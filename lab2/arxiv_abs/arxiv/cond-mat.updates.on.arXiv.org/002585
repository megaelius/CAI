Studies of the transport of wet water vapour are relevant for various areas of human activity, including
the construction and production of building materials, mining, agriculture, environmental safety
of technological processes, scientific research. In particular, one of the methods for extracting
highly viscous bitumen grades of oil from the subterranean depths is based on the dilution of the
contents of the porous medium by means of pumping coolants. The simplest and environmentally friendly
coolant is wet steam containing small drops of water. In addition, with the help of heated water vapour,
the filtering elements of collectors are cleaned from sediments of the solid phase (for example,
paraffins, gas hydrates and ice floes) on the walls of the porous medium. For realistic modeling
of the processes of filtration and heat and mass transfer during the injection of wet steam into a
porous medium, it is necessary to investigate the characteristics of the interaction of saturated
water vapour with individual through-type pores. In this paper, a study was carried out through
mathematical modelling of the dependence of the diffusion rate of wet water vapour on the pressure
difference outside the pore that occurs when water vapour is injected into a porous medium. The dependencies
of the diffusion rate on the pore cross section, the magnitude of vapour adsorption on the pore walls,
as well as the effect of water vapour temperature on all these processes were also investigated.
Practical interest is the study of the influence of the rate of cooling of water vapour on the diffusion
rate and the adsorption of water vapour on the wall of the pores. The calculations were carried out
using a hybrid type model that combines molecular dynamics and macro-diffusion approaches to describe
the interaction of water vapour with individual pores.
