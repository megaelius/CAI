Adiabatic braiding of Majorana zero modes can be used for topologically protected quantum information
processing. While extremely robust to many environmental perturbations, these systems are vulnerable
to noise with high-frequency components. Ironically, slower processes needed for adiabaticity
allow more noise-induced excitations to accumulate, resulting in an antiadiabatic behavior that
limits the precision of Majorana gates if some noise is present. In a recent publication [Phys. Rev.
B 96, 075158 (2017)], fast optimal protocols were proposed as a shortcut for implementing the same
unitary operation as the adiabatic braiding. These shortcuts sacrifice topological protection
in the absence of noise but provide performance gains and remarkable robustness to noise due to the
shorter evolution time. Nevertheless, gates optimized for vanishing noise are suboptimal in the
presence of noise. If we know the noise strength beforehand, can we design protocols optimized for
the existing unavoidable noise, which will effectively correct the noise-induced errors? We address
this question in the present paper. We find such optimal protocols using simulated-annealing Monte
Carlo simulations. The numerically found pulse shapes, which we fully characterize, are in agreement
with Pontryagin's minimum principle, which allows us to arbitrarily improve the approximate numerical
results (due to discretization and imperfect convergence) and obtain numerically exact optimal
protocols. The protocols are \textit{bang-bang} (sequence of sudden quenches) for vanishing
noise, but contain continuous segments in the presence of multiplicative noise due to the nonlinearity
of the master equation governing the evolution. We find that such noise-optimized protocols completely
eliminate the above-mentioned antiadiabatic behavior.
