This study discusses gold tiny particles when their atoms are in certain transition state under
the getup of monolayer assembly for different processing time. At solution surface, atoms of tiny
particles bind by nano shape energy resulting into elongate from centers along opposite poles converting
arrays in structure of smooth elements. A double-packet nano shape energy when placed over monolayer
assembly, it keeps atoms bound into a tiny particle of own shape if the distribution of atoms is appropriate.
Tiny particles pack to develop extended shapes for different processing time where rate of development
is not more than millisecond time depending on the size of individual particle. Increasing the processing
time of solution to certain duration increases the number of developing triangular-shaped tiny
particles. Adjacent placement of electrons in atoms of tiny particle is under the orientational-based
stretching of clamping energy knots while adjusting potential energy as per exertion of force.
Tiny particles develop near to zero-force axis of surface format, their atoms elongate less from
the centers because of the lateral exertion of force. So, particles shape-like rod and bar are developed.
Tiny particles where atoms elongate more, they develop particles shape-like hexagon and triangle
giving less width of structure of smooth elements and inter-spacing distance as compared to the
particles of rod and bar. Different widths of smooth elements along with inter-spacing distance
in one- and three-dimensional particles are recorded in the selective area patterns also give the
same values as in high-resolution images. In arrays of elongated atoms when certain electrons under
appropriate coincide exerted lateral force resulted into bind giving single smooth element of
twice width. The discoveries open multiple routes to design materials and explore underlying science.
