We report the formation of cubic phase, under ambient conditions, in thin films of Zirconia synthesized
by electron beam evaporation technique. The stabilization of the cubic phase was achieved without
the use of chemical stabilizers and/or concurrent ion beam bombardment. Films of two different
thickness (660 nm, 140 nm) were deposited. The 660 nm and 140 nm films were found to be stoichiometric
(ZrO2) and off-stoichiometric (ZrO1.7) respectively by Resonant Rutherford back-scattering
spectroscopy. While the 660 nm as-deposited films were in the cubic phase, as indicated by X-ray
diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements, the 140 nm as-deposited films were amorphous
and the transformation to cubic phase was obtained after thermal annealing. Extended X-ray absorption
fine structure measurements revealed the existence of Oxygen vacancies in the local structure
surrounding Zirconium for all films. However, the amount of these Oxygen vacancies was found to
be significantly higher for the amorphous films as compared to the films in the cubic phase (both
660 nm as-deposited and 140 nm annealed films). The cubic phase stabilization is explained on the
basis of suppression of the soft X2- mode of vibration of the Oxygen sub-lattice due to the presence
of the Oxygen vacancies. Our first-principles modeling under the framework of density functional
theory shows that the cubic structure with Oxygen vacancies is indeed more stable at ambient conditions
than its pristine (without vacancies) counterpart. The requirement of a critical amount of these
vacancies for the stabilization of the cubic phase is also discussed.
