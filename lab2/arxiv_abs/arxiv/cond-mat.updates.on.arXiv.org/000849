We study the non-linear conductance $\mathcal{G}\sim\partial^2I/\partial V^2|_{V=0}$ in coherent
quasi-1D weakly disordered metallic wires. The analysis is based on the calculation of two fundamental
correlators (correlations of conductance's functional derivatives and correlations of injectivities),
which are obtained explicitly by using diagrammatic techniques. In a coherent wire of length $L$,
we obtain $\mathcal{G}\sim0.006\,E_\mathrm{Th}^{-1}$ (and $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle=0$),
where $E_\mathrm{Th}=D/L^2$ is the Thouless energy and $D$ the diffusion constant; the small dimensionless
factor results from screening, i.e. cannot be obtained within a simple theory for non-interacting
electrons. Electronic interactions are also responsible for an asymmetry under magnetic field
reversal: the antisymmetric part of the non-linear conductance (at high magnetic field) being
much smaller than the symmetric one, $\mathcal{G}_a\sim0.001\,(gE_\mathrm{Th})^{-1}$, where
$g\gg1$ is the dimensionless (linear) conductance of the wire. Weakly coherent regimes are also
studied: for $L_\varphi\ll L$, where $L_\varphi$ is the phase coherence length, we get $\mathcal{G}\sim(L_\varphi/L)^{7/2}E_\mathrm{Th}^{-1}$,
and $\mathcal{G}_a\sim(L_\varphi/L)^{11/2}(gE_\mathrm{Th})^{-1}\ll\mathcal{G}$ (at high
magnetic field). When thermal fluctuations are important, $L_T\ll L_\varphi\ll L$ where $L_T=\sqrt{D/T}$,
we obtain $\mathcal{G}\sim(L_T/L)(L_\varphi/L)^{7/2}E_\mathrm{Th}^{-1}$ (the result is
dominated by the effect of screening) and $\mathcal{G}_a\sim(L_T/L)^2(L_\varphi/L)^{7/2}(gE_\mathrm{Th})^{-1}$.
All the precise dimensionless prefactors are obtained. Crossovers towards the zero magnetic field
regime are also analysed.
