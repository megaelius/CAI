Using a recently developed bead-spring model for semiflexible polymers, we develop an efficient
algorithm to simulate double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) dynamics at full basepair resolution in the
absence of hydrodynamic interactions. Polymer dynamics in the model is described by the Langevin
equation. The model has four parameters. All of them are determined by matching to experimental
data: the parameter $d$ sets the distance between the consecutive beads, the two further parameters
$T^*$ and $\nu$ in the Hamiltonian are chosen to match the experimental force-extension curve of
dsDNA, while the Langevin friction coefficient $\xi$ for the dynamics is determined by matching
to the diffusion coefficient of small dsDNA segments in water at room temperature. We consider the
persistence length of dsDNA to be $\approx37.7$ nm that corresponds to $114$ beads in the model.
The key to efficiency is the use of the dynamical properties of the polymer's fluctuation modes in
the algorithm, as opposed to the use of simply the physical positions of the beads. We show that, at
full basepair resolution, within an accuracy tolerance level of $5\%$ of several key observables,
the model allows for single Langevin time steps of $\approx1.6$, 8, 16 and 32 ps for a dsDNA model-chain
consisting of 64, 128, 256 and 512 basepairs (i.e., chains of 0.55, 1.11, 2.24 and 4.48 persistence
lengths) respectively. Correspondingly, in one hour, a standard desktop computer can simulate
0.23, 0.56, 0.56 and 0.26 ms of these dsDNA chains respectively. We compare our results to those obtained
from other methods, and demonstrate the use of the present method by simulating efficiently the
tumbling behavior of a dsDNA segment in a shear flow, at full basepair resolution.
