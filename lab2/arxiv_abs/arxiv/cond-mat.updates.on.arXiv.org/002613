Phase fractions, compositions and energies of the stable phases as a function of macroscopic composition,
temperature, and pressure (X-T-P) are the principle correlations needed for the design of new materials
and improvement of existing materials. They are the outcomes of thermodynamic modeling based on
the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach. The accuracy of CALPHAD predictions vary
widely in X-T-P space due to experimental error, model inadequacy and unequal data coverage. In
response, researchers have developed frameworks to quantify the uncertainty of thermodynamic
property model parameters and propagate it to phase diagram predictions. In previous studies,
uncertainty was represented as intervals on phase boundaries (with respect to composition) or
invariant reactions (with respect to temperature) and was unable to represent the uncertainty
in eutectoid reactions or in the stability of phase regions. In this work, we propose a suite of tools
that leverages samples from the multivariate model parameter distribution to represent uncertainty
in forms that surpass previous limitations and are well suited to materials design. These representations
include the distribution of phase diagrams and their features, as well as the dependence of phase
stability and the distributions of phase fraction, composition activity and Gibbs energy on X-T-P
location - irrespective of the total number of components. Most critically, the new methodology
allows the material designer to interrogate a certain composition and temperature domain and get
in return the probability of different phases to be stable, which can positively impact materials
design.
