The criteria for bosonization of Cooper pairs and novel Bose-liquid superconductivity and superfluidity
in high-$T_c$ cuprates and other pseudogap matters are formulated by using the uncertainty principle
and the boson mean field theory. We argue that the BCS-type s- or d-wave superconductivity occurring
in the fermionic limit of Cooper pairs (which exist in ordinary metals and heavily overdoped cuprates
with large Fermi energies) is not characteristic of underdoped to overdoped cuprates with low Fermi
energies. The superconducting order parameter in high-$T_c$ cuprates and other pseudogap matters
cannot be determined as the BCS-like (s- or d-wave) gap. We show that the unconventional superconductivity/superfluidity
occurring in the bosonic limit of Cooper pairs exists in low Fermi energy systems where the bosonic
Cooper pairs are formed at a pseudogap temperature T* above the uperconducting/superfluid transition
temperature $T_c$ and then such bosons condenses into a Bose superfluid at $T_c$. The pair condensation
of attracting bosons occurs at $T_c$ and then their single particle condensation sets in at $T_c^*$
lower than $T_c$ (in three dimensions (3D)) or at T=0 (in two dimensions (2D)). The coherent single
particle and pair condensates of bosons exist as two distinct superfluid phases below $T_c$. By
solving the mean field equations for high-$T_c$ cuprates, the novel superconducting states (i.e.,
a vortex-like state existing below the temperature $T_v=T^{2D}_c$ lower than T* but higher than
$T_c=T^{3D}_c$ and two superconducting phases below $T_c$) and their properties characterized
by the boson superfluid stiffness are determined and compared with the key experimental findings.
The novel Bose-liquid superconductivity and superfluidity exists also in other exotic superconductors/superfluids,
including quantum liquids, atomic Fermi gases and low-density nuclear matter.
