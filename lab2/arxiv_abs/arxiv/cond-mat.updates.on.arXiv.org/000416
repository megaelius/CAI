We study Anderson localization in graphene with short-range disorder using the real-space Kubo-Greenwood
method implemented on graphics processing units. Two models of short-range disorder, namely,
the Anderson on-site disorder model and the vacancy defect model, are considered. For graphene
with Anderson disorder, localization lengths of quasi-one-dimensional systems with various
disorder strengths, edge symmetries, and boundary conditions are calculated using the real-space
Kubo-Greenwood formalism, showing excellent agreement with independent transfer matrix calculations
and superior computational efficiency. Using these data, we demonstrate the applicability of
the one-parameter scaling theory of localization length and propose an analytical expression
for the scaling function, which provides a reliable method of computing the two-dimensional localization
length. This method is found to be consistent with another widely used method which relates the two-dimensional
localization length to the elastic mean free path and the semiclassical conductivity. Abnormal
behavior at the charge neutrality point is identified and interpreted to be caused by finite-size
effects when the system width is comparable to or smaller than the elastic mean free path. We also
demonstrate the finite-size effect when calculating the two-dimensional conductivity in the
localized regime and show that a renormalization group beta function consistent with the one-parameter
scaling theory can be extracted numerically. For graphene with vacancy disorder, we show that the
proposed scaling function of localization length also applies. Lastly, we discuss some ambiguities
in calculating the semiclassical conductivity around the charge neutrality point due to the presence
of resonant states.
