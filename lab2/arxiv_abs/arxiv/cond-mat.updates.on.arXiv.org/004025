Understanding the nature of light transmission and the photonic bandgap in inverse opal photonic
crystals is essential for linking their optical characteristics to any application. This is especially
important when these structures are examined in liquids or solvents. We examined TiO2 and SnO2 IOs
in a range of common solvents to solve the conflict between Bragg-Snell theory, optical and physical
measurements by a comprehensive angle-resolved light transmission study coupled to microscopy
examination of the IO structure. Tuning the position of the photonic bandgap and index contrast
by solvent infiltration of each inverse opal requires a modification to the Bragg-Snell theory
and the photonic crystal unit cell definition. We also demonstrate experimentally and theroetically
that low fill factors are caused by less desne material infilling all interstitial vancancies in
the opal template to form an IO. By also including an optical interference condition for inverse
opals with an effective refractive index greater than its substrate, and an alternative internal
refraction angle in the substrate, angle-resolved transmission spectra for inverse opals are
now consistent with physical measurements. This work now allows an accurate correlation between
the true response of an IO to the index contrast with a solvent, how an IO is infilled, and the directionality
and bandwidth of the photonic bandgap. As control in functional photonic materials becomes more
prevalent outside of optics and photonics, such as biosensing and energy storage, for example,
a comprehensive and consistent correlation between photonic crystals structures and their primary
optical signatures is a fundamental requirement for application.
