In Part I of this two-part series, the reverse perturbation method for shearing simple liquids [Phys.
Rev. E 59, 4894 (1999)] was extended to systems of interacting particles with time-discrete stochastic
dynamics. For verification, in this paper (Part II) the reverse perturbation method is first applied
to a simple momentum-conserving liquid, modeled through the Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics
(MPCD) technique [J. Chem. Phys. 110, 8605 (1999)]. For MPCD, excellent agreement between the measured
shear viscosity and its theoretical prediction is found. Furthermore, this paper contains applications
of the reverse perturbation method to agent-based simulations of the Vicsek-model [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 75, 1226 (1995)] and its metric-free version. The extracted transport coefficients, the
kinematic viscosity $\nu$ and the momentum amplification coefficient $\lambda$, were compared
to theoretical predictions. To verify the transport coefficients, Green-Kubo relations were
evaluated and transverse current correlations were measured in independent simulations. Not
too far to the transition to collective motion, we find excellent agreement between the different
measurements of the transport coefficients. However, the measured values of $\nu$ and $1-\lambda$
are always slightly higher than the mean-field predictions, even at large mean free paths and at
state points quite far from the threshold to collective motion, that is, far in the disordered phase.
These findings seem to indicate that the mean-field assumption of molecular chaos is much less reliable
in systems with velocity-alignment rules such as the Vicsek model, compared to models obeying detailed
balance such as MPCD.
