Deterministic fractal antennas are employed to realize multimodal plasmonic devices. Such structures
show strongly enhanced localized electromagnetic fields typically in the infrared range with
a hierarchical spatial distribution. Realization of engineered fractal antennas operating in
the optical regime would enable nanoplasmonic platforms for applications, such as energy harvesting,
light sensing, and bio/chemical detection. Here, we introduce a novel plasmonic multiband metamaterial
based on the Sierpinski carpet (SC) space-filling fractal, having a tunable and polarization-independent
optical response, which exhibits multiple resonances from the visible to mid-infrared range.
We investigate gold SCs fabricated by electron-beam lithography on CaF$_{2}$ and Si/SiO$_{2}$
substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such resonances originate from diffraction-mediated
localized surface plasmons, which can be tailored in deterministic fashion by tuning the shape,
size, and position of the fractal elements. Moreover, our findings illustrate that SCs with high
order of complexity present a strong and hierarchically distributed electromagnetic near-field
of the plasmonic modes. Therefore, engineered plasmonic SCs provide an efficient strategy for
the realization of compact active devices with a strong and broadband spectral response in the visible/mid-infrared
range. We take advantage of such a technology by carrying out surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) on Brilliant Cresyl Blue molecules deposited onto plasmonic SCs. We achieve a broadband
SERS enhancement factor up to $10^{4}$, thereby providing a proof-of-concept application for
chemical diagnostics.
