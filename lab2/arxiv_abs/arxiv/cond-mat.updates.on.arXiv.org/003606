Statistical models for families of evolutionary related proteins have recently gained interest:
in particular pairwise Potts models, as those inferred by the Direct-Coupling Analysis, have been
able to extract information about the three-dimensional structure of folded proteins, and about
the effect of amino-acid substitutions in proteins. These models are typically requested to reproduce
the one- and two-point statistics of the amino-acid usage in a protein family, {\em i.e.}~to capture
the so-called residue conservation and covariation statistics of proteins of common evolutionary
origin. Pairwise Potts models are the maximum-entropy models achieving this. While being successful,
these models depend on huge numbers of {\em ad hoc} introduced parameters, which have to be estimated
from finite amount of data and whose biophysical interpretation remains unclear. Here we propose
an approach to parameter reduction, which is based on selecting collective sequence motifs. It
naturally leads to the formulation of statistical sequence models in terms of Hopfield-Potts models.
These models can be accurately inferred using a mapping to restricted Boltzmann machines and persistent
contrastive divergence. We show that, when applied to protein data, even 20-40 patterns are sufficient
to obtain statistically close-to-generative models. The Hopfield patterns form interpretable
sequence motifs and may be used to clusterize amino-acid sequences into functional sub-families.
However, the distributed collective nature of these motifs intrinsically limits the ability of
Hopfield-Potts models in predicting contact maps, showing the necessity of developing models
going beyond the Hopfield-Potts models discussed here.
