We present a neutron spin echo study (NSE) of the nanosecond dynamics of polyethylene glycol (PEG)
functionalised nanosized gold particles dissolved in D$_2$O at two temperatures and two different
PEG molecular weights. The analysis of the NSE data was performed by applying a Bayesian approach
to the description of time correlation function decays in terms of exponential terms, recently
proved to be theoretically rigorous. This approach, which addresses in a direct way the fundamental
issue of model choice in any dynamical analysis, provides here a guide to the most statistically
supported way to follow the decay of the Intermediate Scattering Functions I(Q, t) by basing on statistical
grounds the choice of the number of terms required for the description of the nanosecond dynamics
of the studied systems. Then, the presented analysis avoids from the start resorting to a pre-selected
framework and can be considered as model free. By comparing the results of PEG coated nanoparticles
with those obtained in PEG2000 solutions, we were able to disentangle the translational diffusion
of the nanoparticles from the internal dynamics of the polymer grafted to them, and to show that the
polymer corona relaxation follows a pure exponential decay in agreement with the behavior predicted
by coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical models. This methodology has
one further advantage: in the presence of a complex dynamical scenario I(Q,t) is often described
in terms of the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function that can implicitly represent a distribution
of relaxation times. By choosing to describe the I(Q,t) as a sum of exponential functions and with
the support of the Bayesian approach, we can explicitly determine when a finer-structure analysis
of the dynamical complexity of the system exists according to the available data without the risk
of overparametrisation.
