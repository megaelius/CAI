The Debye temperature, T${_\theta}$=(h/2${\pi}$)/k${_B}$$\omega$$_\theta$, where the Debye
frequency $\omega$$_\theta$ is integrated characteristic frequency of full phonon spectrum,
$\alpha$$^2$($\omega$)F($\omega$). In the BCS theory, T${_\theta}$ in conjunction with electron-phonon
coupling strength parameter, $\lambda$$_{e-ph}$, determines the superconducting transition
temperature, Tc. Despite a fact that more accurate theory of electron-phonon mediated superconductivity
requires the knowledge of full phonon spectrum, $\alpha$$^2$($\omega$)F($\omega$), which can
be very accurately computed by first principles calculation technique, there is no experimental
technique which can measure $\alpha$$^2$($\omega$)F($\omega$) in highly-compressed near-room-temperature
(NRT) superconductors. Thus, $\omega$$_\theta$ remains to be the only measurable parameter of
full phonon spectrum, $\alpha$$^2$($\omega$)F($\omega$), which can be deduced by the fit of experimental
temperature-dependent resistance data, R(T), to Bloch-Gr\"uneisen equation. Taking in account
that within electron-phonon mediated theory of superconductivity two isotopic counterparts
(or, in case of NRT superconductors, the same superconducting phase at different pressures), designated
by subscripts of 1 and 2, should be obey the relation of T${_\theta}_1$/T${_\theta}_2$=T${_c}_1$/T${_c}_2$,
there is a way to reaffirm/disprove the electron-phonon mechanism of NRT superconductivity. In
this paper, we perform the analysis for R3m-phase of H3S at different pressure, as well as for several
superconductors in LaHx-LaDy system and show that there is a large disagreement between experimental
data and T${_\theta}_1$/T${_\theta}_2$=T${_c}_1$/T${_c}_2$. Taking in account that similar
disagreement has recently reported in H3S-D3S system, it can be concluded that primary origin for
NRT superconductivity remains to be discovered.
