The paper develops the stiffness relationship between the movements and forces among a system of
discrete interacting grains. The approach is similar to that used in structural analysis, but the
stiffness matrix of granular material is inherently non-symmetric because of the geometrics of
particle interactions and of the frictional behavior of the contacts. Internal geometric constraints
are imposed by the particles' shapes, in particular, by the surface curvatures of the particles
at their points of contact. Moreover, the stiffness relationship is incrementally non-linear,
and even small assemblies require the analysis of multiple stiffness branches, with each branch
region being a pointed convex cone in displacement-space. These aspects of the particle-level
stiffness relationship gives rise to three types of micro-scale failure: neutral equilibrium,
bifurcation and path instability, and instability of equilibrium. These three pathologies are
defined in the context of four types of displacement constraints, which can be readily analyzed
with certain generalized inverses. That is, instability and non-uniqueness are investigated
in the presence of kinematic constraints. Bifurcation paths can be either stable or unstable, as
determined with the Hill-Bazant-Petryk criterion. Examples of simple granular systems of three,
sixteen, and sixty four disks are analyzed. With each system, multiple contacts were assumed to
be at the friction limit. Even with these small systems, micro-scale failure is expressed in many
different forms, with some systems having hundreds of micro-scale failure modes. The examples
suggest that micro-scale failure is pervasive within granular materials, with particle arrangements
being in a nearly continual state of instability.
