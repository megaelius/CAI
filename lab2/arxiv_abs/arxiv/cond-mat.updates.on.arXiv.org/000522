The icosahedra boron chain and three icosahedra sheets (with {\alpha}, {\delta}4, and {\delta}6
symmetries), constructed by the icosahedra B12, have been obtained as new members of boron family
using a highly efficient molecular dynamics scheme based on a transferable and reliable semi-empirical
Hamiltonian. The icosahedral B12 in the icosahedra chain is slightly elongated along the china
direction and directly bonded each other with the two-center covalent bonds. A deformation of the
icosahedra B12 was also found in the two-dimensional icosahedra sheets. In addition to the three-center
bonding nature inside the icosahedra B12, there are two types of directional inter-icosahedra
bonds in the icosahedra sheet structures, one is the single strong covalent bond, and the other is
a pair of the weak covalent {\delta} bonds. In contrast to the boron monolayer, there is no buckling
found in these icosahedra sheets. The deformation of the icosahedra B12 and the special bonding
nature in these new icosahedra structures induce the energy band gap of 0.74 eV in the icosahedra
chain, 0.52 eV in the icosahedra {\delta}6 sheet, 0.39 eV in the icosahedra {\delta}4 sheet, and
the gapless in the icosahedra {\alpha} sheet, respectively. The energy barrier per atom from the
icosahedra {\delta}6 sheet to the icosahedra {\alpha} sheet is estimated to be 0.17 eV while it is
estimated as 0.38 eV from the icosahedra {\delta}6 sheet to the icosahedra {\delta}4 sheet and 0.27
eV from the icosahedra {\alpha} sheet to the icosahedra {\delta}4 sheet, respectively. Such high
energy barriers indicate that these icosahedra sheets are relatively stable.
