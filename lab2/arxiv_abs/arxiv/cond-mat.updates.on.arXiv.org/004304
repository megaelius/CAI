The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is one powerful experimental technique
to study the electronic structure of materials. As many electron materials show unusual many-body
correlations, the technique to detect directly these many-body correlations will play important
roles in study of their many-body physics. In this article, we propose a technique to detect directly
two-particle correlations, a coincidence ARPES (cARPES) where two incident photons excite two
separative photoelectrons which are detected in coincidence. While the one-photon-absorption
and one-photoelectron-emission ARPES provides single-particle spectrum function, the proposed
cARPES with two-photo-absorption and two-photoelectron-emission is relevant to a two-particle
Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction. Examples of the coincidence detection of two-particle correlations
by cARPES for the free Fermi gas and the BCS superconducting state are studied in detail. We also propose
another two experimental techniques, a coincidence angle-resolved photoemission and inverse-photoemission
spectroscopy (cARP/IPES) and a coincidence angle-resolved inverse-photoemission spectroscopy
(cARIPES). As all of these proposed techniques are relevant to two-particle Bethe-Salpeter wavefunctions,
they can provide the form factor or inner-pair wavefunction of the two-particle pairs in particle-particle
or particle-hole channel. Thus they can be introduced to study the Cooper pairs in superconducting
state, the itinerant magnetic moments in metallic ferromagnet/antiferromagnet, and the particle-hole
pairs in metallic nematic state. Moreover, the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunctions also involve the
time dynamics of inner-pair physics and thus these proposed techniques can be used to study partially
the time-retarded physics.
