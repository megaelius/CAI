Mathematically modeling complex transport phenomena at the molecular level can be a powerful tool
for identifying transport mechanisms and predicting macroscopic properties. We use two different
stochastic time series models, parameterized from long molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories
of a cross-linked H$_{II}$ phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane, in order to predict solute
mean squared displacements (MSDs) and solute flux, and thus solute selectivity, in macroscopic
length pores. First, using anomalous diffusion theory, we show how solute dynamics can be modeled
as a fractional diffusion process subordinate to a continuous time random walk. From the MD simulations,
we parameterize the distribution of dwell times, hop lengths between dwells and correlation between
hops. We explore two variations of the anomalous diffusion modeling approach. The first applies
a single set of parameters to the solute displacements and the second applies two sets of parameters
based on the solute's radial distance from the closest pore center. Next, we generalize Markov state
models, treating the configurational states of the system as a Markov process where each state has
distinct transport properties. For each state and transition between states, we parameterize
the distribution and temporal correlation structure of positional fluctuations as a means of characterization
and to allow us to predict solute MSDs. Qualitative differences between MD and Markov state dependent
model-generated trajectories may limit its usefulness. Finally, we demonstrate how one can use
these models to estimate flux of a solute across a macroscopic-length pore and, based on those quantities,
the membrane's selectivity towards each solute. This work helps to connect microscopic chemically-dependent
solute motions that do not follow simple diffusive behavior with macroscopic membrane performance.
