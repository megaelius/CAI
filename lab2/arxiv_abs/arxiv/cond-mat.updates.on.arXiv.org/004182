We have studied electrical switching with S-shaped I-V characteristics in two-terminal MOM devices
based on vanadium dioxide thin films. The switching effect is associated with the metal-insulator
phase transition. Relaxation oscillations are observed in circuits with VO2-based switches.
Dependences of the oscillator critical frequency Fmax, threshold power and voltage, as well as
the time of current rise, on the switching structure size are obtained by numerical simulation.
The empirical dependence of the threshold voltage on the switching region dimensions and film thickness
is found. It is shown that, for the VO2 channel sizes of 10*10 nm, Fmax can reach the value of 300 MHz
at a film thickness of ~20 nm. Next, it is shown that oscillatory neural networks can be implemented
on the basis of coupled VO2 oscillators. For the weak capacitive coupling, we revealed the dependence
of the phase difference upon synchronization on the coupling capacitance value. When the switches
are scaled down, the limiting time of synchronization is reduced to Ts ~13 {\mu}s, and the number
of oscillation periods for the entering to the synchronization mode remains constant, Ns ~ 17. In
the case of weak thermal coupling in the synchronization mode, we observe in-phase behavior of oscillators,
and there is a certain range of parameters of the supply current, in which the synchronization effect
becomes possible. With a decrease in dimensions, a decrease in the thermal coupling action radius
is observed, which can vary in the range from 0.5 to 50 {\mu}m for structures with characteristic
dimensions of 0.1 to 5 {\mu}m, respectively. Thermal coupling may have a promising effect for realization
of a 3D integrated oscillatory neural network.
