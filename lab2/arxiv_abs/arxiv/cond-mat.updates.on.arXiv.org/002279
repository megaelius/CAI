The defect induced magnetism has initiated a lot of interest in field of spintronics. In this regard,
SiC is a promising material because of its unique properties under extreme conditions. Hence it
will be very much interesting to investigate the interaction between defects and itinerant carrier
in doped SiC for spintronics application. We report the structural stability and magnetic interaction
in Cr doped 3C-SiC synthesized by Thermal Plasma Technique. The EPR spectrum of undoped 3C-SiC shows
a sharp resonance line corresponding to $g=2.00$ associated with the defects present in the system.
Anomalous temperature evolution tendency of the relative intensity of EPR spectra can be attributed
to magnetically correlated defects in the host matrix. For the first time we report the detailed
quantitative analysis of X-band and Q-band EPR study in Cr doped 3C-SiC which reveals that Cr can
be in multivalent state. The non monotonous variation of Longitudinal Mode (LO) of the Raman spectra
has been explained based on the interaction between carriers and surface plasmon using Longitudinal
optical plasmon coupling model (LOPC). The carrier density calculated by using LOPC fit with experimental
data varies from $1.8\times10^{15}$ to $4.2\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$. Room temperature magnetic
measurements exhibit ferromagnetic behavior with non-zero coercivity for all the samples up to
7 T field. We, for the first time, show the Curie temperature to be above 760 K. Quantitative analysis
of magnetic interaction validates the applicability of Bound Magnetic Polaron Model (BMP) which
probably arises from the exchange interaction of Cr$^{3+}$ ions with related (Si, C) defects. The
polaron density estimated from the BMP fit agrees well with the carrier density obtained from the
line shape fitting of Raman spectra.
