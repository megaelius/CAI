The recently developed formalism of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics (NLFH) has been instrumental
in unraveling many new dynamical universality classes in coupled driven systems with multiple
conserved quantities. In principle, this formalism requires knowledge of the exact expression
of locally conserved current in terms of local density of the conserved components. However, for
most nonequilibrium systems an exact expression is not available and it is important to know what
happens to the predictions of NLFH in these cases. We address this question for the first time here
in a system with coupled time evolution of sliding particles on a fluctuating energy landscape.
In the disordered phase this system shows short-ranged correlations, this system shows short-ranged
correlations, the exact form of which is not known, and so the exact expression for current cannot
be obtained. We use approximate expressions based on mean-field theory and corrections to it, to
test the prediction of NLFH using numerical simulations. In this process we also discover important
finite size effects and show how they affect the predictions of NLFH. We find that our system is rich
enough to show a large variety of universality classes. From our analytics and simulations we have
been able to find parameter values which lead to diffusive, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ), $5/3 $ L\'evy
and modified KPZ universality classes. Interestingly, the scaling function in the modified KPZ
case turns out to be close to the Pr\"ahofer-Spohn function which is known to describe usual KPZ scaling.
Our analytics also predict the golden mean and the $3/2$ L\'evy universality classes within our
model but our simulations could not verify this, perhaps due to strong finite size effects.
