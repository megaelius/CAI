Chains of superconducting circuit devices provide a natural platform for studies of synthetic
bosonic quantum matter. Motivated by the recent experimental progress in realizing disordered
and interacting chains of superconducting transmon devices, we study the bosonic many-body localization
phase transition using the methods of exact diagonalization as well as matrix product state dynamics.
We estimate the location of transition separating the ergodic and the many-body localized phases
as a function of the disorder strength and the many-body on-site interaction strength. The main
difference between the bosonic model realized by superconducting circuits and similar fermionic
model is that the effect of the on-site interaction is stronger due to the possibility of multiple
excitations occupying the same site. The phase transition is found to be robust upon including longer-range
hopping and interaction terms present in the experiments. Furthermore, we calculate experimentally
relevant local observables and show that their temporal fluctuations can be used to distinguish
between the dynamics of Anderson insulator, many-body localization, and delocalized phases.
While we consider unitary dynamics, neglecting the effects of dissipation, decoherence and measurement
back action, the timescales on which the dynamics is unitary are sufficient for observation of characteristic
dynamics in the many-body localized phase. Moreover, the experimentally available disorder strength
and interactions allow for tuning the many-body localization phase transition, thus making the
arrays of superconducting circuit devices a promising platform for exploring localization physics
and phase transition.
