We present a new Bayesian methodology to learn the unknown material density of a given sample by inverting
its two-dimensional images that are taken with a Scanning Electron Microscope. An image results
from a sequence of projections of the convolution of the density function with the unknown microscopy
correction function that we also learn from the data. We invoke a novel design of experiment, involving
imaging at multiple values of the parameter that controls the sub-surface depth from which information
about the density structure is carried, to result in the image. Real-life material density functions
are characterised by high density contrasts and typically are highly discontinuous, implying
that they exhibit correlation structures that do not vary smoothly. In the absence of training data,
modelling such correlation structures of real material density functions is not possible. So we
discretise the material sample and treat values of the density function at chosen locations inside
it as independent and distribution-free parameters. Resolution of the available image dictates
the discretisation length of the model; three models pertaining to distinct resolution classes
are developed. We develop priors on the material density, such that these priors adapt to the sparsity
inherent in the density function. The likelihood is defined in terms of the distance between the
convolution of the unknown functions and the image data. The posterior probability density of the
unknowns given the data is expressed using the developed priors on the density and priors on the microscopy
correction function as elicitated from the Microscopy literature. We achieve posterior samples
using an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs inference scheme. The method is applied to learn the
material density of a 3-D sample of a real nano-structure and of simulated alloy samples.
