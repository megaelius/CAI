We present a new simulation technique to study systems of polymers functionalized by reactive sites
that bind/unbind forming reversible linkages. Functionalized polymers feature self-assembly
and responsive properties that are unmatched by systems lacking selective interactions. The scales
at which the functional properties of these materials emerge are difficult to model, especially
in the reversible regime where such properties result from many binding/unbinding events. This
difficulty is related to large entropic barriers associated with the formation of intra-molecular
loops. In this work we present a simulation scheme that sidesteps configurational costs by dedicated
Monte Carlo moves capable of binding/unbinding reactive sites in a single step. Cross-linking
reactions are implemented by trial moves that reconstruct chain sections attempting, at the same
time, a dimerization reaction between pairs of reactive sites. The model is parametrized by the
reaction equilibrium constant of the reactive species free in solution. This quantity can be obtained
by means of experiments or atomistic/quantum simulations. We use the proposed methodology to study
self-assembly of single--chain polymeric nanoparticles, starting from flexible precursors
carrying regularly or randomly distributed reactive sites. During a single run, almost all pairs
of reactive monomers interact at least once. We focus on understanding differences in the morphology
of chain nanoparticles when linkages are reversible as compared to the well studied case of irreversible
reactions. Intriguingly, we find that the size of regularly functionalsized chains, in good solvent
conditions, is non-monotonous as a function of the degree of functionalization. We clarify how
this result follows from excluded volume interactions and is peculiar of reversible linkages and
regular functionalizations.
