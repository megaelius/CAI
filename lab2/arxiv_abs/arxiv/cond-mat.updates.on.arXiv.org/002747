We study theoretically pressure driven planar channel flow of shear thinning viscoelastic fluids.
Combining linear stability analysis and full nonlinear simulation, we study the instability of
an initially one-dimensional base state to the growth of two-dimensional perturbations with wavevector
in the flow direction. We do so within three widely used constitutive models: the microscopically
motivated Rolie-Poly model, and the phenomenological Johnson-Segalman and White-Metzner models.
In each model, we find instability when the degree of shear thinning exceeds some level characterised
by the logarithmic slope of the flow curve at its shallowest point. Specifically, we find instability
for $n<n^*$, with $n^*\approx 0.21, 0.11$ and $0.30$ in the Rolie-Poly, Johnson-Segalman and White-Metzner
models respectively. Within each model, we show that the critical pressure drop for the onset of
instability obeys a criterion expressed in terms of this degree of shear thinning, $n$, together
with the derivative of the first normal stress with respect to shear stress. Both shear thinning
and rapid variations in first normal stress across the channel are therefore key ingredients driving
the instability. In the Rolie-Poly and Johnson-Segalman models, the underlying mechanism appears
to involve the destabilisation of a quasi-interface that exists in each half of the channel, across
which the normal stress varies rapidly. In the White-Metzner model, no such quasi-interface exists,
but the criterion for instability nonetheless appears to follow the same form as in the Rolie-Poly
and Johnson-Segalman models. This presents an outstanding puzzle concerning any possibly generic
nature of the instability mechanism. We finally make some briefly comments on the Giesekus model,
which is rather different in its predictions from the other three.
