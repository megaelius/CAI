We explore the intriguing spatial patterns that emerge in a two-dimensional spatially inhomogeneous
Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn (KLS) driven lattice gas with attractive nearest-neighbor interactions.
The domain is split into two regions with hopping rates governed by different temperatures T > T_c
and T_c, respectively, where T_c indicates the critical temperature for phase ordering, and with
the temperature boundaries oriented perpendicular to the drive. In the hotter region, the system
behaves like the (totally) asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEP), and experiences particle
blockage in front of the interface to the critical region. To explain this particle density accumulation
near the interface, we have measured the steady-state current in the KLS model at T > T_c and found
it to decay as 1/T. In analogy with TASEP systems containing "slow" bonds, we argue that transport
in the high-temperature subsystem is impeded by the lower current in the cooler region, which tends
to set the global stationary particle current value. This blockage is induced by the extended particle
clusters, growing logarithmically with system size, in the critical region. We observe the density
profiles in both high-and low-temperature subsystems to be similar to the well-characterized
coexistence and maximal-current phases in (T)ASEP models with open boundary conditions, which
are respectively governed by hyperbolic and trigonometric tangent functions. Yet if the lower
temperature is set to T_c, we detect marked fluctuation corrections to the mean-field density profiles,
e.g., the corresponding critical KLS power law density decay near the interfaces into the cooler
region.
