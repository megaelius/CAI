$^{121,123}Sb$ nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) was applied to $Fe(Sb_{1-x}Te_x)_2$ in the
low doping regime (\emph{x = 0, 0.01} and \emph{0.05}) as a microscopic zero field probe to study
the evolution of \emph{3d} magnetism and the emergence of metallic behavior. Whereas the NQR spectra
itself reflects the degree of local disorder via the width of the individual NQR lines, the spin lattice
relaxation rate (SLRR) $1/T_1(T)$ probes the fluctuations at the $Sb$ - site. The fluctuations
originate either from conduction electrons or from magnetic moments. In contrast to the semi metal
$FeSb_2$ with a clear signature of the charge and spin gap formation in $1/T_1(T)T ( \sim exp/ (\Delta
k_BT) ) $, the 1\% $Te$ doped system exhibits almost metallic conductivity and a almost filled gap.
A weak divergence of the SLRR coefficient $1/T_1(T)T \sim T^{-n} \sim T^{-0.2}$ points towards
the presence of electronic correlations towards low temperatures wheras the \textit{5\%} $Te$
doped sample exhibits a much larger divergence in the SLRR coefficient showing $1/T_1(T)T \sim
T^{-0.72} $. According to the specific heat divergence a power law with $n\ =\ 2\ m\ =\ 0.56$ is expected
for the SLRR. Furthermore $Te$-doped $FeSb_2$ as a disordered paramagnetic metal might be a platform
for the electronic Griffith phase scenario. NQR evidences a substantial asymmetric broadening
of the $^{121,123}Sb$ NQR spectrum for the \emph{5\%} sample. This has purely electronic origin
in agreement with the electronic Griffith phase and stems probably from an enhanced $Sb$-$Te$ bond
polarization and electronic density shift towards the $Te$ atom inside $Sb$-$Te$ dumbbell.
