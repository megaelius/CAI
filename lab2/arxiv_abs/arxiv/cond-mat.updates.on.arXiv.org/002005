Solid electrolytes are considered a potentially enabling component in rechargeable batteries
that use lithium metal as the negative electrode, and thereby can safely access higher energy density
than available with today's lithium ion batteries. To do so, the solid electrolyte must be able to
suppress morphological instabilities that lead to poor coulombic efficiency and, in the worst
case, internal short circuits. In this work, lithium electrodeposition experiments were performed
using single-crystal Li6La3ZrTaO12 garnet as solid electrolyte layers to investigate the factors
that determine whether lithium penetration occurs through brittle inorganic solid electrolytes.
In these single crystals, grain boundaries are excluded as possible paths for lithium metal propagation.
However, Vickers microindentation was used to introduce sharp surface flaws of known size. Using
operando optical microscopy, it was found that lithium metal penetration sometimes initiates
at these controlled surface defects, and when multiple indents of varying size were present, propagates
preferentially from the largest defect. However, a second class of flaws was found to be equally
or more important. At the perimeter of surface current collectors, an enhanced electrodeposition
current density causes lithium metal filled cracks to initiate and grow to penetration, even when
the large Vickers defects are in close proximity. Modeling the electric field concentration for
the experimental configurations, it was shown that a factor of 5 enhancement in field can readily
occur within 10 micrometers of current collector discontinuities, which we interpret as the origin
of electrochemomechanical stresses leading to failure. Such field amplification may determine
the sites where supercritical surface defects dominate lithium metal propagation during electrodeposition,
overriding the presence of larger defects elsewhere.
