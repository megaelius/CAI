We study an organic Hydrogen bonded material $\rm{H_2SQ}$ analytically and map out the phase diagram
as well as low energy excitations in the relevant parameter space. At zeroth order the dynamics is
governed by plaquette interaction (product of $\sigma_z$ over a plaquette) which defines a $Z_2$
gauge theory and a deconfinement phase satisfying "ice rules". The system is studied under additional
interactions such as an external Zeeman field (with strength $K$) in $x$-direction, a inter-molecular
interaction (with strength $J_1$) and a dipole-dipole interaction with strength $J_2$ such that
$K>J_1>J_2$. The effect of dipole-dipole interaction removes the local $Z_2$ symmetry and gives
rise to four global degenerate states with Ferroeletric order. Using meanfield analysis we chart
out the phase diagram for classical version of the model and find $K_c$ which defines the transition
from disordered phase to ordered phase in $J_1, K$ plane for various values of $J_2$. We find that
presence of $J_1$ and $J_2$ tends to stabilize the deconfined phases. Over the classical ground
states we perform spin-wave analysis and surprisingly find that quantum fluctuations does not
remove the classical degeneracy at all at quadratic level. The spin-wave spectrum is found for the
four global degenerate ground states which shows both gapped spectrum and gapless spectrum (near
the vicinity of CDT transition) for $J_2=0$. However for $J_2$ finite, the spectrum is always gapped.
We perform PCUT analysis to improve the results of spin-wave analysis and calculate ground state
energy and one particle dispersion and gap at high symmetry point. Using this we draw the phase boundary
between confined and deconfined phase in the $K-J_1$ plane. The effect of $J_2$ is also discussed
in the resulting phase boundary.
