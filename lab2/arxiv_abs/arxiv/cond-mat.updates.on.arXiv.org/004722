In this paper, the transfer matrix method is used to investigate the reflectance properties in a
symmetric defective annular photonic crystal (APC) containing semiconductor, high-$T_c$ superconductor
and a radial defect layer. Numerical results offer many noteworthy features that can be very useful
in designing optical devices. In this regard, the geometric effects of alternate layers on the optical
reflectance of our defective APC structure by changing the thickness of different layers would
be investigated. Then, the possibility of controlling the spectral position of existed photonic
band gaps (PBGs) and defect modes would be discussed by our analysis. In addition, it is found that
the characteristics of the reflectance spectrum and subsequently the spectral position of PBG
and defect mode are entirely independent on changes in the starting radius of the hollow core. This
characteristic is very attractive to manufacturers, since increasing the size of the core radius
would offer flexibility and simplicity of fabrication in producing optical devices. This study
reveals that the optical reflectance of defective APCs is strongly dependent on azimuthal mode
number. Therefore, our designed defective APC structure works as a perfect reflector for the considerable
range of wavelength for higher azimuthal mode numbers. Lastly, our results show that by increase
the temperature of superconductor layer both of the existed band gaps and defect mode show a red-shift
trend by moving towards higher wavelengths. The proposed structure and related results can lead
to gain valuable information for designing and fabrication of new types of annular Bragg resonators
surrounding a radial defect and integrated visible waveguide devices like optical switches and
filters.
