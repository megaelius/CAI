High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are solid solutions of multiple elements with equal atomic ratios which
present an innovative pathway for de novo alloy engineering. While there exist extensive studies
to ascertain the important structural aspects governing their mechanical behaviors, elucidating
the underlying deformation mechanisms still remains a challenge. Using atomistic simulations,
we probe the particle rearrangements in a yielding, model HEA system to understand the structural
origin of its plasticity. We find the plastic deformation is initiated by irreversible topological
fluctuations which tend to spatially localize in regions termed as soft spots which consist of particles
actively participating in slow vibrational motions, an observation strikingly reminiscent of
nonlinear glassy rheology. Due to the varying local elastic moduli resulting from the loss of compositional
periodicity, these plastic responses exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity and are found
to be inversely correlated with the distribution of local electronegativity. Further mechanical
loading promotes the cooperativity among these local plastic events and triggers the formation
of dislocation loops. As in strained crystalline solids, different dislocation loops can further
merge together and propagate as the main carrier of large-scale plastic deformation. However,
the energy barriers located at the spatial regions with higher local electronegativity severely
hinders the motion of dislocations. By delineating the transient mechanical response in terms
of atomic configuration, our computational findings shed new light on understanding the nature
of plasticity of single-phase HEA.
