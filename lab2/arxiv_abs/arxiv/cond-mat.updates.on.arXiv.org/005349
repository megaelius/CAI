We find that the best RVB state of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
model(spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ KAFH) is described by a $Z_{2}$ gapped mean field ansatz, which hosts
a mean field spinon dispersion very different from that of the widely studied $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid
state. However, we find that the physical spin fluctuation spectrum calculated from the Gutzwiller
projected RPA(GRPA) theory above such an RVB state is actually gapless and is almost identical to
that above the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state. We find that such a peculiar behavior can be attributed
to the unique flat band physics on the Kagome lattice, which makes the mapping between the mean field
ansatz and the RVB state non-injective. We find that the spin fluctuation spectrum of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
KAFH is not at all featureless, but is characterized by a prominent spectral peak at about $0.25J$
around the $\mathbf{M}$ point, which is immersed in a broad continuum extending to $2.7J$. Based
on these results, we argue that the spectral peak below 2 meV in the inelastic neutron scattering(INS)
spectrum of Hebertsmithite ZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$, which has been attributed to the contribution
of Cu$^{2+}$ impurity spins occupying the Zn$^{2+}$ site, should rather be understood as the intrinsic
contribution from the Kagome layer. We propose to verify such a picture by measuring the Knight shift
on the Cu site, rather than the O site, which is almost blind to the spin fluctuation at the $\mathbf{M}$
point as a result of the strong antiferromagnetic correlation between nearest neighboring spins
on the Kagome lattice.
