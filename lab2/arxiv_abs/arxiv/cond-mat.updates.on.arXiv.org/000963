We study the effects of synchronization and desynchronization in ensembles of phase oscillators
with the global Kuramoto-Sakaguchi coupling under common noise driving. Since the mechanisms
of synchronization by coupling and by common noise are essentially different, their interplay
is of interest. In the thermodynamic limit of large number of oscillators, employing the Ott-Antonsen
approach, we derive stochastic equations for the order parameters and consider their dynamics
for two cases: (i) identical oscillators and (ii) small natural frequency mismatch. For identical
oscillators, the stability of the perfect synchrony state is studied; a strong enough common noise
is revealed to prevail over a moderate negative (repelling) coupling and to synchronize the ensemble.
An inequality between the states of maximal asynchrony (zero-value of the order parameter) and
perfect synchrony; the former can be only weakly stable, while the latter can become adsorbing (the
transition to the synchrony becomes unidirectional). The dependence of the temporal dynamics
of the transition on the system parameters is investigated. For nonidentical oscillators the perfect
synchrony state becomes impossible and an absorbing state disappears; on its place, only a weakly
stable state of imperfect synchrony remains. A nontrivial effect of the divergence of individual
frequencies of oscillators with different natural frequencies is revealed and studied for moderate
repelling coupling; meanwhile, the order parameter remains non-small for this case. In Appendix
we provide an introduction to the theories of Ott-Antonsen and Watanabe-Strogatz.
