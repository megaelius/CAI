The linear perturbation group transformation (LPRG) is used to study the thermodynamics of the
axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising model with four spin interactions (extended ANNNI) in a field.
The LPRG for weakly interacting Ising chains is presented. The method is used to study finite field
para-ferrimagnetic phase transitions observed in layered uranium compounds, UAs_{1-x}Se_x,
UPd_2Si_2 or UNi_2Si_2. The above-mentioned systems are made of ferromagnetic layers and the spins
from the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor layers are coupled by the antiferromagnetic
interactions J_1<0 and J_2<0, respectively. Each of these systems exhibits a triple point
in which two ordered phases (ferrimagnetic and incommensurate) meet the paramagnetic one, and
all undergo the high field phase transition from para- to ferrimagnetic (++-) phase. However, if
in UAs_{1-x}Se_x the para-ferri phase transition is of the first order as expected from the symmetry
reason, in UT_2Si_2 (T=Pd,Ni) this transition seems to be a continuous one, at least in the vicinity
of the multicritical point. Within the MFA, the critical character of the finite field para-ferrimagnetic
transition at least at one isolated point can be described by the ANNNI model supplemented by an additional,
e.g., four-spin interaction. However, in LPRG approximation for the ratio \kappa=J_2/J_1 around
0.5 there is a critical value of the field for which an isolated critical point also exists in the original
ANNNI model. The positive four-spin interaction shifts the critical point towards higher fields
and changes the shape of the specific heat curve. In the latter case for the fields small enough, the
specific heat exhibits two-peak structure in the paramagnetic phase.
