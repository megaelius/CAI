Graphene/MoS$_2$ van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have become very important recently due
to their promising technological applications. Many experimental and theoretical research groups
across the globe have made outstanding contributions to benchmark the properties of graphene/MoS$_2$
heterostructures. Even though some research groups have already made an attempt to model the graphene/MoS$_2$
heterostructures using advanced state-of-art first-principles calculations, there exists
several discrepancies in the results from different theoretical research groups and the experimental
findings. In the present work, we revisit this problem by first principles approach and address
the existing discrepancies about the interlayer spacing between graphene and MoS$_2$ monolayers
in graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructures, and the location of Dirac points near Fermi-level. We find
that the Tkatchenko--Scheffler method efficiently evaluates the long-range vdW interactions
and accurately predicts interlayer spacing between graphene and MoS$_2$ sheets. We further investigate
the electronic, mechanical and vibrational properties of the optimized graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructures
created using 5$\times$5/4$\times$4 and 4$\times$4/3$\times$3 supercell geometries having
different magnitudes of lattice mismatch. The effect of the varying interlayer spacing on the electronic
properties of heterostructures is discussed. Our phonon calculations reveal that the interlayer
shear and breathing phonon modes, which are very sensitive to the weak vdW interactions, play vital
role in describing the thermal properties of the studied systems. The thermodynamic and elastic
properties of heterostructures are further discussed. A systematic comparison between our results
and the results reported from other research groups is presented to resolve the existing ambiguities
in the literature.
