It is well established that the $O(N)$ Wilson-Fisher (WF) CFT sits at a kink of the numerical bounds
from bootstrapping four point function of $O(N)$ vector. Moving away from the WF kinks, there indeed
exists another family of kinks (dubbed non-WF kinks) on the curve of $O(N)$ numerical bounds. Different
from the $O(N)$ WF kinks that exist for arbitary $N$ in $2<d<4$ dimensions, the non-WF kinks exist
in arbitrary dimensions but only for a large enough $N>N_c(d)$ in a given dimension $d$. In this paper
we have achieved a thorough understanding for few special cases of these non-WF kinks. The first
case is the $O(4)$ bootstrap in 2d, where the non-WF kink turns out to be the $SU(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten
(WZW) model, and all the $SU(2)_{k>2}$ WZW models saturate the numerical bound on the left side of
the kink. We further carry out dimensional continuation of the 2d $SU(2)_1$ kink towards the 3d $SO(5)$
deconfined phase transition. We find the kink disappears at around $d=2.7$ dimensions indicating
the $SO(5)$ deconfined phase transition is weakly first order. The second interesting observation
is, the $O(2)$ bootstrap bound does not show any kink in 2d ($N_c=2$), but is surprisingly saturated
by the 2d free boson CFT (also called Luttinger liquid) all the way on the numerical curve. The last
case is the $N=\infty$ limit, where the non-WF kink sits at $(\Delta_\phi, \Delta_T)=(d-1, 2d)$
in $d$ dimensions. We manage to write down its analytical four point function in arbitrary dimensions,
which equals to the subtraction of correlation functions of a free fermion theory and generalized
free theory. An important feature of this solution is the existence of a full tower of conserved higher
spin current. We speculate that a new family of CFTs will emerge at non-WF kinks for finite $N$, in
a similar fashion as $O(N)$ WF CFTs originating from free boson at $N=\infty$.
