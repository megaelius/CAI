As a potential window into the transition between the ergodic and many-body-localized phases,
we study the dephasing of weakly disordered, quasi-one-dimensional fermion systems due to a diffusive,
non-Markovian noise bath. Such a bath is self-generated by the fermions, via inelastic scattering
mediated by short-ranged interactions. We calculate the dephasing of weak localization perturbatively
through second order in the bath coupling. However, the expansion breaks down at long times, and
is not stabilized by including a mean-field decay rate, signaling a failure of the self-consistent
Born approximation. We also consider a many-channel quantum wire where short-ranged, spin-exchange
interactions coexist with screened Coulomb interactions. We calculate the dephasing rate, treating
the short-ranged interactions perturbatively and the Coulomb interaction exactly. The latter
provides a physical infrared regularization that stabilizes perturbation theory at long times,
giving the first controlled calculation of quasi-1D dephasing due to diffusive noise. At first
order in the diffusive bath coupling, we find an enhancement of the dephasing rate, but at second
order we find a rephasing contribution. Our results differ qualitatively from those obtained via
self-consistent calculations and are relevant in two different contexts. First, in the search
for precursors to many-body localization in the ergodic phase. Second, our results provide a mechanism
for the enhancement of dephasing at low temperatures in spin SU(2)-symmetric quantum wires, beyond
the Altshuler-Aronov-Khmelnitsky result. The enhancement is possible due to the amplification
of the triplet-channel interaction strength, and provides an additional mechanism that could
contribute to the experimentally observed low-temperature saturation of the dephasing time.
