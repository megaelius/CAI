Controlling morphology-structure of colloidal matter is an unusual phenomenon. Here, different
morphology-structure of colloidal particles has been investigated. At solution surface, different
tiny shaped particles of gold are developed where packets of nano shape energy cropped monolayer
assembly into their own shape depend on ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time. Tiny particles of two
loosely connected triangles developed at certain bipolar pulse ON time are separated on dealing
a bit disconcerted force at targeted tip. However, under unipolar pulse, triangular-shaped tiny
particles developed directly as the placed packet of nano shape energy was in a triangle shape. One-dimensional
arrays of tiny particles elongate successively as per available force while packing at dominating
centre of force for developing particles of various features. When the ratio of bipolar pulse OFF
to ON time is very large, the resulting particles are distorted while those developed at smaller
values of this ratio reveal geometric anisotropic shapes. When the ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to
ON time is 3, resulted particles reveal low aspect ratio to those developed at inverse value of this
ratio. At longer pulse ON time, tiny particles elongated more where travelling photons along interface
probably align misaligned electron states in atoms resulting into modify structure to structure
of smooth elements whose width is less than inter-spacing distance. When elongated atoms of tiny
particles misaligned at exceeded level, stretched energy knots clamping electron states could
not be recovered by photons travelling along the interface where structure is messed up. Morphology-structure
of particles under varying process conditions is discussed.
