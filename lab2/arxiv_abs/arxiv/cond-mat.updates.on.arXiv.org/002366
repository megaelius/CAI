Surface superconductivity has recently been observed on the (001) surface of the topological crystalline
insulator Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Te using point-contact spectroscopy, and theoretically proposed
to be of the chiral $p-$wave type. In this paper, we closely examine the parameter regimes suitable
for realizing a robust chiral $p-$wave order in this system, since, as we show, small changes in doping
can drastically alter the stable surface superconducting order from the topological chiral $p$-wave
type to a conventional $s$-wave type. Further, within the $p$-wave superconducting phase, we identify
parameter regimes where impurity bound (Shiba) states depend crucially on the existence of the
chiral $p-$wave order, and distinguish them from other regimes where chiral $p$-wave order does
exist but the impurity bound states cannot be used as an evidence for topological superconductivity.
Such a distinction could provide a very useful and easily realizable experimental test for chiral
$p-$wave order in this system. Notably, contrary to the customary belief in the literature, we show
that the crossing of particle-like and hole-like impurity bound state solutions at zero energy,
which has been used as a signature of topological order, can arise trivially even in the absence of
chiral superconductivity. We have obtained exact expressions for the wavefunctions of Shiba states
in point defects in the chiral $p-$wave superconducting state using an analytical method, and find
that, surprisingly, instead of the usual $exponential$ decay profile that characterizes bound
states, these states have a $power-law$ decay profile. As a possible application of our findings,
we show that the zero-energy Shiba states in point defects possess an internal SU(2) rotational
symmetry which enables them to be useful as quantum qubits.
