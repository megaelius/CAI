The zero-temperature quantum phase diagram of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $J_{1}$--$J_{2}$--$J_{1}^{\perp}$
model on an $AA$-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice is investigated using the coupled cluster method
(CCM). The model comprises two monolayers in each of which the spins, residing on honeycomb-lattice
sites, interact via both nearest-neighbor (NN) and frustrating next-nearest-neighbor isotropic
antiferromagnetic (AFM) Heisenberg exchange iteractions, with respective strengths $J_{1}
> 0$ and $J_{2} \equiv \kappa J_{1}>0$. The two layers are coupled via a comparable Heisenberg exchange
interaction between NN interlayer pairs, with a strength $J_{1}^{\perp} \equiv \delta J_{1}$.
The complete phase boundaries of two quasiclassical collinear AFM phases, namely the N\'{e}el
and N\'{e}el-II phases, are calculated in the $\kappa \delta$ half-plane with $\kappa > 0$. Whereas
on each monolayer in the N\'{e}el state all NN pairs of spins are antiparallel, in the N\'{e}el-II
state NN pairs of spins on zigzag chains along one of the three equivalent honeycomb-lattice directions
are antiparallel, while NN interchain spins are parallel. We calculate directly in the thermodynamic
(infinite-lattice) limit both the magnetic order parameter $M$ and the triplet spin gap $\Delta$
for both quasiclassical states used (separately) as the CCM model state, on top of which the multispin
quantum correlations are then calculated to high orders ($n \leq 10$) in a systematic series of approximations
involving $n$-spin clusters. The sole approximation made is then to extrapolate the sequences
of $n$th-order results for $M$ and $\Delta$ to the exact limit, $n \to \infty$.
