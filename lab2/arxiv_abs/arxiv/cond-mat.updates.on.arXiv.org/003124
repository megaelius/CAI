The phenomenon whereby atoms deal the positive or negative charge by losing or gaining the electron
forms the basis of familiar processes. In the elements where the atoms comprise unfilled states
of electrons can be thought of as eligible to electron-dynamics under suitable force or energy indicating
that they can never be ionized. At required level, solid atoms of transition states elongate as per
exerting surface force to their electrons. In the case of inert gas atoms, an alternative process
takes place. Atoms of inert gases, when flowing in suitable amount, split into electron streams
under excess density of photons having characteristic of current. As a result, photons through
leaving inter-state electron gaps of those splitting atoms when enter to air-medium their characteristics
are to be in the visible range to reveal the light-glow. By splitting inert gas atoms, electrons carrying
force-energy of photons impinge to underneath elongated atoms of solid to elongate them further.
When electrons of carrying force-energy do not impinge to them at a suitable orientation instead
of elongating further to those atoms deform them under the non-orientational based stretching
of energy knots clamped to electrons. On splitting of inert gas atoms into electrons where they travel
under carrying force-energy of releasing photons indicate that silicon solar cells and other similar
kind of gadgets generate photons having characteristic of current. A microscope visualizing the
morphology and structure is under the resolving power of working photons transmitted by its built-in
mechanism. Selected area electron diffraction is a selected area photon reflection. These fundamental
revolutions bring vast changes in the existing state of science.
