Heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and inorganic
semiconducting zero-dimensional (0D) quantum dots (QDs) offer unique charge and energy transfer
pathways which could form the basis of novel optoelectronic devices. To date, most has focused on
charge transfer and energy transfer from QDs to TMDs, i.e. from 0D to 2D. Here, we present a study of
the energy transfer process from a 2D to 0D material, specifically exploring energy transfer from
monolayer tungsten disulphide ($WS_{2}$) to near infrared (NIR) emitting lead sulphide-cadmium
sulphide (PbS-CdS) QDs. The high absorption cross section of $WS_{2}$ in the visible region combined
with the potentially high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of PbS QD systems, make this an interesting
donor-acceptor system that can effectively use the WS2 as an antenna and the QD as a tuneable emitter,
in this case downshifting the emission energy over hundreds of meV. We study the energy transfer
process using photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and PL microscopy, and show that 58% of the QD
PL arises due to energy transfer from the $WS_{2}$. Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) microscopy
studies show that the energy transfer process is faster than the intrinsic PL quenching by trap states
in the $WS_{2}$, thus allowing for efficient energy transfer. Our results establish that QDs could
be used as tuneable and high PL efficiency emitters to modify the emission properties of TMDs. Such
TMD/QD heterostructures could have applications in light emitting technologies, artificial
light harvesting systems or be used to read out the state of TMD devices optically in various logic
and computing applications
