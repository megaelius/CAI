We study diffusion of colloids on a fluid-fluid interface using particle simulations and fluctuating
hydrodynamics. Diffusion on a two-dimensional interface with three-dimensional hydrodynamics
is known to be anomalous, with the collective diffusion coefficient diverging like the inverse
of the wavenumber. This unusual collective effect arises because of the compressibility of the
fluid flow in the plane of the interface, and leads to a nonlinear nonlocal convolution term in the
diffusion equation for the ensemble-averaged concentration. We extend the previous hydrodynamic
theory to account for a species/color labeling of the particles, as necessary to model experiments
based on fluorescent techniques. We study the magnitude and dynamics of density and color density
fluctuations using a novel Brownian dynamics algorithm, as well as fluctuating hydrodynamics
theory and simulation. We find that hydrodynamic coupling between a single tagged particle and
collective density fluctuations leads to a reduction of the long-time self-diffusion coefficient,
even for an ideal gas of non-interacting particles. Using linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics
theory, we show that for diffusion on a fluid-fluid interface, nonequilibrium fluctuations of
the total density are small compared to the equilibrium fluctuations, but fluctuations of color
density are giant and exhibit a spectrum that decays as the inverse cubed power of the wavenumber.
We confirm these predictions through Brownian dynamics simulations of diffusive mixing with two
indistinguishable species. We also examine nonequilibrium fluctuations in systems with two-dimensional
hydrodynamics, such as thin smectic films in vacuum. We find that nonequilibrium fluctuations
are colossal and comparable in magnitude to the mean, and can be accurately modeled using numerical
solvers for the nonlinear equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics.
