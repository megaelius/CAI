The Enskog kinetic theory for moderately dense granular suspensions is considered as a model to
determine the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients. The influence of the interstitial gas on
solid particles is modeled by a viscous drag force term plus a stochastic Langevin-like term. The
suspension model is solved by means of the Chapman--Enskog method conveniently adapted to dissipative
dynamics. The momentum and heat fluxes as well as the cooling rate are obtained to first order in the
deviations of the hydrodynamic field gradients from their values in the homogeneous steady state.
Since the cooling terms (arising from collisional dissipation and viscous friction) cannot be
compensated for by the energy gained by grains due to collisions with the interstitial gas, the reference
distribution (zeroth-order approximation of the Chapman--Enskog solution) depends on time through
its dependence on temperature. On the other hand, to simplify the analysis and given that we are interested
in computing transport properties in the first order of deviations from the reference state, the
steady-state conditions are considered. This simplification allows us to get explicit expressions
for the Navier--Stokes transport coefficients. As expected, the results show that the dependence
of the transport coefficients on both inelasticity and density is clearly different from that found
in its granular counterpart (no gas phase). Finally, a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic
equations with respect to the homogeneous steady state is performed. In contrast to the granular
case (no gas-phase), no instabilities are found and hence, the homogeneous steady state is (linearly)
stable.
