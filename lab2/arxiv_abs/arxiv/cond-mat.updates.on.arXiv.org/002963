In this article we study the quench dynamics of Galilean and scale invariant many-body systems which
can be prepared using interacting atomic gases. The far-away from equilibrium dynamics are investigated
by employing $m$-body density matrices, which are most conveniently defined in terms of a special
basis - the conformal tower states. We explicitly illustrate that, although during the initial
stage of the dynamics all symmetries can be broken and absent in the unitary evolution because of
the initialization of the state, there is always an emergent conformal symmetry in the long time
limit. The emergence of this dynamic conformal symmetry is robust, and always occurs; it uniquely
defines the characteristics of the asymptotic dynamics at a scale invariant fixed point. As an immediate
application of the asymptotic dynamics of the microscopic density matrices, we have focused on
the effects of this emergent conformal symmetry on two observables: the moment of inertia tensor,
$I_{ij}(t)$, $i,j=x,y,z$, and the entropy density field, $S({\bf r}, t)$, in the hydrodynamic
flow of strongly interacting particles. We show that the long time behaviour of these observables
is completely set by conformal symmetry, while the leading long time corrections depend on interference
effects between different conformal tower states. The emergent conformal symmetry naturally
leads to entropy conservation, and {\em conformal cooling}, an energy conserving cooling of a strongly
interacting gas during free expansion. When the interaction Hamiltonian breaks the scale symmetry,
we further demonstrate that there is a direct cause-effect relation between conformal symmetry
breaking in the long time limit, and a non-vanishing entropy production. This suggests that the
entropy production rate is a natural {\em parameter} for categorizing the breaking of conformal
symmetry.
