Generalized mode-coupling theory (GMCT) constitutes a systematically correctable, first-principles
theory to study the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the glass transition. It is a hierarchical
framework that, through the incorporation of increasingly many particle density correlations,
can remedy some of the inherent limitations of the ideal mode-coupling theory (MCT). However, despite
MCT's limitations, the ideal theory also enjoys several remarkable successes, notably including
the analytical scaling laws for the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-relaxation dynamics. Here we mathematically
derive similar scaling laws for arbitrary-order multi-point density correlation functions obtained
from GMCT under arbitrary mean-field closure levels. More specifically, we analytically derive
the asymptotic and preasymptotic solutions for the long-time limits of multi-point density correlators,
the critical dynamics with two power-law decays, the factorization scaling laws in the $\beta$-relaxation
regime, and the time-density superposition principle in the $\alpha$-relaxation regime. The
two characteristic power-law-divergent relaxation times for the two-step decay and the non-trivial
relation between their exponents are also obtained. The validity ranges of the leading-order scaling
laws are also provided by considering the leading preasymptotic corrections. Furthermore, we
test these solutions for the Percus-Yevick hard-sphere system. We demonstrate that GMCT preserves
all the celebrated scaling laws of MCT while quantitatively improving the exponents, rendering
the theory a promising candidate for an ultimately quantitative first-principles theory of glassy
dynamics.
