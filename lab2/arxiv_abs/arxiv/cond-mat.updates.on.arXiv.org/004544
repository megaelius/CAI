Hafnium orthosilicate (HfSiO4: hafnon) has been proposed as an environmental barrier coating
(EBC) material to protect silicon coated, silicon-based ceramic materials at high temperatures
and as a candidate dielectric material in microelectronic devices. It can naturally form at the
interface between silicon dioxide (SiO2) and hafnia (HfO2). When used in these applications, its
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) should match that of silicon and SiC composites to reduce
the stored elastic strain energy, and thus risk of failure of these systems. The physical, mechanical,
thermodynamic and thermal transport properties of hafnon have been investigated using a combination
of both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental assessments. The average
linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) calculated using the quasi-harmonic approximation
increase from 3.06 10-6 K-1 to 6.36 10-6 K-1, as the temperature increases from 300 to 1500 K, in agreement
with both X-ray diffraction lattice parameter and dilatometry measurements. The predicted thermal
conductivity from Boltzmann transport theory was approximately 18 W/m.K at 300K. Both hot disk
and laser flash measurements gave a thermal conductivity of 13.3 W/m.K. This slightly lower value
is indicative of residual disorder in the experimental samples that was absent in the theoretical
analysis. First-principles calculations and nanoindentation techniques were used to assess
the ambient temperature elastic constants and bulk modulus respectively. The elastic properties
obtained by both approaches agreed to within 5% validating the computational approach and its future
use for study of the thermomechanical properties of other oxides or silicates.
