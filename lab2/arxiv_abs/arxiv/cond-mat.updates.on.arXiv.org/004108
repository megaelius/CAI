Here we develop and characterize high thermal conductivity/high thermal shock resistant bulk
Ce doped Al2O3 and propose it as a new phosphor converting capping layer for high-powered/high-brightness
solid-state white lighting (SSWL). The bulk, dense Ce:Al2O3 ceramics have a 0.5 at.% Ce:Al concentration
(significantly higher than the equilibrium solubility limit), and were produced using a simultaneous
solid-state reactive Current Activated Pressure-Assisted Densification (CAPAD) approach.
Ce:Al2O3 exhibits a broadband emission from 400-600nm, which encompasses the entire blue and green
portions of the visible spectrum when pumped with ultra-violet (UV) light that is now commercially
available in UV light emitting devices (LED) and laser diodes (LD). These broadband phosphors can
be used in the commonly employed scheme of mixing with other UV converting capping layers that emit
red light to produce white light. Alternatively, they can be used in a novel composite down converter
approach that ensures improved thermal-mechanical properties of the converting phosphor capping
layer. In this configuration Ce:Al2O3 is used with proven phosphor conversion materials such as
Ce:YAG as an active encapsulant or as a capping layer to produce SSWL with an improved bandwidth in
the blue portion of the visible spectrum. In order to study the effect of crystallinity on the Ce PL
emission, we synthesize Ce:YAG ceramics using high-pressure CAPAD at moderate temperatures to
obtain varying crystallinity (amorphous through fully -crystalline). We investigate the PL characteristics
of Ce:Al2O3 and Ce:YAG from 295K to 4K, revealing unique crystal field effects from the matrix on
the Ce-dopants. The unique PL properties in conjunction with the superior thermal-mechanical
properties of Ce:Al2O3 can be used in high-powered/high-brightness integrated devices based
on high-efficiency UV-LD that do not suffer
