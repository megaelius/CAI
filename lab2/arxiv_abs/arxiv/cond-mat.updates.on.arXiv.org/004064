As the size of quantum devices continues to grow, the development of scalable methods to characterise
and diagnose noise is becoming an increasingly important problem. Recent methods have shown how
to efficiently estimate Hamiltonians in principle, but they are poorly conditioned and can only
characterize the system up to a scalar factor, making them difficult to use in practice. In this work
we present a Bayesian methodology, called Bayesian Hamiltonian Learning (BHL), that addresses
both of these issues by making use of any or all, of the following: well-characterised experimental
control of Hamiltonian couplings, the preparation of multiple states, and the availability of
any prior information for the Hamiltonian. Importantly, BHL can be used online as an adaptive measurement
protocol, updating estimates and their corresponding uncertainties as experimental data become
available. In addition, we show that multiple input states and control fields enable BHL to reconstruct
Hamiltonians that are neither generic nor spatially local. We demonstrate the scalability and
accuracy of our method with numerical simulations on up to 100 qubits. These practical results are
complemented by several theoretical contributions. We prove that a $k$-body Hamiltonian $H$ whose
correlation matrix has a spectral gap $\Delta$ can be estimated to precision $\varepsilon$ with
only $\tilde{O}\bigl(n^{3k}/(\varepsilon \Delta)^{3/2}\bigr)$ measurements. We use two subroutines
that may be of independent interest: First, an algorithm to approximate a steady state of $H$ starting
from an arbitrary input that converges factorially in the number of samples; and second, an algorithm
to estimate the expectation values of $m$ Pauli operators with weight $\le k$ to precision $\epsilon$
using only $O(\epsilon^{-2} 3^k \log m)$ measurements, which quadratically improves a recent
result by Cotler and Wilczek.
