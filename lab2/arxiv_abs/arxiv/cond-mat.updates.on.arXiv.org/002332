Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic waves that travel along a metal-insulator
interface. Recently, new control methods of SPPs have been intensively investigated utilizing
unique optical responses in innovative materials such as graphenes and topological insulators.
Weyl semimetal (WSM) is one promising candidate of such materials. SPPs localized at a WSM-dielectric
interface have several inherent properties such as non-reciprocity and partial lack of dispersion
curves. These properties are caused by chiral magnetic effect in WSMs, which resembles that of external
static magnetic fields. In actual applications, however, WSMs are sandwiched between two dielectrics,
and the thickness of WSMs as well as the permittivity of outer layers can be regarded as fine-tuning
parameters. Here, we consider the thin-film WSMs and investigate how the properties of SPPs are
affected by hybridization between SPPs localized at the two WSM-dielectric interfaces. Generally,
this hybridization results in new mixed SPP modes, which are called short-range surface plasmons
(SRSP) and long-range surface plasmons (LRSP), respectively. We calculate dispersion curves
of these mixed modes for three principle configurations of the axion vector describing axial anomaly
in WSMs. We show that the partial lack of the dispersion and the non-reciprocity can be controlled
by fine-tuning of the thickness of the WSMs, the dielectric constants of the outer insulators, and
the direction of the axion vector. Our analysis also suggests that tuning of parameters enables
us to design the stability of the SRSP and LRSP. Complete suppression of the LRSP mode as well as controlling
the non-reciprocity will increase the functionality of new optical devices such as plasmonic waveguides
and optical one-way waveguides. Our consideration paves a way for stable control of SPPs even without
an external magnetic field.
