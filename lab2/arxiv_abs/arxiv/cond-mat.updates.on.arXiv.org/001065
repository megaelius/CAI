Identifying novel functional materials with desired key properties is an important part of bridging
the gap between fundamental research and technological advancement. In this context, high-throughput
calculations combined with data-mining techniques highly accelerated this process in different
areas of research during the past years. The strength of a data-driven approach for materials prediction
lies in narrowing down the search space of thousands of materials to a subset of prospective candidates.
Recently, the open-access organic materials database OMDB was released providing electronic
structure data for thousands of previously synthesized three-dimensional organic crystals.
Based on the OMDB, we report about the implementation of a novel density of states similarity search
tool which is capable of retrieving materials with similar density of states to a reference material.
The tool is based on the approximate nearest neighbor algorithm as implemented in the ANNOY library
and can be applied via the OMDB web interface. The approach presented here is wide-ranging and can
be applied to various problems where the density of states is responsible for certain key properties
of a material. As the first application, we report about materials exhibiting electronic structure
similarities to the aromatic hydrocarbon p-terphenyl which was recently discussed as a potential
organic high-temperature superconductor exhibiting a transition temperature in the order of
120~K under strong potassium doping. Although the mechanism driving the remarkable transition
temperature remains under debate, we argue that the density of states, reflecting the electronic
structure of a material, might serve as a crucial ingredient for the observed high-$T_\mathrm{c}$.
To provide candidates which might exhibit comparable properties, we present 15 purely organic
materials with similar features to p-terphenyl...
