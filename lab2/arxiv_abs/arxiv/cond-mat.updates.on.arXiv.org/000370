We perform a comprehensive first-principles study of the electronic properties of phosphorene
nanoribbons, phosphorene nanotubes, multilayer phosphorene, and heterobilayers of phosphorene
and two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayer. The tensile strain
and electric-field effects on electronic properties of low-dimensional phosphorene nanostructures
are also investigated. Our calculations show that zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons (z-PNRs) are
metals, regardless of the ribbon width while armchair phosphorene nanoribbons (a-PNRs) are semiconductors
with indirect bandgaps and the bandgaps are insensitive to variation of the ribbon width. We find
that tensile compression (or expansion) strains can reduce (or increase) the bandgap of the a-PNRs
while an in-plane electric field can significantly reduce the bandgap of a-PNRs, leading to the
semiconductor-to-metal transition beyond certain electric field. For single-walled phosphorene
nanotubes (SW-PNTs), both armchair and zigzag nanotubes are semiconductors with direct bandgaps.
With either tensile strains or transverse electric field, similar behavior of bandgap modulation
can arise as that for a-PNRs. It is known that multilayer phosphorene sheets are semiconductors
with their bandgaps decreasing with increasing the number of multilayers. In the presence of a vertical
electric field, the bandgaps of multilayer phosphorene sheets decrease with increasing the electric
field, and the bandgap modulation is more significant with more layers. Lastly, heterobilayers
of phosporene with a TMDC (MoS2 or WS2) monolayer are still semiconductors while their bandgaps
can be reduced by applying a vertical electric field as well.
