In this paper we continue our analysis of the interplay between the pairing and the non-Fermi liquid
behavior in a metal for a set of quantum-critical models with an effective dynamical electron-electron
interaction $V(\Omega_m) \propto 1/|\Omega_m|^\gamma$ (the $\gamma$-model). We analyze both
the original model and its extension, in which we introduce an extra parameter $N$ to account for
non-equal interactions in the particle-hole and particle-particle channel. In two previous papers(arXiv:2004.13220
and arXiv:2006.02968), we considered the case $0 < \gamma <1$ and argued that (i) at $T=0$, there
exists an infinite discrete set of topologically different gap functions, $\Delta_n (\omega_m)$,
all with the same spatial symmetry, and (ii) each $\Delta_n$ evolves with temperature and terminates
at a particular $T_{p,n}$. In this paper, we analyze how the system behavior changes between $\gamma
<1$ and $\gamma >1$, both at $T=0$ and a finite $T$. The limit $\gamma \to 1$ is singular due to infra-red
divergence of $\int d \omega_m V(\Omega_m)$, and the system behavior is highly sensitive to how
this limit is taken. We show that for $N =1$, the divergencies in the gap equation cancel out, and $\Delta_n
(\omega_m)$ gradually evolve through $\gamma=1$ both at $T=0$ and a finite $T$. For $N \neq 1$, divergent
terms do not cancel, and a qualitatively new behavior emerges for $\gamma >1$. Namely, the form of
$\Delta_n (\omega_m)$ changes qualitatively, and the spectrum of condensation energies, $E_{c,n}$
becomes continuous at $T=0$. We introduce different extension of the model, which is free from singularities
for $\gamma >1$.
