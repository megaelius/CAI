The characteristic features of the renormalization of the electrons in the bilayer cuprate superconductors
are investigated within the kinetic-energy driven superconductivity. It is shown that the quasiparticle
excitation spectrum is split into its bonding and antibonding components due to the presence of
the bilayer coupling, with each component that is independent. However, in the underdoped and optimally
doped regimes, although the bonding and antibonding electron Fermi surface (EFS) contours deriving
from the bonding and antibonding layers are truncated to form the bonding and antibonding Fermi
arcs, almost all spectral weights in the bonding and antibonding Fermi arcs are reduced to the tips
of the bonding and antibonding Fermi arcs, which in this case coincide with the bonding and antibonding
hot spots. These hot spots connected by the scattering wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i} $ construct an octet
scattering model, and then the enhancement of the quasiparticle scattering processes with the
scattering wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i}$ is confirmed via the result of the autocorrelation of the
ARPES spectral intensities. Moreover, the peak-dip-hump (PDH) structure developed in each component
of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum along the corresponding EFS is directly related with
the peak structure in the quasiparticle scattering rate except for at around the hot spots, where
the PDH structure is caused mainly by the bilayer coupling. Although the kink in the quasiparticle
dispersion is present all around EFS, when the momentum moves away from the node to the antinode,
the kink energy smoothly decreases, while the dispersion kink becomes more pronounced, and in particular,
near the cut close to the antinode, develops into a break separating of the fasting dispersing high-energy
part of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum from the slower dispersing low-energy part.
