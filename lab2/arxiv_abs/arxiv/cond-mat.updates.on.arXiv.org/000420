Polybutene-1 (PB-1), a typical semicrystalline polymer, in its stable form I shows a peculiar temperature
dependent strain-whitening behavior when being stretched at different temperatures where the
extent of strain-whitening weakens with the increasing of stretching temperature reaching a minima
value followed by an increase at higher stretching temperatures. Correspondingly, a stronger
strain-hardening phenomenon was observed at higher stretching temperatures. The strain-whitening
phenomenon in semicrystalline polymers has its origin of cavitation process during stretching.
In this work, the effect of crystalline lamellar thickness and stretching temperature on the cavitation
process in PB-1 has been investigated by means of combined synchrotron ultrasmall-angle and wide-angle
X-ray scattering techniques. It was found that, with respect to the cavitation process, three modes
of cavitation during the stretching process can be identified, namely no cavitation for sample
with the thinnest lamellae where only shear yielding occurred, cavitation with reorientation
for the samples stretched at lower temperatures and samples with thicker lamellae, and cavitation
without reorientation for samples with thinner lamellae stretched at higher temperatures. The
mode cavitation with reorientation occurs before yield point where the plate-like cavities start
to be generated within the lamellar stacks with normal perpendicular to the stretching direction
due to the blocky substructure of the crystalline lamellae and reorient gradually to the stretching
direction after strain-hardening. The mode of cavitation without reorientation appears after
yield point where ellipsoidal shaped cavities are generated in those lamellae stacks with normal
parallel to the stretching direction followed by an improvement of their orientation at larger
strains.
