Self-similar curves are shown to arise naturally as tension-free stationary states of conformally
invariant energies. Planar logarithmic spirals are associated with the simplest such energy,
the conformal arc-length, and their remarkable properties follow as a consequence of this invariance
and the manner of its breaking. In this paper their three-dimensional analogues will be constructed
explicitly. The qualitative behavior of these states is controlled by two parameters, the conserved
scaling current S and the magnitude of the torque M. If the spiral apex is located at the origin, the
conserved conformal current vanishes. Planar logarithmic spirals sit where M and S are tuned such
that 4MS =1 in parameter space. More generally, the spiral exhibits internal structure, nutating
between two cones aligned along the torque axis. It expands monotonically as this pattern precesses
about this axis. If 4MS<1 and 2S<1 the planar spiral undergoes a discontinuous transition into an
expanding deformed helical spiral, bounded between two nested similarly oriented cones. If 4MS>1,
however, the cones are identical and oppositely oriented; the torsion changes sign within the nutation
cycle where the projection along the torque axis reverses. This transition may be continuous or
discontinuous. I will describe the internal structure of the irreducible nutating segment of a
spiral and how it gets replicated to generate the complete self-similar geometry. These elementary
spirals provide the natural templates against which to compare spiral patterns exhibiting self-similar
behavior. In particular, supercritical trajectories (with 4MS>1) approximate rather well the
nutating tip of the growing tendril in a climbing plant first described by Darwin. This is probably
not a coincidence.
