We theoretically study the electronic transport through a ferromagnet-Ising superconductor
junction. A tight-binding Hamiltonian describing the Ising superconductor is presented. Then
by combing the non-equilibrium Green's function method, the expressions of Andreev reflection
coefficient and conductance are obtained. A strong magnetoanisotropic spin-triplet Andreev
reflection is shown, and the magnetoanisotropic period is $\pi$ instead of $2\pi$ as in the conventional
magnetoanisotropic system. We demonstrate a significant increase of the spin-triplet Andreev
reflection for the single-band Ising superconductor. Furthermore, the dependence of the Andreev
reflection on the incident energy and incident angle are also investigated. A complete Andreev
reflection can occur when the incident energy is equal to the superconductor gap, regardless of
the Fermi energy (spin polarization) of the ferromagnet. For the suitable oblique incidence, the
spin-triplet Andreev reflection can be strongly enhanced. In addition, the conductance spectroscopies
of both zero bias and finite bias are studied, and the influence of gate voltage, exchange energy,
and spin-orbit coupling on the conductance spectroscopy are discussed in detail. The conductance
reveals a strong magnetoanisotropy with period $\pi$ as the Andreev reflection coefficient. When
the magnetization direction is parallel to the junction plane, a large conductance peak always
emerges at the superconductor gap. This work offers a comprehensive and systematic study of the
spin-triplet Andreev reflection, and has underlying application of $\pi$-periodic spin valve
in spintronics.
