We calculate the lattice-driven in-plane $(\kappa_{\parallel})$ and out-of-plane $(\kappa_{\perp})$
thermal conductivities of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ bulk, and of films of different thicknesses, using the
Boltzmann equation with phonon scattering times obtained from anharmonic third order density
functional perturbation theory. We compare our results for the lattice component of the thermal
conductivity with published data for $\kappa_{\parallel}$ on bulk samples and with our room-temperature
thermoreflectance measurements of $\kappa_{\perp}$ on films of thickness (L) ranging from 18~nm
to 191~nm, where the lattice component has been extracted via the Wiedemann-Franz law. Ab-initio
theoretical calculations on bulk samples, including an effective model to account for finite sample
thickness and defect scattering, compare favorably both for the bulk case (from literature) and
thin films (new measurements). In the low-T limit the theoretical in-plane lattice thermal conductivity
of bulk Bi$_2$Se$_3$ agrees with previous measurements by assuming the occurrence of intercalated
Bi$_2$ layer defects. The measured thermal conductivity monotonically decreases by reducing
$L$, its value is $\kappa_{\perp}\approx 0.39\pm 0.08$~W/m$\cdot$K for $L=18$ nm and $\kappa_{\perp}=0.68\pm0.14$~W/m$\cdot$K
for $L=191$ nm. We show that the decrease of room-temperature $\kappa_{\perp}$ in Bi$_2$Se$_3$
thin films as a function of sample thickness can be explained by the incoherent scattering of out-of-plane
momentum phonons with the film surface. Our work outlines the crucial role of sample thinning in
reducing the out-of-plane thermal conductivity.
