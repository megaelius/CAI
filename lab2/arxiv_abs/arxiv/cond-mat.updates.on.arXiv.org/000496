We have systematically investigated the crystal structure and the magnetic properties of BiS2-based
superconductor Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (x = 0 - 1.0, y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (x =
0 - 0.8, y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7). In the REOBiS2 system, both crystal structure and physical properties
are tunable by mixing the RE (RE = rare earth) site with Ce, Nd and Sm due to the difference of ionic radius
of RE. In the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system, bulk superconductivity is observed for x = 1.0 with y = 0.3
and x = 0.5 - 1.0 with y = 0.5. The transition temperature (Tc) increases with increasing Nd concentration.
The highest Tc is 4.8 K for x = 1.0 with y = 0.5 in the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system. By the Nd substitution
for Ce, lattice contraction along the a axis is generated while the c axis does not show a remarkable
dependence on Nd concentration. The lattice constant of c decreases with increasing F concentration.
Furthermore, we found that the Nd site can be replaced by smaller Sm ions up to z = 0.8 in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2.
Bulk superconductivity is observed within z = 0 - 0.8 for y = 0.3 and z = 0 - 0.6 for y = 0.5. The Tc increases
with increasing Sm concentration. The highest Tc is 5.6 K for z = 0.8 with y = 0.3. With increasing Sm
concentration, the lattice constant of a decreases while the lattice constants of c does not show
a remarkable dependence on Sm concentration. We found that the chemical pressure generated by systematic
solution of the RE site in the blocking layer commonly induces lattice contraction along the a axis
in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2. The obtained results indicate that both optimal
F concentration and uniaxial lattice contraction along the a axis generated by chemical pressure
are essential for the inducement of bulk superconductivity in the REO1-yFyBiS2 system.
