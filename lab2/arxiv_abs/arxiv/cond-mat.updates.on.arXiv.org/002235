A dark energy model (DE) is proposed based on Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transition (GLT).
This model, GLTofDE, surprisingly provides a framework to study not only temporal tensions in cosmology
e.g. $H_0$ tension but also spatial anomalies of CMB e.g. the hemispherical asymmetry, quadrupole-octopole
alignment and its orthogonality to dipole simultaneously. In the mean field approximation of GLTofDE,
the potential is broken spontaneously. We modeled this transition and showed that GLTofDE can resolve
both the $H_0$ tension and Lyman-$\alpha$ anomaly in a non-trivial way. According to $\chi^2$-analysis
the transition happens at $z_t=0.746^{+0.028}_{-0.039}$ while $H_0=73.5\pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc and
$\Omega_{k}=-0.196^{+0.049}_{-0.033}$ which are consistent with the latest $H(z)$ reconstructions.
In addition, the GLTofDE proposes a framework to address the CMB anomalies when it is considered
beyond the mean field approximation. In this regime existence of a long wavelength mode is a typical
consequence which is named the Goldstone mode in the case of continuous symmetries. This mode, which
is an automatic byproduct in GLTofDE, makes different directions of the sky see different cosmological
constants. This means one side of the sky should be colder than the other side which can describe observed
dipole in CMB. In addition between initial stochastic pattern and the final state with one long wavelength
mode, we can observe smaller patches or protrusions of the biggest remaining patch in the simulation.
Our simulations show these protrusions are few in numbers and will be evolved according to Alan-Cahn
mechanism. These protrusions can give an additional effect on CMB which is the existence of aligned
quadrupole-octopole mode and its direction should be orthogonal to the dipole direction. We conclude
that GLTofDE is a very rich framework both theoretically and phenomenologically.
