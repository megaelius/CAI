Acoustic excitations in topologically disordered media at mesoscale present anomalous features
with respect to the Debye's theory. In a three-dimensional medium an acoustic excitation is characterized
by its phase velocity, intensity and polarization. The so-called Rayleigh anomalies, which manifest
in attenuation and retardation of the acoustic excitations, affect the first two properties. The
topological disorder is, however, expected to influence also the third one. Acoustic excitations
with a well-defined polarization in the continuum limit present indeed a so-called mixing of polarizations
at nanoscale, as attested by experimental observations and Molecular Dynamics simulations. We
provide a comprehensive experimental characterization of acoustic dynamics properties of a selected
glass, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride glass, whose heterogeneous structure at nanoscale
is well-assessed. Distinctive features, which can be related to the occurrence of the Rayleigh
anomalies and of the mixing of polarizations are observed. We develop, in the framework of the Random
Media Theory, an analytical model that allows a quantitative description of all the Rayleigh anomalies
and the mixing of polarizations. Contrast between theoretical and experimental features for the
selected glass reveals an excellent agreement. The quantitative theoretical approach permits
thus to demonstrate how the mixing of polarizations generates distinctive feature in the dynamic
structure factor of glasses and to unambiguously identify them. The robustness of the proposed
theoretical approach is validated by its ability to describe as well transverse acoustic dynamics.
