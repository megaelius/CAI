In addition to the self-governing properties, tiny-sized particles of metallic colloids are the
building blocks of large-sized particles. This study has been the subject of many researches. The
development of a tiny-sized particle on the solution surface depends on the attained dynamics of
atoms. When protocol energy is supplied to the transitional state atoms of monolayer assembly,
it binds them in its own shape. Atoms of arrays elongate uniformly under forced exertion of electrons
along the opposite poles to form structures of smooth elements of tiny particles. On solution surface,
impinging electron streams at a fixed angle result in elongating further the already elongated
atoms of arrays through gained forced energy of carried photons. Travelling photons along the air-solution
interface having different forcing energies further shape arrays of elongated atoms also termed
as structures of smooth elements. Inside the solution or near interface, gold atoms also form tiny
particles of different shaped structures, where in addition to their attained dynamics, miscellaneous
factors contribute too. Again, suitably amalgamated gold atoms in the neutral state execute confined
inter-state electron dynamics to self-generate bind energy, where they are not required to be uplifted
to solution surface for binding under protocol energy. Tiny-sized particles evolve structures
in the original format instead of developing structures if localized dynamics of atoms favor execution
of the electron dynamics where they do not require nano-energy to design structures. This study
highlights the fundamental process of formation of different tiny particles where electronic
structure, phase transition and localized dynamics of gold atoms appear to exert their influence.
Such a tool for processing materials opens several possibilities to develop engineered materials
of specific properties.
