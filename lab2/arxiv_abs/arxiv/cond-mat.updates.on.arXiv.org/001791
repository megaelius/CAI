We investigate the crystal structure and lattice vibrations of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ by a combined phonon
Raman scattering and x-ray powder diffraction experiment under pressures up to $66$ GPa and room
temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) and $ab$-initio lattice dynamics calculations
were also carried out. A first-order structural phase transition associated with an $8$ % collapse
of the $c$-axis is observed at high pressures, with phase coexistence being observed between $\sim
40$ and $55$ GPa. At lower pressures, lattice and phonon anomalies were observed, reflecting crossovers
between isostructural competing states. A critical pressure of $P_1=17$ GPa is associated with:
(i) a reduction of lattice volume compressibility and a change of behavior of the tetragonal $c/a$
ratio take place above $P_1$; (ii) a four-fold symmetry-breaking lattice strain associated with
lattice disorder; (iii) disappearance of two Raman active modes (at $\sim 180$ and $\sim 260$ cm$^{-1}$);
and (iv) development of an asymmetric Fano lineshape for the $\sim 390$ cm$^{-1}$ mode. DFT indicates
that the phase above $P_1$ is most likely non-magnetic. Exploring the similarities between iridate
and cuprate physics, we argue that these observations are consistent with the emergence of a rotational
symmetry-breaking electronic instability at $P_1$, providing hints for the avoided metallization
under pressure and supporting the hypothesis of possible competing orders that are detrimental
to superconductivity in this family. Alternative scenarios for the transition at $P_1$ are also
suggested and critically discussed. Additional phonon and lattice anomalies in the tetragonal
phase are observed at $P_2=30$ and $P_3=40$ GPa, indicating further competing phases that are stabilized
at high pressures.
