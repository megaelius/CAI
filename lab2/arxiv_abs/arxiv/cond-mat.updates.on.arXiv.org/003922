Arising from the interplay between charge, spin and orbital of electrons, spin-orbit torque (SOT)
has attracted immense interest in the past decade. Despite vast progress, the existing quantification
methods of SOT still have their respective restrictions on the magnetic anisotropy, the entanglement
between SOT effective fields, and the artifacts from the thermal gradient and the planar Hall effect,
etc. Thus, accurately characterizing SOT across diverse samples remains as a critical need. In
this work, with the aim of removing the afore-mentioned restrictions, thus enabling the universal
SOT quantification, we report the characterization of the sign and amplitude of SOT by angular measurements.
We first validate the applicability of our angular characterization in a perpendicularly magnetized
Pt/Co-Ni heterostructure by showing excellent agreements to the results of conventional quantification
methods. Remarkably, the thermoelectric effects, i.e., the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) arising
from the temperature gradient can be self-consistently disentangled and quantified from the field
dependence of the angular characterization. The superiority of this angular characterization
has been further demonstrated in a Cu/CoTb/Cu sample with large ANE but negligible SOT, and in a Pt/Co-Ni
sample with weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), for which the conventional quantification
methods are not applicable and even yield fatal error. By providing a comprehensive and versatile
way to characterize SOT and thermoelectric effects in diverse heterostructures, our results pave
the important foundation for the spin-orbitronic study as well as the interdisciplinary research
of thermal spintronic.
