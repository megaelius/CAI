We develop a theory for quantum phases and quantum multicriticality in bilayer graphene in the presence
of an explicit energy gap in the non-interacting spectrum by extending previous renormalization
group (RG) analyses of electron-electron interactions in gapless bilayer graphene at finite temperature
to include the effect of an electric field applied perpendicular to the sample. We determine the
possible outcomes of the resulting RG equations, represented by "fixed rays" along which ratios
of the coupling constants remain constant and map out the leading instabilities of the system for
an interaction of the form of a Coulomb interaction that is screened by two parallel conducting plates
placed equidistant from the electron. We find that some of the fixed rays on the "target plane" found
in the zero-field case are no longer valid fixed rays, but that all four of the isolated rays are still
valid. We also find five additional fixed rays that are not present in the zero-field case. We then
construct maps of the leading instability (or instabilities) of the system for the screened Coulomb-like
interaction as a function of the overall interaction strength and interaction range for four values
of the applied electric field. We find that the pattern of leading instabilities is the same as that
found in the zero-field case, namely that the system is unstable to a layer antiferromagnetic state
for short-ranged interactions, to a nematic state for long-ranged interactions, and to both for
intermediate-ranged interactions. However, if the interaction becomes too long-ranged or too
weak, then the system will exhibit no instabilities. The ranges at which the nematic instability
first appears, the antiferromagnetic instability disappears, and the nematic instability disappears
all decrease with increasing applied electric field.
