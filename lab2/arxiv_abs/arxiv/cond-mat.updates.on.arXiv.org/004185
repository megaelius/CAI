As the semiconductor industry turns to alternate conductors to replace Cu for future interconnect
nodes, much attention as been focused on evaluating the electrical performance of Ru. The typical
hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase has been extensively studied, but relatively little attention
has been paid to the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase, which has been shown to nucleate in confined
structures and may be present in tight-pitch interconnects. Using \emph{ab initio} techniques,
we benchmark the performance of fcc Ru. We find that the phonon-limited bulk resistivity of the fcc
Ru is less than half of that of hcp Ru, a feature we trace back to the stronger electron-phonon coupling
elements that are geometrically inherited from the modified Fermi surface shape of the fcc crystal.
Despite this benefit of the fcc phase, high grain boundary scattering results in increased resistivity
compared to Cu-based interconnects with similar average grain size. We find, however, that the
line resistance of fcc Ru is lower than that of Cu below 21 nm line width due to the conductor volume
lost to adhesion and wetting liners. In addition to studying bulk transport properties, we evaluate
the performance of adhesion liners for fcc Ru. We find that it is energetically more favorable for
fcc Ru to bind directly to silicon dioxide than through conventional adhesion liners such as TaN
and TiN. In the case that a thin liner is necessary for the Ru deposition technique, we find that the
vertical resistance penalty of a liner for fcc Ru can be up to eight times lower than that calculated
for conventional liners used for Cu interconnects. Our calculations, therefore, suggest that
the formation of the fcc phase of Ru may be a beneficial for advanced, low-resistance interconnects.
