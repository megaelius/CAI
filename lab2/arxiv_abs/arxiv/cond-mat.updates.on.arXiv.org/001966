Among the numerous anomalies of water, the acceleration of dynamics under pressure is particularly
puzzling. Whereas the diffusivity anomaly observed in experiments has been reproduced in several
computer studies, the parallel viscosity anomaly has received less attention. Here we simulate
viscosity and self-diffusion coefficient of the TIP4P/2005 water model over a broad temperature
and pressure range. We reproduce the experimental behavior, and find additional anomalies at negative
pressure. The anomalous effect of pressure on dynamic properties becomes more pronounced upon
cooling, reaching two orders of magnitude for viscosity at 220 K. We analyze our results with a dynamic
extension of a thermodynamic two-state model, an approach which has proved successful in describing
experimental data. Water is regarded as a mixture of interconverting species with contrasting
dynamic behaviors, one being strong (Arrhenius), and the other fragile (non-Arrhenius). The dynamic
parameters of the two-state models are remarkably close between experiment and simulations. The
larger pressure range accessible to simulations suggests a modification of the dynamic two-state
model, which in turn also improves the agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, our simulations
demonstrate the decoupling between viscosity $\eta$ and self-diffusion coefficient $D$ as a function
of temperature $T$. The Stokes-Einstein relation, which predicts a constant $D \eta/T$, is violated
when $T$ is lowered, in connection with the Widom line defined by an equal fraction of the two interconverting
species. These results provide a unifying picture of thermodynamics and dynamics in water, and
call for experiments at negative pressure.
