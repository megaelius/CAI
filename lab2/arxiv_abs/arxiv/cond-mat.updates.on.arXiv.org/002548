Using Monte Carlo techniques, we study a three-orbital CuO$_2$ spin-fermion model for copper-based
high critical temperature superconductors that captures the charge-transfer properties of these
compounds. Our studies reveal the presence of spin order in the parent compound and, more importantly,
stripe spin and charge order under hole doping. Due to the $p$-$d$ orbital hybridizati on, the added
holes are approximately equally distributed among the two $p$ orbitals of the oxygen atoms and the
$d$ orbital of the copper atoms in the unit cell. In rectangular clusters of dimension $16\times
4$ %that break the $\pi/2$ lattice rotational symmetry, {\it half-filled} stripes are observed
upon hole doping, namely when $N_h=2n$ holes are introduced in the system then $n$ stripes of length
4 are formed along the short direction. The original antiferromagnetic order observed in the parent
compound develops a $\pi-$shift across each stripe and the magnetic structure factor has a peak
at wavevector ${\bf k}=(\pi-\delta,\pi)$ with $\delta=2\pi N_h/N=\pi N_h/2L$, where $L=16$.
The electronic charge is also modulated and the charge structure factor is maximized at ${\bf k}=(2\delta,0)$.
As electrons are removed from the system, intracell orbital nematicity with $\langle n_{p_x}\rangle-\langle
n_{p_y}\rangle\ne 0$ dev elops in the oxygen sector, as well as intercell magnetic nematicity with
$\langle S^z_{{\bf i},d}(S^z_{{\bf i}+{\bf x},d}-S^z_{{\bf i}+{\ bf y},d})\rangle\ne 0$ in
the spin copper sector, in the standard notation. This occurs not only in rectangular but also in
square 8$\times$8 lattices. Overall, our results suggest that the essence of the stripe spin and
charge distribution experimentally observed in hole-doped cuprates are captured by unbiased
Monte Carlo studies of a simple hole-doped charge-transfer insulator CuO$_2$ spin-fermion model.
