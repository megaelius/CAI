We propose a closed form for the statistical distribution of non-interacting Majorana fermions
at low temperature. Majorana particles often appear in the contemporary many-body literature
in the Kitaev, Fu-Kane, or Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models, where the Majorana condition of self-conjugacy
immediately results in nonconserved particle number, non-trivial braiding statistics, and the
absence of a noninteracting limit. We deviate from this description and instead consider a gas of
noninteracting, spin-1/2 Majorana fermions that obey the spin-statistics theorem via imposing
a condensed matter analog of momentum conservation. This allows us to build a quantum statistical
theory of the Majorana system in the low temperature, low density limit without the need to account
for strong fluctuations in the particle number. A combinatorial analysis leads to a configurational
entropy which deviates from the fermionic result with an increasing number of available microstates.
A number-conserving Majorana distribution function is derived which shows signatures of a sharply-defined
Fermi surface at finite temperatures. Such a distribution is then re-derived from a microscopic
model in the form of a modified Kitaev chain with a bosonic pair interaction. The thermodynamics
of this free Majorana system is found to be nearly identical to that of a free Fermi gas, except now
distinguished by a two-fold ground state degeneracy and, subsequently, a residual entropy at zero
temperature. Despite clear differences with the anyonic or Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models, we nevertheless
find surprising agreement between our theory and experimental signatures of Majorana excitations
in several materials. Experimental realization of our exactly solvable model is also discussed
in the realm of astrophysical and high-energy phenomena.
