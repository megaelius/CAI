The ultimate in miniature circuitry, exactingly crafted of single atom building blocks, can unleash
a new basis for electronic devices, one that is far more energy efficient, while at once much faster
and more compact than today's state of the art. While examples of atom-crafting with a suitable level
of precision and complexity has existed for 3 decades, that control did not extend to electronically
useful and also strongly bonded material systems. The attractive idea of forming circuitry of very
robust patterned hydrogen atom terminated silicon surface states had been expressed decades ago,
but, sufficient understanding of single atom states, ensemble states, and the interaction of those
with dopants and bulk states was lacking and has only very recently been established. That new understanding
coupled with greatly improved atomic scale fabrication methods developed just months ago have
enabled a great step forward. Here, we report the first example of reversible information transmission
through a binary wire (a two state wire) made of atomic silicon quantum dots. A binary OR gate and its
full truth table has also been demonstrated. Because electrons are merely rearranged and are conserved,
and as no conventional current is used, minuscule power consumption is expected. Signal transfer
is mediated by electrons confined by and tunneling among constituent dots. An atomic force microscope
operating in the NC mode was deployed to fabricate these active structures. A variant of that technique,
KPFM, records individual atom charge state changes to reveal and verify the inner workings of this
approach. Spontaneous spatial charge arrangements in ensembles occur in response to imposed charge
inputs, allowing information representation and computation. This approach to electronics we
call BASIL for Binary Atomic Silicon Logic.
