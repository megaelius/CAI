Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) encapsulation has demonstrated to significantly improve carrier
transport in graphene. In this work, we have investigated the benefit of implementing this encapsulation
technique in graphene field-effect transistors (GFET) in terms of their radio frequency (RF) performance.
For such a purpose, a drift-diffusion self-consistent simulator was prepared to get the GFET electrical
characteristics. Both the mobility and saturation velocity information were obtained by means
of an ensemble Monte Carlo simulator, upon considering the relevant scattering mechanisms that
affect carrier transport, namely, carrier-carrier interactions, intrinsic phonons, remote
surface polar phonons from the h-BN layers, and scattering by defects and impurities. The GFET RF
figures of merit were obtained using a high-frequency small-signal model derived from the DC characteristics,
got in turn from the drift-diffusion simulator. Importantly, the model accounts for the non-reciprocal
capacitances of the GFET to get accurate results. The cutoff frequency scales with the channel length
up to the physical limit given by the inverse of the transit time. Projected maximum oscillation
frequencies, in the order of few THz, are expected to exceed the values demonstrated by InP and Si
based RF transistors. We have also thoroughly studied the existing trade-off between power gain
and stability and the role played by the gate resistance. Assuming positive drain bias, high power
gain and stability are both feasible if the device is operated in the hole branch, remarkably far
away from current saturation operation. We have finally discussed the benefits of device unilateralization
and the exploitation of the negative differential resistance region of GFET to get negative-resistance
gain.
