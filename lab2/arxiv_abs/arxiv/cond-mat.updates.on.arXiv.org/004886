Failure in brittle materials under dynamic loading conditions is a result of the propagation and
coalescence of microcracks. Simulating this mechanism at the continuum level is computationally
expensive or, in some cases, intractable. The computational cost is due to the need for highly resolved
computational meshes required to capture complex crack growth behavior, such as branching, turning,
etc. Typically, continuum-scale models that account for brittle damage evolution homogenize
the crack network in some way, which reduces the overall computational cost, but can also neglect
key physics of the subgrid crack growth behavior, sacrificing accuracy for efficiency. We have
developed an approach using machine learning that overcomes the current inability to represent
micro-scale physics at the macro-scale. Our approach leverages damage and stress data from a high-fidelity
model that explicitly resolves microcrack behavior to build an inexpensive machine learning emulator,
which runs in seconds as opposed to the high-fidelity model, which takes hours. Once trained, the
machine learning emulator is used to predict the evolution of crack length statistics. A continuum-scale
constitutive model is then informed with these crack statistics, speeding up the workflow by four
orders of magnitude. Both the machine learning model and the continuum-scale model are validated
against a high-fidelity model and experimental data, respectively, showing excellent agreement.
There are two key findings. The first is that we can reduce the dimensionality of the problem, establishing
that the machine learning emulator only needs the length of the longest crack and one of the maximum
stress components to capture the necessary physics. Another compelling finding is that the emulator
can be trained in one experimental setting and transferred successfully to predict behavior in
a different setting.
