Fractionalized quasiparticles - anyons - bear a special role in present-day physics. At the same
time, they display properties of interest both foundational, with quantum numbers that transcend
the spin-statistics laws, and applied, providing a cornerstone for decoherence-free quantum
computation. The development of platforms for realization and manipulation of these objects,
however, remains a challenge. Typically these entail the zero-temperature ground-state of incompressible,
gapped fluids. Here, we establish a strikingly different approach: the development and probing
of anyon physics in a gapless fluid. The platform of choice is a chiral, multichannel, multi-impurity
realization of the Kondo effect. We discuss how, in the proper limit, anyons appear at magnetic impurities,
protected by an asymptotic decoupling from the fluid and by the emerging Kondo length scale. We discuss
possible experimental realization schemes using integer quantum Hall edges. The gapless and charged
degrees of freedom coexistent with the anyons suggest the possibility of extracting quantum information
data by transport and simple correlation functions. To show that this is the case, we generalize
the fusion ansatz of Cardy's boundary conformal field theory, now in the presence of multiple localized
perturbations. The generalized fusion ansatz captures the idea that multiple impurities share
quantum information non-locally, in a way formally identical to anyonic zero modes. We display
several examples supporting and illustrating this generalization and the extraction of quantum
information data out of two-point correlation functions. With the recent advances in mesoscopic
realizations of multichannel Kondo devices, our results imply that exotic anyon physics may be
closer to reach than presently imagined.
