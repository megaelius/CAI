We discuss the dynamical polarization, plasmon dispersion, relaxation time, and the Friedel oscillation
of screened potential of the two-dimension Dirac and three-dimension Weyl system (which are gapped)
in the low-energy tigh-binding model. The results, like the Fermi wavevector, Thomas-Fermi wavevector,
and longitudinal conductivity are obtained in different dimensions. Some important conclusions
are detailedly discussed in this paper, including the screening character under short or long range
Coulomb interaction, and the longitudinal conductivity in two- or three-dimensions. The longitudinal
conductivity in optical limit is distinguishing for the case of two-dimension system and three-dimension
system. The density-dependence (including the carrier density and the impurity concentration)
of the Fermi wavevector, dc conductivity, and the relaxation time are discussed. Specially, for
the doped Weyl system, the pumped carrier density due to the chiral anomaly origin from electromagnetic
response is controlled by the internode relaxation time which has also been analyzed. %The model
for which the calculations based on is the low-energy tight-binding model as presented in the Sec.2,
%i.e., the results in this paper is for the low-temperature and low-energy case %and it's thus possible
to carrying out a logarithmic self-energy correction to the relaxation time as we discussed in the
text. %The difference between the longitudinal conductivity in serversal systems is also been
discussed. Our results is helpful to the application of the Dirac or Weyl systems as well as the study
on their low-temperature characters.
