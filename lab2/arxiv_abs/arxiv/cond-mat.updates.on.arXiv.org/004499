Self-organized bistability (SOB) is the counterpart of 'self-organized criticality' (SOC),
for systems tuning themselves to the edge of bistability of a discontinuous phase transition, rather
than to the critical point of a continuous one. The equations defining the mathematical theory of
SOB turn out to bear strong resemblance to a (Landau-Ginzburg) theory recently proposed to analyze
the dynamics of the cerebral cortex. This theory describes the neuronal activity of coupled mesoscopic
patches of cortex, homeostatically regulated by short-term synaptic plasticity. The theory for
cortex dynamics entails, however, some significant differences with respect to SOB, including
the lack of a (bulk) conservation law, the absence of a perfect separation of timescales and, the
fact that in the former, but not in the second, there is a parameter that controls the overall system
state (in blatant contrast with the very idea of self-organization). Here, we scrutinize --by employing
a combination of analytical and computational tools-- the analogies and differences between both
theories and explore whether in some limit SOB can play an important role to explain the emergence
of scale-invariant neuronal avalanches observed empirically in the cortex. We conclude that,
actually, in the limit of infinitely slow synaptic-dynamics, the two theories become identical,
but the timescales required for the self-organization mechanism to be effective do not seem to be
biologically plausible. We discuss the key differences between self-organization mechanisms
with/without conservation and with/without infinitely separated timescales. In particular,
we introduce the concept of 'self-organized collective oscillations' and scrutinize the implications
of our findings in neuroscience, shedding new light into the problems of scale invariance and oscillations
in cortical dynamics.
