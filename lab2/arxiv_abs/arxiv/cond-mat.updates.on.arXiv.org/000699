We report the results of our investigations on a polycrystalline sample of Lu$_2$Ir$_3$Si$_5$
which crystallizes in the U$_2$Co$_3$Si$_5$ type structure (Ibam). These investigations comprise
powder X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and high temperature
(120-300 K) heat capacity studies. Our results reveal that the sample undergoes a superconducting
transition below 3.5 K. It also undergoes a first order phase transition between 150-250 K as revealed
by an upturn in the resistivity, a diasmagnetic drop in the magnetic susceptibility and a large anomaly
(20-30 J/mol K) in the specific heat data. We observe a huge thermal hysteresis of almost 45 K between
the cooling and warming data across this high temperature transition in all our measurements. Low
temperature X-ray diffraction measurements at 87 K reveals that the compound undergoes a structural
change at the high temperature transition. Resistivity data taken in repeated cooling and warming
cycles indicate that at the high temperature transition, the system goes into a highly metastable
state and successive heating/cooling curves are found to lie above the previous one and the resistance
keeps increasing with every thermal cycle. The room temperature resistance of a thermaly cycled
piece of the sample decays exponentialy with time with a decay time constant estimated to be about
10$^4$ secs. The anomaly (upturn) in the resistivity and the large drop (almost 45%) in the susceptibility
across the high temperature transition suggest that the observed structural change is accompanied
or induced by an electronic transition.
