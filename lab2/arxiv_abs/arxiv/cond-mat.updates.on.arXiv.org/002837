The successful assembly of heterostructures consisting of several layers of different 2D materials
in arbitrary order by exploiting van der Waals forces has truly been a game changer in the field of
low dimensional physics. For instance, the encapsulation of graphene or MoS2 between atomically
flat hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers with strong affinity and graphitic gates that screen
charge impurity disorder provided access to a plethora of new physical phenomena by drastically
boosting the device quality. The encapsulation is accompanied by a self-cleansing effect at the
interfaces. The otherwise predominant charged impurity disorder is minimized and random strain
fluctuations ultimately constitute the main source of residual disorder. Despite these advances,
the fabricated heterostructures still vary notably in their performance and many possess only
mediocre quality. Here, we report a reliable method to improve fully completed van der Waals heterostructure
devices with a straightforward post-processing surface treatment based on contact mode AFM. The
impact is demonstrated by comparing magnetotransport measurements before and after the AFM treatment
on one and the same device as well as on a larger set of treated and untreated devices to collect device
statistics. Both the low temperature properties as well as the room temperature electrical characteristics
as relevant for applications improve on average substantially. We surmise that the main beneficial
effect arises from reducing nanometer scale corrugations at the interfaces and, hence, the detrimental
impact of random strain fluctuations due to the AFM ironing action.
