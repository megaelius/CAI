We present a symmetry-adapted real-space formulation of Kohn-Sham density functional theory
for cylindrical geometries and apply it to the study of large X (X=C, Si, Ge, Sn) nanotubes. Specifically,
starting from the Kohn-Sham equations posed on all of space, we reduce the problem to the fundamental
domain by incorporating cyclic and periodic symmetries present in the angular and axial directions
of the cylinder, respectively. We develop a high-order finite-difference parallel implementation
of this formulation, and verify its accuracy against established planewave and real-space codes.
Using this implementation, we study the band structure and bending properties of X nanotubes and
Xene sheets, respectively. Specifically, we first show that zigzag and armchair X nanotubes with
radii in the range 1 to 5 nm are semiconducting. In particular, we find an inverse linear dependence
of the bandgap with respect to the radius for all nanotubes, other than the armchair and zigzag type
III carbon variants, for which we find an inverse quadratic dependence. Next, we exploit the connection
between cyclic symmetry and uniform bending deformations to calculate the bending moduli of Xene
sheets in both zigzag and armchair directions. We find Kirchhoff-Love type bending behavior for
all sheets, with graphene and stanene possessing the largest and smallest moduli, respectively.
In addition, other than graphene, the sheets demonstrate significant anisotropy, with larger
bending moduli along the armchair direction. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach
has very good parallel scaling and is highly efficient, enabling ab initio simulations of unprecedented
size for systems with a high degree of cyclic symmetry. In particular, we show that even micron-sized
nanotubes can be simulated with modest computational effort.
