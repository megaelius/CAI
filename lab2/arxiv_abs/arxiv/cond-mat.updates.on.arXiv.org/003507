Motivated by the analysis of gapped periodic quantum systems in presence of a uniform magnetic field
in dimension $d \le 3$, we study the possibility to construct spanning sets of exponentially localized
(generalized) Wannier functions for the space of occupied states. When the magnetic flux per unit
cell satisfies a certain rationality condition, by going to the momentum-space description one
can model $m$ occupied energy bands by a real-analytic and $\mathbb Z^{d}$-periodic family $\{P({\bf
k})\}_{{\bf k} \in \mathbb R^{d}}$ of orthogonal projections of rank $m$. A moving orthonormal
basis of $\mathrm{Ran} P({\bf k})$ consisting of real-analytic and $\mathbb Z^d$-periodic Bloch
vectors can be constructed if and only if the first Chern number(s) of $P$ vanish(es). Here we are
mainly interested in the topologically obstructed case. First, by dropping the generating condition,
we show how to algorithmically construct a collection of $m-1$ orthonormal, real-analytic, and
periodic Bloch vectors. Second, by dropping the linear independence condition, we construct a
Parseval frame of $m+1$ real-analytic and periodic Bloch vectors which generate $\mathrm{Ran}
P({\bf k})$. Both algorithms are based on a two-step logarithm method which produces a moving orthonormal
basis in the topologically trivial case. A moving Parseval frame of analytic, periodic Bloch vectors
corresponds to a Parseval frame of exponentially localized composite Wannier functions. We extend
this construction to the case of magnetic Hamiltonians with an irrational magnetic flux per unit
cell and show how to produce Parseval frames of exponentially localized generalized Wannier functions
also in this setting. Our results are illustrated in crystalline insulators modelled by $2d$ discrete
Hofstadter-like Hamiltonians, but apply to certain continuous models of magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger
operators as well.
