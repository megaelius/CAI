The electronic phase separation (EPS) of optimally doped La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) thin films under
various degrees of anisotropic strain is investigated by static magnetotransport and dynamic
relaxation measurements. Three LCMO films were grown simultaneously on (001) NdGaO3 (NGO) substrates
by pulsed laser deposition, and then post-growth annealed at 780 oC in O2 for different durations
of time. With increasing annealing time, the films developed significant strains of opposite signs
along the two orthogonal in-plane directions. The static temperature-dependent resistivity,
R(T), was measured simultaneously along the two orthogonal directions. With increasing annealing
time, both zero-field-cooled and field-cooled R(T) show significant increases, suggesting strain-triggered
EPS and appearance of antiferromagnetic insulating (AFI) phases in a ferromagnetic metallic (FMM)
ground state. Meanwhile, R(T) along the tensile-strained [010] direction becomes progressively
larger than that along the compressive-strained [100]. The enhanced resistivity anisotropy indicates
that the EPS is characterized by phase-separated FMM entities with a preferred orientation along
[100], possibly due to the cooperative deformation and rotation/tilting of the MnO6 octahedra
under the enhanced anisotropic strain. The anisotropic EPS can also be tuned by an external magnetic
field. During a field-cycle at several fixed temperatures, the AFI phases are melted at high fields
and recovered at low fields, resulting in sharp resistance changes of the ratio as high as 104. Furthermore,
the resistivity was found to exhibit glass-like behavior, relaxing logarithmically in the phase-separated
states. Fitting the data to a phenomenological model, the resulting resistive viscosity and characteristic
relaxation time are found to evolve with temperature, showing a close correlation with the static
measurements in the EPS states.
