Supported Lipid Bilayers (SLBs) are model membranes formed at solid substrate surfaces. This architecture
renders membranes experimentally accessible to surface sensitive techniques used to study their
properties, including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation
(QCM-D) and X-Ray/Neutron Reflectometry, and allows the bilayer to be integrated with technology
for potential biotechnological applications, such as drug screening devices. From a biological
function perspective, it could be argued that a supported bilayer is a more useful model of a biological
cell membrane, which sits between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix networks. Many
substrates can be used to support lipid bilayers, dependent upon the experimental signal being
measured. Simple lipid dynamics and structures on SLBs have been investigated, but there have been
very few studies quantifying how different substrates can lead to different results. We present
data showing that the phase separation of a well-studied lipid mixture varies drastically between
mica and glass. The distinct micron scale domains observed on mica, very similar to those seen in
free-floating Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs), are reduced to nanometer scale domains on glass.
The origin of this difference is not due to variations in molecular diffusion rate or to changes in
thermal transition temperature, both of which would imply a chemical difference, but rather a hindering
of the hydrodynamic flow of clusters or small domains during the process of phase separation. Nanoscale
roughness with a radius of curvature too small for the bilayer to conform leads to pinning points
where ordered domains are effectively arrested, and no longer able to coalesce via cluster/domain
motion, limiting phase separation to molecular accretion. This hypothesis is confirmed by introducing
defined roughness to a mica surface.
