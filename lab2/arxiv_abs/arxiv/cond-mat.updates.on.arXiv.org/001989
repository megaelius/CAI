The generation of thermopower in a miniaturized device modeled as a channel connected to reservoirs/contacts
maintained at different temperatures is studied in this work. The left reservoir is also coupled
to a periodic THz driving source leading to a rearrangement of its internal energy levels. The modified
levels are determined using Floquet theory that governs the dynamics of a periodic Hamiltonian.
The starting point for the presented thermopower calculations (mirrored in the related thermal
gradient controlled current) is the Landauer formula rooted in the transmission formalism. Primarily,
we show that while thermally activated electrons can be pumped from the hot reservoir into the cold
side as a straightforward manifestation of the Seebeck effect through a difference in their respective
Fermi levels, the quantum of charge flow increases in presence of the periodic perturbation. We
explain this phenomenon by noting how the periodic driving makes available a greater number of states
in the left reservoir that are able to inject electrons into the channel. The calculations also uncover
a useful feature whereby the strength of such a thermally-pumped current is amenable through a joint
control of the amplitude and frequency of the signal, offering an additional experimentally-adjustable
tool to regulate their flow. The calculated results are shown for two classes of materials defined
by prototypical linear and quadratic dispersion, with the former capable of furnishing a larger
current by virtue of higher available density-of-modes. We close by pointing out possible improvements
to the calculation by accounting for dissipative effects in the channel.
