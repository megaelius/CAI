We study normal diffusive and subdiffusive processes in a harmonic potential (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process) on a uniformly growing/contracting domain. Our starting point is a recently derived fractional
Fokker-Planck equation, which covers both the case of Brownian diffusion and the case of a subdiffusive
Continuous-Time Random Walk (CTRW). We find a high sensitivity of the random walk properties to
the details of the domain growth rate, which gives rise to a variety of regimes with extremely different
behaviors. At the origin of this rich phenomenology is the fact that the walkers still move while
they wait to jump, since they are dragged by the deterministic drift arising from the domain growth.
Thus, the increasingly long waiting times associated with the ageing of the subdiffusive CTRW imply
that, in the time interval between two consecutive jumps, the walkers might travel over much longer
distances than in the normal diffusive case. This gives rise to seemingly counterintuitive effects.
For example, on a static domain, both Brownian diffusion and subdiffusive CTRWs yield a stationary
particle distribution with finite width when a harmonic potential is at play, thus indicating a
confinement of the diffusing particle. However, for a sufficiently fast growing/contracting
domain, this qualitative behavior breaks down, and differences between the Brownian case and the
subdiffusive case are found. In the case of Brownian particles, a sufficiently fast exponential
domain growth is needed to break the confinement induced by the harmonic force; in contrast, for
subdiffusive particles such a breakdown may already take place for a sufficiently fast power-law
domain growth. Our analytic and numerical results for both types of diffusion are fully confirmed
by random walk simulations.
