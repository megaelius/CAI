The competition, coexistence and cooperation of various orders in low-dimensional materials
like spin, charge, topological orders and charge-density-wave has been one of the most intriguing
issues in condensed matter physics. In particular, layered transition metal dichalcogenides
provide an ideal platform for studying such an interplay with a notable case of 1${T}$-TaS$_{2}$
featuring Mott-insulating ground state, charge-density-wave, spin frustration and emerging
superconductivity together. We investigated local electronic states of Se-substituted 1${T}$-TaS$_{2}$
by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), where superconductivity emerges
from the unique Mott-CDW state. Spatially resolved STS measurements reveal that an apparent V-shape
pseudogap forms at the Fermi Level (E$_{F}$), with the origin of the electronic states splitting
and transformation from the Mott states, and the CDW gaps are largely preserved. The formation of
the pseudogap has little correlation to the variation of local Se concentration, but appears to
be a global characteristics. Furthermore, the correlation length of local density of states (LDOS)
diverges at the Fermi energy and decays rapidly at high energies. The spatial correlation shows
a power-law decay close to the Fermi energy. Our statistics analysis of the LDOS indicates that our
system exhibits weak multifractal behavior of the wave functions. These findings strongly support
a correlated metallic state induced by disorder in our system, which provides an new insight into
the novel mechanism of emerging superconductivity in the two-dimensional correlated electronic
systems.
