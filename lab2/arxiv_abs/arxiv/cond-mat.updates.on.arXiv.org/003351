Our density functional study reveals a peculiar relation between the normalized Th content i.e.
Th/(U+Th) and the hydrostatic pressure enforcing zircon to reidite type transition in uranothorite
solid solution. We found that the transition pressure exhibits a minimum when Th/(U+Th) = 0.50 i.e.
when the unit cell contains equal amount of U and Th. Any change in normalized Th content, as we move
towards the U and Th end-members of the series, shows a significant jump in zircon-reidite transition
pressure. In order to explain this behavior, we proposed a novel method of quantifying the distortions
of U/Th-coordination polyhedra which manifest themselves as a triangular dodecahedron or snub-disphenoid.
We have theoretically defined two parameters: one related to the two geometrically different U/Th-O
bond lengths, having a fixed ratio between them for regular triangular dodecahedra irrespective
of the volume and the other with three kinds of O-U-O and O-Th-O bond angles with multiplicities of
2, 4 and 12, respectively. The bond angle distortion for both U and Th-polyhedra were found to show
a maximum in zircon phase and a minimum in reidite phase corresponding to Th/(U+Th) = 0.5. Since,
the difference in angular distortion is minimum in case of Th/(U+Th) = 0.5, a lesser hydrostatic
pressure is capable of triggering the transition, compared to the other members of this series.
The bond length distortion is also characterized by a maximum in the reidite phase at the equal concentration
of U and Th. Our finding is also complemented by the minimum compressibility observed in the zircon
phase when the atomic percentage of U and Th are equal.
