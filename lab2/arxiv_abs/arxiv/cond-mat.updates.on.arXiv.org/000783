We performed simulations for solid molecular hydrogen at high pressures (250GPa$\leq$P$\leq$500GPa)
along two isotherms at T=200 K (phases III and VI) and at T=414 K (phase IV). At T=200K we considered
likely candidates for phase III, the C2c and Cmca12 structures, while at T=414K in phase IV we studied
the Pc48 structure. We employed both Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo (CEIMC) and Path Integral
Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the vdW-DF approximation.
The comparison between the two methods allows us to address the question of the accuracy of the xc
approximation of DFT for thermal and quantum protons without recurring to perturbation theories.
In general, we find that atomic and molecular fluctuations in PIMD are larger than in CEIMC which
suggests that the potential energy surface from vdW-DF is less structured than the one from Quantum
Monte Carlo. We find qualitatively different behaviors for systems prepared in the C2c structure
for increasing pressure. Within PIMD the C2c structure is dynamically partially stable for P$\leq$250GPa
only: it retains the symmetry of the molecular centers but not the molecular orientation; at intermediate
pressures it develops layered structures like Pbcn or Ibam and transforms to the metallic Cmca-4
structure at P$\geq$450GPa. Instead, within CEIMC, the C2c structure is found to be dynamically
stable at least up to 450GPa; at increasing pressure the molecular bond length increases and the
nuclear correlation decreases. For the other two structures the two methods are in qualitative
agreement although quantitative differences remain. We discuss various structural properties
and the electrical conductivity. We find these structures become conducting around 350GPa but
the metallic Drude-like behavior is reached only at around 500GPa, consistent with recent experimental
claims.
