We present a new Higgsless model of superconductivity, inspired from anyon superconductivity
but P- and T-invariant and generalizable to any dimension. While the original anyon superconductivity
mechanism was based on incompressible quantum Hall fluids as average field states, our mechanism
involves topological insulators as average field states. In D space dimensions it involves a (D-1)-form
fictitious pseudovector gauge field which originates from the condensation of topological defects
in compact low-energy effective BF theories. In the average field approximation, the corresponding
uniform emergent charge creates a gap for the (D-2)-dimensional branes via the Magnus force, the
dual of the Lorentz force. One particular combination of intrinsic and emergent charge fluctuations
that leaves the total charge distribution invariant constitutes an isolated gapless mode leading
to superfluidity. The remaining massive modes organise themselves into a D-dimensional charged,
massive vector. There is no massive Higgs scalar as there is no local order parameter. When electromagnetism
is switched on, the photon acquires mass by the topological BF mechanism. Although the charge of
the gapless mode (2) and the topological order (4) are the same as those of the standard Higgs model,
the two models of superconductivity are clearly different since the origins of the gap, reflected
in the high-energy sectors are totally different. In 2D this type of superconductivity is explicitly
realized as global superconductivity in Josephson junction arrays. In 3D this model predicts a
possible phase transition from topological insulators to Higgsless superconductors.
