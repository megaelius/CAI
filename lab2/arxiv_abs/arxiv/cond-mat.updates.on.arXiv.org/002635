The structure of the International Trade Network (ITN), whose nodes and links represent world countries
and their trade relations respectively, affects key economic processes worldwide, including
globalization, economic integration, industrial production, and the propagation of shocks and
instabilities. Characterizing the ITN via a simple yet accurate model is an open problem. The traditional
Gravity Model (GM) successfully reproduces the volume of trade between connected countries, using
macroeconomic properties such as GDP, geographic distance, and possibly other factors. However,
it predicts a network with complete or homogeneous topology, thus failing to reproduce the highly
heterogeneous structure of the ITN. On the other hand, recent maximum-entropy network models successfully
reproduce the complex topology of the ITN, but provide no information about trade volumes. Here
we integrate these two currently incompatible approaches via the introduction of an Enhanced Gravity
Model (EGM) of trade. The EGM is the simplest model combining the GM with the network approach within
a maximum-entropy framework. Via a unified and principled mechanism that is transparent enough
to be generalized to any economic network, the EGM provides a new econometric framework wherein
trade probabilities and trade volumes can be separately controlled by any combination of dyadic
and country-specific macroeconomic variables. The model successfully reproduces both the global
topology and the local link weights of the ITN, parsimoniously reconciling the conflicting approaches.
It also indicates that the probability that any two countries trade a certain volume should follow
a geometric or exponential distribution with an additional point mass at zero volume.
