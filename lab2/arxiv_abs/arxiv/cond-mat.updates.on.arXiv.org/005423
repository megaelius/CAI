Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid systems have outstanding potential for emerging high-performance
nanoelectronics and quantum devices. However, critical to their successful application is the
fabrication of high-quality and reproducible semiconductor-superconductor interfaces. Here,
we realize and measure axial Al-Ge-Al nanowire heterostructures with atomically precise interfaces,
enwrapped by an ultrathin epitaxial Si layer further denoted as Al-Ge/Si-Al nanowire heterostructures.
The heterostructures were synthesized by a thermally induced exchange reaction of single-crystalline
Ge/Si core/shell nanowires and lithographically defined Al contact pads. Applying this heterostructure
formation scheme enables self-aligned quasi one-dimensional crystalline Al leads contacting
ultrascaled Ge/Si segments with contact transparencies greater than 96%. Integration into back-gated
field-effect devices and continuous scaling beyond lithographic limitations allows us to exploit
the full potential of the highly transparent contacts to the 1D hole gas at the Ge-Si interface. This
leads to the observation of ballistic transport as well as quantum confinement effects up to temperatures
of 150 K. Low-temperature measurements reveal proximity-induced superconductivity in the Ge/Si
core/shell nanowires. The realization of a Josephson field-effect transistor allows us to study
the subgap structure caused by multiple Andreev reflections. Most importantly, the absence of
a quantum dot regime indicates a hard superconducting gap originating from the highly transparent
contacts to the 1D hole gas, which is potentially interesting for the study of Majorana zero modes.
Moreover, underlining the importance of the proposed thermally induced Al-Ge/Si-Al heterostructure
formation technique, our system could contribute to the development of key components of quantum
computing such as gatemon or transmon qubits
