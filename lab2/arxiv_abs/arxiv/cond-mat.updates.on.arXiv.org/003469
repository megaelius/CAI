Superconductivity in two-dimensional (2D) materials is a hot topic of research today owing to their
promising technological applications. The present work reports superconductivity in a new 2D
Nb$_2$C MXene with highest critical temperature of 12.5 K attained till now. We have synthesized
two-dimensional Nb$_2$C MXene from its Nb$_2$AlC MAX phase after systematically optimizing the
chemical etching process. The X-ray diffraction showed a clear (002) peak indicating the successful
formation of MXene as well as a significant increase in the c-lattice parameter from 13.83{\AA}
to 22.72{\AA} which is indicated as the delamination of Nb$_2$C MXene sheet as was evident from the
morphological study using scanning electron microscopy. The magnetic measurement was done using
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The ZFC-FC measurements show a clear transition
from normal state to the superconducting state at the superconducting onset transition temperature
Tconset (K) ~ 12.5 K. The M-H loops at low temperature show significant broadening that indicate
better connectivity of the superconducting grains. The experimental Hc1, Hc2 vs. Temperature
fits well in accordance with the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory indicating the superconducting nature
of our Nb$_2$C MXene. The reasons for existence of highest Tc in our Nb$_2$C MXene is the presence
of strong-electron phonon interaction and the large density of states above Fermi level. The present
work is a significant advancement in the field of two-dimensional superconductivity which opens
up new door towards the research and potential applications of two-dimensional MXene.
