Predicting the microstructure during selective laser sintering (SLS) is of great interests, which
can compliment the current time and cost expensive trial-and-error principle with an efficient
computational design tool. However, it still remains a great challenge to simulate the microstructure
evolution during SLS due to the complex underlying physical phenomena. In this work, we present
a three-dimensional finite element phase-field simulation of the SLS single scan, and revealed
the process-microstructure relation. We use a thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal
phase-field model including various physics (i.e. partial melting, pore structure evolution,
diffusion, grain boundary migration, and coupled heat transfer), and interaction of powder bed
and laser power absorption. The initial powder bed is generated by the discrete element method.
Moreover, we present in the manuscript a novel algorithm analogy to minimum coloring problem and
managed to simulate a system of 200 grains with grain tracking using as low as 8 non-conserved order
parameters. The developed model is shown to capture interesting phenomena which are not accessible
to the conventional isothermal model. Specifically, applying the model to SLS of the stainless
steel 316L powder, we identify the influences of laser power and scanning speed on microstructural
indicators, including the porosity, surface morphology, temperature profile, grain geometry,
and densification. We further validate the first-order kinetics during the porosity evolution,
and demonstrate the applicability of the developed model in predicting the linkage of densification
factor to the specific energy input during SLS.
