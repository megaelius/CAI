In the pursuit of accurate descriptions of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT) has been an invaluable tool for elucidating the spectral properties and
quantum phases of both phenomenological models and ab initio descriptions of real materials. Key
to the DMFT process is the self-consistent map of the original system into an Anderson impurity model,
the ground state of which is computed using an impurity solver. The power of the method is thus limited
by the complexity of the impurity model the solver can handle. Simulating realistic systems generally
requires many correlated sites. By adapting the recently proposed adaptive sampling configuration
interaction (ASCI) method as an impurity solver, we enable much more efficient zero temperature
DMFT simulations. The key feature of the ASCI method is that it selects only the most relevant Hilbert
space degrees of freedom to describe the ground state. This reduces the numerical complexity of
the calculation, which will allow us to pursue future DMFT simulations with more correlated impurity
sites than in previous works. Here we present the ASCI-DMFT method and example calculations on the
one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models that exemplify its efficient convergence
and timing properties. We show that the ASCI approach is several orders of magnitude faster than
the current best published ground state DMFT simulations, which allows us to study the bath discretization
error in simulations with small clusters, as well as to address cluster sizes beyond the current
state of the art. Our approach can also be adapted for other embedding methods such as density matrix
embedding theory and self-energy embedding theory.
