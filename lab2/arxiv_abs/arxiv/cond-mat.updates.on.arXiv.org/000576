For over 30 years, mode-coupling theory (MCT) has been the de facto theoretic description of dense
fluids and the liquid-glass transition. MCT, however, is limited by its ad hoc construction and
lacks a mechanism to institute corrections. We use recent results from a new theoretical framework--developed
from first principles via a self-consistent perturbation expansion in terms of an effective two-body
potential--to numerically explore the kinetics of systems of classical particles, specifically
hard spheres obeying Smoluchowski dynamics. We present here a full solution to the kinetic equation
governing the density-density time correlation function and show that the function exhibits the
characteristic two-step decay of supercooled fluids and an ergodic-nonergodic transition to
a dynamically-arrested state. Unlike many previous numerical studies and experiments, we have
access to the full time and wavenumber range of the correlation function and can track the solution
unprecedentedly close to the transition, covering nearly 15 decades of time. Using asymptotic
approximation techniques developed for MCT, we fit the solution to predicted forms and extract
critical parameters. Our solution shows a transition at packing fraction $\eta^*=0.60149761(10)$--consistent
with previous static solutions under this theory and with comparable colloidal suspension experiments--and
the behavior in the $\beta$-relaxation regime is fit to power-law decays with critical exponents
$a=0.375(3)$ and $b=0.8887(4)$, and with $\lambda=0.5587(18)$. For the $\alpha$-relaxation
of the ergodic phase, we find a power-law divergence of the time scale $\tau_{\alpha}$ as we approach
the transition. Through these results, we establish that this new theory is able to reproduce the
salient features of MCT, but has the advantages of a first principles derivation and a clear mechanism
for making systematic improvements.
