In this work we give a comprehensive derivation of an exact and numerically feasible method to perform
ab-initio calculations of quantum particles interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field.
We present a hierachy of density-functional-type theories that describe the interaction of charged
particles with photons and introduce the appropriate Kohn-Sham schemes. We show how the evolution
of a system described by quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb gauge is uniquely determined by its
initial state and two reduced quantities. These two fundamental observables, the polarization
of the Dirac field and the vector potential of the photon field, can be calculated by solving two coupled,
non-linear evolution equations without the need to explicitly determine the (numerically infeasible)
many-body wave function of the coupled quantum system. To find reliable approximations to the implicit
functionals we present the according Kohn-Sham construction. In the non-relativistic limit this
density-functional-type theory of quantum electrodynamics reduces to the density-functional
reformulation of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, which is based on the current density of the electrons
and the vector potential of the photon field. By making further approximations, e.g. restricting
the allowed modes of the photon field, we derive further density functional-type theories of coupled
matter-photon systems for the corresponding approximate Hamiltonians. In the limit of only two
sites and one mode we deduce the according effective theory for the two-site Hubbard model coupled
to one photonic mode. This model system is used to illustrate the basic ideas of a density-functional
reformulation in great detail and we present the exact Kohn-Sham potentials for our coupled matter-photon
model system.
