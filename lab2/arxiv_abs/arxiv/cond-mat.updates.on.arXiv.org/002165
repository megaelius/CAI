We report on our systematic attempts at finding local interactions for which the lowest-Landau-level
projected composite-fermion wave functions are the unique zero energy ground states. For this
purpose, we study in detail the simplest non-trivial system beyond the Laughlin states, namely
bosons at filling $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ and identify local constraints among clusters of particles
in the ground state. By explicit calculation, we show that no Hamiltonian up to (and including) four
particle interactions produces this state as the exact ground state, and speculate that this remains
true even when interaction terms involving greater number of particles are included. Surprisingly,
we can identify an interaction, which imposes an energetic penalty for a specific entangled configuration
of four particles with relative angular momentum of $6\hbar$, that produces a unique zero energy
solution (as we have confirmed for up to 12 particles). This state, referred to as the $\lambda$-state,
is not identical to the projected composite-fermion state, but the following facts suggest that
the two might be topologically equivalent: the two sates have a high overlap; they have the same root
partition; the quantum numbers for their neutral excitations are identical; and the quantum numbers
for the quasiparticle excitations also match. On the quasihole side, we find that even though the
quantum numbers of the lowest energy states agree with the prediction from the composite-fermion
theory, these states are not separated from the others by a clearly identifiable gap. This prevents
us from making a conclusive claim regarding the topological equivalence of the $\lambda$ state
and the composite-fermion state. Our study illustrates how new candidate states can be identified
from constraining selected many particle configurations and it would be interesting to pursue
their topological classification.
