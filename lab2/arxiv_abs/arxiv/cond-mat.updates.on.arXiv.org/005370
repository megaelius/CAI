Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) displays a host of correlated electronic phases associated with
the formation of flat electronic bands near an interlayer "magic angle" (MA) of 1.1 degrees. Intralayer
lattice reconstruction, which involves local rotations with consequent localized strain, and
symmetry breaking due to extrinsic heterostrain have significant implications for electronic
behavior at the MA. Although reconstruction and strain are therefore fundamental to the properties
of TBG, directly mapping the reconstruction mechanics in the MA regime has been elusive and the strain
tensor fields of TBG have not been measured. Here, we introduce Bragg interferometry, based on four-dimensional
scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), to capture the atomic displacement fields
of TBG with twist angles ranging from 0.1 to 1.6 degrees. Sub-nanometer resolution allows us to image
atomic reconstruction in MA-TBG and resolve twist angle disorder at the level of individual moir\'e
domains. We quantitatively map the strain tensor fields and uncover that reconstruction proceeds
in two distinct regimes depending on the twist angle -- in contrast to previous models depicting
a single continuous process -- and we distinguish the contributions of these regimes to the band
structure. Further, we find that over a twist angle range encompassing the MA, applied heterostrain
accumulates anisotropically in saddle point (SP) regions to generate distinctive striped strain
phases. Our results thus establish the reconstruction mechanics underpinning the twist angle
dependent electronic behavior of TBG, and provide a new framework for directly visualizing strain
and reconstruction in other moir\'e materials.
