We study theoretically shear banding in soft glassy materials subject to large amplitude time-periodic
shear flows, considering separately the protocols of large amplitude oscillatory shear strain,
large amplitude square or triangular or sawtooth strain rate, and large amplitude oscillatory
shear stress. In each case, we find shear banding to be an important part of the material's flow response
for a broad range of values of the frequency $\omega$ and amplitude of the imposed oscillation. Crucially,
and highly counterintuitively, in the glass phase this persists even to the lowest frequencies
accessible numerically (that seems consistent with it persisting even when $\omega\to 0$), although
the soft glassy rheology model we use has an underlying monotonic constitutive curve of shear stress
as a function of shear rate, and is therefore unable to support shear banding as its steady state response
at constant shear rate. We attribute this to the repeated competition, within each flow cycle, of
glassy aging and flow rejuvenation. Besides reporting significant banding in the glass phase,
where the flow curve has a yield stress, we also observe it at noise temperatures just above the glass
point, where the flow curve is of power law fluid form. Thus, our results suggest a predisposition
to shear banding in flows of even extremely slow time-variation, for both aging yield stress fluids,
and for power law fluids with sluggish relaxation timescales. We show that shear banding can have
a pronounced effect on the shape of the Lissajous-Bowditch curves that are commonly used to fingerprint
complex fluids rheologically. We therefore counsel caution in seeking to compute such curves calculations
that impose upfront a homogeneous shear flow, discarding the possibility of banding. We also analyze
the stress response to the imposed strain waveforms in terms of a `sequence of physical processes'.
