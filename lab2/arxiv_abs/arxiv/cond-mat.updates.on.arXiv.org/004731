Inorganic-organic interfaces are important for enhancing the power conversion efficiency of
silicon-based solar cells through singlet exciton fission (SF). We elucidated the structure of
the first monolayers of tetracene (Tc), a SF molecule, on hydrogen-passivated Si(111) [H-Si(111)]
and hydrogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H) by combining near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
(NEXAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments with density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. For samples grown at or below substrate temperatures of 265 K, the resulting
ultrathin Tc films are dominated by almost upright-standing molecules. The molecular arrangement
is very similar to the Tc bulk phase, with only slightly higher average angle between the conjugated
molecular plane normal and the surface normal ($\alpha$) around 77{\deg}. Judging from carbon
K-edge X-ray absorption spectra, the orientation of the Tc molecules are almost identical when
grown on H-Si(111) and a-Si:H substrates as well as for (sub)mono- to several-monolayer coverages.
Annealing to room temperature, however, changes the film structure towards a smaller $\alpha$
of about 63{\deg}. A detailed DFT-assisted analysis suggests that this structural transition
is correlated with a lower packing density and requires a well-chosen amount of thermal energy.
Therefore, we attribute the resulting structure to a distinct monolayer configuration that features
less inclined, but still well-ordered molecules. The larger overlap with the substrate wavefunctions
makes this arrangement attractive for an optimized interfacial electron transfer in SF-assisted
silicon solar cells.
