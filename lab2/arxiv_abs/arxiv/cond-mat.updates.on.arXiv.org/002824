Graphene is an innovative nanomaterial, made of two-dimensional honeycomb-like carbon lattice,
with potential in many different applications. Studying the behaviour of graphene-related materials
(GRMs) in biological systems is, therefore, crucial to assess possible side effects. In this work
is studied the biotransformation and biological impact of few-layer pristine graphene (FLG) and
graphene oxide (GOX), following ingestion as exposure route. To mimic FLG and GOX ingestion, an
in vitro digestion assay based on a standardized operating procedure (SOP) is applied. The assay
simulates the human ingestion of GRMs during their dynamic passage through the different environments
of gastrointestinal (GI) tract (salivary, gastric, intestinal). Physical-chemical changes
of GRMs during the digestion process are assessed through a detailed Raman spectroscopy characterization.
Moreover, the effect of chronic exposure to digested GRMs on integrity and functionality of an in
vitro model of intestinal barrier is also determined according to a second SOP. Our results showed
that the FLG and GOX nanoflakes aggregates after experiencing the passage through the different
environments of GI tract, with evident doping effects, due to the interaction of GRMs with digestive
juice components and the strong pH variations. Interestingly, neither structural changes nor
degradation of the nanomaterials is observed, suggesting that GRMs are bio-persistent nanomaterials
when administered by oral route. Chronic exposure to digested GRMs does not affect intestinal barrier
integrity and is not associated to inflammation and cytotoxicity, though possible long-term adverse
effects cannot be ruled out, due to the observed bio-durability of the materials.
