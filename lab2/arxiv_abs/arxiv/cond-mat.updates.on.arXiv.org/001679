Graphite under high magnetic field exhibits consecutive metal-insulator (MI) transitions as
well as re-entrant insulator-metal (IM) transition in the quasi-quantum limit at low temperature.
We employ models with electron pocket(s) and hole pocket(s), to construct a bosonized Hamiltonian
that comprises of displacement field along the field direction and its conjugate fields. Using
a renormalization group argument, we show that there exists a critical interaction strength above
which a umklapp term becomes relevant and the system enters excitonic insulator phase with a long-range
ordering of spin superfluid phase field ("spin nematic excitonic insulator"). When a pair of electron
and hole pockets get smaller in size, a quantum fluctuation of the spin superfluid phase becomes
progressively large and eventually distabilizes the excitonic insulator phases, resulting in
the re-entrant IM transition. The strength of the quantum fluctuation is quantified by the Luttinger
parameters of the pockets, while the Luttinger parameters are shown to be related with the critical
exponent of the $T=0$ IM (and also MI) transition point. We further show that the exponent can be experimentally
determined by an infrared optical spectroscopy. This lets us propose a "test experiment" for our
theory of the re-entrant IM transition. One of the two spin nematic excitonic insulators proposed
in this paper can be regarded as a 3-dimensional topological insulator under the magnetic field.
We argue that non-zero topological number defined for a mean-field bulk Hamiltonian endows with
its side surfaces [surfaces that are parallel to the field] a 2-dimensional helical surface state
with a gapless Dirac cone. We discuss field- and temperature-dependences of in-plane resistivity
by surface transports via surface states and its coupling with gapless Goldstone modes associated
with the spin nematic orderings.
