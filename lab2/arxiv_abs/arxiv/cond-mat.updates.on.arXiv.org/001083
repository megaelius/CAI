This work explores a nontrivial temperature behavior of the carriers concentration, which governs
graphene channel conductance in the nano-structure "graphene channel on ferroelectric substrate"
that is a basic element for FETs in non-volatile memory units of new generation. We revealed the transition
from a single to double antiferroelectric-like hysteresis loop of the concentration voltage dependence
that happens with the temperature increase and then exist in a wide temperature range (from 350 to
500 K). Unexpectedly we revealed the double loops of polarization and concentration can have irregular
shape that remains irregular as long as the computation takes place, and the voltage position of
the different features (jumps, secondary maxima, etc.) changes from one period to another, leading
to the impression of quasi-chaotic behavior. It appeared that these effects originate from the
nonlinear screening of ferroelectric polarization by graphene carriers, as well as it is conditioned
by the temperature evolution of the domain structure kinetics in ferroelectric substrate. The
nonlinearity rules the voltage behavior of polarization screening by graphene 2D-layer and at
the same time induces the motion of separated domain walls accompanied by the motion of p-n junction
along the graphene channel (2D-analog of Hann effect). Since the domain walls structure, period
and kinetics can be controlled by varying the temperature, we concluded that the considered nano-structures
based on graphene-on-ferroelectric are promising for the fabrication of new generation of modulators
based on the graphene p-n junctions.
