Standard models of reaction kinetics in condensed materials rely on the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution
for the population of reactants at the top of the free energy barrier separating them from the products.
While energy dissipation and quantum effects at the barrier top can potentially affect the transmission
coefficient entering the rate preexponential factor, much stronger dynamical effects on the reaction
barrier are caused by the breakdown of ergodicity for populating the reaction barrier (violation
of the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics). When the spectrum of medium modes coupled to the reaction coordinate
includes fluctuations slower than the reaction rate, such nuclear motions dynamically freeze
on the reaction time-scale and do not contribute to the activation barrier. Here we consider the
consequences of this scenario for electrode reactions in slowly relaxing media. Changing electrode
overpotential speeds electrode electron transfer up, potentially cutting through the spectrum
of nuclear modes coupled to the reaction coordinate. The reorganization energy of electrochemical
electron transfer becomes a function of the electrode overpotential, switching between the thermodynamic
value at low rates to the nonergodic limit at higher rates. The sharpness of this transition depends
of the relaxation spectrum of the medium. The reorganization energy experiences a sudden drop with
increasing overpotential for a medium with a Debye relaxation, but becomes a much shallower function
of the overpotential for media with stretched exponential dynamics. The latter scenario characterizes
electron transfer in ionic liquids. The analysis of electrode reactions in room-temperature ionic
liquids shows that the magnitude of the free energy of nuclear solvation is significantly below
its thermodynamic limit.
