Semiconductor heterostructures based on layered two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMD) interfaced to gallium nitride (GaN) are excellent material systems to realize broadband
light emitters and absorbers. The surface properties of the polar semiconductor, such as GaN are
dominated by interface phonons, thus the optical properties of the vertical heterostructure depend
strongly on the interface exciton-phonon coupling. The origin and activation of different Raman
modes in the heterostructure due to coupling between interfacial phonons and optically generated
carriers in a monolayer MoS2-GaN (0001) heterostructure was observed. This coupling strongly
influences the non-equilibrium absorption properties of MoS2 and the emission properties of both
semiconductors. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the band
alignment of the interface, which revealed a type-I heterostructure. The optical excitation with
interband transition in MoS2 at K-point strongly modulates the C excitonic band in MoS2. The overlap
of absorption and emission bands of GaN with the absorption bands of MoS2 induces the energy and charge
transfer across the interface with an optical excitation at {\Gamma}-point. A strong modulation
of the excitonic absorption states is observed in MoS2 on GaN substrate with transient optical pump-probe
spectroscopy. The interaction of carriers with phonons and defect states leads to the enhanced
and blue shifted emission in MoS2 on GaN substrate. Our results demonstrate the relevance of interface
coupling between phonons and carriers for the development of optical and electronic applications.
