We study the orientational ordering in systems of self-propelled particles with selective interactions.
To introduce the selectivity we augment the standard Vicsek model with a bounded-confidence collision
rule: a given particle only aligns to neighbors who have directions quite similar to its own. Neighbors
whose directions deviate more than a fixed restriction angle $\alpha$ are ignored. The collective
dynamics of this systems is studied by agent-based simulations and kinetic mean field theory. We
demonstrate that the reduction of the restriction angle leads to a critical noise amplitude decreasing
monotonically with that angle, turning into a power law with exponent 3/2 for small angles. Moreover,
for small system sizes we show that upon decreasing the restriction angle, the kind of the transition
to polar collective motion changes from continuous to discontinuous. Thus, an apparent tricritical
point is identified and calculated analytically. We also find that at very small interaction angles
the polar ordered phase becomes unstable with respect to the apolar phase. We show that the mean-field
kinetic theory permits stationary nematic states below a restriction angle of $0.681 \pi$. We calculate
the critical noise, at which the disordered state bifurcates to a nematic state, and find that it
is always smaller than the threshold noise for the transition from disorder to polar order. The disordered-nematic
transition features two tricritical points: At low and high restriction angle the transition is
discontinuous but continuous at intermediate $\alpha$. We generalize our results to systems that
show fragmentation into more than two groups and obtain scaling laws for the transition lines and
the corresponding tricritical points. A novel numerical method to evaluate the nonlinear Fredholm
integral equation for the stationary distribution function is also presented.
