Measurements of current-voltage characteristics from ideal carbon nanotube (CNT) field electron
emitters of small apex radius have shown that these emitters can exhibit a linear Fowler-Nordheim
(FN) plot [e.g., Dean and Chalamala, Appl. Phys. Lett., 76, 375, 2000]. From such a plot, a constant
(voltage-independent) characteristic field enhancement factor (FEF) can be deduced. Over fifteen
years later, this experimental result has not yet been convincingly retrieved from first-principles
electronic structure calculations, or more generally from quantum mechanics (QM). On the contrary,
several QM calculations have deduced that the characteristic FEF should be a function of the macroscopic
field applied to the CNT. This apparent contradiction between experiment and QM theory has been
an unexplained feature of CNT emission science, and has raised doubts about the ability of existing
QM models to satisfactorily describe experimental CNT emission behavior. In this work we demonstrate,
by means of a density functional theory analysis of single-walled CNTs "floating" in an applied
macroscopic field, the following significant result. This is that agreement between experiment,
classical-conductor CNT models and QM calculations can be achieved if the latter are used to calculate
(from the "real" total-charge-density distributions initially obtained) the distributions
of $\textit{induced}$ charge-density, induced local fields and induced local FEFs. The present
work confirms, more reliably and in significantly greater detail than in earlier work on a different
system, that this finding applies to the common "post-on-a-conducing plane" situation of CNT field
electron emission. This finding also brings out various further theoretical questions that need
to be explored.
