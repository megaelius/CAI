Photo-induced phase transitions have been intensively studied owing to the ability to control
a material of interest in a flexible manner, which can induce exotic phases unable to be attained
at equilibrium. The key mechanisms are still under debate, and how the couplings between the electron,
lattice, and spin degrees of freedom are evolving during photo-induced phase transitions has currently
been a central issue. However, the measurements for each degree in the ultrafast timescale require
distinctively different and state-of-the-art techniques, such as terahertz spectroscopy for
low frequency conductivity, time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for electronic
band structures, and time-resolved X-ray measurements for crystal structures, which prevents
directly revealing the connections between each degree in the nonequilibrium state. Here, we develop
a new analysis method, frequency-domain angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, to gain
precise insight into electron-phonon couplings in photo-induced insulator-to-metal transitions.
Regarding the electron-phonon coupling in the photo-induced insulator-to-metal transition
for Ta2NiSe5, we find that multiple coherent phonons are generated as a result of displacive excitations,
and they show band-selective coupling to the electrons. The lattice modulation corresponding
to the specific phonon mode, where Ta lattice is sheared along the a-axis, is the most relevant for
the formation of excitonic insulator phase and is the most effective to modulate the valence band
top in the photo-induced semimetallic phase. Furthermore, we developed a new theoretical method
to analyse the mode and momentum selective electron-phonon couplings based on the density functional
theory. Our novel analysis method can pave the way for quantum engineering utilizing correlations
between electrons and phonons.
