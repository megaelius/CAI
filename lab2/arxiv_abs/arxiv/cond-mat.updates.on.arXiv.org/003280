Studying thermal conduction in low-dimensional non-integrable systems is necessary for understanding
the microscopic origin of macroscopic irreversible behavior and Fourier's law of heat conduction.
Two distinct types of low-dimensional thermal conduction models have been proposed in the literature
-- ones that display normal thermal conduction (like the $\Phi^4$ chain) and others that show anomalous
thermal conduction (like the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain). However, in both these models nothing prevents
two nearby particles from crossing each other. In this manuscript, we introduce a modification
in the Hamiltonian of the traditional $\Phi^4$ chain (henceforth called $\Phi^{4C}$ model) through
soft-sphere potential that prevents two particles from crossing. The proposed model is then subjected
to thermal conduction by keeping its two ends at different temperatures using Nos\'e-Hoover thermostats.
Equations of motion, derived from the Hamiltonian, are solved using $4^{th}$ order Runge-Kutta
method for 1 billion time-steps, where each time-step is of 0.0005 time units. Averages have been
computed using the last 750 million time-steps. Our results indicate that the boundary effects
due to contact with the thermostats is minimized in the $\Phi^{4C}$ model as compared to the traditional
$\Phi^4$ chain, ensuring a smoother temperature distribution across the chain. Further, the rate
of convergence of heat flux is much faster in the $\Phi^{4C}$ chain vis-\'a-vis the traditional
$\Phi^4$ chain. However, the absolute value of heat flux is much smaller in the $\Phi^{4C}$ chain.
These results suggest that collision plays an important role in quickly ensuring that a steady-state
is reached and diminishing the magnitude of heat flux. Interestingly enough, collision does not
significantly alter the diffusive properties of the chain, irrespective of the temperature gradient
within the chain.
