Single crystals of RCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ (R = Y, La-Nd, Sm-Tm) were grown using a self-flux method and
were characterized by room-temperature powder x-ray diffraction; anisotropic, temperature
and field dependent magnetization; temperature and field dependent, in-plane resistivity; and
specific heat measurements. In this series, the majority of the moment-bearing members order antiferromagnetically;
YCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ and LaCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ are non-moment-bearing. Ce is trivalent in CeCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$
at high temperatures, and exhibits an enhanced electronic specific heat coefficient due to Kondo
effect at low temperatures. In addition, CeCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ shows two low-temperature anomalies
in temperature-dependent magnetization and specific heat measurements. Three members (R = Tb-Ho)
have multiple phase transitions above 1.8 K. Eu appears to be divalent with total angular momentum
L = 0. Both EuCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ and GdCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ manifest essentially isotropic paramagnetic
properties consistent with J = S = 7/2. Clear magnetic anisotropy for rare-earth members with finite
L was observed, with ErCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ and TmCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ manifesting planar anisotropy
and the rest members manifesting axial anisotropy. The experimentally estimated crystal electric
field (CEF) parameters B$_{2}^{0}$ were calculated from the anisotropic paramagnetic $\theta_{ab}$
and $\theta_{c}$ values and follow a trend that agrees well with theoretical predictions. The ordering
temperatures, T$_{N}$, as well as the polycrystalline averaged paramagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature,
$\Theta_{avg}$, for the heavy rare-earth members deviate from the de Gennes scaling, as the magnitude
of both are the highest for Tb, which is sometimes seen for extremely axial systems. Except for SmCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$,
metamagnetic transitions were observed at 1.8 K for all members that ordered antiferromagnetically.
