What does correlation energy really mean? Density functional theory (DFT) enumerates the total
energy of electrons into five contributions: 1) the kinetic energy as electrons move in space, 2)
the potential energy that binds electrons to nuclei, 3) the Coulomb repulsion energy as electrons
repel each other, 4) the exchange energy due to the Pauli exclusion principle, and 5) the correlation
energy. Although DFT has become the most widely used theory in describing behaviors of molecules
and bulk material, an intuitive meaning of the fifth contribution has remained elusive for over
90 years in the history of quantum mechanics. Here, we hypothesize that the correlation energy is
the energy that tries to keep electrons in order, evenly distributed in a uniform fashion. As such,
the energy assumes its maximum value when a gradient of density is zero. As the gradient increases,
the energy is diminished by a gradient suppressing factor, designed to attenuate the energy from
its maximum value similar to the shape of a bell curve. Based on this hypothesis we constructed a very
simple mathematical formula that predicted the correlation energy of atoms and molecules. Combined
with our proposed exchange energy functional, we calculated the correlation energies, the total
energies, and the ionization energies of test atoms and molecules; and despite the unique simplicities,
the functionals' accuracies are in the top tier performance, competitive to the B3LYP, BLYP, PBE,
TPSS, and M11. Therefore, we conclude that, as guided by the simplicities and supported by the accuracies,
the correlation energy is the energy that tries to keep electrons in order, for it favors the uniformity
of the electrons' distribution.
