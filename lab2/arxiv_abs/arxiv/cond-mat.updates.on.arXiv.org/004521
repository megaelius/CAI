In the field of beam physics, two frontier topics have taken center stage due to their potential to
enable new approaches to discovery in a wide swath of science. These areas are: advanced, high gradient
acceleration techniques, and x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). Further, there is intense interest
in the marriage of these two fields, with the goal of producing a very compact XFEL. In this context,
recent advances in high gradient radio-frequency cryogenic copper structure research have opened
the door to the use of surface electric fields between 250 and 500 MV/m. Such an approach is foreseen
to enable a new generation of photoinjectors with six-dimensional beam brightness beyond the current
state-of-the-art by well over an order of magnitude. This advance is an essential ingredient enabling
an ultra-compact XFEL (UC-XFEL). In addition, one may accelerate these bright beams to GeV scale
in less than 10 meters. Such an injector, when combined with inverse free electron laser-based bunching
techniques can produce multi-kA beams with unprecedented beam quality, quantified by ~50 nm-rad
normalized emittances. These beams, when injected into innovative, short-period (1-10 mm) undulators
uniquely enable UC-XFELs having footprints consistent with university-scale laboratories.
We describe the architecture and predicted performance of this novel light source, which promises
photon production per pulse of a few percent of existing XFEL sources. We review implementation
issues including collective beam effects, compact x-ray optics systems, and other relevant technical
challenges. To illustrate the potential of such a light source to fundamentally change the current
paradigm of XFELs with their limited access, we examine possible applications in biology, chemistry,
materials, atomic physics, industry, and medicine which may profit from this new model of performing
XFEL science.
