Identifying the microscopic mechanism for superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene (MATBG) is an outstanding open problem. While MATBG exhibits a rich phase-diagram, driven
partly by the strong interactions relative to the electronic bandwidth, its single-particle properties
are unique and likely play an important role in some of the phenomenological complexity. Some of
the salient features include an electronic bandwidth smaller than the characteristic phonon bandwidth
and a non-trivial structure of the underlying Bloch wavefunctions. We perform a systematic theoretical
study of the cooperative effects due to phonons and plasmons on pairing in order to disentangle the
distinct role played by these modes on superconductivity. We consider a variant of MATBG with an
enlarged number of fermion flavors, $N \gg 1$, where the study of pairing instabilities reduces
to the conventional (weak-coupling) Eliashberg framework. In particular, we show that certain
umklapp processes involving mini-optical phonon modes, which arise physically as a result of the
folding of the original acoustic branch of graphene due to the moir\'e superlattice structure,
contribute significantly towards enhancing pairing. We also investigate the role played by the
dynamics of the screened Coulomb interaction on pairing, which leads to an enhancement in a narrow
window of fillings, and study the effect of external screening due to a metallic gate on superconductivity.
We propose a smoking-gun experiment to detect resonant features associated with the phonon-umklapp
processes in the differential conductance and also discuss experimental implications of a pairing
mechanism relying on plasmons.
