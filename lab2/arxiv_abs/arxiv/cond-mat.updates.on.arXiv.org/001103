We study magnitudes and temperature dependences of the electron-electron and electron-phonon
interaction times which play the dominant role in the formation and relaxation of photon induced
hotspot in two dimensional amorphous WSi films. The time constants are obtained through magnetoconductance
measurements in perpendicular magnetic field in the superconducting fluctuation regime and through
time-resolved photoresponse to optical pulses. The excess magnetoconductivity is interpreted
in terms of the weak-localization effect and superconducting fluctuations. Aslamazov-Larkin,
and Maki-Thompson superconducting fluctuation alone fail to reproduce the magnetic field dependence
in the relatively high magnetic field range when the temperature is rather close to Tc because the
suppression of the electronic density of states due to the formation of short lifetime Cooper pairs
needs to be considered. The time scale {\tau}_i of inelastic scattering is ascribed to a combination
of electron-electron ({\tau}_(e-e)) and electron-phonon ({\tau}_(e-ph)) interaction times,
and a characteristic electron-fluctuation time ({\tau}_(e-fl)), which makes it possible to extract
their magnitudes and temperature dependences from the measured {\tau}_i. The ratio of phonon-electron
({\tau}_(ph-e)) and electron-phonon interaction times is obtained via measurements of the optical
photoresponse of WSi microbridges. Relatively large {\tau}_(e-ph)/{\tau}_(ph-e) and {\tau}_(e-ph)/{\tau}_(e-e)
ratios ensure that in WSi the photon energy is more efficiently confined in the electron subsystem
than in other materials commonly used in the technology of superconducting nanowire single-photon
detectors (SNSPDs). We discuss the impact of interaction times on the hotspot dynamics and compare
relevant metrics of SNSPDs from different materials.
