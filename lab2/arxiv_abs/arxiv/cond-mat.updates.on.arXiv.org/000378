Oxide electronics relies on the availability of epitaxial oxide thin films. The extreme flexibility
of the chemical composition of ABO3 perovskites and the broad spectrum of properties they cover,
inspire the creativity of scientists and place perovskites in the lead of functional materials
for advanced technologies. Moreover, emerging properties are being discovered at interfaces
between distinct perovskites that could not be anticipated on the basis of those of the adjacent
epitaxial layers. All dreamed new prospects require the use of suitable substrates for epitaxial
growth. Perovskite single crystals are the workhorses of this activity and understanding and controlling
their surface properties have become critical. In this tutorial review we will chiefly focus on
the impact of the morphology and composition of the surface of ABO3 perovskite substrates on the
growth mechanisms and properties of thin films epitaxially grown on them. As SrTiO3 is the most popular
substrate, we will mostly concentrate on describing the current understanding and achievements
for it. Illustrative examples of other perovskite substrates (LaAlO3, LSAT and DyScO3) will be
also included. We will show that distinct chemical terminations can exist on the surfaces used for
growth and we will review methods employed either to select the most appropriate one for specific
growth to allow, for instance, tailoring the ultimate outmost epilayer, or to induce self-ordering
to engineer long-range nanoscale patterns of chemical terminations. We will demonstrate the capacity
of this knowledge by the growth of low-dimensional organic and inorganic structures.
