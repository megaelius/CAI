A comprehensive bulk and surface investigation of high-quality In$_2$O$_3$(001) single crystals
is reported. The transparent-yellow, cube-shaped single crystals were grown using the flux method.
Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) reveals small residues of Pb, Mg, and Pt
in the crystals. Four-point-probe measurements show a resistivity of 2.0 $\pm$ 0.5 $\times$ 10$^5$
{\Omega} cm, which translates into a carrier concentration of $\approx$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$.
The results from x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements revise the lattice constant to 10.1150(5)
{\AA} from the previously accepted value of 10.117 {\AA}. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
images of a reduced (sputtered/annealed) and oxidized (exposure to atomic oxygen at 300 {\deg}C)
surface show a step height of 5 {\AA}, which indicates a preference for one type of surface termination.
The surfaces stay flat without any evidence for macroscopic faceting under any of these preparation
conditions. A combination of low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) and atomically resolved STM indicates
an indium-terminated surface with small islands of 2.5 {\AA} height under reducing conditions,
with a surface structure corresponding to a strongly distorted indium lattice. Scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS) reveals a pronounced surface state at the Fermi level ($E_F$). Photoelectron
spectroscopy (PES) shows additional, deep-lying band gap states, which can be removed by exposure
of the surface to atomic oxygen. Oxidation also results in a shoulder at the O 1s core level at a higher
binding energy, possibly indicative of a surface peroxide species. A downward band bending of 0.4
eV is observed for the reduced surface, while the band bending of the oxidized surface is of the order
of 0.1 eV or less.
