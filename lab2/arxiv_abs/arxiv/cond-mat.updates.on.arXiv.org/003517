The fundamental building blocks in band theory are band representations (BRs): bands whose infinitely-numbered
Wannier functions are generated (by action of a space group) from a finite number of symmetric Wannier
functions centered on a point in space. This work aims to simplify questions on a multi-rank BR by
splitting it into unit-rank bands, via the following crystallographic splitting theorem: being
a rank-$N$ BR is equivalent to being splittable into a finite sum of bands indexed by $\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$,
such that each band is spanned by a single, analytic Bloch function of $k$, and any symmetry in the
space group acts by permuting $\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$. Applying this theorem, we develop computationally
efficient methods to determine whether a given energy band (of a tight-binding or Schr\"odinger
Hamiltonian) is a BR, and, if so, how to numerically construct the corresponding symmetric Wannier
functions. Thus we prove that rotation-symmetric topological insulators in class AI are fragile,
meaning that the obstruction to symmetric Wannier functions is removable by addition of BRs. An
implication of fragility is that its boundary states, while robustly covering the bulk energy gap
in finite-rank tight-binding models, are unstable if the Hilbert space is expanded to include all
symmetry-allowed representations. These fragile insulators have photonic analogs that we identify;
in particular, we prove that an existing photonic crystal built by Yang et al. [Nature 565, 622 (2019)]
is fragile topological with removable surface states, which disproves a widespread perception
of `topologically-protected' surface states in time-reversal-invariant, gapped photonic/phononic
crystals. Our theorem is finally applied to derive various symmetry obstructions on the Wannier
functions of topological insulators, and to prove their equivalence with the nontrivial holonomy
of Bloch functions.
