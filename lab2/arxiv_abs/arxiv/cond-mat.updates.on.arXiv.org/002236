The conventional Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation is a widely used tool to describe dynamics
of local magnetic moments, viewed as classical vectors of fixed length, with their change assumed
to take place simultaneously with the cause. Here we demonstrate that recently developed [M. D.
Petrovi\'{c} {\em et al.}, {\tt arXiv:1802.05682}] self-consistent coupling of the LLG equation
to time-dependent quantum-mechanical description of electrons microscopically generates time-retarded
damping in the LLG equation described by a memory kernel which is also spatially dependent. For sufficiently
slow dynamics of local magnetic moments, the memory kernel can be expanded to extract the Gilbert
damping (proportional to first time derivative of magnetization) and magnetic inertia (proportional
to second time derivative of magnetization) terms whose parameters, however, are time-dependent
in contrast to time-independent parameters used in the conventional LLG equation. We use examples
of single or multiple magnetic moments precessing in an external magnetic field, as well as field-driven
motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW), to quantify the difference in their time evolution computed
from conventional LLG equation vs. TDNEGF+LLG quantum-classical hybrid approach. The faster
DW motion predicted by TDNEGF+LLG approach reveals that important quantum effects, stemming from
finite amount of time which it takes for conduction electron spin to react to the motion of classical
local magnetic moments, are missing from conventional classical micromagnetics simulations.
We also demonstrate large discrepancy between TDNEGF+LLG-computed numerically exact and, therefore,
nonperturbative result for charge current pumped by a moving DW and the same quantity computed by
perturbative spin motive force formula combined with the conventional LLG equation.
