Metallic nanojunctions are realised by separating two metal structures with an ultrathin spacer,
which may consist of molecules, two-dimensional crystals or a vacuum gap. Engineering nanojunctions
to support localised plasmon resonances boosts light matter interactions and confines electromagnetic
fields to the smallest possible volumes allowed by quantum mechanics. In this regime, the optical
response of the system is governed by poorly understood dynamical phenomena at the frontier between
the bulk, molecular and atomic scales. Here, we report the discovery of ubiquitous blinking of intrinsic
light emission from photo-excited plasmonic nanojunctions of various compositions, evidencing
the light-induced formation of domain boundaries and intrinsic quantum confined emitters inside
the noble metal. Contrasting with mechanisms proposed to date to explain surfaced-enhanced Raman
scattering fluctuations in similar systems, this internal atomic scale restructuring of the metal
does not affect the near-field enhancement and scattering spectra of the plasmonic modes in a measurable
way, highlighting a subtle interplay between atomic and mesoscopic properties of the nanojunction.
Moreover, our temperature and power dependent measurements demonstrate that blinking is not thermally
activated, pointing instead to the key role of optically excited carriers and localised electron-lattice
interactions in remodelling the metal. Our findings reveal the unexpectedly rich content of metal-induced
light emission from plasmonic nanojunctions. They provide a path to engineering brighter nanoscale
plasmonic light emitters, suggest new routes to probe metallic interfaces at the sub-nanometer
scale, and unravel unsuspected instabilities in the metal lattice induced by photo-excited carriers
under weak continuous wave illumination.
