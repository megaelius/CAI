Nonlocal QFT of one-component scalar field $\varphi$ in $D$-dimensional Euclidean spacetime
is considered. The generating functional (GF) of complete Green functions $\mathcal{Z}$ as a functional
of external source $j$, coupling constant $g$, and spatial measure $d\mu$ is studied. An expression
for GF $\mathcal{Z}$ in terms of the abstract integral over the primary field $\varphi$ is given.
An expression for GF $\mathcal{Z}$ in terms of integrals over the primary field and separable Hilbert
space (HS) is obtained by means of a separable expansion of the free theory inverse propagator $\hat{L}$
over the separable HS basis. The classification of functional integration measures $\mathcal{D}\left[\varphi\right]$
is formulated, according to which trivial and two nontrivial versions of GF $\mathcal{Z}$ are obtained.
Nontrivial versions of GF $\mathcal{Z}$ are expressed in terms of $1$-norm and $0$-norm, respectively.
The definition of the $0$-norm generator $\varPsi$ is suggested. Simple cases of sharp and smooth
generators are considered. Expressions for GF $\mathcal{Z}$ in terms of integrals over the separable
HS with new integrands are obtained. For polynomial theories $\varphi^{2n},\, n=2,3,4,\ldots,$
and for the nonpolynomial theory $\sinh^{4}\varphi$, integrals over the separable HS in terms
of a power series over the inverse coupling constant $1/\sqrt{g}$ for both norms ($1$-norm and $0$-norm)
are calculated. Critical values of model parameters when a phase transition occurs are found numerically.
A generalization of the theory to the case of the uncountable integral over HS is formulated. A comparison
of two GFs $\mathcal{Z}$, one in the case of uncountable HS integral and one obtained using the Parseval-Plancherel
identity, is given.
