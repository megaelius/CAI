We study the crossover from low- to high-temperature fluctuations including critical fluctuations
in confined isotropic O$(n)$-symmetric systems on the basis of a finite-size renormalization-group
approach at fixed dimension $d$ introduced previously [V. Dohm, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 110}, 107207
(2013)]. Our theory is formulated within the $\varphi^4$ lattice model in a $d$-dimensional block
geometry with periodic boundary conditions. We derive the finite-size scaling functions $F^{\text
ex}$ and $X$ of the excess free energy density and of the thermodynamic Casimir force, respectively,
for $1\leq n \leq \infty$, $2<d<4$. Applications are given for $ L_\parallel^{d-1} \times L$ slab
geometries with a finite aspect ratio $\rho=L/L_\parallel$ as well as for the film limit $\rho \to
0$ at fixed $L$. For $n=1$ and $\rho=0$ the low-temperature limits of $F^{\text ex}$ and $X$ vanish
whereas they are finite for $n\geq 2$ and $\rho = 0$ due to the effect of the Goldstone modes. For $n=1$
and $\rho>0$ we find a finite low-temperature limit of $F^{\text ex}$ which deviates from that of
the the Ising model. We attribute this deviation to the nonuniversal difference between the $\varphi^4$
model with continuous variables $\varphi$ and the Ising model with discrete spin variables $s=\pm1$.
For $n\geq 2$ and $\rho>0$, a logarithmic divergence of $F^{\text ex}$ in the low-temperature limit
is predicted, in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo (MC) data for the $d=3$ $XY$ model. For $2\leq
n \leq \infty$ and $0\leq \rho<\rho_0=0.8567$ the Goldstone modes generate a negative (attractive)
low-temperature Casimir force that vanishes for $\rho = \rho_0$ and becomes positive (repulsive)
for $\rho > \rho_0$. Our predictions are compared with MC data for Ising, $XY$, and Heisenberg models
in slab geometries with $0.01\leq\rho\leq1$. Good overall agreement is found.
