Under optical cooling of nuclei, a strongly correlated nuclear-spin polaron state can form in semiconductor
structures with localized charge carriers due to strong hyperfine interaction of the nuclear spins
with the electron spin. Here we develop a kinetic-equation formalism describing the nuclear-spin
polaron formation. We present a derivation of kinetic equations for an electron-nuclear spin system
coupled to reservoirs of different electron and nuclear temperatures which generates the exact
thermodynamic steady state for equal temperatures independent of the system size. We illustrate
our approach using the analytical solution of the central spin model in the limit of an Ising form
of the hyperfine coupling. In this case, the model is reduced to an analytically solvable form. Based
on the analysis of the nuclear-spin distribution function and the electron-nuclear spin correlators,
we derive a relation between the electron and nuclear spin temperatures, where the correlated nuclear-spin
polaron state is formed. In the limit of large nuclear baths, this temperature line coincides with
the critical temperature of the mean-field theory for polaron formation. The criteria of the polaron
formation in a finite-size system are discussed. We demonstrate that the system's behavior at the
transition temperature does not depend on details of the hyperfine-coupling distribution function
but only on the effective number of coupled bath spins. In addition, the kinetic equations enable
the analysis of the temporal formation of the nuclear-polaron state, where we find the build-up
process predominated by the nuclear spin-flip dynamics.
