The latest discovery of possible high temperature superconductivity in the single-layer FeSe
film grown on a SrTiO3 substrate, together with the observation of its unique electronic structure
and nodeless superconducting gap, has generated much attention. Initial work also found that,
while the single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film exhibits a clear signature of superconductivity, the
double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film shows an insulating behavior. Such a dramatic difference between
the single-layer and double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films is surprising and the underlying origin remains
unclear. Here we report our comparative study between the single-layer and double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3
films by performing a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study on the samples annealed in
vacuum. We find that, like the single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film, the as-prepared double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3
film is insulating and possibly magnetic, thus establishing a universal existence of the magnetic
phase in the FeSe/SrTiO3 films. In particular, the double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film shows a quite
different doping behavior from the single-layer film in that it is hard to get doped and remains in
the insulating state under an extensive annealing condition. The difference originates from the
much reduced doping efficiency in the bottom FeSe layer of the double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film from
the FeSe-SrTiO3 interface. These observations provide key insights in understanding the origin
of superconductivity and the doping mechanism in the FeSe/SrTiO3 films. The property disparity
between the single-layer and double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films may facilitate to fabricate electronic
devices by making superconducting and insulating components on the same substrate under the same
condition.
