We present a multiscale modeling framework to study the effect of shape, size and ligand composition
on the efficacy of binding of a ligand-coated-particle to a substrate functionalized with the target
receptors. First, we show how molecular dynamics (MD) along with Steered MD calculations can be
used to accurately parameterize the molecular binding free energy and the effective spring constant
for a receptor-ligand pair. We demonstrate this for two ligands that bind to the $\alpha_5$ $\beta_1$-domain
of integrin. Next, we show how these effective potentials can be used to build computational models
at the meso- and continuum-scales. These models incorporate the molecular nature of the receptor-ligand
interactions and yet provide an inexpensive route to study the multivalent interaction of receptors
and ligands through the construction of Bell potentials customized to the molecular identities.
We quantify the binding efficacy of the ligand-coated-particle in terms of its multivalency, binding
free energy landscape and the losses in the configurational entropies. We show that (i) the binding
avidity for particle sizes less than 350 nm is set by the competition between the enthalpic and entropic
contributions while that for sizes above 350 nm is dominated by the enthalpy of binding, (ii) anisotropic
particles display higher multivalent binding compared to spherical particles and (iii) variations
in ligand composition can alter binding avidity without altering the average multivalency. The
methods and results presented here have wide applications in the rational design of functionalized
carriers and also in understanding cell adhesion.
