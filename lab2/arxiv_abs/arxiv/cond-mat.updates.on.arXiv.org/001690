We present the first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties
of SrCoO$_{3-\delta}$ ($\delta=0, 0.25, 0.5$) to understand the multivalent nature of Co ions
in SrCoO$_{3-\delta}$ along the line of topotactic transition between perovskite SrCoO$_{3}$
and brownmillerite SrCoO$_{2.5}$. From the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$-dependent ground
state of stoichiometric SrCoO$_{3}$, we show the proximity of its metallic ferromagnetic ground
state to other antiferromagnetic states. The structural and magnetic properties of SrCoO$_{3-\delta}$
depending on their oxygen-content provide an interesting insight into the relationship between
the Co-Co distances and the magnetic couplings so that the spin-state transition of Co spins can
understood by the change of $pd$-hybridization depending on the Co-Co distances. The \emph{strong}
suppression of the $dp\sigma$-hybridization between Co $d$ and O $p$ orbitals in brownmillerite
SrCoO$_{2.5}$ brings on the high-spin state of Co$^{3+}$ $d^{6}$ and is responsible for the antiferromagnetically
ordered insulating ground state. The increase of effective Co-Co distances driven by the presence
of oxygen vacancies in SrCoO$_{3-\delta}$ is consistent with the reduction of the effective $pd$-hybridization
between Co $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. We conclude that the configuration of neighboring Co spins is shown
to be crucial to their local electronic structure near the metal-to-insulator transition along
the line of the topotactic transition in SrCoO$_{3-\delta}$. Incidentally, we also find that the
\textit{I2mb} symmetry of SrCoO$_{2.5}$ is energetically stable and exhibits ferroelectricity
via the ordering of CoO$_{4}$ tetrahedra, where this polar lattice can be stabilized by the presence
of a large activation barrier.
