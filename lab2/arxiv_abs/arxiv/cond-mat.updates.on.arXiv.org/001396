The dynamic effects observed in the J-V measurements represent one important hallmark in the behavior
of the perovskite solar cells. Proper measurement protocols (MPs) should be employed for the experimental
data reproducibility, in particular for a reliable evaluation of the power conversion efficiency
(PCE), as well as for a meaningful characterization of the type and magnitude of the hysteresis.
We discuss here several MPs by comparing the experimental J-V characteristics with simulated ones
using the dynamic electrical model (DEM). Pre-poling conditions and bias scan rate can have a dramatic
influence not only on the apparent solar cell performance, but also on the hysteretic phenomena.
Under certain measurement conditions, a hysteresis-less behavior with relatively high PCEs may
be observed, although the J-V characteristics may be far away from the stationary case. Furthermore,
forward-reverse and reverse-forward bias scans show qualitatively different behaviors regarding
the type of the hysteresis, normal and inverted, depending on the bias pre-poling. We emphasize
here that correlated forward-reverse or reverse-forward bias scans are essential for a correct
assessment of the dynamic hysteresis. In this context, we define a hysteresis index which consistently
assigns the hysteresis type and magnitude. Our DEM simulations, supported by experimental data,
provide further guidance for an efficient and accurate determination of the stationary J-V characteristics,
showing that the type and magnitude of the dynamic hysteresis may be affected by unintentional pre-conditioning
in typical experiments.
