Electrical modulus analysis of the frequency dependent conductivity data over the range from 100
Hz to 10 MHz and at temperature range of 140 oC to 300 oC were carried out on the mixed alkali vanadate
glass samples having lithium and rubidium as alkali elements. The analysis of the data is done using
Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) equation which describes the relaxation behavior of the mobile
species. We have used the Bergman equation (R. Bergman, J. Apl. Phys. 88 (2000) 1356.) for fitting
the imaginary part of the electrical modulus. The stretching parameter beta derived from this fit
shows a nonlinear variation with respect to alkali content which is attributed to mixed alkali effect.
The variations of beta with respect to alkali element concentration is analyzed on the basis of alkali
ion distance and molar volume. It is found that the coupling between the mobile ions is better at 50
mol percentage of the alkali mixture when compared to single alkali concentrations. It is observed
that coupling between the ions are weak in case of all Rubidium glass than all Lithium or Lithium-Rubidium
mixture, even though the alkali concentration is on the higher (30 mol percentage) side. The contributions
from fast and slow types of relaxation mechanisms were determined. It again shows that at low concentrations
of Rubidium ions, there exists a good coupling between alkali ions and contribute to a macroscopic
relaxation time responsible for the stretching, whereas at high concentrations of Rubidium ions
the relaxing sites decouple and relax with a microscopic relaxation time. A scaling of modulus spectra
with respect to frequency shows that stretching parameter beta is slightly dependent on temperature.
