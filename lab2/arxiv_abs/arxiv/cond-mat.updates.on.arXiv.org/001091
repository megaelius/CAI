Density functional theory augmented with Hubbard-$U$ correction (DFT+$U$) is currently the most
widely used method for first-principles electronic structure modelling of transition metal oxides
(TMOs). %Within this model, many compounds belonging to this class of materials, appear to be insulators
of Mott or charge-transfer type. Since $U$ is relatively large in comparison with the band width,
the magnetic excitations in TMOs are expected to be well described by a Heisenberg model with configuration-independent
exchange parameters $J_{ij}$'s. However, in practice the calculated $J_{ij}$'s depend on the
state they are extracted from. In this work we investigate how spin polarization of the underlying
exchange-correlation functional influences the magnetism of TMOs, i.e. compare the calculations
based on local (spin) density approximation plus $U$ (LDA+$U$ and LSDA+$U$). We perform a systematic
study of several oxides and compare their electronic structures, total energies and effective
magnetic interactions $J_{ij}$'s extracted from ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
configurations. We report that, for a realistic choice of Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ parameters,
LSDA+$U$ and LDA+$U$ calculations result in different values of the band gap. Moreover, its value
is shown to depend on the magnetic ground state and this dependence is stronger in the case of LDA+$U$.
We argue that the latter is the main reason behind the observed configurational dependence of the
$J_{ij}$'s, which is found to be systematically more pronounced in LDA+$U$ as compared to LSDA+$U$
calculations. On the other hand, we report a very good correspondence between the DFT+$U$ total
energies and the parameterized Heisenberg model for LDA+$U$ calculations, but not for LSDA+$U$.
