Nanotubular molecular self-aggregate are characterized by a high degree of symmetry and they are
fundamental systems in natural and artificial light-harvesting complexes. While coherent effects
are thought to be at the basis of their high efficiency the relationship between structure, coherence
and functionality is still an open problem. Here we show that natural nanotubular structures, present
in Green Sulfur Bacteria, have the ability to support macroscopic coherent states even at room temperature.
Such large thermal coherence length cannot be explained neither by the magnitude of the nearest-neighbour
coupling between the molecules, nor by the presence of long-range interactions between the molecules.
The existence of macroscopic coherent states is thus an emergent property of such structures. Indeed
we give evidence that symmetry induces a super-transfer and sub-transfer coupling between the
eigenstates of sub-units of the whole structure. In natural structures, the super-transfer coupling
determines the eigenstates of the lower part of the spectrum, including a superradiant state close
to the ground state, which represents a fully extended excitonic state. Due to the enhanced coupling
strength created by the super-transfer, the density of states is suppressed close to the ground
state, thus boosting the thermal coherence length. As a striking consequence of such depressed
density of states close to the ground state, we show the emergence of an energy gap between the excitonic
ground state and the first excited state which increases (instead of decreasing) with the length
of the nanotube, up to a critical system size which is close the length of the natural complexes considered.
