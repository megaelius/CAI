In this work we investigated the phase behavior of melts of block-copolymers with one charged block
by means of dissipative particle dynamics with explicit electrostatic interactions. We assumed
that all the Flory-Huggins \c{hi} parameters were equal to 0 and showed that the charge correlation
attraction solely can cause microphase separation with long-range order; a phase diagram was constructed
by varying the volume fraction of the uncharged block and the electrostatic interaction parameter
{\lambda}. The obtained phase diagram was compared to the phase diagram of corresponding neutral
diblock-copolymers. Surprisingly, the differences between these phase diagrams are rather subtle;
the same phases are observed, and the positions of the ODT points are similar if the {\lambda}-parameter
is considered as an "effective" \c{hi}-parameter. Next, we studied the position of the ODT for lamellar
structure depending on the chain length N. It turned out that while for the uncharged diblock-copolymer
the product \c{hi}crN was almost independent of N, for the diblock-copolymers with one charged
block we observed a significant increase in {\lambda}crN upon increasing N. It can be attributed
to the fact that the counterion entropy prevents the formation of ordered structures. This was supported
by studying the ODT in diblock-copolymers with charged blocks and counterions cross-linked to
the charged monomer units. The ODT for such systems was observed at significantly lower values of
{\lambda} with the difference being more pronounced at longer chain lengths N. The diffusion of
counterions in the obtained ordered structures was studied and compared to the case of a system with
the same number of charged groups but homogeneous structure; the diffusion coefficient in a direction
in the lamellar plane was found to be higher than in any direction in homogeneous structure.
