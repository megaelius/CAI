Small spontaneous lattice distortion of a cubic ferromagnet at temperatures below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$
is expected, but usually a neglected phenomenon. This study is focused on such effect on the example
of $\mathrm{U_{4}Ru_{7}Ge_{6}}$. We propose the lattice distortion from the cubic space group
to a lower symmetry as a result of our DFT calculations. The strong spin-orbit coupling on the U site
plays the most essential role, that should lower the symmetry of the system and give rise to the two
different U sites (U1 and U2). We bring convincing experimental evidence for this splitting resulting
from our polarized neutron diffraction experiment. Proper treatment of the flipping ratios collected
in the ordered state and in the paramagnetic state reveals dramatically different magnetic moments
on the U1 and U2 sites. We have reached good agreement of the results from the MAXENT method and from
direct fitting of the data. The ratio of the orbital and spin component on the U2 site is lower than
for the free $\mathrm{U^{3+}}$ or $\mathrm{U^{4+}}$ ion and points to a strong hybridization between
the U $5f$ and Ru $4d$ wave functions. The same ratio on the U1 site is unexpectedly low. This would
mean that its orbital component is almost quenched. We have observed the absence of a magnetic moment
on the Ru1 site, but a rather large induced moment on the Ru2 site. Very similar results were obtained
also in the paramagnetic state in the regime induced by the magnetic field. It points to the intimate
coupling of the magnetic ordering and structural distortion as it is possible to split the U site
in to two different polarizing paramagnetic U moments above $T_{\mathrm{C}}$ by a strong magnetic
field. We propose that the difference between the magnetic moment on the U sites is caused by the change
of local point symmetry of the sites that is tightly bound to the role of the strong spin-orbit interaction.
