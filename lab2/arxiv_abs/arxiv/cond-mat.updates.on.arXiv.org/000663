The quantum master equation is an important tool in the study of quantum open systems. It is often
derived under a set of approximations, chief among them the Born (factorization) and Markov (neglect
of memory effects) approximations. In this article we study the paradigmatic model of quantum Brownian
motion of an harmonic oscillator coupled to a bath of oscillators with a Drude-Ohmic spectral density.
We obtain analytically the \emph{exact} solution of the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, with
which we study correlation functions in the asymptotic stationary state. We compare the \emph{exact}
correlation functions to those obtained in the asymptotic long time limit with the quantum master
equation in the Born approximation \emph{with and without} the Markov approximation. In the latter
case we implement a systematic derivative expansion that yields the \emph{exact} asymptotic limit
under the factorization approximation \emph{only}. We find discrepancies that could be significant
when the bandwidth of the bath $\Lambda$ is much larger than the typical scales of the system. We study
the \emph{exact} interaction energy as a \emph{proxy} for the correlations missed by the Born approximation
and find that its dependence on $\Lambda$ is similar to the \emph{discrepancy} between the exact
solution and that of the quantum master equation in the Born approximation. We quantify the regime
of validity of the quantum master equation in the Born approximation with or without the Markov approximation
in terms of the system's relaxation rate $\gamma$, its \emph{unrenormalized} natural frequency
$\Omega$ and $\Lambda$: $\gamma/\Omega \ll 1$ and \emph{also} $\gamma \Lambda/\Omega^2 \ll 1$.
The reliability of the Born approximation is discussed within the context of recent experimental
settings and more general environments.
