Here, we report the crystal growth, physical and transport properties of Bi1-xSbx (x = 0.05, 0.1
and 0.15) topological insulator. Single crystals of Bi1-xSbx (x = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15) were grown
by melting bismuth and antimony together using the facile self flux method. The XRD measurements
displayed highly indexed 00l lines and confirmed the crystalline nature as well as the rhombohedral
structure of the Bi1-xSbx (x = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15) crystals. Raman spectroscopy measurements for
Bi1-xSbx system revealed four peaks within the spectral range of 10 to 250 cm-1 namely A1g and Eg modes
corresponding to Bi-Bi and Sb-Sb vibrations. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive
Temperature dependent electrical resistivity curves with and without applied magnetic field
exhibited a metallic behaviour and linear non-saturating magneto-resistance (MR) respectively
for all the antimony (Sb) concentrations of x = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15. The lowest Sb concentration sample
with x = 0.05 (Bi0.95Sb0.05) exhibited the highest MR value of about 1400%, followed by x = 0.1 and
0.15 samples (Bi0.9Sb0.1 and Bi0.85Sb0.05) with MR values reaching up to 500% and 110% respectively
at 2K and 6Tesla applied field. The magneto-conductivity (MC) is fitted to the HLN (Hikami Larkin
Nagaoka) equation and it is found that the charge conduction mechanism is mainly dominated by WAL
(weak anti-localization) along with a small contribution from WL (weak localization) effect.
Summarily, the short letter discusses the synthesis, interesting transport and magneto-transport
properties of Bi1-xSbx (x = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15), which could be useful in understanding the fascinating
properties of topological insulators and their technological applications.
