The convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns of twisted bilayer samples exhibit interference
patterns in their CBED spots. Such interference patterns can be treated as off-axis holograms and
the phase of the scattered waves, meaning the interlayer distance can be reconstructed. A detailed
protocol of the reconstruction procedure is provided in this study. In addition, we derive an exact
formula for reconstructing the interlayer distance from the recovered phase distribution, which
takes into account the different chemical compositions of the individual monolayers. It is shown
that one interference fringe in a CBED spot is sufficient to reconstruct the distance between the
layers, which can be practical for imaging samples with a relatively small twist angle or when probing
small sample regions. The quality of the reconstructed interlayer distance is studied as a function
of the twist angle. At smaller twist angles, the reconstructed interlayer distance distribution
is more precise and artefact free. At larger twist angles, artefacts due to the moir\'e structure
appear in the reconstruction. A method for the reconstruction of the average interlayer distance
is presented. As for resolution, the interlayer distance can be reconstructed by the holographic
approach at an accuracy of 0.5 A, which is a few hundred times better than the intrinsic z-resolution
of diffraction limited resolution, as expressed through the spread of the measured k-values. Moreover,
we show that holographic CBED imaging can detect variations as small as 0.1 A in the interlayer distance,
though the quantitative reconstruction of such variations suffers from large errors.
