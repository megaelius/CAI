Since the discovery of long-range magnetic orders in the two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW)
crystals, significant interest on such 2D magnets has emerged, inspired by their appealing physical
properties and integration with other 2D family for unique heterostructures. In known 2D magnets
such as Cr2Ge2Te6, CrI3 and Fe3GeTe2, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) stabilizes perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (PMA) down to one or few monolayers. Such a strong SOC could also lift the chiral degeneracy,
leading to the formation of topological magnetic textures such as skyrmions through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI). Here, we report the experimental observation of magnetic skyrmions and their
ordered crystal structures in a vdW ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 flake. Using high-resolution scanning
transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements,
we demonstrate that a skyrmion crystal (SkX) state in Fe3GeTe2 can be generated by both dynamically
using current pulses and statically using magnetic field-cooling process, where our LTEM measurements
suggest that the observed skyrmions in SkX state are N\'eel-type. We also present the current-driven
motion of these skyrmions in Fe3GeTe2, which is the essential requirement for any skyrmion-based
spintronic device. Using first principle calculations, we further unveil the possible origin
of DMI being the oxidized FGT (O-FGT) at interfaces. Otherwise Bloch-type magnetic textures appear
in a FGT heterostructure without any interface oxidation. Our finding opens the door to chiral magnetism
and topological spin textures in the 2D vdW magnet, which will pave a new avenue towards 2D magnet-based
topological spintronics.
