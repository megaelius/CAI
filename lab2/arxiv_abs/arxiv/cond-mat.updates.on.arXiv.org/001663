Topological insulators (TIs) are an emerging class of materials that host highly robust in-gap
surface/interface states while maintaining an insulating bulk. While most notable scientific
advancements in this field have been focused on TIs and related topological crystalline insulators
in 2D and 3D, more recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of 1D symmetry-protected
topological phases in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The topological phase of these laterally-confined,
semiconducting strips of graphene is determined by their width, edge shape, and the terminating
unit cell, and is characterized by a Z2 invariant (similar to 1D solitonic systems). Interfaces
between topologically distinct GNRs characterized by different Z2 are predicted to support half-filled
in-gap localized electronic states which can, in principle, be utilized as a tool for material engineering.
Here we present the rational design and experimental realization of a topologically-engineered
GNR superlattice that hosts a 1D array of such states, thus generating otherwise inaccessible electronic
structure. This strategy also enables new end states to be engineered directly into the termini
of the 1D GNR superlattice. Atomically-precise topological GNR superlattices were synthesized
from molecular precursors on a Au(111) surface under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and characterized
by low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS). Our experimental
results and first-principles calculations reveal that the frontier band structure of these GNR
superlattices is defined purely by the coupling between adjacent topological interface states.
This novel manifestation of 1D topological phases presents an entirely new route to band engineering
in 1D materials based on precise control of their electronic topology, and is a promising platform
for future studies of 1D quantum spin physics.
