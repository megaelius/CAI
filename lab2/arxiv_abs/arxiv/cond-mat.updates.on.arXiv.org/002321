In the context of novel solid electrolytes for solid-state batteries, first-principles calculations
are becoming increasingly more popular due to their ability to reproduce and predict accurately
the energy, structural, and dynamical properties of fast-ion conductors. In order to accelerate
the discovery of new superionic conductors is convenient to establish meaningful relations between
ionic transport and simple materials descriptors. Recently, several experimental studies on
lithium fast-ion conductors have suggested a correlation between lattice softness and enhanced
ionic conductivity due to a concomitant decrease in the activation energy for ion migration, $E_{a}$.
In this article, we employ extensive \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations based on
density functional theory to substantiate the links between ionic transport and lattice dynamics
in a number of structurally and chemically distinct lithium superionic conductors. Our first-principles
results show no evidence for a direct and general correlation between $E_{a}$, or the hopping attempt
frequency, and lattice softness. However, we find that, in agreement with recent observations,
the pre-exponential factor of lithium diffusivity, $D_{0}$, follows the Meyer-Neldel rule $\propto
\exp{\left(E_{a}/\langle \omega \rangle\right)}$, where $\langle \omega \rangle$ represents
an average phonon frequency. Hence, lattice softness can be identified with enhanced lithium diffusivity
but only within families of superionic materials presenting very similar migration activation
energies, due to larger $D_{0}$. On the technical side, we show that neglection of temperature effects
in first-principles estimation of $E_{a}$ may lead to huge inaccuracies of $\sim 10$\%. The limitations
of zero-temperature harmonic approaches in modeling of lithium-ion conductors are also illustrated.
