Thermal transport by phonons in films with thicknesses of less than 10 nm is investigated in a soft
system (Lennard-Jones argon) and a stiff system (Tersoff silicon) using two-dimensional lattice
dynamics calculations and the Boltzmann transport equation. This approach uses a unit cell that
spans the film thickness, which removes approximations related to the finite cross-plane dimension
required in typical three-dimensional-based approaches. Molecular dynamics simulations are
performed to obtain finite-temperature structures for the lattice dynamics calculations and
to predict thermal conductivity benchmarks. Thermal conductivity decreases with decreasing
film thickness until the thickness reaches four unit cells (2.1 nm) for argon and three unit cells
(1.6 nm) for silicon. With a further decrease in film thickness, thermal conductivity plateaus
in argon while it increases in silicon. This unexpected behavior, which we identify as a signature
of phonon confinement, is a result of an increased contribution from low-frequency phonons, whose
density of states increases as the film thickness decreases. Phonon mode-level analysis suggests
that confinement effects emerge below thicknesses of ten unit cells (5.3 nm) for argon and six unit
cells (3.2 nm) for silicon. Thermal conductivity predictions based on the bulk phonon properties
combined with a boundary scattering model do not capture the low thickness behavior. To match the
two-dimensional lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics predictions for larger thicknesses,
the three-dimensional lattice dynamics calculations require a finite specularity parameter
that in some cases approaches unity. These findings point to the challenges associated with interpreting
experimental thermal conductivity measurements of ultrathin silicon films, where surface roughness
and a native oxide layer impact phonon transport.
