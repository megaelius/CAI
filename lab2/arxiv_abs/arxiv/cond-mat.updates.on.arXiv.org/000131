A great flourish of interest in the development of new high-strength and high-toughness materials
is taking place in contemporary materials science, with the aim of surpassing the mechanical properties
of commercial high-performance fibres. Recently, macroscopic buckypapers, nanotube bundles
and graphene sheets have been manufactured. While their macroscopic strength remains 1-2 orders
of magnitude lower than their theoretical strength, and is thus comparable to that of current commercial
fibres, recent progress has been made in significantly increasing toughness. In particular, researchers
have produced extremely tough nanotube fibres with toughness modulus values of up to 570 J/g, 870
J/g and very recently, including graphene, reaching 970 J/g, thus well surpassing that of spider
silk (170 J/g, with a record for a giant riverine orb spider of 390 J/g and Kevlar (80 J/g). In this letter,
thanks to a new paradigm based on structural mechanics rather than on materials science, we present
the Egg of Columbus for making fibres with unprecedented toughness: a slider, in the simplest form
just a knot, is introduced as smart frictional element to dissipate energy and in general to reshape
the fibre constitutive law, showing evidence of a previously hidden toughness, strictly related
to the specific strength of the material. The result is a nearly perfectly plastic constitutive
law, with a shape mimicking that of spider silk. The proof of concept is experimentally realized
making the world toughest fibre, increasing the toughness modulus of a commercial Endumax fibre
from 44 J/g up to 1070 J/g. The maximal achievable toughness is expected for graphene, with an ideal
value of 100000 J/g.
