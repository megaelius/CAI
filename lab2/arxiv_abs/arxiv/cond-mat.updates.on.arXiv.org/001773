Three-dimensional-random-site-Ising-model (3D-RSIM) along with Glauber dynamics of pseudo-spins
(PSs) is applied for the first time to study the relaxion-ferroelectric-phase-transition (RFPT)
of perovskite-relaxor-ferroelectrics (PRFEs) in detail. To solve this model, we proposed a new
method, mean-field of PS-strings (MF-PSSs). We find: 1) 3D-RSIM is a mixed system consisting of
permanent-paraelectric-subsystem (PPSS), low-transition-temperature ferroelectric-subsystem
(LTT-FSS), and high-transition-temperature ferroelectric-subsystem (HTT-FSS). The contents
of these three subsystems change with the PS concentration (phi) of the model; 2) When phi < phi_p
(phi_p is the percolation threshold of the 3D-RSIM), HTT-FSS dominates the whole system. On cooling,
the system undergoes an inhomogeneous-diffuse-ferroelectric-phase-transition (IDFPT), and
as phi increases, it shows a crossover from the critical, gradually to Vogel-Fulcher, and to Arrehnius
type slowdown. Specifically, we observe this crossover from the relationship between the peak
temperature (Tm) of the real susceptibility of the correlated relaxation of PSs and angular frequency
(omega); 3) When phi = phi_p, the three subsystems have comparable contents. However, as temperature
decreases, the spontaneous polarization and specific heat of the whole system show an IDFPT, but
Tm shifts to lower temperature with omega until 0K. Since the relaxation time of PPSS rapidly increases
at lower temperature and diverges at 0K, during a cooling process at a limited rate, PPSS must be frozen
at a certain temperature, i.e. PS glass transition occurs. In short, with the increase of phi, 3D-RSIGM
gradually evolves from the IDFPT system to PS glass system, and phi_p is the characteristic concentration
of this evolution. Moreover, based on the coupling between PSs and crystal lattice, we also give
a new possible mechanism of Burns transformation.
