We present the model of a quantum dot (QD) consisting of a spherical core-bulk heterostructure made
of 3D topological insulator (TI) materials, such as PbTe/Pb$_{0.31}$Sn$_{0.69}$Te, with bound
massless and helical Weyl states existing at the interface and being confined in all three dimensions.
The number of bound states can be controlled by tuning the size of the QD and the magnitude of the core
and bulk energy gaps, which determine the confining potential. We demonstrate that such bound Weyl
states can be realized for QD sizes of few nanometers. We identify the spin locking and the Kramers
pairs, both hallmarks of 3D TIs. In contrast to topologically trivial semiconductor QDs, the confined
massless Weyl states in 3D TI QDs are localized at the interface of the QD and exhibit a mirror symmetry
in the energy spectrum. We find strict optical selection rules satisfied by both interband and intraband
transitions that depend on the polarization of electron-hole pairs and therefore give rise to the
Faraday effect due to Pauli exclusion principle. We show that the semi-classical Faraday effect
can be used to read out spin quantum memory. When a 3D TI QD is embedded inside a cavity, the single-photon
Faraday rotation provides the possibility to implement optically mediated quantum teleportation
and quantum information processing with 3D TI QDs, where the qubit is defined by either an electron-hole
pair, a single electron spin, or a single hole spin in a 3D TI QD. Remarkably, the combination of inter-
and intraband transition gives rise to a large dipole moment of up to 450 Debye. Therefore, the strong-coupling
regime can be reached for a cavity quality factor of $Q\approx10^{4}$ in the infrared wavelength
regime of around $10\:\mu$m.
