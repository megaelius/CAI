We present an application of the Extended Stochastic Liouville-von Neumann equations (ESLN) method
introduced earlier [PRB 95, 125124 (2017); PRB 97, 224310 (2018)] which describes the dynamics
of an exactly thermalised open quantum system reduced density matrix coupled to a non-Markovian
harmonic environment. Critically, the combined system of the open system fully coupled to its environment
is thermalised at finite temperature using an imaginary time evolution procedure before the application
of real time evolution. This initialises the combined system in the correct canonical equilibrium
state rather than being initially decoupled. We apply our theory to the spin-boson Hamiltonian
and develop a number of competing ESLN variants designed to reduce the numerical divergence of the
trace of the open system density matrix. We find that a careful choice of the driving noises is essential
for improving numerical stability. We also investigate the effect of applying higher order numerical
schemes for solving stochastic differential equations, such as the Stratonovich-Heun scheme,
and conclude that stochastic sampling dominates convergence with the improvement associated
with the numerical scheme being less important for short times but required for late times. To verify
the method and its numerical implementation, we consider evolution under a fixed Hamiltonian and
show that the system either remains in, or approaches, the correct canonical equilibrium state
at long times. Additionally, evolution of the open system under non-equilibrium Landau-Zener
(LZ) driving is considered and the asymptotic convergence to the LZ limit was observed for vanishing
system-environment coupling and temperature. When coupling and temperature are non-zero, initially
thermalising the combined system at a finite time in the past was found to be a better approximation
of the true LZ initial state than a pure state.
