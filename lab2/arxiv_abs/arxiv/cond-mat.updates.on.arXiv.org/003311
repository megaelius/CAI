A many-particle system must posses long-range interactions in order to be hyperuniform at thermal
equilibrium. Hydrodynamic arguments and numerical simulations show, nevertheless, that a three-dimensional
elastic-line array with short-ranged repulsive interactions, such as vortex matter in a type-II
superconductor, forms at equilibrium a class-II hyperuniform two-dimensional point pattern
for any constant-$z$ cross section. In this case, density fluctuations vanish isotropically as
$\sim q^{\alpha}$ at small wave-vectors $q$, with $\alpha=1$. This prediction includes the solid
and liquid vortex phases in the ideal clean case, and the liquid in presence of weak uncorrelated
disorder. We also show that the three-dimensional Bragg glass phase is marginally hyperuniform,
while the Bose glass and the liquid phase with correlated disorder are expected to be non-hyperuniform
at equilibrium. Furthermore, we compare these predictions with experimental results on the large-wavelength
vortex density fluctuations of magnetically decorated vortex structures nucleated in pristine,
electron-irradiated and heavy-ion irradiated superconducting BiSCCO samples in the mixed state.
For most cases we find hyperuniform two-dimensional point patterns at the superconductor surface
with an effective exponent $\alpha_{\text{eff}} \approx 1$. We interpret these results in terms
of a large-scale memory of the high-temperature line-liquid phase retained in the glassy dynamics
when field-cooling the vortex structures into the solid phase. We also discuss the crossovers expected
from the dispersivity of the elastic constants at intermediate length-scales, and the lack of hyperuniformity
in the $x\,-y$ plane for lengths $q^{-1}$ larger than the sample thickness due to finite-size effects
in the $z$-direction.
