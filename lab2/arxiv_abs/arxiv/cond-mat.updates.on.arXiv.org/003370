The superposition approximation and the Born-Green-Yvon (BGY) equation allows calculation of
pair distributions in thermal equilibrium from pair potentials. A 2-d variant can be used to derive
adatom pair distributions from arbitrary analytical pair potentials. As practical example substrate
mediated elastic interactions, fitted previously to first principles (FP) calculations, are
used to derive adatom pair distributions of OPd(100). The evaluation method utilizes the particle-hole
symmetry of the pair interaction lattice gas Hamiltonian. The nonlinear BGY-type integral equation
is solved numerically up to half coverage using power series expansion of coverage. The resulting
adatom pair- and three-body distributions are used to analyze the short-range order of adatoms.
A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was performed in parallel to compare the current model with established
methods. MC derived pair distributions fit well to those found with the analytical model, except
in the high coverage region. The Fourier transformed pair correlations are compared with experimental
LEED spot data and provide additional insight. Due to significant attraction the model predicts
formation of 3rd and 4th nearest neighbors (n.n.) at small 3rd n.n. chains. A long range order of adatoms
like a p(2x2) lattice is not found with the current model but a glassy structure is proposed as also
indicated by the equilibrium Monte Carlo configurations. The glassy structure is assumed to contain
fluctuations explaining broad p(2x2) LEED spots in the 0.25 monolayer region. The assumptions
and limitations of the model towards higher coverages are discussed and open questions are formulated.
