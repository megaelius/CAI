Information processing typically occurs via the composition of modular units, such as universal
logic gates. The benefit of modular information processing, in contrast to globally integrated
information processing, is that complex global computations are more easily and flexibly implemented
via a series of simpler, localized information processing operations which only control and change
local degrees of freedom. We show that, despite these benefits, there are unavoidable thermodynamic
costs to modularity---costs that arise directly from the operation of localized processing and
that go beyond Landauer's dissipation bound for erasing information. Integrated computations
can achieve Landauer's bound, however, when they globally coordinate the control of all of an information
reservoir's degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, global correlations among the information-bearing
degrees of freedom are easily lost by modular implementations. This is costly since such correlations
are a thermodynamic fuel. We quantify the minimum irretrievable dissipation of modular computations
in terms of the difference between the change in global nonequilibrium free energy, which captures
these global correlations, and the local (marginal) change in nonequilibrium free energy, which
bounds modular work production. This modularity dissipation is proportional to the amount of additional
work required to perform the computational task modularly. It has immediate consequences for physically
embedded transducers, known as information ratchets. We show how to circumvent modularity dissipation
by designing internal ratchet states that capture the global correlations and patterns in the ratchet's
information reservoir. Designed in this way, information ratchets match the optimum thermodynamic
efficiency of globally integrated computations.
