Van der Waals interface plays a critical role in nanomaterials-based devices such as interconnects
in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, assembled nanostructure arrays and van der Waals heterostructures.
A thorough understanding of thermal transport through the van der Waals interface is essential
for these applications to address the increasingly severe heat dissipation problem. In this work,
we report an experimental study on thermal transport through the van der Waals interface between
two copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) nanoribbons. The interfacial thermal conductance for the planar
contact between CuPc nanoribbons is found to be in the range of 1.8-6.5x105 Wm-2K-1, which is three
orders of magnitude lower than the interfacial thermal conductance previously reported for the
point contact between carbon nanotubes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation predicted a thermal
conductance of 1.54x108 Wm-2K-1 for a perfectly smooth interface between two parallelly aligned
CuPc nanoribbons, over two orders of magnitude larger than experimental values. Further MD simulations
and contact mechanics analysis reveal that surface roughness plays a pronounced role for thermal
transport through the van der Waals interface between CuPc nanoribbons, which significantly reduces
the adhesion energy and the effective contact area between CuPc nanoribbons and thus results in
orders of magnitude lower interfacial thermal conductance. In addition, MD simulation discloses
that the adhesion energy at the interface depends on the stacking configuration of two CuPc nanoribbons,
which may also contribute to the observed ultralow interfacial thermal conductance.
