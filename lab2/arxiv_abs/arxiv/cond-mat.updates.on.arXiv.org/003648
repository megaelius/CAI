We present a joint experimental and theoretical determination of structures of Ag adatoms on the
Ge(111) surface using low energy electron diffraction, low energy electron microscopy, scanning
tunneling microscopy, and density functional theory-based calculations, as functions of coverages
and temperature. Experimentally for clean Ge(111), c(2X8) and (2X1) phases occur, while Ag overlayers
cause (4X4), (V3XV3)R30 and (3X1) surface structural phases. The dependence of the growth behavior
of these different phases was examined as a function of temperature, Ag deposition rate and coverage,
substrate step density, and history of temperature cycling. First-principles calculations of
the electronic and geometric structures and vibrational dynamics show the Ge(111)-c(2X8) configuration
with Ge adatoms adsorbed on three-fold hollow (T4) sites to be the energetically most favored phase
of the Ge(111) surface, among unreconstructed Ge(111), reconstructed Ge(111)-2X1, and Ge(111)-c(2X8)
structures. The Ge(111)-Ag(3X1) overlayer of the system has Ge atoms forming a honeycomb chain
on a missing top layer reconstructed surface, with metal at 1/3 ML coverage in channel. The Ge (111)-Ag(V3XV3)R30
overlayer contains one monolayer Ag forming inequivalent Ag triangles in a surface unit cell on
the missing top layer reconstructed Ge(111) surface. The Ge(111)-Ag(4X4) overlayer formed at
low Ag coverage contains two triangular subunits at different heights: one with six Ag adatoms and
the other with three Ge adatoms on the intact double layer Ge(111) surface. The temperature and coverage
dependent surface phase diagram, obtained by minimizing the surface free energy, captures the
main features of the experimental phase diagram.
