Studying the strong correlation effects in interacting Dirac fermion systems is one of the most
challenging problems in modern condensed matter physics. The long-range Coulomb interaction
and the fermion-phonon interaction can play an important role in such systems, and in some cases
may lead to a variety of intriguing properties, including non-Fermi liquid behavior and phase-transition
instabilities. In the strong-coupling regimes, the method of weak-coupling expansion breaks
down. Here, we investigate the interaction between massless Dirac fermions and a generic scalar
bosonic mode, and develop an efficient non-perturbative approach to access the strong-coupling
regime. This approach is universal and applicable to both (1+2) and (1+3) dimensions. We first derive
a number of coupled Ward-Takahashi identities based on symmetry analysis, and then use these identities
to incorporate all the fermion-boson vertex corrections into the Dyson-Schwinger integral equations
of fermion and boson propagators. We prove that the fully renormalized fermion propagator satisfies
an entirely self-closed Dyson-Schwinger equation, which can be directly solved by numerical skills.
Our approach provides a unified framework for the theoretical study of the interaction-induced
effects, including Landau damping, fermion velocity renormalization, and formation of charge
density wave, in a self-consistent way. No small expansion parameter is needed, thus all the results
are reliable no matter how strong the fermion-boson interaction is. Our approach can be used to treat
strong long-range Coulomb interaction and strong fermion-phonon interaction. Under proper conditions,
it might also be applied to study the Yukawa coupling between Dirac fermion and order-parameter
quantum fluctuation around a putative quantum critical point.
