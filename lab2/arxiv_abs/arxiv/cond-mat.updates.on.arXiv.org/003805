Trigonal tellurium (Te) is an anisotropic chiral semiconductor that holds great promise as the
foundation for next generation optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Engineering these
devices, however, relies critically on details of the band-edge optical response and carrier decay
dynamics, which are poorly understood in Te. Here we employ polarized transient mid-IR reflectance
spectroscopy to investigate both its complex electronic structure as well as carrier dynamics
within the extended bulk band structure. The transient spectra reveal a series of optical transitions
around the H- and L-points of the Brillouin zone and the transition energies are found to be very sensitive
to the laser polarizations perpendicular and parallel to the c-axis of the Te crystal. Optical transitions
are clearly seen between uppermost H4, H5 and H6 valence bands and the lowest lying H6 conduction
band. The fundamental gap (H4 to H6) is observed at 0.315 eV with both polarizations, while the higher
lying transition (H5 to H6) is only observed for E parallel to the c axis. The energies of both transitions
measured with E parallel to the c axis are strongly modulated as photoexcited carriers relax to ground
state, suggesting transient band modifications by photoinduced strain in the nanosheet. The majority
of photoexcited carriers near the band edge are seen to decay within 30 ps while higher lying transitions
observed near 1.2 eV appear to have substantially longer lifetimes, potentially due to contributions
of intervalley processes in the recombination rate. These new findings shed light on strong correlation
between photoinduced carriers and electronic structure in anisotropic crystals and provide a
new pathway for designing Te-based novel devices.
