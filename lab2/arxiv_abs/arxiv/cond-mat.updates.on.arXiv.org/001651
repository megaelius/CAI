We report magnetic, thermodynamic, thermal expansion, and on detailed optical experiments on
the layered compound $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ focusing on the THz and sub-gap optical response across
the structural phase transition from the monoclinic high-temperature to the rhombohedral low-temperature
structure, where the stacking sequence of the molecular layers is changed. This type of phase transition
is characteristic for a variety of tri-halides crystallizing in a layered honeycomb-type structure
and so far is unique, as the low-temperature phase exhibits the higher symmetry. One motivation
is to unravel the microscopic nature of spin-orbital excitations via a study of temperature and
symmetry-induced changes. We document a number of highly unusual findings: A characteristic two-step
hysteresis of the structural phase transition, accompanied by a dramatic change of the reflectivity.
An electronic excitation, which appears in a narrow temperature range just across the structural
phase transition, and a complex dielectric loss spectrum in the THz regime, which could indicate
remnants of Kitaev physics. Despite significant symmetry changes across the monoclinic to rhombohedral
phase transition, phonon eigenfrequencies and the majority of spin-orbital excitations are not
strongly influenced. Obviously, the symmetry of the single molecular layers determine the eigenfrequencies
of most of these excitations. Finally, from this combined terahertz, far- and mid-infrared study
we try to shed some light on the so far unsolved low energy (< 1eV) electronic structure of the ruthenium
$4d^5$ electrons in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.
