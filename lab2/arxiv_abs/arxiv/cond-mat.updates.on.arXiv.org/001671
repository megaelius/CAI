We perform spin wave analysis of classical ground states of a model Hamiltonian proposed earlier(Phys.
Rev. B {\bf 90}, 104420(2014)) for $\alpha-MnO_2$ compounds. It is known that the phase diagram
of the Hollandite lattice (lattice of $\alpha-MnO_2$ compounds) consists of four different Helical
phases(FH, A2H, C2H, CH phase) in the space of model parameters $J_1,~J_2,~J_3$. The spin wave dispersion
shows presence of gapless mode which interpolates between quadratic to linear depending on phases
and values of $J_i$'s. In most cases, the 2nd lowest mode shows the existence of a roton minima mainly
from $X$ to $M$ and $M$ to $Z$ path. Few higher modes also show roton minima. Each helical phase has
its characteristic traits which can be used to determine the phases itself. The analytical expressions
of eigenmodes at high symmetry points are obtained which can be utilized to extract the values of
$J_i$'s. Density of states, specific heat and susceptibilities at low temperature has been studied
within spin wave approximation. The specific heat shows departure from $T^{1.5(3)}$ dependence
found in three dimensional unfrustrated ferromagnetic(anti-ferromagnetic) system which seems
to be the signature of incommensurate helical phase. The parallel susceptibility is maximum for
FH phase and minimum for CH phase at low temperature. The perpendicular susceptibility is found
to be independent of temperature at very low temperature. Our study can be used to compare experimental
results on magnon spectrum, elastic neutron scattering, and finite temperature properties mentioned
above for clean $\alpha-MnO_2$ system
