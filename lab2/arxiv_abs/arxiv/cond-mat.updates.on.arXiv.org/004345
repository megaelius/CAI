Selected configuration interaction (SCI) methods are currently enjoying a resurgence due to several
recent developments which improve either the overall computational efficiency or the compactness
of the resulting SCI vector. These recent advances have made it possible to get full CI (FCI) quality
results for much larger orbital active spaces, compared to conventional approaches. However,
due to the starting assumption that the FCI vector has only a small number of significant Slater determinants,
SCI becomes intractable for systems with strong correlation. This paper introduces a method for
developing SCI algorithms in a way which exploits local molecular structure to significantly reduce
the number of SCI variables. The proposed method is defined by first grouping the orbitals into clusters
over which we can define many particle cluster states. We then directly perform the SCI algorithm
in a basis of tensor products of cluster states instead of Slater determinants. While the approach
is general for arbitrarily defined cluster states, we find significantly improved performance
by defining cluster states through a self-consistent Tucker decomposition of the global (and sparse)
SCI vector. To demonstrate the potential of this method, called tensor product selected configuration
interaction (TPSCI), we present numerical results for a modified Hubbard model with different
inter- and intra-cluster hopping terms. We also study the less obviously clusterable cases of bond
breaking in N2 and CO and also singlet-triplet gaps in planar {\pi}-conjugated systems. Numerical
results show that TPSCI can be used to reduce the number of variables in the variational space quite
significantly as compared to other selected CI approaches.
