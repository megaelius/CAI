In recent years, generative artificial neural networks based on restricted Boltzmann machines
(RBMs) have been successfully employed as accurate and flexible variational wave functions for
clean quantum many-body systems. In this article we explore their use in simulations of disordered
quantum spin models. The standard dense RBM with all-to-all inter-layer connectivity is not particularly
appropriate for large disordered systems, since in such systems one cannot exploit translational
invariance to reduce the amount of parameters to be optimized. To circumvent this problem, we implement
sparse RBMs, whereby the visible spins are connected only to a subset of local hidden neurons, thus
reducing the amount of parameters. We assess the performance of sparse RBMs as a function of the range
of the allowed connections, and compare it with the one of dense RBMs. Benchmark results are provided
for two sign-problem free Hamiltonians, namely pure and random quantum Ising chains. The RBM ansatzes
are trained using the unsupervised learning scheme based on projective quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC)
algorithms. We find that the sparse connectivity facilitates the training process and allows sparse
RBMs to outperform the dense counterparts. Furthermore, the use of sparse RBMs as guiding functions
for PQMC simulations allows us to perform PQMC simulations at a reduced computational cost, avoiding
possible biases due to finite random-walker populations. We obtain unbiased predictions for the
ground-state energies and the magnetization profiles with fixed boundary conditions, at the ferromagnetic
quantum critical point. The magnetization profiles agree with the Fisher-de Gennes scaling relation
for conformally invariant systems, including the scaling dimension predicted by the renormalization-group
analysis.
