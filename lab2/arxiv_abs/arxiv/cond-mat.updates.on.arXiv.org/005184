Stripe phases, in which the rotational symmetry of charge density is spontaneously broken, occur
in many strongly correlated systems with competing interactions. One representative example
is the copper-oxide superconductors, where stripe order is thought to be relevant to the mechanism
of high-temperature superconductivity. Identifying and studying the stripe phases in conventional
strongly correlated systems are, however, challenging due to the complexity and limited tunability
of these materials. Here we uncover stripe phases in WSe2/WS2 moir\'e superlattices with continuously
gate-tunable charge densities by combining optical anisotropy and electronic compressibility
measurements. We find strong electronic anisotropy over a large doping range peaked at 1/2 filling
of the moir\'e superlattice. The 1/2-state is incompressible and assigned to a (insulating) stripe
crystal phase. It can be continuously melted by thermal fluctuations around 35 K. The domain configuration
revealed by wide-field imaging shows a preferential alignment along the high-symmetry axes of
the moir\'e superlattice. Away from 1/2 filling, we observe additional stripe crystals at commensurate
filling 1/4, 2/5 and 3/5. The anisotropy also extends into the compressible regime of the system
at incommensurate fillings, indicating the presence of electronic liquid crystal states. The
observed filling-dependent stripe phases agree with the theoretical phase diagram of the extended
Hubbard model on a triangular lattice in the flat band limit. Our results demonstrate that two-dimensional
semiconductor moir\'e superlattices are a highly tunable platform to study the stripe phases and
their interplay with other symmetry breaking ground states.
