Ceria has proven to be an excellent ion-transport and ion-exchange material when used in polycrystalline
form and with a high-concentration of aliovalent doped cations. Despite its widespread application,
the impact of atomic-scale defects in this material are scarcely studied and poorly understood.
In this article, using first-principles simulations, we provide a fundamental understanding
of the atomic-structure, thermodynamic stability and electronic properties of undoped grain-boundaries
(GBs) and alkaline-earth metal (AEM) doped GBs in ceria. Using density-functional theory simulations,
with a GGA+U functional, we find the $\Sigma$3 (111)/[$\bar{1}$01] GB is thermodynamically more
stable than the $\Sigma$3 (121)/[$\bar{1}$01] GB due to the larger atomic coherency in the $\Sigma$3
(111)/[$\bar{1}$01] GB plane. We dope the GBs with $\sim$20% [M]$_{GB}$ (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba)
and find that the GB energies have a parabolic dependence on the size of solutes, the interfacial
strain and the packing density of the GB. We see a stabilization of the GBs upon Ca, Sr and Ba doping
whereas Be and Mg render them thermodynamically unstable. The electronic density of states reveal
that no defect states are present in or above the band gap of the AEM doped ceria, which is highly conducive
to maintain low electronic mobility in this ionic conductor. The electronic properties, unlike
the thermodynamic stability, exhibit complex inter-dependence on the structure and chemistry
of the host and the solutes. This work makes advances in the atomic-scale understanding of aliovalent
cation doped ceria GBs serving as an anchor to future studies that can focus on understanding and
improving ionic-transport.
