We investigated frictional effects on the folding rates of a human telomerase hairpin (hTR HP) and
H-type pseudoknot from the Beet Western Yellow Virus (BWYV PK) using simulations of the Three Interaction
Site (TIS) model for RNA. The heat capacity from TIS model simulations, calculated using temperature
replica exchange simulations, reproduces nearly quantitatively the available experimental
data for the hTR HP. The corresponding results for BWYV PK serve as predictions. We calculated the
folding rates ($k_\mathrm{F}$) from more than 100 folding trajectories for each value of the solvent
viscosity ($\eta$) at a fixed salt concentration of 200 mM. By using the theoretical estimate ($\propto$$\sqrt{N}$
where $N$ is the number of nucleotides) for folding free energy barrier, $k_\mathrm{F}$ data for
both the RNAs are quantitatively fit using one-dimensional Kramers' theory with two parameters
specifying the curvatures in the unfolded basin and the barrier top. In the high-friction regime
($\eta\gtrsim10^{-5}\,\textrm{Pa\ensuremath{\cdot}s}$), for both HP and PK, $k_\mathrm{F}$s
decrease as $1/\eta$ whereas in the low friction regime, $k_\mathrm{F}$ values increase as $\eta$
increases, leading to a maximum folding rate at a moderate viscosity ($\sim10^{-6}\,\textrm{Pa\ensuremath{\cdot}s}$),
which is the Kramers turnover. From the fits, we find that the speed limit to RNA folding at water viscosity
is between 1 and 4 $\mathrm{\mu s}$, which is in accord with our previous theoretical prediction
as well as results from several single molecule experiments. Both the RNA constructs fold by parallel
pathways. Surprisingly, we find that the flux through the pathways could be altered by changing
solvent viscosity, a prediction that is more easily testable in RNA than in proteins.
