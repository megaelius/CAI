We consider the spin $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, with nearest neighbor, next nearest neighbor ($\alpha$)
and biquadratic ($\beta$) interactions using a combination of the density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG), a variational matrix product state wave function, and non-Abelian bosonization.
We study the effect of frustration ($\alpha>0$) on the Haldane phase with $-1\leq \beta <
1$ which reveals a rich phase diagram. For $-1<\beta<\beta^\ast$, we establish the existence
of a spontaneously dimerized phase for large $\alpha>\alpha_c$, separated from the Haldane
phase by the critical line $\alpha_c(\beta)$ of second-order phase transitions connected to the
Takhtajan--Babudjian integrable point $\alpha_c(\beta=-1)=0$. In the opposite regime, $\beta>\beta^\ast$,
the transition from the Haldane phase becomes first-order into the next nearest neighbor (NNN)
AKLT phase. Based on field theoretical arguments and DMRG calculations we conjecture these two
regimes are separated by a multi-critical end-point ($\beta^\ast, \alpha^\ast$) of a different
universality class, described by the $SU(2)_4$ Wess--Zumino--Witten critical theory. From the
DMRG calculations we estimate this end-point to lie in the range $-0.2<\beta^\ast<-0.15$
and $0.47<\alpha^\ast < 0.53$. For large frustration above the critical line $\alpha>\alpha_c(\beta)$,
we find that the dimerized phase smoothly crosses over to the NNN AKLT phase via an intermediate dimer
phase with incommensurate short range order. We show the existence of two incommensurate crossovers:
the Lifshitz transition and the disorder transition of the first kind, marking incommensurate
correlations in momentum and real space, respectively. We show these crossover lines stretch across
the entire $(\beta,\alpha)$ phase diagram, merging into a single incommensurate-to-commensurate
transition line for negative $\beta\lesssim \beta^\ast$.
