The role of catalyst support and regioselectivity of molecular adsorption on a metal oxide surface
is investigated for the NO reduction on a Cu/{\gamma}-alumina heterogeneous catalyst. For the
solid surface, computational models of the {\gamma}-alumina surface are constructed based on
the Step-by-Step Hydrogen Termination (SSHT) approach. Dangling bonds, which appear by cutting
the crystal structure of a model, are terminated stepwise with H atoms until the model has an appropriate
energy gap. The obtained SSHT models exhibit the realistic infrared (IR) and ultraviolet-visible
(UV/Vis) spectra. Vibronic coupling density (VCD), as a reactivity index, is employed to elucidate
the regioselectivity of the Cu adsorption on the {\gamma}-alumina and that of the NO adsorption
on the Cu/{\gamma}-alumina in place of the frontier orbital theory that could not provide clear
results. We discovered that the highly dispersed Cu atoms are loaded on Lewis-basic O atoms, which
is known as anchoring effect, located in the tetrahedral sites of the {\gamma}-alumina surface.
The role of the {\gamma}-alumina support is to raise the frontier orbital of the Cu catalyst, which
in turn gives rise to the electron back-donation from the Cu/{\gamma}-alumina to NO. In addition,
the penetration of the VCD distribution of the Cu/{\gamma}-alumina into the {\gamma}-alumina
support indicates that the excessive reaction energies dissipate into the support after the NO
adsorption and reduction. In other words, the support plays the role of a heat bath. The NO reduction
on the Cu/{\gamma}-alumina proceeds even in an oxidative atmosphere because the Cu-NO bond is strongly
bounded compared to the Cu-O2 bond.
