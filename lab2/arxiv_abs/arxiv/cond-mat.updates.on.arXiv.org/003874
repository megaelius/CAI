The worm algorithm is a versatile technique in the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for both classical
and quantum systems. The algorithm substantially alleviates critical slowing down and reduces
the dynamic critical exponents of classical systems. It is crucial to improve the algorithm and
push the boundary of the Monte Carlo method for physical systems. We here propose a directed worm
algorithm that significantly improves computational efficiency. We use the geometric allocation
approach to optimize the worm scattering process: worm backscattering is averted, and forward
scattering is favored. Our approach successfully enhances the diffusivity of the worm head (kink),
which is evident in the probability distribution of the relative position of the two kinks. Performance
improvement is demonstrated for the Ising model at the critical temperature by measurement of exponential
autocorrelation times and asymptotic variances. The present worm update is approximately 25 times
as efficient as the conventional worm update for the simple cubic lattice model. Surprisingly,
our algorithm is even more efficient than the Wolff cluster algorithm, which is one of the best update
algorithms. We estimate the dynamic critical exponent of the simple cubic lattice Ising model to
be $z \approx 0.27$ in the worm update. The worm and the Wolff algorithms produce different exponents
of the integrated autocorrelation time of the magnetic susceptibility estimator but the same exponent
of the asymptotic variance. We also discuss how to quantify the computational efficiency of the
Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of physical systems,
such as the $| \phi |^4$ model, the Potts model, the O($n$) loop model, and lattice QCD.
