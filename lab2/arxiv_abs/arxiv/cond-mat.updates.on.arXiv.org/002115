The theory of receptor-ligand binding equilibria has long been well-established in biochemistry,
and was primarily constructed to describe dilute aqueous solutions. Accordingly, few computational
approaches have been developed for making quantitative predictions of binding probabilities
in environments other than dilute isotropic solution. Existing techniques, ranging from simple
automated docking procedures to sophisticated thermodynamics-based methods, have been developed
with soluble proteins in mind. Biologically and pharmacologically relevant protein-ligand interactions
often occur in complex environments, including lamellar phases like membranes and crowded, non-dilute
solutions. Here we revisit the theoretical bases of ligand binding equilibria, avoiding overly
specific assumptions that are nearly always made when describing receptor-ligand binding. Building
on this formalism, we extend the asymptotically exact Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation technique
to quantifying occupancies of sites on proteins in a complex bulk, including phase-separated,
anisotropic, or non-dilute solutions, using a thermodynamically consistent and easily generalized
approach that resolves several ambiguities of current frameworks. To incorporate the complex
bulk without overcomplicating the overall thermodynamic cycle, we simplify the common approach
for ligand restraints by using a single distance-from-bound-configuration (DBC) ligand restraint
during AFEP decoupling from protein. DBC restraints should be generalizable to binding modes of
most small molecules, even those with strong orientational dependence. We apply this approach
to compute the likelihood that membrane cholesterol binds to known crystallographic sites on 3
GPCRs at a range of concentrations. Non-ideality of cholesterol in a binary cholesterol:POPC bilayer
is characterized and consistently incorporated into the interpretation.
