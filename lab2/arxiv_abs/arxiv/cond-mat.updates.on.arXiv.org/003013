It is established that roughness and chemistry play a crucial role in the wetting properties of a
substrate. Yet, few studies have analyzed systematically the effect of the non-uniformity in the
distribution of texture and surface tension of substrates on its wetting properties. In this work
we investigate this issue theoretically and numerically. We propose a continuous model that takes
into account the total energy required to create interfaces of a droplet in two possible wetting
states: Cassie-Baxter(CB) with air pockets trapped underneath the droplet; and the other characterized
by the homogeneous wetting of the surface, the Wenzel(W) state. To introduce geometrical non-regularity
we suppose that pillar heights and pillar distances are Gaussian distributed instead of having
a constant value. Similarly, we suppose a heterogeneous distribution of Young's angle on the surface
to take into account the chemical non-uniformity. This allows to vary the "amount" of disorder by
changing the variance of the distribution. We first solve this model analytically and then we also
propose a numerical version of it, which can be applied to study any type of disorder. In both versions,
we employ the same physical idea: the energies of both states are minimized to predict the thermodynamic
wetting state of the droplet for a given volume and surface texture. We find that the main effect of
disorder is to induce the stability of both wetting states on the same substrate. In terms of the influence
of the disorder on the contact angle of the droplet, we find that it is negligible for the chemical
disorder and for pillar-distance disorder. However, in the case of pillar-height disorder, it
is observed that the average contact angle of the droplet increases with the amount of disorder.
We end the paper investigating how the region of stability of both wetting states behaves when the
droplet volume changes.
