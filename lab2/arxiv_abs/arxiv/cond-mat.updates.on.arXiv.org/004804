High throughput screening of materials for technologically relevant areas, like identification
of better catalysts, electronic materials, ceramics for high temperature applications and drug
discovery, is an emerging topic of research. To facilitate this, density functional theory based
(DFT) calculations are routinely used to calculate the electronic structure of a wide variety of
materials. However, DFT calculations are expensive and the computing cost scales as the cube of
the number of electrons present in the system. Thus, it is desirable to generate surrogate models
that can mitigate these issues. To this end, we present a two step procedure to predict total energies
of large three-dimensional systems (with periodic boundary conditions) with chemical accuracy
(1kcal/mol) per atom using a small data set, meaning that such models can be trained on-the-fly.
Our procedure is based on the idea of the Hohenberg-Kohn map proposed by Brockherde et al. (Nat. Commun,
8, 872 (2017)) and involves two training models: one, to predict the ground state charge density,
$\rho(r)$, directly from the atomic structure, and another to predict the total energy from $\rho(r)$.
To predict $\rho(r)$, we use many-body correlation descriptors to accurately describe the neighborhood
of a grid point and to predict the total energy we use amplitudes of these many-body correlation descriptors.
Utilizing the amplitudes of the many-body descriptors allows for uniquely identifying a structure
while accounting for constraints, such as translational invariance; additionally, such a formulation
is independent of the charge density grid.
