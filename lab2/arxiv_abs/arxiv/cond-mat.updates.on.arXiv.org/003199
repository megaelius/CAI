Motivated by the quasiparticle wavefunction in the composite fermion (CF) theory for fractional
quantum Hall filling factor $\nu = 1/m$, I consider a suitable quasiparticle operator in differential
form, as a modified form of Laughlin's quasiparticle operator, that reproduces quasiparticle
wave function as predicted in the CF theory. I further consider the conjugate of this operator as
quasihole operator for obtaining a novel quasihole wave function for $1/m$ state. Each of these
wave functions is interpreted as expelled electron into a different Hilbert subspace from the original
Hilbert space of Laughlin condensate while still maintaining its correlation (although changed)
with the electrons in the condensate such that the expelled electron behaves as a CF with respect
to the electrons in the condensate. With this interpretation, I show that the ground state wavefunctions
for general states at filling fractions $\nu_{n,m}^{\pm} = n/[n(m\mp 1)\pm 1]$, respectively,
can be constructed as coherent superposition of $n$ coupled Laughlin condensates and their conjugates,
formed at different Hilbert subspaces. The corresponding wave functions, specially surprising
for $\nu_{n,m}^{-}$ sequence of states, are identical with those proposed in the theory of noninteracting
CFs. The states which were considered as fractional quantum Hall effect of interacting CFs, can
also be treated in the same footing as for the prominent sequences of states describing as the coupled
condensates among which one is a non-Laughlin condensate in a different Hilbert subspace. Further,
I predict that the half filling of the lowest Landau level is a quantum critical point for phase transitions
between two topologically distinct phases each corresponding to a family of states.
