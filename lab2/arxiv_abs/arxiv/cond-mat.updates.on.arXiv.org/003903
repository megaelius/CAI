Self-organized bistability is the counterpart of "self-organized criticality" (SOC), for systems
tuning themselves to the edge of bistability of a discontinuous/first-order phase transition,
rather than to the critical point of a continuous/second order one. The equations defining the theory
of SOB turn out to be very similar to a mesoscopic (Landau-Ginzburg) theory recently proposed to
describe the dynamics in the cerebral cortex. This theory describes the bistable/oscillating
neuronal activity of coupled mesoscopic patches of cortex, homeostatically regulated by short-term
synaptic plasticity. However, the theory for cortex dynamics entails significant differences
with respect to SOB, including the lack of a (bulk) conservation law, the absence of a perfect separation
of timescales between driving and dissipation and, the fact that in the former there is a parameter
that controls the overall system state (in blatant contrast with the very idea of self-organization).
Here, we scrutinize --by employing a combination of analytical and computational tools-- the analogies
and differences between both theories and explore whether in some limit SOB could play an important
role to explain the emergence of scale-invariant neuronal avalanches observed empirically in
the cortex. We conclude that actually, in the limit of infinitely slow synaptic-dynamics, the two
theories behave identically, but the separation of timescales required for the self-organization
mechanism to be effective does not seem to be biologically plausible. We discuss the key differences
between self-organization mechanisms with or without conservation and separated timescales,
and in particular, we scrutinize the implications of our findings in neuroscience, hopefully shedding
new light into the problem of scale invariance in cortical dynamics.
