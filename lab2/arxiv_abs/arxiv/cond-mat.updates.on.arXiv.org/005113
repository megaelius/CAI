A radical anion based functionalization of the basal plane of two-dimensional (2D) materials is
proposed in the present study. Simple charge neutral radical functionalizations typically detach
from the basal planes upon reduction. For example, epoxy oxygens irreversibly detach from graphene
when reduced by an alkali metal. The radical anion functionalization of 2D materials results in
a stable reduced state that can reversibly be oxidized and has high ionic conductivity due to the
great mobility of the cations between the negatively charged functional groups on the surface.
Depending on the oxidation state of these systems, a high concentration of hole states can also be
realized allowing for good electronic conductivity. These properties can further allow for improved
energy storage devices via transition metal free cathode active species, solid electrolytes,
electroconductive additives, separators, coatings for metal anodes and heat conductors through
a single material. One possible realization of the above principles is the 2D salt An(BN)2OBX3,
where A is an alkali atom (Li, Na, etc; 0=<n=<2) or alkaline earth (Mg, etc; 0=<n=<1) and X is a halide
(typically F or Cl). This material can be derived from the basal plane functionalization of hexagonal
boron nitride, h-BN, with .OBX3^- radical anions in the presence of the A cations. One potential
source of .OBX3^- radical anions is their recombined form, the [X3B-O-O-BX3]2- anion, which can
be found in the Lewis adduct of an AnO2 ionic peroxide with BX3: An[X3B-O-O-BX3]. The individual
radical anions can be obtained by thermally splitting the O-O bond in the recombined anion. Transition
metal free all-solid-state batteries with Li, Na and Mg anodes, thermal stability and high energy
and power densities may be realizable using An(BN)2OBX3.
