We numerically and experimentally study the segregation dynamics in a binary mixture of microswimmers
which move on a two-dimensional substrate in a static periodic triangular-like light intensity
field. The motility of the active particles is proportional to the imposed light intensity and they
possess a motility contrast, i.e., the prefactor depends on the species. In addition, the active
particles also experience a torque aligning their motion towards the direction of the negative
intensity gradient. We find a segregation of active particles near the intensity minima where typically
one species is localized close to the minimum and the other one is centered around in an outer shell.
For a very strong aligning torque, there is an exact mapping onto an equilibrium system in an effective
external potential that is minimal at the intensity minima. This external potential is similar
to (height-dependent) gravity, such that one can define effective `heaviness' of the self-propelled
particles. In analogy to shaken granular matter in gravity, we define a `colloidal Brazil nut effect'
if the heavier particles are floating on top of the lighter ones. Using extensive Brownian dynamics
simulations, we identify system parameters for the active colloidal Brazil nut effect to occur
and explain it based on a generalized Archimedes' principle within the effective equilibrium model:
heavy particles are levitated in a dense fluid of lighter particles if their effective mass density
is lower than that of the surrounding fluid. We also perform real-space experiments on light-activated
self-propelled colloidal mixtures which confirm the theoretical predictions.
