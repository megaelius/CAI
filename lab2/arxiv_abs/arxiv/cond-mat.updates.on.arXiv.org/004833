Carbon-based magnetic structures promise significantly longer coherence times than traditional
magnetic materials, which is of fundamental importance for spintronic applications. An elegant
way of achieving carbon-based magnetic moments is the design of graphene nanostructures with an
imbalanced occupation of the two sublattices forming the carbon honeycomb lattice. According
to Lieb's theorem, this induces local magnetic moments that are proportional to the sublattice
imbalance. Exact positioning of sublattice imbalanced nanostructures in graphene nanomaterials
hence offers a route to control interactions between induced local magnetic moments and to obtain
graphene nanomaterials with magnetically non-trivial ground states. Here, we show that such sublattice
imbalanced nanostructures can be incorporated along a large band gap armchair graphene nanoribbon
on the basis of asymmetric zigzag edge extensions, which is achieved by incorporating specifically
designed precursor monomers during the bottom-up fabrication of the graphene nanoribbons. Scanning
tunneling spectroscopy of an isolated and electronically decoupled zigzag edge extension reveals
Hubbard-split states in accordance with theoretical predictions. Investigation of pairs of such
zigzag edge extensions reveals ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic or quenching of the magnetic
interactions depending on the relative alignment of the asymmetric edge extensions. Moreover,
a ferromagnetic spin chain is demonstrated for a periodic pattern of zigzag edge extensions along
the nanoribbon axis. This work opens a route towards the design and fabrication of graphene nanoribbon-based
spin chains with complex magnetic ground states.
