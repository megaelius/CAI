Generation of energetic (hot) electrons is an intrinsic property of any plasmonic nanostructure
under illumination. Simultaneously, a striking advantage of metal nanocrystals over semiconductors
lies in their very large absorption cross sections. Therefore, metal nanostructures with strong
and tailored plasmonic resonances are very attractive for photocatalytic applications. However,
the central questions regarding plasmonic hot electrons are how to quantify and extract the optically-excited
energetic electrons in a nanocrystal. We develop a theory describing the generation rates and the
energy-distributions of hot electrons in nanocrystals with various geometries. In our theory,
hot electrons are generated owing to surfaces and hot spots. The formalism predicts that large optically-excited
nanocrystals show the excitation of mostly low-energy Drude electrons, whereas plasmons in small
nanocrystals involve mostly hot electrons. The energy distributions of electrons in an optically-excited
nanocrystal show how the quantum many-body state in small particles evolves towards the classical
state described by the Drude model when increasing nanocrystal size. We show that the rate of surface
decay of plasmons in nanocrystals is directly related to the rate of generation of hot electrons.
Based on a detailed many-body theory involving kinetic coefficients, we formulate a simple scheme
describing the plasmon's dephasing. In most nanocrystals, the main decay mechanism of a plasmon
is the Drude friction-like process and the secondary path comes from generation of hot electrons
due to surfaces and electromagnetic hot spots. This latter path strongly depends on the size, shape
and material of the nanocrystal, correspondingly affecting its efficiency of hot-electron production.
The results in the paper can be used to guide the design of plasmonic nanomaterials for photochemistry
and photodetectors.
