Biological hydrogels have been increasingly sought after as e.g. wound dressings or scaffolds
for regenerative medicine, due to their inherent biofunctionality in biological environments.
Especially in moist wound healing, the ideal material should absorb large amounts of wound exudate
whilst remaining mechanically competent in-situ. Despite their large hydration, however, current
biological hydrogels still leave much to be desired in terms of mechanical properties in physiological
conditions. To address this challenge, a multi-scale approach is presented for the synthetic design
of cyto-compatible collagen hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties (from nano- up to the
macro-scale), uniquely high swelling ratios and retained (>70%) triple-helical features.
Type I collagen was covalently functionalized with three different monomers, i.e. 4 vinylbenzyl
chloride, glycidyl methacrylate and methacrylic anhydride, respectively. Backbone rigidity,
hydrogen-bonding capability and degree of functionalization (<i>F</i>: 16&plusmn12
&ndash 91&plusmn7 mol.-%) of introduced moieties governed the structure-property relationships
in resulting collagen networks, so that the swelling ratio (<i>SR</i>: 707&plusmn51
&ndash 1996&plusmn182 wt.-%), bulk compressive modulus (<i>E<sub>c</sub></i>:
30&plusmn7 &ndash 168&plusmn40 kPa) and Atomic Force Microscopy elastic modulus
(<i>E<sub>AFM</sub></i>: 16&plusmn2 &ndash 387&plusmn66
kPa) were readily adjusted. In light of their remarkably high swelling and mechanical properties,
these tunable collagen hydrogels may be further exploited for the design of advanced dressings
for chronic wound care.
