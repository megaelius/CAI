Point contact tunneling (PCT) spectroscopy measurements are reported over wide areas of cm-sized
cut outs from niobium superconducting RF cavities. A comparison is made between a high-quality,
conventionally processed (CP) cavity with a high field Q drop for acceleration field E $>$ 20 MV/m
and a nitrogen doped (N-doped) cavity that exhibits an increasing Q up to fields approaching 15 MV/m.
The CP cavity displays hot spot regions at high RF fields where Q-drop occurs as well as unaffected
regions (cold spots). PCT data on cold spots reveals a near ideal BCS density of states (DOS) with
gap parameters, $\Delta$ as high as 1.62 meV, that are among the highest values ever reported for
Nb. Hot spot regions exhibit a wide distribution of gap values down to $\Delta \sim$ 1.0 meV and DOS
broadening characterized by a relatively large value of pair-breaking rate, $\Gamma$, indicating
surface regions of significantly reduced superconductivity. In addition, hot spots commonly
exhibit Kondo tunneling peaks indicative of surface magnetic moments attributed to a defective
oxide. N-doped cavities reveal a more homoegeneous gap distribution centered at $\Delta \sim$
1.5 meV and relatively small values of $\Gamma/\Delta$. The absence of regions of significantly
reduced superconductivity indicates that the N interstitials are playing an important role in
preventing the formation of hydride phases and other macroscopic defects which might otherwise
severely affect the local, surface superconductivity that lead to hot spot formation. The N-doped
cavities also display a significantly improved surface oxide, i.e., increased thickness and tunnel
barrier height, compared to CP cavities. These results help explain the improved performance of
N-doped cavities and give insights into the origin of the initial increasing Q with RF amplitude.
