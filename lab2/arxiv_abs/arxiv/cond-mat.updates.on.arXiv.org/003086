In different materials, orientationally-controlled assembling of building blocks results into
the developing of different anisotropic particles. These trends are more pronounced in atoms of
metallic nature when in their certain transition state. Their monolayer assembly is vital as it
forms the tiny particles. When triangle-shaped packets of nano-energy were supplied by a source
of certain arrangement to that formed compact monolayer assembly, atoms bound into their shapes.
Joined triangle-shaped tiny particles developed when tuned bipolar pulses were examined. For
each case, they separated into two tiny particles while force-exertion under a bit non-uniform
manner to electrons of atoms forming the contact-point between them. At controlled electronically-flat
solution surface, re-crystallization state atoms of tiny particles elongate equally. Electrons
of left-side and right-side at centre of their atoms experience uniform exertion of surface force
exerting along their opposite poles. Thus, atoms of 1D-arrays convert into structures of smooth
elements. Such structures of smooth elements flatten further by the travelling photons of different
forcing energies. Originally, binding of solid-atoms should be considered under the execution
of confined inter-state electron-dynamics in grounded-format. Tiny particles developed in structures
of smooth elements pack as a one-unit to assemble them at common-point where force-exertion remains
in an immersing-format. In different regions of solution surface, structures of smooth elements
when nucleate a shaped mono-layer of developing particle, unfilled regions are filled precisely
by the afterward arriving structures of smooth elements, which is not in the case of a distorted particle.
For lateral-wise adherence of structures of smooth elements to above mono-layer, each mono-layer
of developing particle of anisotropic shape deals localized gravity.
