We have investigated the electronic states of CeB$_6$ and have directly calculated the RKKY interaction
on the basis of the 74-orbital effective Wannier model which includes 14 Ce-$f$ orbitals and 60 conduction
($c$) orbitals of Ce-$d,s$ and B-$p,s$ derived from the density-functional theory bandstructure
calculation. By using not only the $c$-band dispersion but also the $f$-$c$ mixing matrix elements
of the Wannier model, the realistic couplings for all 15 active multipole moments in $\Gamma_8$
quartet subspace are obtained in the wavevector $q$-space and real-space. Both of the $\Gamma_{5g}$
quadrupoles $(O_{yz},O_{zx},O_{xy})$ and the $\Gamma_{2u}$ octupole $T_{xyz}$ couplings are
maximally enhanced with $q=(\pi,\pi,\pi)$ which naturally explains the phase II of the antiferro-quadrupolar
ordering at $T_{Q}=3.2$ K, and are also enhanced with $q=(0,0,0)$ corresponding to the elastic
softening of $C_{44}$. Also the couplings of the $\Gamma_{5u}$ octupoles $T_{x}^{\beta}$, $T_{y}^{\beta}$
and $T_{z}^{\beta}$ are quite large for $q=(\pi,0,0)$, $(0,\pi,0)$ and $(0,0,\pi)$, which yields
the antiferro-octupolar ordering of a possible candidate for phase IV of Ce$_{x}$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$.
The intersite vector dependence of the RKKY couplings exhibit different long-range, oscillating,
isotropic and anisotropic behaviors depending on the types of the multipole moments. The present
approach enables us to provide the information about the possible multipole ordering in an unbiased
way and is easily available for other localized $f$ electron materials once the $c$ states and $f$-$c$
mixing elements are given from the bandstructure calculation.
