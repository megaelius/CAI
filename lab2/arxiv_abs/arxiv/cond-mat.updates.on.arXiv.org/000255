The B-phase of superfluid $^3$He is a 3D time-reversal invariant (TRI) topological superfluid
with an isotropic energy gap separating the ground-state and bulk continuum states. We report calculations
of surface spectrum, spin- and mass current densities originating from the Andreev surface states
for confined $^3$He-B. The surface states are Majorana Fermions with their spins polarized transverse
to their direction of propagation along the surface. The negative energy states give rise to a ground-state
helical spin current confined on the surface. The spectral functions reveal the subtle role of the
spin-polarized surface states in relation to the ground-state spin current. By contrast, these
states do not contribute to the $T=0$ mass current. Superfluid flow through a channel of confined
$^3$He-B is characterized by the flow field, $p_s$. The flow field breaks 2D rotational symmetry
and time reversal (T). However, the Bogoliubov-Nambu Hamiltonian remains invariant under $T$
combined with a 180 degree rotation about the normal to the film. As a result the B-phase in the presence
of a superflow remains a topological phase with a gapless spectrum of Majorana modes on the surface.
Thermal excitation of the Doppler shifted Majorana branches leads to a power law suppression of
the superfluid mass current, providing a direct signature of the Majorana branches of surface excitations
in the fully gapped 3D topological superfluid, $^3$He-B. Results are reported for the superfluid
fraction (mass current) and helical spin current for confined $^3$He-B, including the temperature
dependences, as well as dependences on confinement, interactions between quasiparticles and
pressure.
