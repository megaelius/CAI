Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation, coupled with third-order anharmonic lattice dynamics
calculations, has been widely used to model lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{l}$) in bulk
crystals. However, its application to materials with structural phase transition at relatively
high temperature is fundamentally challenged by the presence of lattice instabilities (imaginary
phonon modes). Additionally, its accuracy suffers from the absence of higher-than-third-order
phonon scattering processes, which are important near/above the Debye temperature. In this letter,
we present an effective scheme that combines temperature-induced anharmonic phonon renormalization
and four-phonon scattering to resolve these two theoretical challenges. We apply this scheme to
investigate the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of GeTe, which undergoes a second-order
ferroelectric phase transition from rhombohedral $\alpha$-GeTe to rocksalt $\beta$-GeTe at
about 700~K. Our results on the high-temperature phase $\beta$-GeTe at 800~K confirm the stabilization
of $\beta$-GeTe by temperature effects. We find that considering only three-phonon scattering
leads to significantly overestimated $\kappa_{l}$ of 3.8~W/mK at 800~K, whereas including four-phonon
scattering reduces $\kappa_{l}$ to 1.7~W/mK, a value comparable with experiments. To explore
the possibility to further suppress $\kappa_{l}$, we show that alloying $\beta$-GeTe with heavy
cations such as Pb and Bi can effectively reduce $\kappa_{l}$ to about 1.0~W/mK, whereas sample
size needs to be around 10nm through nanostructuring to achieve a comparable reduction of $\kappa_{l}$.
