Advanced hydrogen lithography techniques and low-temperature epitaxial overgrowth enable patterning
of highly phosphorus-doped silicon (Si:P) monolayers (ML) with atomic precision. This approach
to device fabrication has made Si:P monolayer systems a testbed for multiqubit quantum computing
architectures and atomically precise 2-D superlattice designs whose behaviors are directly tied
to the deterministic placement of single dopants. However, dopant segregation, diffusion, surface
roughening, and defect formation during the encapsulation overgrowth introduce large uncertainties
to the exact dopant placement and activation ratio. In this study, we develop a unique method by combining
dopant segregation/diffusion models with sputter profiling simulation to monitor and control,
at the atomic scale, dopant movement using room-temperature grown locking layers (LL). We explore
the impact of LL growth rate, thickness, rapid thermal anneal, surface accumulation, and growth
front roughness on dopant confinement, local crystalline quality, and electrical activation
within Si:P 2-D systems. We demonstrate that dopant movement can be more efficiently suppressed
by increasing the LL growth rate than by increasing LL thickness. We find that the dopant segregation
length can be suppressed below a single Si lattice constant by increasing LL growth rates at room
temperature while maintaining epitaxy. Although dopant diffusivity within the LL is found to remain
high even below the hydrogen desorption temperature, we demonstrate that exceptionally sharp
dopant confinement with high electrical quality within Si:P monolayers can be achieved by combining
a high LL growth rate with a low-temperature LL rapid thermal anneal.
