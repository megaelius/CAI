The theory of orbital magnetization is reconsidered through careful definition of additional
quantities that incorporate a non-Hermitian effect due to anomalous operators that break the domain
of definition of the Hermitian Hamiltonian. As a result, boundary contributions to the observable
are rigorously and analytically taken into account. In this framework, we first extend the standard
velocity operator definition in order to incorporate an anomaly of the position operator that is
inherent in band theory, which results to an explicit boundary velocity contribution. Using the
extended velocity, we define the electrons' intrinsic orbital circulation which is an intensive
quantity of periodic systems that properly counts the circulating micro-currents embodied in
the wavefunctions' structure (bulk and boundary contributions). A connection between the nth
band electrons' collective intrinsic circulation and the Wannier-based local and itinerant circulation
contributions used in the modern theory of orbital magnetization is made. We develop a quantum mechanical
formalism for the orbital magnetization of extended and periodic topological solids (insulators
or semimetals) without any Wannier-localization approximation or heuristic extension [Caresoli,
Thonhauser, Vanderbilt and Resta, Phys. Rev. B 74, 024408 (2006)]. It is rigorously shown that,
as a result of the non-Hermitian effect, an emerging covariant derivative enters the one-band (adiabatically
deformed) approximation k-space expression for the orbital magnetization. In the corresponding
many-band (unrestricted) k-space formula, the non-Hermitian effect contributes an additional
boundary quantity which is expected to give locally (in momentum space) giant contributions whenever
band crossings occur along with Hall voltage due to imbalance of electron accumulation at the opposite
boundaries of the material.
