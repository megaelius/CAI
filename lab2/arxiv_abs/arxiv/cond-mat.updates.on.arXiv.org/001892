In addition to the self-governing properties, tiny-sized particles of metallic colloids are the
building blocks of large-sized particles. Thus, their study has been the subject of many studies.
A tiny-sized particle developed at solution surface or inside the solution depends on the attained
dynamics of atoms where different mechanisms of their bindings are involved. When a packet of nano
shape energy is placed over monolayer assembly, it results into develop three-dimensional structure
of tiny-sized particle of own shape. Atoms of each one-dimensional arrays of tiny-sized particle
elongate under the exertion of force in surface format, thus, converting arrays into structure
of smooth elements. At solution surface, impinging electron streams at fixed angle results into
further elongate elongated atoms of tiny-sized particle under transported forced energy. Travelling
photons of certain wavelength along the interface further shape arrays of elongated atoms for structure
of smooth elements. Amalgamated atoms when are in neutral transition state, they execute electron-dynamics
to bind where they are not required to be uplifted at solution surface for binding under the packet
of nano shape energy. Inside the solution or near to interface, gold atoms develop tiny-sized particle
in multi-dimensional shape and structure depending on their attained dynamics. Tiny-sized particles
develop their structure in the original format if localized dynamics or attained dynamics of amalgamated
atoms are remained in natural sort of way where they do not involve the frustration. This study highlights
the fundamental process of developing tiny-sized particles where electronic structure of gold
atoms is altered because of experiencing different behavior of force-energy, so, they deal a phase
transition. Such a tool of processing materials opens several possibilities to develop engineered
materials.
