Understanding the complex properties of electronic and spintronic devices at the micro- and nano-scale
is a topic of intense current interest as it becomes increasingly important for scientific progress
and technological applications. In-operando characterization of such devices by scanned probe
techniques is particularly well-suited for the microscopic study of these properties. We have
developed a scanned probe microscope (SPM) which is capable of both standard force imaging (atomic,
magnetic, electrostatic) and simultaneous electrical transport measurements. We utilize flexible
and inexpensive FPGA (field programmable gate array) hardware and a custom software framework
developed in National Instrument's LabVIEW environment to perform the various aspects of microscope
operation and device measurement. The FPGA-based approach enables sensitive, real-time cantilever
frequency-shift detection. Using this system, we demonstrate electrostatic force microscopy
of an electrically-biased graphene FET device. The combination of SPM and electrical transport
also enables imaging of the transport response to a localized perturbation provided by the scanned
cantilever tip. Facilitated by the broad presence of LabVIEW in the experimental sciences and the
openness of our software solution, our system permits a wide variety of combined scanning and transport
measurements by providing standardized interfaces and flexible access to all aspects of a measurement
(input and output signals, and processed data). Our system also enables precise control of timing
(synchronization of scanning and transport operations) and implementation of sophisticated
feedback protocols, and thus should be broadly interesting and useful to practitioners in the field.
