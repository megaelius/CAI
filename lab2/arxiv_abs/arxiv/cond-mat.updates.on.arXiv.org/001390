In organic bulk heterojunction solar cells, the donor/acceptor interfacial energy offset ($\Delta
E$) is found to provide the driving force for efficient charge separation which gives rise to high
short circuit current density ($J_\mathrm{sc}$), but a high $\Delta E$ inevitably undermines
the open circuit voltage ($V_\mathrm{oc}$). In this paper, employing the device model method we
calculated the steady state current density-voltage ($J-V$) and the $J_\mathrm{sc}-\Delta E$
curves under two different charge separation mechanisms to investigate the optimum driving force
required for achieving sizable $V_\mathrm{oc}$ and $J_\mathrm{sc}$ simultaneously. Under the
Marcus charge transfer mechanism, with the increased $\Delta E$ the Jsc increases rapidly for $\Delta
E\leq 0.2$ eV, and then maintains a nearly constant value before decreasing at the Marcus inverted
region, which is due to the accumulation of undissociated excitons within their lifetime and is
beneficial for obtaining a sizable $J_\mathrm{sc}$ under a $\Delta E$ much smaller than the reorganization
energy $\lambda$. For the coherent charge transfer mechanism in which the driving force act as the
energy window of accessible charge separated states, with two typical types of density of states
for the charge transfer excitons, it is shown that the highest $J_\mathrm{sc}$ can also be achieved
under a small $\Delta E$ of 0.2\,eV if the high-lying delocalized states are harvested in high proportion.
This work demonstrates the existence of the optimum driving force of 0.2\,eV and provides some guidelines
for engineering the interfacial energetics to achieve the high balanced $J_\mathrm{sc}$ and $V_\mathrm{oc}$.
