Computational studies of crystal nucleation can be impacted by finite size effects, primarily
due to unphysical interactions between crystalline nuclei and their periodic images. It is, however,
not always feasible to systematically investigate the sensitivity of nucleation kinetics and
mechanism to system size due to large computational costs of nucleation studies. Here, we use jumpy
forward flux sampling to accurately compute the rates of heterogeneous ice nucleation in the vicinity
of square-shaped model structureless ice nucleating particles (INPs) of different sizes, and
identify three distinct regimes for the dependence of rate on the INP dimension, $L$. For small INPs,
the rate is a strong and non-monotonic function of $L$ due to artificial spanning of critical nuclei
across the periodic boundary. Intermediate-sized INPs, however, give rise to the emergence of
non-spanning 'proximal` nuclei that are close enough to their periodic images to fully structure
the intermediary liquid. While such proximity can facilitate nucleation, its effect is offset
by the compression of the intermediary liquid by the growing non-proximal nuclei, leading to artificially
small nucleation rates overall. The critical nuclei formed at large INPs are neither spanning nor
proximal. Yet, the rate is a weak function of $L$, with its logarithm scaling linearly with $1/L$.
The key heuristic emerging from these observations is that finite size effects will be minimal if
critical nuclei are neither spanning nor proximal, and if the density of the unstructured part of
the intermediary liquid is statistically indistinguishable from the supercooled liquid density
under the same conditions.
