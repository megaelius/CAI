Many biological functions are executed by molecular machines, which consume energy and convert
it into mechanical work. Biological machines have evolved to transport cargo, facilitate folding
of proteins and RNA, remodel chromatin and replicate DNA. A common aspect of these machines is that
their functions are driven out of equilibrium. It is a challenge to provide a general framework for
understanding the functions of biological machines, such as molecular motors, molecular chaperones,
and helicases. Using these machines as prototypical examples, we describe a few general theoretical
methods providing insights into their functions. Although the theories rely on coarse-graining
of these complex systems they have proven useful in not only accounting for many in vitro experiments
but also addressing questions such as how the trade-off between precision, energetic costs and
optimal performances are balanced. However, many complexities associated with biological machines
will require one to go beyond current theoretical methods. Simple point mutations in the enzyme
could drastically alter functions, making the motors bi-directional or result in unexpected diseases
or dramatically restrict the capacity of molecular chaperones to help proteins fold. These examples
are reminders that while the search for principles of generality in biology is intellectually stimulating,
one also ought to keep in mind that molecular details must be accounted for to develop a deeper understanding
of processes driven by biological machines. Going beyond generic descriptions of in vitro behavior
to making genuine understanding of in vivo functions will likely remain a major challenge for some
time to come. The combination of careful experiments and the use of physical principles will be useful
in elucidating the rules governing the workings of biological machines.
