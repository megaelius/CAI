When some 'entities' are related by the 'features' they share they are amenable to a bipartite network
representation. Plant-pollinator ecological communities, co-authorship of scientific papers,
customers and purchases, or answers in a poll, are but a few examples. Analyzing clustering of such
entities in the network is a useful tool with applications in many fields, like internet technology,
recommender systems, or detection of diseases. The algorithms most widely applied to find clusters
in bipartite networks are variants of modularity optimization. Here we provide an hierarchical
clustering algorithm based on a dissimilarity between entities that quantifies the probability
that the features shared by two entities is due to mere chance. The algorithm performance is $O(n^2)$
when applied to a set of n entities, and its outcome is a dendrogram exhibiting the connections of
those entities. Through the introduction of a 'susceptibility' measure we can provide an 'optimal'
choice for the clustering as well as quantify its quality. The dendrogram reveals further useful
structural information though -- like the existence of sub-clusters within clusters or of nodes
that do not fit in any cluster. We illustrate the algorithm by applying it first to a set of synthetic
networks, and then to a selection of examples. We also illustrate how to transform our algorithm
into a valid alternative for one-mode networks as well, and show that it performs at least as well
as the standard, modularity-based algorithms -- with a higher numerical performance. We provide
an implementation of the algorithm in Python freely accessible from GitHub.
