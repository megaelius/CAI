Electron bilayers in a strong magnetic field exhibit insulating behavior for a wide range of interlayer
separation $d$ for total Landau level fillings $\nu\leq 1/2$, which has been interpreted in terms
of a pinned crystal. We study theoretically the competition between many strongly correlated liquid
and crystal states and obtain the phase diagram as a function of quantum well width and $d$ for several
filling factors of interest. We predict that three crystal structures can be realized: (a) At small
$d$, the Triangular Ising AntiFerromagnetic (TIAF) crystal is stabilized in which the particles
overall form a single-layer like triangular crystal while satisfying the condition that no nearest-neighbor
triangle has all three particles in the same layer. (b) At intermediate $d$, a Correlated Square
(CS) crystal is stabilized, in which particles in each layer form a square lattice, with the particles
in one layer located directly across the centers of the squares of the other. (c) At large $d$, we find
a Bilayer Graphene (BG) crystal in which the A and B sites of the graphene lattice lie in different
layers. All crystals that we predict are strongly correlated crystals of composite fermions; a
theory incorporating only electron Hartree-Fock crystals does not find any crystals besides the
`trivial' ones occurring at large interlayer separations for total filling factor $\nu\leq1/3$
(when layers are uncorrelated and each layer is in the long familiar single-layer crystal phase).
The TIAF, CS and BG crystals come in several varieties, with different flavors of composite fermions
and different interlayer correlations. The appearance of these exotic crystal phases adds to the
richness of the physics of electron bilayers in a strong magnetic field, and also provides insight
into experimentally observed bilayer insulator as well as transitions within the insulating part
of the phase diagram.
