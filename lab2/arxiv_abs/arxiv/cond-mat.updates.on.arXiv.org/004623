Recently Chern insulators with Chern number $C=1$ and $C=2$ in zero (or very small) magnetic field
have been observed in two moire graphene systems: twisted bilayer graphene and ABC trilayer graphene,
both aligned with a hexagonal Boron-Nitride (h-BN) substrate. These Chern insulator states arise
due to many body effects in the Chern bands of these systems when they are partially filled to a total
integer filling $\nu_T = 1,3$ (including spin and valley degrees of freedom). A simple possible
explanation is from Hartree-Fock mean field theory which predicts valley and spin polarization
in the zero bandwidth limit, similar to the "quantum Hall ferromagnetism" in Landau levels. Though
valley polarization is implied by the existing experiments, the fate of the spin degree of freedom
is not presently clear. In this paper we propose alternative valley polarized - but not spin polarized
- candidates for the observed QAH effect. For a valley polarized spinful Chern band at filling $\nu_T=1$,
we describe a class of exotic Chern insulator phases through spin-charge separation: charge is
in a conventional Chern insulator phase with quantized Hall conductivity, while the spin forms
disordered spin liquid phase with fractionalization, which we dub quantum Hall spin liquids. We
construct a simple class of $Z_2$ quantum Hall spin liquid as analogs of the familiar $Z_2$ spin liquid
through slave fermion-schwinger boson parton theory. Condensation of the spinon from the $Z_2$
quantum Hall spin liquid can lead to a quantum Hall antiferromagnet which is yet another, less exotic,
candidate for the experimentally observed Chern insulator. We offer several experimental proposals
to probe the quantum Hall spin liquid and the quantum Hall anti-ferromagnetic phases.
