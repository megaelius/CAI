Persistent, direct interactions between proteins in complex phases and small molecules acting
as ligands, including processes taking place in lamellar environments like the membrane or in crowded,
non-dilute environments, are critical to action of numerous drugs. Few computational approaches
have been developed for making quantitative predictions of binding probabilities in environments
other than dilute isotropic solution. Available techniques, ranging from simple automated docking
procedures to sophisticated thermodynamics-based methods, have been developed almost exclusively
for use in soluble proteins. Here we extend the asymptotically exact Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation
technique to quantifying occupancies of sites on proteins in a complex bulk, including phase-separated,
anisotropic, or non-dilute solutions, using a thermodynamically consistent and easily generalized
approach that resolves several previous ambiguities. To incorporate the complex bulk without
overcomplicating the overall thermodynamic cycle, we simplify the common approach for ligand
restraints by using a single distance-from-bound-configuration (DBC) ligand restraint during
AFEP decoupling from protein. DBC restraints should be generalizable to binding modes of most small
molecules, even those with strong orientational dependence. We apply this approach to calculate
the likelihood that cholesterol binds to widely-studied crystallographic sites on 3 GPCRs ($\beta_{2}$-adrenergic,
5HT-2B, and $\mu$-opioid) at a range of concentrations. Non-ideality of cholesterol in a binary
cholesterol:phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer is characterized and consistently incorporated
into the interpretation.
