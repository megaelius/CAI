An analytical method is proposed for computing the low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamic mobility
function of a small colloidal particle asymmetrically moving inside a large spherical elastic
cavity, the membrane of which is endowed with resistance toward shear and bending. In conjunction
with the results obtained in the first part [Daddi-Moussa-Ider, L\"{o}wen, and Gekle, Eur. Phys.
J. E 41, 104 (2018)], in which the axisymmetric motion normal to the surface of an elastic cavity is
investigated, the general motion for an arbitrary force direction can be addressed. The elastohydrodynamic
problem is formulated and solved using the classic method of images through expressing the hydrodynamic
flow fields as a multipole expansion involving higher-order derivatives of the free-space Green's
function. In the quasi-steady limit, we demonstrate that the particle self-mobility function
of a particle moving tangent to the surface of the cavity is larger than that predicted inside a rigid
stationary cavity of equal size. This difference is justified by the fact that a stationary rigid
cavity introduces additional hindrance to the translational motion of the encapsulated particle,
resulting in a reduction of its hydrodynamic mobility. Furthermore, the motion of the cavity is
investigated, revealing that the translational pair (composite) mobility, which linearly couples
the velocity of the elastic cavity to the force exerted on the solid particle, is solely determined
by membrane shear properties. Our analytical predictions are favorably compared with fully-resolved
computer simulations based on a completed-double-layer boundary integral method.
