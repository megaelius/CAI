We use large-scale DFT calculations to investigate with unprecedented detail the so-called spin-orbit
(SO) proximity effect in graphene adsorbed on the Pt(111) and Ni(111)/Au semi-infinite surfaces,
previously studied via spin and angle resolved photoemission (SP-ARPES) experiments. The key
finding is that, due to the hybridization with the metal's bands, the Dirac cones manifest an unexpectedly
rich spin texture including out-of-plane and even radial in-plane spin components at (anti)crossings
where local gap openings and deviations from linearity take place. Both the continuum character
of the metallic bands and the back folding associated to the moir\'e patterns enhance the spin texture
and induce sizable splittings which, nevertheless, only become giant (~100 meV) at anticrossing
regions; that is, where electronic transport is suppressed. At the quasilinear regions the splitted
bands typically disperse with different broadenings and tend to cross with their magnetization
continuously changing in order to match that at the edges of the upper and lower gaps. As a result,
both the splittings and spin direction become strongly k dependent. The SO manifests in an analogous
way for the spin-polarized G/Au/Ni(111) system, although here the magnetic exchange interactions
dominate inducing small splittings (~10 meV) in the $\pi$ bands while the SO mainly introduces a
small Rashba splitting in the Dirac cones as their magnetization acquires a helical component.
While revealing such complex spin texture seems challenging from the experimental side, our results
provide an important reference for future SP-ARPES measurements of similar graphene based systems
extensively investigated for applications in spintronics.
