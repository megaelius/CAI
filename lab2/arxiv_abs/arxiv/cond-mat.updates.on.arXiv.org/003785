The area of magnetic skyrmions, with potential revolution in certain applications, in condensed
matter physics is considered about a decade old. In this article, we draw the attention of the community
to the recent work of Kurumaji et al [Science 365, 914 (2019)] establishing magnetic skymion lattice
behavior in Gd2PdSi3. We consider it important to bring out the two decades old history of this compound,
which led to this finding. As a continuation of our exhaustive investigations on AlB2 derived ternary
rare-earth intermetallics with triangular arrangement of magnetic ions, we were prompted to investigate
this compound two decades ago, on the basis of the clue we obtained for abnormal transport behavior
of many materials containing Gd and other normal rare-earth ions, which are traditionally considered
uninteresting. The key experimental data in support of the skyrmion lattice that Kurumaji et al
present is the observation of topological Hall resistivity in an intervening field range, following
two metamagnetic transitions. In addition, the values are giant, compared to those known for other
magnetic skyrmions. We point out here that such a giant Hall resistivity (along with metamagnetic
transitions) was reported by us on the same compound in 1999, expressing difficulties in explaining
the results at that time. It is fascinating that Kurumaji et al is able to find an explanation in terms
of a modern idea of magnetic skyrmions on the basis of resonant x-ray scattering tool. In view of above,
the compound Gd2PdSi3, ex post facto, can be considered as the first experimental demonstration
for giant topological Hall effect in this field, discovered about two decades ago. We take this opportunity
to share some thoughts, offering clues for further investigations, in particular to identify novel
magnetic skyrmions and to find the same to enable applications.
