Edge structure plays an essential role in the nature of electronic states in graphene nanoribbons.
By focusing on the interplay between this feature and non-trivial topology in the domain of the Dirac
confinement problem, this paper proposes to examine how effects associated with edge shape manifest
themselves in conjunction with the topological signature typical of M\"{o}bius strips within
a low-energy regime. Aiming to provide an alternative to prevailing tight-binding approaches,
zigzag and armchair M\"{o}bius strips are modeled by proposing compatible sets of boundary conditions,
prescribing profiles of terminations in both transverse and longitudinal directions which are
demonstrated to be coherent in describing consistently transverse edge patterns in combination
with a proper M\"{o}bius periodicity. Of particular importance is the absence of constraints on
the solution, in contrast with infinite mass analogues, as well as an energy spectrum with a characteristic
dual structure responding exclusively to the parity associated with the transverse quantum number.
Zigzag ribbons are predicted to possess an intrinsic mechanism for parity inversion, while the
armchair ones carry the possibility of a coexistent gapless and gapped band structure. We also inspect
the influence of the edge structure on persistent currents. In zigzag-edged configurations they
are found to be sensitive to a length-dependent term which behaves as an effective flux. Armchair
rings show a quite distinctive property: alternation of constant and flux-dependent currents
according to the width of the ring, for a fixed transverse quantum number. In the flux-free case the
effects of topology are found to be entirely suppressed, and conventional odd and even currents
become undistinguishable.
