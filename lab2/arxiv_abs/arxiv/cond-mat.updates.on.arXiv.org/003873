Methods of optical dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) open the door to the replenishable hyperpolarization
of nuclear spins, boosting their NMR/MRI signature by orders of magnitude. Nanodiamond powder
rich in negatively charged Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) defect centers has recently emerged as one such
promising platform, wherein 13C nuclei can be hyperpolarized through the optically pumped defects
completely at room temperature and at low magnetic fields. Given the compelling possibility of
relaying this 13C polarization to nuclei in external liquids, there is an urgent need for the engineered
production of highly "hyperpolarizable" diamond particles. In this paper, we report on a systematic
study of various material dimensions affecting optical 13C hyperpolarization in diamond particles
-- especially electron irradiation and annealing conditions that drive NV center formation. We
discover surprisingly that diamond annealing at elevated temperatures close to 1720C have remarkable
effects on the hyperpolarization levels, enhancing them by upto 36-fold over materials annealed
through conventional means. We unravel the intriguing material origins of these gains, and demonstrate
they arise from a simultaneous improvement in NV electron relaxation time and coherence time, as
well as the reduction of paramagnetic content, and an increase in 13C relaxation lifetimes. Overall
this points to significant recovery of the diamond lattice from radiation damage as a result of the
high-temperature annealing. Our work suggests methods for the guided materials production of
fluorescent, 13C hyperpolarized, nanodiamonds and pathways for their use as multi-modal (optical
and MRI) imaging and hyperpolarization agents.
