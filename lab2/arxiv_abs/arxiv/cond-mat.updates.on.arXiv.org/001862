We use exact diagonalization to study a rotating system of $N=2$ to $16$ spinless bosons confined
in quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap and interacting via repulsive finite-range Gaussian
potential with large $s$-wave scattering length. The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix
using Davidson algorithm, in subspaces of quantized total angular momenta $L_{z}$ in slow rotating
regime $0 \le L_{z} \le 2N$ is carried out to obtain the $N$-body lowest eigenenergy and eigenstate.
To bring out the effect of quantum (Bose) statistics and consequent phase stiffness (rigidity)
of the variationally obtained many-body wavefunction on various physical quantities, our study
spans from few-body ($N=2$) to many-body ($N=16$) systems. Further, to examine the finite-range
effect of the repulsive Gaussian potential on many-body ground state properties of the Bose-condensate,
we obtain the lowest eigenstate, the critical angular velocity of single vortex state and the quantum
correlation (measured) in terms of von Neumann entanglement entropy and degree of condensation.
It is found that for small values of the range (measured by the parameter $\sigma$) of Gaussian potential,
the ground state energy increases for few-boson ($2\le N\le 8$) systems but decreases for many-boson
($N>8$) systems. On the other hand for relatively large values of the range of Gaussian potential,
the ground state energy exhibits a monotonic decrease, regardless of the number of bosons $N$. For
a given $N$, there is found an optimal value of the range of Gaussian potential for which the first
vortex (with $L_{z}=N$) nucleates at a lower value of the rotational angular velocity $\Omega_{\bf
c1}$ compared to the zero-range ($\delta$-function) potential. Further, we observe that rotation
and interactions are competing effects with former being dominant over the latter.
