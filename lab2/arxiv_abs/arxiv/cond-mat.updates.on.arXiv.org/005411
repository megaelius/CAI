Layered van-der-Waals 2D magnetic materials are of great interest in fundamental condensed-matter
physics research, as well as for potential applications in spintronics and device physics. We present
neutron powder diffraction data using new ultra-high-pressure techniques to measure the magnetic
structure of Mott-insulating 2D honeycomb antiferromagnet FePS$_3$ at pressures up to 183 kbar
and temperatures down to 80 K. These data are complemented by high-pressure magnetometry and reverse
Monte Carlo modeling of the spin configurations. As pressure is applied, the previously-measured
ambient-pressure magnetic order switches from an antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic interplanar
interaction, and from 2D-like to 3D-like character. The overall antiferromagnetic structure
within the $ab$ planes, ferromagnetic chains antiferromagnetically coupled, is preserved, but
the magnetic propagation vector is altered from $(0\:1\:\frac{1}{2})$ to $(0\:1\:0)$, a halving
of the magnetic unit cell size. At higher pressures, coincident with the second structural transition
and the insulator-metal transition in this compound, we observe a suppression of this long-range-order
and emergence of a form of magnetic short-range order which survives above room temperature. Reverse
Monte Carlo fitting suggests this phase to be a short-ranged version of the original ambient pressure
structure - with a return to antiferromagnetic interplanar correlations. The persistence of magnetism
well into the HP-II metallic state is an observation in seeming contradiction with previous x-ray
spectroscopy results which suggest a spin-crossover transition.
