A few experiments have already detected the presence of icosahedral superclusters in undercooled
liquids, confirming a possible homogeneous nucleation of such entities as suggested by Franck.
These superclusters survive in melts above the crystal melting temperature Tm because all their
surface atoms have the same fusion heat as their core atoms and are melted by homogeneous nucleation
of liquid in their core, depending on overheating time and temperature. In complete contrast to
current ideas, a long time is necessary to melt them and to attain the thermodynamic equilibrium
above Tm. They act as heterogeneous growth nuclei of crystallized phase at a temperature Tc of the
undercooled melt when they are not melted. They contribute to the reduction of the critical barrier,
which becomes smaller than that of crystals containing the same atom number n. The undercooling
rate is always limited, even in a liquid at thermodynamic equilibrium, because the homogeneous
nucleation of 13-atom superclusters reduces the energy barrier, and increases Tc above the homogeneous
nucleation temperature equal to Tm/3 in liquid elements. After weak superheating, the most stable
superclusters containing n = 13, 55, 147, 309 and 561 atoms survive or melt and determine Tc during
undercooling, which depends on n and on the sample volume. The experimental nucleation temperatures
Tc of 32 liquid elements and the melting temperatures of superclusters are predicted without any
adjustable parameter using a sample volume varying by nearly 18 orders of magnitude. The classical
Gibbs free energy change is used, adding an enthalpy saving related to the Laplace pressure change
associated with supercluster formation, which is quantified and strongly weakened for n = 13 and
55.
