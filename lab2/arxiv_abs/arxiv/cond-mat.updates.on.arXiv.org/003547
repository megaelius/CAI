Spin chains with symmetry-protected edge modes are promising candidates to realize intrinsically
robust physical qubits that can be used for the storage and processing of quantum information. In
any experimental realization of such physical systems, weak perturbations in the form of induced
interactions and disorder are unavoidable and can be detrimental to the stored information. At
the same time, the latter may in fact be beneficial; for instance by deliberately inducing disorder
which causes the system to localize. In this work, we explore the potential of using an $XZX$ cluster
Hamiltonian to encode quantum information into the local edge modes and comprehensively investigate
the influence of both many-body interactions and disorder on their stability over time, adding
substance to the narrative that many-body localization may stabilize quantum information. We
recover the edge state at each time step, allowing us to reconstruct the quantum channel that captures
the locally constrained out of equilibrium time evolution. With this representation in hand, we
analyze how well classical and quantum information are preserved over time as a function of disorder
and interactions. We find that the performance of the edge qubits varies dramatically between disorder
realizations. Whereas some show a smooth decoherence over time, a sizeable fraction are rapidly
rendered unusable as memories. We also find that the stability of the classical information -- a
precursor for the usefulness of the chain as a quantum memory -- depends strongly on the direction
in which the bit is encoded. When employing the chain as a genuine quantum memory, encoded qubits
are most faithfully recovered for low interaction and high disorder.
