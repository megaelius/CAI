We present a novel "linear combination of atomic orbitals"-type of approximation, enabling accurate
electronic structure calculations for systems of up to 20 or more electronically coupled quantum
dots. Using realistic single quantum dot wavefunctions as basis to expand the eigenstates of the
heterostructure, our method shows excellent agreement with full 8-band $\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{p}$
calculations, exemplarily chosen for our benchmarking comparison, with an orders of magnitude
reduction in computational time. We show that, in order to correctly predict the electronic properties
of such stacks of coupled quantum dots, it is necessary to consider the strain distribution in the
whole heterostructure. Edge effects determine the electronic structure for stacks of $\lesssim$
10 QDs, after which a homogeneous confinement region develops in the center. The overarching goal
of our investigations is to design a stack of vertically coupled quantum dots with an intra-band
staircase potential suitable as active material for a quantum-dot-based quantum cascade laser.
Following a parameter study in the In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs material system, varying quantum
dot size, material composition and inter-dot coupling strength, we show that an intra-band staircase
potential of identical transitions can in principle be realized. A species library we generated
for over 800 unique quantum dots provides easy access to the basis functions required for different
realizations of heterostructures. In the associated manuscript entitled "Room Temperature Lasing
of Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers Based on a Quantum Dot Superlattice", we investigate room temperature
lasing of a terahertz quantum cascade laser based on a two-quantum-dot unit cell superlattice.
