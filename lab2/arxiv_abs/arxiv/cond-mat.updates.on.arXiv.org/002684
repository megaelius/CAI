The study of networking mechanism is of central importance for better understanding the broader
properties and phenomena of networks. Here, we investigate the scale-free networking in urban
street networks holistically within the framework of information physics and statistical physics.
Although the number of times that a natural road (a substitute for `named' street) crosses an other
one has been widely reported to follow a scale-free probability distribution among self-organized
cities, the derivation of the statistics of urban street networks from fundamental principles
has focused very little attention. We recover the discrete Pareto probability distribution for
natural roads in self-organized cities, and foresee a nonstandard bell-shaped probability distribution
with a Paretian tail for their junctions. Our approach explicitly emphasizes the road-junction
hierarchy rather than implicitly inhibiting it as in most investigations. This holistic viewpoint
reveals an underlying Galoisean algebraic structure. So that our approach fits with the mindset
of information physics. This enables us to envisage urban street networks as evolving social systems
subject to a Boltzmann-mesoscopic entropy conservation. The passage from the underlying Galoisean
hierarchy to an underlying Paretian coherence occurs by invoking Jaynes's Maximum Entropy principle.
Ultimately, to obtain the predicted statistics, we untangle the underlying discrete Pareto probability
distribution with a binomial paired-agent social model taken at the asymptotic limit. The emerging
paradigm may apply to systems with a more intricate hierarchy. Meanwhile, along your findings,
it appears to reflect well Alexander's ideas on cities. The established statistics can be useful
to build realistic urban models and to discover underlying laws that govern our cities.
