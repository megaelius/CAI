X-ray diffraction (XRD) for crystal structure characterization is among the most time-consuming
and complex steps in the development cycle of novel materials. We propose a machine-learning-enabled
approach to predict crystallographic dimensionality and space group from a limited number of experimental
thin-film XRD patterns. We overcome the sparse-data problem intrinsic to novel materials development
by coupling a supervised machine-learning approach with a physics-based data augmentation strategy
. Using this approach, XRD spectrum acquisition and analysis occurs under 5.5 minutes, with accuracy
comparable to human expert labeling. We simulate experimental powder diffraction patterns from
crystallographic information contained in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD).
We train a classification algorithm using a combination of labeled simulated and experimental
augmented datasets, which account for thin-film characteristics and measurement noise. As a test
case, 88 metal-halide thin films spanning 3 dimensionalities and 7 space-groups are synthesized
and classified. The accuracies and throughputs of multiple machine-learning techniques are evaluated,
along with the effect of augmented dataset size. The most accurate classification algorithm is
found to be a feed-forward deep neural network. The calculated accuracies for dimensionality and
space-group classification are comparable to ground-truth labelling by a human expert, approximately
90\% and 85\%, respectively. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the maximum XRD spectrum
step size (data acquisition rate) before loss of predictive accuracy occurs, and determine it to
be \ang{0.16} $2\theta $, which enables an XRD spectrum to be obtained and analyzed in 5 minutes or
less.
