The use of integrated MicroElectroMechanical systems (MEMS) is recently spread thanks to their
improved sensitivity, accuracy and reliability. Accurate preliminary computations born from
the need of high precision in the manufacturing process of such devices. Piezoelectric materials
are broadly employed in this field as direct converters between mechanical and electrical signals
and some of these piezoelectric materials show pyroelectric features, which involve thermo-electrical
interactions. Pyroelectric bending actuators are analyzed in the present study in plane conditions.
They consists of active PZT layers with in-plane polarization and a microstructured composite
layer characterized by a periodic microstructure where PZT fibers with an out of plane polarization
are immersed in a polymeric matrix. The constitutive law of the composite layer at the macroscale
has been determined by means of a multi-field asymptotic homogenization technique, recently developed
for thermo-piezoelectric materials. Overall constitutive equations characterizing the behavior
of the microstructured layer at the macroscale have been derived and the closed form of the overall
constitutive tensors has been provided for the equivalent first-order (Cauchy) homogenized continuum.
Deflection of unimorph and bimorph bender actuators has been investigated in relation to their
geometrical features, exploiting the out of plane piezoelectric properties of the composite layer,
which modify the stiffness of the entire bender. An accurate description of benders behavior at
the structural length scale is of fundamental importance in order to design devices with high performances.
In this regard, the influence of the microstructure on the global response of the actuator is investigated
in the present study in order to understand how the composite material can be tailored to meet specific
design requirements.
