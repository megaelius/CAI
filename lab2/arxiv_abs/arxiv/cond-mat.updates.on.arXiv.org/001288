Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are an emergent class of metamaterials comprised of vertically
stacked two-dimensional (2D) building blocks, which provide us with a vast tool set to engineer
their properties on top of the already rich tunability of 2D materials. One of the knobs, the twist
angle between different layers, plays a crucial role in the ultimate electronic properties of a
vdW heterostructure and does not have a direct analog in other systems such as MBE-grown semiconductor
heterostructures. For small twist angles, the moir\'e pattern produced by the lattice misorientation
creates a long-range modulation. So far, the study of the effect of twist angles in vdW heterostructures
has been mostly concentrated in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) twisted structures,
which exhibit relatively weak interlayer interaction due to the presence of a large bandgap in h-BN.
Here we show that when two graphene sheets are twisted by an angle close to the theoretically predicted
'magic angle', the resulting flat band structure near charge neutrality gives rise to a strongly-correlated
electronic system. These flat bands exhibit half-filling insulating phases at zero magnetic field,
which we show to be a Mott-like insulator arising from electrons localized in the moir\'e superlattice.
These unique properties of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TwBLG) open up a new playground
for exotic many-body quantum phases in a 2D platform made of pure carbon and without magnetic field.
The easy accessibility of the flat bands, the electrical tunability, and the bandwidth tunability
though twist angle may pave the way towards more exotic correlated systems, such as unconventional
superconductors or quantum spin liquids.
