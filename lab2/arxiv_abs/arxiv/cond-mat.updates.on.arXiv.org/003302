In a certain regime of low carrier densities and strong correlations, electrons can crystallize
into a periodic arrangement of charge known as Wigner crystal. Such phases are particularly interesting
in one dimension (1D) as they display a variety of charge and spin ground states which may be harnessed
in quantum devices as high-fidelity transmitters of spin information. Recent theoretical studies
suggest that the strong Coulomb interactions in Mott insulators and other flat band systems, may
provide an attractive higher temperature platform for Wigner crystallization, but due to materials
and device constraints experimental realization has proven difficult. In this work we use scanning
tunneling microscopy at liquid helium temperatures to directly image the formation of a 1D Wigner
crystal in a Mott insulator, TaS$_2$. Charge density wave domain walls in TaS$_2$ create band bending
and provide ideal conditions of low densities and strong interactions in 1D. STM spectroscopic
maps show that once the lower Hubbard band crosses the Fermi energy, the charges rearrange to minimize
Coulomb energy, forming zigzag patterns expected for a 1D Wigner crystal. The zigzag charge patterns
show characteristic noise signatures signifying charge or spin fluctuations induced by the tunneling
electrons, which is expected for this more fragile condensed state. The observation of a Wigner
crystal at orders of magnitude higher temperatures enabled by the large Coulomb energy scales combined
with the low density of electrons, makes TaS$_2$ a promising system for exploiting the charge and
spin order in 1D Wigner crystals.
