The most promising mechanisms for the formation of Majorana bound states (MBSs) in condensed matter
systems involve one-dimensional systems (such as semiconductor nanowires, magnetic chains,
and quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) edges) proximitized to superconducting materials. The
choice between each of these options involves trade-offs between several factors such as reproducibility
of results, system tunability, and robustness of the resulting MBS. In this article, we propose
that a combination of two of these systems, namely a magnetic chain deposited on a QSHI edge in contact
with a superconducting surface, offers a better choice of tunability and MBS robustness compared
to magnetic chain deposited on bulk. We study how the QSHI edge interacts with the magnetic chain,
and see how the topological phase is affected by edge proximity. We show that MBSs near the edge can
be realized with lower chemical potential and Zeeman field than the ones inside the bulk, independently
of the chain's magnetic order (ferromagnetic or spiral order). Different magnetic orderings in
the chain modify the overall phase diagram, even suppressing the boundless topological phase found
in the bulk for chains located at the QSHI edge. Moreover, we quantify the "quality" of MBSs by calculating
the Majorana Polarization (MP) for different configurations. For chains located at the edge, the
MP is close to its maximum value already for short chains. For chains located away from the edge, longer
chains are needed to attain the same quality as chains located at the edge. The MP also oscillates
in phase with the in-gap states, which is relatively unexpected as peaks in the energy spectrum corresponds
to stronger overlap of MBSs.
