We extend the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory of atomically rough bcc-liquid interfaces [Wu {\it et
al.}, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{73}, 094101 (2006)] outside of equilibrium. We use this extension to
derive an analytical expression for the kinetic coefficient, which is the proportionality constant
$\mu(\hat n)$ between the interface velocity along a direction $\hat n$ normal to the interface
and the interface undercooling. The kinetic coefficient is expressed as a spatial integral along
the normal direction of a sum of gradient square terms corresponding to different nonlinear density
wave profiles. Anisotropy arises naturally from the dependence of those profiles on the angles
between the principal reciprocal lattice vectors $\vec K_i$ and $\hat n$. Values of the kinetic
coefficient for the$(100)$, $(110)$ and $(111)$ interfaces are compared quantitatively to the
prediction of linear Mikheev-Chernov (MC) theory [J. Cryst. Growth \textbf{112}, 591 (1991)]
and previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of crystallization kinetics for a classical
model of Fe. Additional MD simulations are carried out here to compute the relaxation time of density
waves in the liquid in order to make this comparison free of fit parameter. The GL theory predicts
a similar expression for $\mu$ as the MC theory but yields a better agreement with MD simulations
for both its magnitude and anisotropy due to a fully nonlinear description of density wave profiles
across the solid-liquid interface. GL theory is also used to derive an inverse relation between
$\mu$ and the solid-liquid interfacial free-energy. The general methodology used here to derive
an expression for $\mu(\hat n)$ also applies to amplitude equations derived from the phase-field-crystal
model, which only differ from GL theory by the choice of cubic and higher order nonlinearities in
the free-energy density.
