In magnetic topological insulators (TIs), the interplay between magnetic order and nontrivial
topology can induce fascinating topological quantum phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous
Hall effect, chiral Majorana fermions and axion electrodynamics. Recently, a great deal of attention
has been focused on the intrinsic magnetic TIs, where disorder effects can be eliminated to a large
extent, which is expected to facilitate the emergence of topological quantum phenomena. In despite
of intensive efforts, the experimental evidence of topological surface states (SSs) remains elusive.
Here, by combining first-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) experiments, we have revealed that EnSn2As2 is an antiferromagnetic TI with observation
of Dirac SSs consistent with our prediction. We also observed gapless Dirac SSs in another antiferromagnetic
TI MnBi2Te4, which were missed in previous ARPES study. These results provide clear evidence for
nontrivial topology of the two intrinsic magnetic TIs. Moreover, the topological SSs show no observable
changes across the magnetic transitions within the experimental resolution, indicating that
the magnetic order has limited effect on the topological SSs, which can be attributed to weak hybridization
between the magnetic states and the topological electronic states. This provides insights for
further studies that the correlations between magnetism and topological states need to be strengthened
to induce larger gaps of the topological SSs, which will facilitate the realization of topological
quantum phenomena at higher temperatures.
