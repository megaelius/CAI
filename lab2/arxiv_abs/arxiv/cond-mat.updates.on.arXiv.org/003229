The recently proposed crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) offers a highly versatile
and accurate machine learning (ML) framework by learning material properties directly from graph-like
representations of crystal structures ("crystal graphs"). Here, we develop an improved variant
of the CGCNN model (iCGCNN) that outperforms the original by incorporating information of the Voronoi
tessellated crystal structure, explicit 3-body correlations of neighboring constituent atoms,
and an optimized chemical representation of interatomic bonds in the crystal graphs. We demonstrate
the accuracy of the improved framework in two distinct illustrations: First, when trained/validated
on 180,000/20,000 density functional theory (DFT) calculated thermodynamic stability entries
taken from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and evaluated on a separate test set of 230,000
entries, iCGCNN achieves a predictive accuracy that is significantly improved, i.e., 20% higher
than that of the original CGCNN. Second, when used to assist high-throughput search for materials
in the ThCr2Si2 structure-type, iCGCNN exhibited a success rate of 31% which is 310 times higher
than an undirected high-throughput search and 2.4 times higher than that of the original CGCNN.
Using both CGCNN and iCGCNN, we screened 132,600 compounds with elemental decorations of the ThCr2Si2
prototype crystal structure and identified a total of 97 new unique stable compounds by performing
757 DFT calculations, accelerating the computational time of the high-throughput search by a factor
of 130. Our results suggest that the iCGCNN can be used to accelerate high-throughput discoveries
of new materials by quickly and accurately identifying crystalline compounds with properties
of interest.
