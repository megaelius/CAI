It is very important to identify carrier molecules of astronomical interstellar infrared spectrum
(IR) to understand chemical evolution step of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in the universe.
In our previous study, it was suggested that coronene (C24H12) related PAH could reproduce such
IR by the first principles quantum chemical calculation. In this paper, PAH candidates were enhanced
to circumcoronene (C54H18) related molecules. Well known PAH oriented wavelength of 6.2, 7.7,
8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 micrometer were reproduced well by a void induced mono-cation (C53H18) having
hydrocarbon two pentagons combined with 17 hexagons. Typical astronomical object are the red rectangle
nebula and NGC6946, which is categorized as Type-B sectrum. Neutral circumcoronene show very strong
IR peak at 11.1 micrometer, which is noted as Type-A spectrum observed in NGC1316 and NGC4589. Ubiquitously
well observed spectrum was noted as Type-C, which could be explained by a suitable combination of
Type-B and Type-A. Type-C objects are NGC7023, NGC2023 and so many. It should be noted that a dehydrogenated
pure carbon mono-cation molecule (C53) show IR peaks at 6.3, 7.8, 8.5 micrometer, but no peak at 11.3
micrometer, which newly defined as Type-E. Such a strange characteristic can contribute to explain
IR intensity ratio. Observed intensity ratio between peaks of 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 micrometer
each other were compared with above calculated IR intensities. Major intensity ratio was well reproduced
by Type-B molecules. Variation of observed intensity ratio could be explained by a mixture degree
between Type-B and Type-A, and also a mixture degree between Type-B and Type-E.
