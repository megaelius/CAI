We have carried out detailed bulk and local probe studies on the hexagonal oxides Ba3MIr2O9 (M=Sc,Y)
where Ir is expected to have a fractional oxidation state of +4.5. In the structure, Ir-Ir dimers
are arranged in an edge shared triangular network parallel to the ab plane. Whereas only weak anomalies
are evident in the susceptibility data, clearer anomalies are present in the heat capacity data.
Our 45Sc nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lineshape (first order quadrupole split) is symmetric
at room temperature but becomes progressively asymmetric with decreasing temperatures. This
is suggestive of distortions in the structure which could arise from progressive tilt/rotation
of the IrO6 octahedra with a decrease in temperature T. The 45Sc NMR spectral weight shifts near the
reference frequency with decreasing T indicating the development of magnetic singlet regions.
Around 10K, a significant change in the spectrum takes place with a large intensity appearing near
the reference frequency but with the spectrum remaining multi-peak. It appears from our 45Sc NMR
data that in Ba3ScIr2O9 significant disorder is still present below 10K. In the case of Ba3YIr2O9,
the 89Y NMR spectral lines are asymmetric at high temperatures but become nearly symmetric (single
magnetic environment) below T~70K. Our 89Y spectra and T1 measurements confirm the onset of long
range ordering (LRO) from a bulk of the sample at 4K in this compound. Our results suggest that Ba3YIr2O9
might be structurally distorted at room temperature (via, for example, tilt/rotations of the IrO6
octahedra) but becomes progressively a regular triangular lattice with decreasing T. The effective
magnetic moments and magnetic entropy changes are strongly reduced in Ba3YIr2O9 as compared to
those expected for a S=1/2 system. Similar effects have been found in other iridates which naturally
have strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC).
