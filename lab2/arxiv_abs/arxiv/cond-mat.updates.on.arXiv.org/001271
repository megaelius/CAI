The force per unit area on the surface of a colloidal particle is a fundamental dynamical quantity
in the mechanics and statistical mechanics of colloidal suspensions. Here we compute it in the limit
of slow viscous flow for a suspension of $N$ spherical active colloids in which activity is represented
by surface slip. Our result is best expressed as a set of linear relations, the "generalized Stokes
laws", between the coefficients of a tensorial spherical harmonic expansion of the force per unit
area and the surface slip. The generalized friction tensors in these laws are many-body functions
of the colloidal configuration and can be obtained to any desired accuracy by solving a system of
linear equations. Quantities derived from the force per unit area - forces, torques and stresslets
on the colloids and flow, pressure and entropy production in the fluid - have succinct expressions
in terms of the generalized Stokes laws. Most notably, the active forces and torques have a dissipative,
long-ranged, many-body character that can cause phase separation, crystallization, synchronization
and a variety of other effects observed in active suspensions. We use the results above to derive
the Langevin and Smoluchowski equations for Brownian active suspensions, to compute active contributions
to the suspension stress and fluid pressure, and to relate the synchrony in a lattice of harmonically
trapped active colloids to entropy production. Our results provide the basis for a microscopic
theory of active Brownian suspensions that consistently accounts for momentum conservation in
the bulk fluid and at fluid-solid boundaries
