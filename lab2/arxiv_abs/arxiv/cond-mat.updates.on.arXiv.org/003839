Today, digital data transmission relies on the parallel transmission of information employing
wavelength (WDM) or frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For quantum communication, such superchannels
enable the creation of hyperentangled states. Nonlinear optics has been employed to harness this
quantum resource by creating an entangled state of a quantum register formed by different teeth
of a frequency comb. However to date, frequency combs and derived quantum technologies are generated
by photonic means, rigorously described by Maxwell's classical theory of electromagnetism. Here
we report on the realization of a tunable frequency comb of non-classical light, single photons.
This comb is emitted from a single semiconductor quantum dot (QD) by coherent optical and surface
acoustic waves (SAWs) acting on its exciton transition. The coherent optomechanical interaction
mixes optical frequencies at $\omega_{opt}/2 \pi \simeq 330$ THz and radio frequencies of phonons
at $\omega_{SAW}/2\pi \geq 1$ GHz. Thus, a comb of sidebands is generated in the scattered light
spectrum, precisely split by $\omega_{SAW}$. We show that the nonlinear interaction between two
mutually coherent SAW fields at $\omega_{SAW}^{(1)}$ and $\omega_{SAW}^{(2)}=2\omega _{SAW}^{(1)}$
creates a highly stable and tunable comb. We observe frequency rungs of scattered photon intensities
in the time domain for deliberately set detunings $\Delta _{SAW}/2\pi$ as small as 50 $\mathrm{\mu}$Hz.
This extremely stable quantum frequency comb may enable practical quantum technologies, for instance
quantum clock synchronization or frequency comb spectroscopy at the single photon level.
