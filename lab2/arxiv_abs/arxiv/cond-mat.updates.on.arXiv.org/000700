In all known fermionic superfluids, Cooper pairs are composed of spin-1/2 quasi-particles that
pair to form either spin-singlet or spin-triplet bound states. The "spin" of a Bloch electron, however,
is fixed by the symmetries of the crystal and the atomic orbitals from which it is derived, and in some
cases can behave as if it were a spin-3/2 particle. The superconducting state of such a system allows
pairing beyond spin-triplet, with higher spin quasi-particles combining to form quintet or septet
pairs. Here, we report evidence of unconventional superconductivity emerging from a spin-3/2
quasiparticle electronic structure in the half-Heusler semimetal YPtBi, a low-carrier density
noncentrosymmetric cubic material with a high symmetry that preserves the $p$-like $j=3/2$ manifold
in the Bi-based $\Gamma_8$ band in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling. With a striking linear
temperature dependence of the London penetration depth, the existence of line nodes in the superconducting
order parameter $\Delta$ is directly explained by a mixed-parity Cooper pairing model with high
total angular momentum, consistent with a high-spin fermionic superfluid state. We propose a $\mathbf{k\cdot
p}$ model of the $j=3/2$ fermions to explain how a dominant $J$=3 septet pairing state is the simplest
solution that naturally produces nodes in the mixed even-odd parity gap. Together with the underlying
topologically non-trivial band structure, the unconventional pairing in this system represents
a truly novel form of superfluidity that has strong potential for leading the development of a new
generation of topological superconductors.
