We investigate the photoinduced effect to the silicene, which is a topological insulator, by the
circularly polarized light in off-resonance regime with a frequency much larger than the critical
value (also much larger than the frequency about the particle-hole pair creation), and with a perpendicular
electric field. The anomalous Rabi frequency which is a non-linear optical, arised by the off-resonance
circularly polarized light. The temporal behavior of the pseudospin, valley, and spin degrees
of freedom, which are momentum- and quasienergy-dependent, are explored. The anomalous Rabi oscillation
is also related to the photoinduced topological phase transition between the topological trivial
state with zero Chern number and gapped edge state and the topological nontrivial state with nonzero
Chern number and gapless edge state. The off-resonance laser can also induce the topological phase
transition by manipulating the energy band structure, rather than excite the atoms to the high quantum-number
states like the resonance light. The exchange between the radiation driving field and the two-component
dynamical polarizations with the dipole oscillation, plays a important role in the determination
of the out-of-plane spin polarization and the motion of the center of mass, which can induced a collapse-and-revival
pattern under a certain condition. The Rabi oscillation observed in the motion of the center of mass
in a laser-induced harmonic potential can be used to detect the time evolution of the atom polulation.
Our results can also be applied to the other two-dimension low-energy Dirac models or the surface
of the three-dimension topological insulators, and even the weyl semimetal with the photoinduced
topological phase transition.
