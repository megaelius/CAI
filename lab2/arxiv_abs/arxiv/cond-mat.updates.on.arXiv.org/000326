We investigate the ground-state properties of trapped fermion systems described by the Hubbard
model with an external confining potential. We discuss the universal behaviors of systems in different
regimes: from few particles, i.e. in dilute regime, to the trap thermodynamic limit. The asymptotic
trap-size (TS) dependence in the dilute regime (increasing the trap size l keeping the particle
number N fixed) is described by a universal TS scaling controlled by the dilute fixed point associated
with the metal-to-vacuum quantum transition. This scaling behavior is numerically checked by
DMRG simulations of the one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard model. In particular, the particle density
and its correlations show crossovers among different regimes: for strongly repulsive interactions
they approach those of a spinless Fermi gas, for weak interactions those of a free Fermi gas, and for
strongly attractive interactions they match those of a gas of hard-core bosonic molecules. The
large-N behavior of systems at fixed N/l corresponds to a 1D trap thermodynamic limit. We address
issues related to the accuracy of the local density approximation (LDA). We show that the particle
density approaches its LDA in the large-l limit. When the trapped system is in the metallic phase,
corrections at finite l are O(l^{-1}) and oscillating around the center of the trap. They become
significantly larger at the boundary of the fermion cloud, where they get suppressed as O(l^{-1/3})
only. This anomalous behavior arises from the nontrivial scaling at the metal-to-vacuum transition
occurring at the boundaries of the fermion cloud.
