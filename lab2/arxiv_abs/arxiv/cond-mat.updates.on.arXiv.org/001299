Local electronic effects in the vicinity of an impurity provide pivotal insight into the origin
of unconventional superconductivity, especially when the materials are located on the edge of
magnetic instability. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, a strong suppression of
superconductivity and appearance of low-energy bound states are clearly observed near nonmagnetic
impurities. However, whether these features are common to other strongly correlated superconductors
has not been established experimentally. Here, we report the {$in$} {$situ$} scanning tunneling
microscopy observation of electronic structure around a nonmagnetic Zn impurity in heavy-fermion
CeCo(In$_{1-x}$Zn$_x$)$_5$ films, which are epitaxially grown by the state-of-the-art molecular
beam epitaxy technique. The films have very wide atomically flat terraces and Zn atoms residing
on two different In sites are clearly resolved. Remarkably, no discernible change is observed for
the superconducting gap at and around the Zn atoms. Moreover, the local density of states around
Zn atoms shows little change inside the $c$-$f$ hybridization gap, which is consistent with calculations
for a periodic Anderson model without local magnetic order. These results indicate that no nonsuperconducting
region is induced around a Zn impurity and do not support the scenario of antiferromagnetic droplet
formation suggested by indirect measurements in Cd-doped CeCoIn$_5$. These results also highlight
a significant difference of the impurity effect between cuprates and CeCoIn$_5$, in both of which
$d$-wave superconductivity arises from the non-Fermi liquid normal state near antiferromagnetic
instabilities.
