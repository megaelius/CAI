In this paper we present a comprehensive study of magnetic dynamics in the rare-earth orthoferrite
YbFeO$_3$ at temperatures below and above the spin-reorientation (SR) transition $T_{\mathrm{SR}}=7.6$
K, in magnetic fields applied along the $a, b$ and $c$ axes. Using single-crystal inelastic neutron
scattering, we observed that the spectrum of magnetic excitations consists of two collective modes
well separated in energy: 3D gapped magnons with a bandwidth of $\sim$60 meV, associated with the
antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered Fe subsystem, and quasi-1D AFM fluctuations of $\sim$1 meV
within the Yb subsystem, with no hybridization of those modes. The spin dynamics of the Fe subsystem
changes very little through the SR transition and could be well described in the frame of semiclassical
linear spin-wave theory. On the other hand, the rotation of the net moment of the Fe subsystem at $T_{\mathrm{SR}}$
drastically changes the excitation spectrum of the Yb subsystem, inducing the transition between
two regimes with magnon and spinon-like fluctuations. At $T < T_{\mathrm{SR}}$, the Yb spin chains
have a well defined field-induced ferromagnetic (FM) ground state, and the spectrum consists of
a sharp single-magnon mode, a two-magnon bound state, and a two-magnon continuum, whereas at $T
> T_{\mathrm{SR}}$ only a gapped broad spinon-like continuum dominates the spectrum. In this work
we show that a weak quasi-1D coupling within the Yb subsystem $J_\text{Yb-Yb}$, mainly neglected
in previous studies, creates unusual quantum spin dynamics on the low energy scales. The results
of our work may stimulate further experimental search for similar compounds with several magnetic
subsystems and energy scales, where low-energy fluctuations and underlying physics could be "hidden"
by a dominating interaction.
