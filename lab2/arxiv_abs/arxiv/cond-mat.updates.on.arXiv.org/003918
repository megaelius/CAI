Creation of sharp lateral p-n junctions in graphene devices, with transition widths well below
the Fermi wavelength of graphene charge carriers, is vital to study and exploit these electronic
systems for electron-optical applications. The achievement of such junctions is, however, not
trivial due to the presence of a considerable out-of-plane electric field in lateral p-n junctions,
resulting in large widths. Metal-graphene interfaces represent a novel, promising and easy to
implement technique to engineer such sharp lateral p-n junctions in graphene field-effect devices,
in clear contrast to the much wider (i.e. smooth) junctions achieved via conventional local gating.
In this work, we present a systematic and robust investigation of the electrostatic problem of metal-induced
lateral p-n junctions in gated graphene devices for electron-optics applications, systems where
the width of the created junctions is not only determined by the metal used but also depends on external
factors such as device geometries, dielectric environment and different operational parameters
such as carrier density and temperature. Our calculations demonstrate that sharp junctions can
be achieved via metal-graphene interfaces at room temperature in devices surrounded by dielectric
media with low relative permittivity. In addition, we show how specific details such as the separation
distance between metal and graphene and the permittivity of the gap in-between plays a critical
role when defining the p-n junction, not only defining its width w but also the energy shift of graphene
underneath the metal. These results can be extended to any two-dimensional (2D) electronic system
doped by the presence of metal clusters and thus are relevant for understanding interfaces between
metals and other 2D materials.
