Transport and diffusion of heat in one dimensional (1D) nonlinear systems which {\it conserve momentum}
is typically thought to proceed anomalously. Notable exceptions, however, exist of which the rotator
model is a prominent case. Therefore, the quest arises to identify the origin of manifest anomalous
transport in those low dimensional systems. Here, we develop the theory for both, momentum/heat
diffusion and its corresponding momentum/heat transport. We demonstrate that the second temporal
derivative of the mean squared deviation of the momentum spread is proportional to the equilibrium
correlation of the total momentum flux. This result in turn relates, via the integrated momentum
flux correlation, to an effective viscosity, or equivalently, to the underlying momentum diffusivity.
We put forward the intriguing hypothesis that a fluid-like momentum dynamics with a {\it finite
viscosity} causes {\it normal} heat transport; its corollary being that superdiffusive momentum
diffusion with an intrinsic {\it diverging viscosity} in turn yields {\it anomalous} heat transport.
This very hypothesis is corroborated over wide extended time scales by use of precise molecular
dynamics simulations. The numerical validation of the hypothesis involves three distinct archetype
classes of nonlinear pair-interaction potentials: (i) a globally bounded pair interaction (the
noted rotator model), (ii) unbounded interactions acting at large distances (the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam
$\beta$ model, or the rotator model amended with harmonic pair interactions) and (iii), a pair interaction
potential being unbounded at short distances while displaying an asymptotic free part (Lennard-Jones
model).
