Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is one of the most promising methods for investigating the structure
of materials at the micro and nanoscale levels, as well as their local physical-mechanical properties.
The experimental data obtained with the help of AFM have a serious problem of assessing the accuracy
and reliability. This is especially pronounced when studying materials with a strong mechanical
structural heterogeneity. Such materials include considered in this paper elastomers, filled
with rigid dispersed particles. The article presents a technique for mathematical processing
of such experimental data, which allows to significantly improve the accuracy of their interpretation.
It is based on the use of three criteria for filtering and processing the initially obtained experimental
information. 1) The criterion of the "relief of the nanoscale", which makes it possible to extract
a relief with objects of low curvature from the overall picture obtained. It is on it that the filler
particles protruding on the surface are clearly visible (usually covered with a thin film of elastomeric
binder, known in the literature as bound rubber). 2) "Adhesion deflection" criterion, by means
of which it is possible to isolate the filler particles by changing the adhesion forces between the
AFM probe and the sample surface. 3) The criterion of "indentational compliance", designed to determine
the location and stiffness of the filler particles. All these criteria were used to decode the AFM
scanning data of the surface of disperse filled elastomeric composite. Optimal conditions for
the application of each of the criteria were determined from the analysis of the results obtained.
Also, the accuracy of the experimental results was estimated on the basis of a comparison of the data
obtained with the forward and reverse horizontal motion of the AFM probe when scanning the same surface
area.
