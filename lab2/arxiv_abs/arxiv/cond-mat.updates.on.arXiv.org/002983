Nonlocal compensation of magnetic damping by spin injection has been theoretically shown to establish
dynamic, noncollinear magnetization states that carry spin currents over micrometer distances.
Such states can be generically referred to as dissipative exchange flows (DEFs) because spatially
diffusing spin currents are established by the mutual exchange torque exerted by neighboring spins.
Analytical studies to date have been limited to the weak spin injection assumption whereby the equation
of motion for the magnetization is mapped to hydrodynamic equations describing spin flow and then
linearized. Here, we analytically and numerically study easy-plane ferromagnetic channels subject
to spin injection of arbitrary strength at one extremum under a unified hydrodynamic framework.
We find that DEFs generally exhibit a nonlinear profile along the channel accompanied by a nonlinear
frequency tuneability. At large injection strengths, we fully characterize a novel magnetization
state we call a contact-soliton DEF (CS-DEF) composed of a stationary soliton at the injection site,
which smoothly transitions into a DEF and exhibits a negative frequency tuneability. The transition
between a DEF and a CS-DEF occurs at the maximum precessional frequency and coincides with the Landau
criterion: a subsonic to supersonic flow transition. Leveraging the hydraulic-electrical analogy,
the current-voltage characteristics of a nonlinear DEF circuit are presented. Micromagnetic
simulations of nanowires that include magnetocrystalline anisotropy and non-local dipole fields
are in qualitative agreement with the analytical results. The magnetization states found here
along with their characteristic profile and spectral features provide quantitative guidelines
to pursue an experimental demonstration of DEFs in ferromagnetic materials and establishes a unified
description for long-distance spin transport.
