We discuss a method to calculate with quantum molecular dynamics simulations the rate of energy
exchanges between electrons and ions in two-temperature plasmas, liquid metals and hot solids.
Promising results from this method were recently reported for various materials and physical conditions
[J. Simoni and J. Daligault, Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 205001 (2019)]. Like other ab-initio calculations,
the approach offers a very useful comparison with the experimental measurements and permits an
extension into conditions not covered by the experiments. The energy relaxation rate is related
to the friction coefficients felt by individual ions due to their non-adiabatic interactions with
electrons. Each coefficient satisfies a Kubo relation given by the time integral of the autocorrelation
function of the interaction force between an ion and the electrons. These Kubo relations are evaluated
using the output of quantum molecular dynamics calculations in which electrons are treated in the
framework of finite-temperature density functional theory. The calculation presents difficulties
that are unlike those encountered with the Kubo formulas for the electrical and thermal conductivities.
In particular, the widely used Kubo-Greenwood approximation is inapplicable here. Indeed, the
friction coefficients and the energy relaxation rate diverge in this approximation since it does
not properly account for the electronic screening of electron-ion interactions. The inclusion
of screening effects considerably complicates the calculations. We discuss the physically-motivated
approximations we applied to deal with these complications in order to investigate a widest range
of materials and physical conditions.
