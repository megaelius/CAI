The semiconducting behaviour and optoelectronic response of gallium nitride is governed by point
defect processes, which are poorly understood. Using hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical
(QM/MM) embedded cluster calculations, we investigate the structure, formation and ionisation
energies, and equilibrium concentrations of native point defects in GaN including vacancies,
interstitials, and antisites. We employ two thermochemical and kinetic exchange-and-correlation
density functionals (B97-2 and BB1k). Calculated ionisation energies are used to provide optical
and adiabatic defect levels, which can guide the assignment of experimental spectroscopic signals.
We show that vacancies are the most thermodynamically favourable native defects in GaN; the nitrogen
vacancy contributes to the n-type character of as grown GaN; and the gallium vacancy cannot act as
an acceptor defect. We confirm the most stable geometries of Ga and N interstitials as octahedral
and split, respectively. By computing equilibrium defect and carrier concentrations, we show
that GaN can be easily doped n-type, but, even if all fully ionised, acceptor dopants will be compensated
by vacancies and no significant hole concentrations will be observed, indicating that non-equilibrium
processes must dominate in p-type GaN. We discuss possible assignments for the sources of infrared,
red, yellow, green, blue and ultraviolet luminescence peaks observed in GaN, as well as other spectroscopic
signatures. Finally, we calculate the effective-mass-like levels associated with electrons
and holes bound in diffuse orbitals, and show that including such levels in luminescence processes
may explain the observed 3.46 and 3.27 eV UV peaks observed in a broad range of GaN samples as being
due to the presence of nitrogen vacancies.
