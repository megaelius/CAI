We report inelastic neutron scattering experiments in Ca2Y2Cu5O10 and map out the full one magnon
dispersion which extends up to a record value of 53 meV for frustrated ferromagnetic (FM) edge-sharing
CuO2 chain (FFESC) cuprates. A homogeneous spin-1/2 chain model with a FM nearest-neighbor (NN),
an antiferromagnetic (AFM) next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) inchain, and two diagonal AFM interchain
couplings (ICs) analyzed within linear spin-wave theory (LSWT) reproduces well the observed strong
dispersion along the chains and a weak one perpendicularly. The ratio R=|J_{a2}/J_{a1}| of the
FM NN and the AFM NNN couplings is found as ~0.23, close to the critical point Rc=1/4 which separates
ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically correlated spiral magnetic ground states in single
chains, whereas Rc>0.25 for coupled chains is considerably upshifted even for relatively weak
IC. Although the measured dispersion can be described by homogeneous LSWT, the scattering intensity
appears to be considerably reduced at ~11.5 and ~28 meV. The gap-like feature at 11.5 meV is attributed
to magnon-phonon coupling whereas based on DMRG simulations of the dynamical structure factor
the gap at 28 meV is considered to stem partly from quantum effects due to the AFM IC. Another contribution
is ascribed to the intrinsic superstructure from the distorting incommensurate pattern of CaY
cationic chains adjacent to the CuO2 ones. It gives rise to non-equivalent CuO4 units and Cu-O-Cu
bond angles Phi and a resulting distribution of all exchange integrals. The J's fitted by homogeneous
LSWT are regarded as average values. The record value of the FM NN integral J1=24 meV among FFESC cuprates
can be explained by a non-universal Phi (not 90 deg.) and Cu-O bond length dependent anisotropic
mean direct FM Cu-O exchange K_{pd}~120 meV. Enhanced K_{pd} values are also needed to compensate
a significant AFM J_{dd} > ~6 meV.
