We study the thermodynamic properties of dimerized spin-gapped quantum magnets with and without
exchange anisotropy (EA) and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) anisotropies within the mean-field approximation.
For this, we obtain the thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ of a triplon gas taking into account the
strength of DM interaction up to second order. The minimization of $\Omega$ with respect to self-energies
yields the equation for $X_{1,2}=\Sigma_n\pm\Sigma_{an}-\mu$, which define the dispersion
of quasiparticles $E_k=\sqrt{\epsilon_k+X_1}\sqrt{\epsilon_k+X_2}$ where $\epsilon_k$
is the bare dispersion of triplons. The minimization of $\Omega$ with respect to magnitude $\rho_0$
and phase $\Theta$ of triplon condensate leads to the coupled equations. Also, we discuss the restrictions
on $\rho_0$ and $\Theta$ imposed by these equations for systems. The requirement of dynamical stability
conditions in equilibrium, as well as the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem, particularly for isotropic
Bose condensate, impose certain conditions to the physical solutions of these equations. It is
shown that the phase angle of a purely homogenous Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) without any anisotropy
may only take values $\Theta=\pi n$ (n=0,$\pm 1,\pm 2$..) while that of BEC with even a tiny DM interaction
results in $\Theta=\pi/2+2\pi n$. In contrast to Hartree-Fock approximation, which allows arbitrary
phase angle, our approach predicts that the phase angle may have only discrete values. The consequences
of this phase-locking for interference of two Bose condensates and to their possible Josephson
junction is studied. In such quantum magnets, the emergence of a triplon condensate leads to a finite
staggered magnetization $M_\bot$, whose direction in the xy-plane is related to the condensate
phase $\Theta$. We also discuss the possible Kibble-Zurek mechanism in dimerized magnets and its
influence on $M_\bot$.
