By using the gauge-invariant optical Bloch equation, we perform a microscopic kinetic investigation
on the anomalous Hall effect in chiral p-wave superconducting states. Specifically, the intrinsic
anomalous Hall conductivity in the absence of the magnetic field is zero as a consequence of Galilean
invariance in our description. As for the extrinsic channel, a finite anomalous Hall current is
obtained from the impurity scattering with the optically excited normal quasiparticle current
even at zero temperature. From our kinetic description, it can be clearly seen that the excited normal
quasiparticle current is due to an induced center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs through the
acceleration driven by ac electric field. For the induced anomalous Hall current, we show that the
conventional skew-scattering channel in the linear response makes the dominant contribution
in the strong impurity interaction. In this case, our kinetic description as a supplementary viewpoint
mostly confirms the results of Kubo formalism in the literature. Nevertheless, in the weak impurity
interaction, this skew-scattering channel becomes marginal and we reveal that a novel induction
channel from the Born contribution dominates the anomalous Hall current. This novel channel, which
has long been overlooked in the literature, is due to the particle-hole asymmetry by nonlinear optical
excitation. Finally, we study the case in the chiral p-wave superconducting state with a transverse
conical magnetization, which breaks the Galilean invariance. In this situation, the intrinsic
anomalous Hall conductivity is no longer zero. Comparison of this intrinsic channel with the extrinsic
one from impurity scattering is addressed.
