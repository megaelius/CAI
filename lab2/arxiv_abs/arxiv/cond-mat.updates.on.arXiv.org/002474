Topological insulators are insulating bulk materials hosting conducting surface states. Their
magnetic doping breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates numerous interesting effects such
as dissipationless transport. Nonetheless, their dynamical properties are still poorly understood.
Here, we perform a systematic investigation of transverse spin excitations of $3d$ and $4d$ single
impurities embedded in two prototypical topological insulators (Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$).
The impurity-induced states within the bulk gap of the topological insulators are found to have
a drastic impact on the spin excitation spectra, resulting in very high lifetimes reaching up to
${microseconds}$. An intuitive picture of the spin dynamics is obtained by mapping onto a generalized
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenological model. The first quantity extracted from this mapping
procedure is the magnetic anisotropy energy, which is then compared to the one provided by the magnetic
force theorem. This uncovers some difficulties encountered with the latter, which can provide
erroneous results for impurities with a high density of states at the Fermi energy. Moreover, the
Gilbert damping and nutation tensors are obtained. The nutation effects can lead to a non-negligible
shift in the spin excitation resonance in the high-frequency regime. Finally, we study the impact
of the surface state on the spin dynamics, which may be severely altered due to the repositioning
of the impurity-induced state in comparison to the bulk case. Our systematic investigation of this
series of magnetic impurities sheds light on their spin dynamics within topological insulators,
with implications for available and future experimental studies as, for instance, on the viability
of using such impurities for solid-state qubits.
