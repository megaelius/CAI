On-chip quantum information processing requires controllable quantum light sources that can
be operated on-demand at high-speeds and with the possibility of in-situ control of the photon emission
wavelength and its optical polarization properties. Here, we report on the dynamic control of the
optical emission from core-shell GaN/InGaN nanowire (NW) heterostructures using radio frequency
surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The SAWs are excited on the surface of a piezoelectric lithium niobate
crystal equipped with a SAW delay line onto which the NWs were mechanically transferred. Luminescent
quantum dot (QD)-like exciton localization centers induced by compositional fluctuations within
the InGaN nanoshell were identified using stroboscopic micro-photoluminescence (micro-PL)
spectroscopy. They exhibit narrow and almost fully linearly polarized emission lines in the micro-PL
spectra and a pronounced anti-bunching signature of single photon emission in the photon correlation
experiments. When the nanowire is perturbed by the propagating SAW, the embedded QD is periodically
strained and its excitonic transitions are modulated by the acousto-mechanical coupling, giving
rise to a spectral fine-tuning within a ~1.5 meV bandwidth at the acoustic frequency of ~330 MHz.
This outcome can be further combined with spectral detection filtering for temporal control of
the emitted photons. The effect of the SAW piezoelectric field on the QD charge population and on
the optical polarization degree is also observed. The advantage of the acousto-optoelectric over
other control schemes is that it allows in-situ manipulation of the optical emission properties
over a wide frequency range (up to GHz frequencies).
