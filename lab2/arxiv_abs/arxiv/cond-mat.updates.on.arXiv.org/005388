We consider a particle with a Langevin dynamics driven by a uniform non-conservative force, in a
one-dimensional potential with periodic boundary conditions. We are interested in the properties
of the system for atypical values of the time-integral of a generalized particle current. To study
these, we bias the dynamics, at trajectory level, by a parameter conjugated to the current, within
the large-deviation formalism. We investigate, in the weak-noise limit, the phase diagram spanned
by the physical driving force and the parameter defining the biased process. We focus in particular
on the depinning transition in this two-dimensional phase diagram. In the absence of trajectory
bias, the depinning transition as a function of the force is characterized by the standard exponent
$\frac{1}{2}$. We show that for any non-zero bias, the depinning transition is characterized by
an inverse logarithmic behavior as a function of either the bias or the force, close to the critical
lines. We also report a scaling exponent $\frac{1}{3}$ for the current when considering the depinning
transition in terms of the bias, fixing the non-conservative force to its critical value in the absence
of bias. Then, focusing on the time-integrated particle current, we study the thermal rounding
effects in the zero-current phase when the tilted potential exhibits a local minimum. We derive
in this case the Arrhenius scaling, in the small noise limit, of both the particle current and the
scaled cumulant generating function. This derivation of the Arrhenius scaling relies on the determination
of the left eigenvector of the biased Fokker-Planck operator, to exponential order in the low-noise
limit. An effective Poissonian statistics of the integrated current emerges in this limit.
