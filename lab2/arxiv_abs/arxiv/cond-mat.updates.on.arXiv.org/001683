We have studied the physical properties of M2InC (M = Zr, Hf and Ta) MAX phases ternary carbides using
density functional theory (DFT) methodology. The structural, elastic and electronic properties
are revisited (and found to be in good agreement with recently reported results). The charge density
distribution, Fermi surface features, Vickers hardness, dynamical stability, thermodynamics
and optical properties have been investigated for the first time. The calculated single crystal
elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves endorse the mechanical and dynamical stability
of all the compounds under study. The calculated single crystal elastic constants Cij and polycrystalline
elastic constants are found to increase with increasing atomic number of M species (M = Zr, Hf and
Ta). The values of Pugh ratio and Poisson ratio revealed the brittleness of the compounds under study
associated with strong directional covalent bond with a mixture of ionic contribution. Overlapping
of conduction band and valence band at Fermi level notify the metallic nature of M2InC (M = Zr, Hf and
Ta) MAX phases. Low values of Vicker hardness indicate the softness of the materials and easy machinability..
The thermodynamic properties, such as the free energy, enthalpy, entropy, specific heat capacity
and Debye temperature are evaluated using the phonon dispersion curves and a good correspondence
is found with the M atomic species. Electronically important optical properties, e.g., dielectric
functions, refractive index, photoconductivity, absorption coefficient, loss function and
reflectivity are calculated and discussed in detail in this study.
