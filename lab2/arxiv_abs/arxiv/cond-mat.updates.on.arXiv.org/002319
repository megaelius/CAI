The temporal evolution of ordered gamma prime (L12)-precipitates precipitating in a disordered
gamma(f.c.c.) matrix is studied in extensive detail for a Ni-12.5 Al at.% alloy aged at 823 K (550
oC), for times ranging from 0.08 to 4096 h. Three-dimensional atom-probe tomography (3-D APT) results
are compared to monovacancy-mediated lattice-kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC1) simulations, which
include monovacancy-solute binding energies through 4th nearest-neighbor distances, for the
same mean composition and aging temperature. The temporal evolution of the measured values of the
mean radius, <R(t)>, number density, aluminum supersaturations, and volume fraction of the gamma
prime(L12)-precipitates are compared to the predictions of a modified version of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner
coarsening model due to Calderon, Voorhees et al. The resulting experimental rate constants are
used to calculate the Gibbs interfacial free-energy between the gamma(f.c.c.)- and gamma prime(L12)-phases
using data from two thermodynamic databases, and its value is compared to all extant values dating
from 1966. The diffusion coefficient for coarsening is calculated utilizing the same rate constants
and compared to all extant archival diffusivities, not determined from coarsening experiments,
and is demonstrated to be the inter-diffusivity, , of Ni and Al. The monovacancy-mediated LKMC1
simulation results are in good agreement with our 3-D APT data. It is demonstrated that the compositional
interfacial width, for the {100} interface, between the gamma(f.c.c.)- and gamma prime (L12)-phases,
decreases continuously with increasing aging time and <R(t)>, for the 3-D APT results and monovacancy-mediated
LKMC1 simulations, in disagreement with an ansatz intrinsic to the trans-interface diffusion-controlled
coarsening model, which predicts the opposite trend for binary alloys.
