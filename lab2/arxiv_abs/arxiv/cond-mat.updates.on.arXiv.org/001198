Self-propelled Brownian particles show rich out-of-equilibrium physics, for instance, the motility-induced
phase separation (MIPS). While decades of studying the structure of liquids have established a
deep understanding of passive systems, not much is known about correlations in active suspensions.
In this work we derive an approximate analytic theory for three-body correlations and forces in
systems of active Brownian disks starting from the many-body Smoluchowski equation. We use our
theory to predict the conditional forces that act on a tagged particle and their dependence on the
propulsion speed of self-propelled disks. We identify preferred directions of these forces in
relation to the direction of propulsion and the positions of the surrounding particles. We further
relate our theory to the effective swimming speed of the active disks, which is relevant for the physics
of MIPS. To test and validate our theory, we additionally run particle-resolved computer simulations,
for which we explicitly calculate the three-body forces. In this context, we discuss the modeling
of active Brownian swimmers with nearly hard interaction potentials. We find very good agreement
between our simulations and numerical solutions of our theory, especially for the nonequilibrium
pair-distribution function. For our analytical results, we carefully discuss their range of validity
in the context of the different levels of approximation we applied. This discussion allows us to
study the individual contribution of particles to three-body forces and to the emerging structure.
Thus, our work sheds light on the collective behavior, provides the basis for further studies of
correlations in active suspensions, sheds new light onto the collective behavior, and makes a step
towards an emerging liquid state theory.
