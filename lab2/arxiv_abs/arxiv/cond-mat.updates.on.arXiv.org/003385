Electron-doped Sr(Co{1-x}Ni{x})2As2 single crystals with compositions x = 0 to 0.9 were grown
out of self-flux and SrNi2As2 single crystals out of Bi flux. The crystals were characterized using
single-crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic susceptibility chi(H,T), isothermal magnetization
M(H,T), heat capacity Cp(H,T), and electrical resistivity ho(H,T) measurements versus applied
magnetic field H and temperature T. The chi(T) data show that the crystals exhibit an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) ground state almost immediately upon Ni doping on the Co site. Ab-initio electronic-structure
calculations for x = 0 and x = 0.15 indicate that a flat band with a peak in the density of states just
above the Fermi energy is responsible for this initial magnetic-ordering behavior on Ni doping.
The Curie-Weiss-like T dependence of \chi in the paramagnetic (PM) state indicates dominant ferromagnetic
(FM) interactions. The small ordered moments ~0.1 muB per transition metal atom and the values of
the Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio indicate that the magnetism is itinerant. The Cp(T) at low T exhibits
Fermi-liquid behavior for 0 < x < 0.15 whereas an evolution to a logarithmic non-Fermi-liquid (NFL)
behavior is found for x = 0.2 to 0.3. The logarithmic dependence is suppressed in an applied magnetic
field. The low- T rho(H = 0,T) data show a T^2 dependence for 0 < x < 0.20 and a power-law dependence with
n < 2 for x = 0.20 and 0.30. These low-T NFL behaviors observed in the Cp and rho measurements are most
evident near the quantum-critical concentration x ~ 0.3 at which a T = 0 composition-induced transition
from the AFM phase to the PM phase occurs.
