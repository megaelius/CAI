We propose a topological mechanism for superconductivity observed in twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG) in which both interaction-driven insulators and superconductors are realized near a 'magic
angle' on varying the electron filling. We show that topological textures of a promising candidate
for the ordered insulating state, the Kramers inter-valley coherent (K-IVC) phase, carry electric
charge due to band topology, which we relate to the observed superconductivity at finite doping.
Specifically, we view the correlated flat bands of TBG as a pair of quantum Hall ferromagnets related
by time reversal symmetry. An antiferromagnetic interaction $J$ couples the two ferromagnets
into a three component order parameter, which includes both the XY K-IVC order and the nearby valley-Hall
order. Skyrmions of this order parameter are charge 2e bosons, whose condensation can trigger superconductivity.
We work out microscopic aspects of this scenario including the (i) energetics of charged skyrmions,
which are shown to be relatively low energy excitations, relevant to the finite doping problem (ii)
the effective mass of charge $2e$ skyrmions and hence the superfluid stiffness and (iii) the pairing
symmetry compatible with skyrmion condensation. Pairing in this scenario originates from the
kinetic energy driven "superexchange" with characteristic scale $J\sim 1$ meV, which is specific
to twisted bilayer graphene, and is not operative in other Moir\'e materials that lack $C_{2z}$
symmetry. An effective theory with a five component order parameter that combines the superconductor
and insulating orders is also discussed.
