Understanding quantum thermalization through entanglement build-up in isolated many-body systems
addresses fundamental questions on how unitary dynamics connects to statistical physics. These
studies also constitute a novel way to investigate strongly correlated quantum systems. A promising
pathway is being opened by ultracold atomic systems featuring internal levels that can be initialized
in pure states and coherently evolved with controllable long-range interactions. In particular,
magnetic atoms offer a unique possibility to investigate truly macroscopic and well-ordered arrays
of spins. Here we experimentally study the dynamics and approach towards thermal equilibrium of
a macroscopic ensemble of spins initially tilted compared to the magnetic field, under the effect
of dipole-dipole interactions. The experiment uses a unit filled array of 10^4 chromium atoms in
a 3D optical lattice, realizing the spin-3 XXZ Heisenberg model. We monitor the population of the
seven spin components after a collective rotation of an initially polarized ensemble, as a function
of the angle between the initial coherent state with respect to the magnetic field. We find that the
approach to thermal equilibrium is increasingly driven by quantum correlations as the angle approaches
pi/2. The quantum dynamics is benchmarked by comparison with an improved numerical quantum phase-space
method which also enables us to compute the dynamics of the Renyi entanglement entropy. Although
the measurements only allow us to reconstruct the entropy generated by the diagonal components
of the average local density matrix, the excellent agreement with the theory supports entanglement
build-up and the corresponding approach to local thermal equilibrium. Our work provides a first
benchmark of our experiment as a quantum simulator, opening a path to soon investigate regimes intractable
to theory.
