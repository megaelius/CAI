When an extended system is coupled at its opposite boundaries to two reservoirs at different temperatures
or chemical potentials, it cannot achieve a global thermal equilibrium and is instead driven to
a set of current carrying non-equilibrium states. Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario
to metallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement structure of the
resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental difficulty in solving realistic models
for disordered, interacting electrons. We investigate this problem using two "toy" models for
coherent quantum transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated three-dimensional, non-interacting
Anderson model and a class of random quantum circuits acting on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps
to an interacting fermion problem. Crucially, the random circuit model exhibits a quantum chaotic
phase typical of interacting systems, as well as an integrable phase of diffusive fermions, similar
to the Anderson model. Computing the von Neumann entropy of the system shows that local equilibrium
only emerges in the quantum chaotic phase, while the diffusive fermion phase exhibits volume-law
mutual information and entanglement, which we also find in the non-equilibrium steady-state of
the Anderson model. In addition, we find a third phase in the random circuit model with an intriguing
connection to an exactly solvable classical stochastic lattice gas model called the symmetric-simple-exclusion
process. These results provide a generic picture for the emergence of local equilibrium in current-driven
quantum chaotic systems, as well as provide insights into methods to stabilize highly-entangled
many-body states out of equilibrium. We discuss experimental techniques to probe these effects
in low-temperature mesoscopic wires or ultracold atomic gases.
