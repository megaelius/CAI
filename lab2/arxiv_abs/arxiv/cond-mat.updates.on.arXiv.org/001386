We present the implementation of GAtor, a massively parallel, first principles genetic algorithm
(GA) for molecular crystal structure prediction. GAtor is written in Python and currently interfaces
with the FHI-aims code to perform local optimizations and energy evaluations using dispersion-inclusive
density functional theory (DFT). GAtor offers a variety of fitness evaluation, selection, crossover,
and mutation schemes. Breeding operators designed specifically for molecular crystals provide
a balance between exploration and exploitation. Evolutionary niching is implemented in GAtor
by using machine learning to cluster the dynamically updated population by structural similarity
and then employing a cluster-based fitness function. Evolutionary niching promotes uniform sampling
of the potential energy surface by evolving several sub-populations, which helps overcome initial
pool biases and selection biases (genetic drift). The various settings offered by GAtor increase
the likelihood of locating numerous low-energy minima, including those located in disconnected,
hard to reach regions of the potential energy landscape. The best structures generated are re-relaxed
and re-ranked using a hierarchy of increasingly accurate DFT functionals and dispersion methods.
GAtor is applied to a chemically diverse set of four past blind test targets, characterized by different
types of intermolecular interactions. The experimentally observed structures and other low-energy
structures are found for all four targets. In particular, for Target II, 5-cyano-3-hydroxythiophene,
the top ranked putative crystal structure is a $Z^\prime$=2 structure with P$\bar{1}$ symmetry
and a scaffold packing motif, which has not been reported previously.
