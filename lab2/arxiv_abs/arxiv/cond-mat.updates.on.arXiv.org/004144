Strong optical nonlinearities play a central role in realizing quantum photonic technologies.
In solid state systems, exciton-polaritons, which result from the hybridization of material excitations
and cavity photons, are an attractive candidate to realize such nonlinearities. Here, the interaction
between excitons forms the basis of the polaritonic nonlinearity. While the interaction between
ground state excitons generates a notable optical nonlinearity, the strength of such ground state
interactions is generally not sufficient to reach the regime of quantum nonlinear optics and strong
single-polariton interactions. Excited states, however, feature enhanced interactions and
therefore hold promise for accessing the quantum domain of single-photon nonlinearities, as demonstrated
with high-lying Rydberg states of cold atomic systems. Excitons in excited states have recently
been observed in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Here we demonstrate the formation
of exciton-polaritons using the first excited excitonic state in monolayer tungsten diselenide
(WSe2) embedded in a microcavity. Owing to the larger exciton size compared to their ground state
counterpart, the realized polaritons exhibit an enhanced nonlinear response by more than an order
of magnitude, as evidenced through a modification of the cavity Rabi splitting. The demonstration
of excited exciton-polaritons in two-dimensional semiconductors and their enhanced nonlinear
response presents the first step towards the generation of strong photon interactions in solid
state systems, a necessary building block for quantum photonic technologies.
