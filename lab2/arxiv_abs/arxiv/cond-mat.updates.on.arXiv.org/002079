The linear energy-momentum dispersion, coupled with pseudo-spinors, makes graphene an ideal
solid-state material platform to realize an electronic device based on Dirac-Fermionic relativistic
quantum mechanics. Employing local gate control, several examples of electronic devices based
on Dirac fermion dynamics have been demonstrated, including Klein tunneling, negative refraction
and specular Andreev reflection. In this work, we present a quantum switch based on analogous Dirac-fermion-optics
(DFO), in which the angle dependence of Klein tunneling is explicitly utilized to build tunable
collimators and reflectors for the quantum wave function of Dirac fermions. We employ a novel dual-source
design with a single flat reflector, which minimizes diffusive edge scattering and suppresses
the background incoherent transmission. Our gate-tunable collimator-reflector device design
enables measurement of the net DFO contribution in the switching device operation. We measure a
full set of transmission coefficients of DFO wavefunction between multiple leads of the device,
separating the classical contribution from that of any disorder in the channel. Since the DFO quantum
switch demonstrated in this work requires no explicit energy gap, the switching operation is expected
to be robust against thermal fluctuations and inhomogeneity length scales comparable to the Fermi
wavelength. We find our quantum switch works at an elevated temperature up to 230 K and large bias
current density up to 102 A/m, over a wide range of carrier densities. The tunable collimator-reflector
coupled with the conjugated source electrodes developed in this work provides an additional component
to build more efficient DFO electronic devices.
