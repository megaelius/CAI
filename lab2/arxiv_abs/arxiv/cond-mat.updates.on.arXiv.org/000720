Based solely on the analytical properties of the single-particle Green's function of fermions
at finite temperatures, we show that the generalized Luttinger theorem inherently possesses topological
aspects. The topological interpretation of the generalized Luttinger theorem can be introduced
because i) the Luttinger volume is represented as the winding number of the single-particle Green's
function and thus ii) the deviation of the theorem, expressed with a ratio between the interacting
and noninteracting single-particle Green's functions, is also represented as the winding number
of this ratio. The formulation based on the winding number naturally leads to two types of the generalized
Luttinger theorem. Exploring two examples of single-band translationally invariant interacting
electrons, i.e., simple metal and Mott insulator, we show that the first type falls into the original
statement for Fermi liquids given by Luttinger, while the second type corresponds to the extended
one for non metallic cases with no Fermi surface generalized by Dzyaloshinskii. This formulation
also allows us to derive a sufficient condition for the validity of the Luttinger theorem of the first
type by applying the Rouche's theorem in complex analysis as an inequality. Moreover, we can rigorously
prove in a non-perturbative manner, without assuming any detail of a microscopic Hamiltonian,
that the generalized Luttinger theorem of both types is valid for generic interacting fermions
as long as the particle-hole symmetry is preserved. Finally, we show that the winding number of the
single-particle Green's function can also be associated with the distribution function of quasiparticles,
and therefore the number of quasiparticles is equal to the Luttinger volume.
