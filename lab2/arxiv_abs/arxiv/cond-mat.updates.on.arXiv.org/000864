We explore various aspects of magneto-conductance signatures in nanowires, developing quantum
transport models based on the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism which permits not only
a ballistic calculation, but also a systematic inclusion of disorder, roughness and dephasing
effects. In the case of clean nanowires, our numerical results clearly indicate that the Aharonov-Bohm
(AB - h/e) oscillations are dominant, contingent upon the surface confinement of electrons in the
nanowire. Further, we explore the effect of disorder and nanowire length on the conductance harmonics.
We numerically bridge the gap between the clean and disordered case by varying the length of the disordered
section, and identify a transition point where the Al'tshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS - h/2e) oscillations
start dominating. We note the role of the dispersion of the surface confined electrons in dictating
the ballistic and quantum diffusive regimes within the energy bands, which defines the relative
dominance of these harmonics with energy. We also show the ways of suppressing the oscillatory components
(AB and AAS) to observe the non-oscillatory weak localization corrections, noting the interplay
of scattering, dephasing, geometry of electronic distribution, and orientation of magnetic field.
This is followed by studying the effects of surface roughness and dephasing, revealing a key difference.
While surface roughness may lead to the dominance of AAS oscillations depending on the sensitivity
of the hopping parameters to the roughness, dephasing reveals a systematic degradation of the higher
harmonics, which unlike surface roughness, results in the relative dominance of the Aharonov-Bohm
component. Our work establishes computational models for magneto-conductance signatures of
various structures that are actively researched, with the systematic inclusion of disorder and
dephasing.
