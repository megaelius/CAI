We introduce a Rigid-Body Fluctuating Immersed Boundary (RB-FIB) method to perform large-scale
Brownian dynamics simulations of suspensions of rigid particles in fully confined domains, without
any need to explicitly construct Green's functions or mobility operators. In the RB-FIB approach,
discretized fluctuating Stokes equations are solved with prescribed boundary conditions in conjunction
with a rigid-body immersed boundary method to discretize arbitrarily-shaped colloidal particles
with no-slip or active-slip prescribed on their surface. We design a specialized Split--Euler--Maruyama
temporal integrator that uses a combination of random finite differences to capture the stochastic
drift appearing in the overdamped Langevin equation. The RB-FIB method presented in this work only
solves mobility problems in each time step using a preconditioned iterative solver, and has a computational
complexity that scales linearly in the number of particles and fluid grid cells. We demonstrate
that the RB-FIB method correctly reproduces the Gibbs-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, and
use the method to examine the time correlation functions for two spheres tightly confined in a cuboid.
We model a quasi--two-dimensional colloidal crystal confined in a narrow microchannel and hydrodynamically
driven across a commensurate periodic substrate potential mimicking the effect of a corrugated
wall. We observe partial and full depinning of the colloidal monolayer from the substrate potential
above a certain wall speed, consistent with a transition from static to kinetic friction through
propagating kink solitons. Unexpectedly, we find that particles nearest the boundaries of the
domain are the first to be displaced, followed by particles in the middle of the domain.
