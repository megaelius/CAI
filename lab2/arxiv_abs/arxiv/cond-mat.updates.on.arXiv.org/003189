Controlling the shape and structure of metallic colloids is an important topic. Here, different
morphology-structures of colloidal gold particles are investigated with different process parameters
in a pulse-based electron-photon and solution interface process. Different tiny-shaped particles
of gold developed for different packets of supplied nano-energy as per set pulse OFF to ON time. Depending
on the set ratios of pulse OFF to ON times and pulse polarity, packets of nano-energy bind transitional
state gold atoms resting at electronically-flat solution surface that is controlled in their own
shapes. Tiny particles of joined triangular shape in each case developed under set tuned ratio of
bipolar pulses OFF to ON time. At unipolar pulse, tiny particles in triangular shape developed directly.
When the ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time was large, distorted shapes of the particles developed.
Geometrical shapes of particles developed under significant ratios of pulse OFF to ON times. When
the ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time was 3, particles developed in low aspect ratio. But under
the fraction of this ratio, particles tend to develop in high aspect ratio. For longer pulse ON time,
structures of smooth elements get developed in width less than inter-spacing distance and forcing
energy of travelling photons along the interface to flatten them further. Morphology and structure
of tiny particles, nanoparticles and particles are discussed for different process parameters
opening multiple routes for materials research and their counterparts. This is the overall attained
orientation of electrons in elongated atoms forming colloidal particles of different size and
shape maintaining the certain color of their solution under sunlight.
