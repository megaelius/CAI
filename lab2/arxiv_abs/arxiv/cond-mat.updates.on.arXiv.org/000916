The direct measurement of Berry phases is still a great challenge in condensed matter systems. The
bottleneck has been the ability to adiabatically drive an electron coherently across a large portion
of the Brillouin zone in a solid where the scattering is strong and complicated. We break through
this bottleneck and show that high-order sideband generation (HSG) in semiconductors is intimately
affected by Berry phases. Electron-hole recollisions and HSG occur when a near-band gap laser beam
excites a semiconductor that is driven by sufficiently strong terahertz (THz)-frequency electric
fields. We carried out experimental and theoretical studies of HSG from three GaAs/AlGaAs quantum
wells. The observed HSG spectra contain sidebands up to the 90th order, to our knowledge the highest-order
optical nonlinearity observed in solids. The highest-order sidebands are associated with electron-hole
pairs driven coherently across roughly 10% of the Brillouin zone around the \Gamma point. The principal
experimental claim is a dynamical birefringence: the sidebands, when the order is high enough (>
20), are usually stronger when the exciting near-infrared (NIR) and the THz electric fields are
polarized perpendicular than parallel; the sideband intensities depend on the angles between
the THz field and the crystal axes in samples with sufficiently weak quenched disorder; and the sidebands
exhibit significant ellipticity that increases with increasing sideband order, despite nearly
linear excitation and driving fields. We explain dynamical birefringence by generalizing the
three-step model for high order harmonic generation. The hole accumulates Berry phases due to variation
of its internal state as the quasi-momentum changes under the THz field. Dynamical birefringence
arises from quantum interference between time-reversed pairs of electron-hole recollision pathways.
