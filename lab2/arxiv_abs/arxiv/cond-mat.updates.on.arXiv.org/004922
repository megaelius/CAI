The trigonal compound EuMg2Bi2 has recently been discussed in terms of its topological band properties.
These are intertwined with its magnetic properties. Here detailed studies of the magnetic, thermal,
and electronic transport properties of EuMg2Bi2 single crystals are presented. The Eu{+2} spins-7/2
in EuMg2Bi2 exhibit an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at a temperature TN = 6.7 K, as previously
reported. By analyzing the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility chi data below TN in terms of molecular-field
theory (MFT), the AFM structure is inferred to be a c-axis helix, where the ordered moments in the
hexagonal ab-plane layers are aligned ferromagnetically in the ab plane with a turn angle between
the moments in adjacent moment planes along the c axis of about 120 deg. The magnetic heat capacity
exhibits a lambda anomaly at TN with evidence of dynamic short-range magnetic fluctuations both
above and below TN. The high-T limit of the magnetic entropy is close to the theoretical value for
spins-7/2. The in-plane electrical resistivity rho(T) data indicate metallic character with
a mild and disorder-sensitive upturn below Tmin = 23 K. An anomalous rapid drop in rho(T) on cooling
below TN as found in zero field is replaced by a two-step decrease in magnetic fields. The rho(T) measurements
also reveal an additional transition below TN in applied fields of unknown origin that is not observed
in the other measurements and may be associated with an incommensurate to commensurate AFM transition.
The dependence of TN on the c-axis magnetic field Hperp was derived from the field-dependent chi(T),
Cp(T), and rho(T) measurements. This TN(Hperp) was found to be consistent with the prediction of
MFT for a c-axis helix with S = 7/2 and was used to generate a phase diagram in the Hperp-T plane.
