Despite several theoretical approaches describing multiple Andreev reflections (MAR) effect
in superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) junction are elaborated, the problem of
comprehensive and adequate description of MAR is highly actual. In particular, a broadening parameter
$\Gamma$ is still unaccounted at all, whereas a ballistic condition (the mean free path for inelastic
scattering $l$ to the barrier width $d$ ratio) is considered only in the framework of K\"{u}mmel,
Gunsenheimer, and Nikolsky (KGN), as well as Gunsenheimer-Zaikin approaches, for an isotropic
case and fully-transparent constriction. Nonetheless, an influence of $l/d$ ratio to the dynamic
conductance spectrum ($dI/dV$) features remains disregarded, thus being one of the aims of the
current work. Our numerical calculations in the framework of an extended KGN approach develop the
$l/d$ variation to determine both the number of the Andreev features and their amplitudes in the
$dI/dV$ spectrum. We show, in the spectrum of a diffusive SNS junction ($l/d \rightarrow 1$) a suppression
of the Andreev excess current, dramatic change in the current voltage $I(V)$-curve slope at low
bias, with only the main harmonic at $eV=2\Delta$ bias voltage remains well-distinguished in the
$dI/dV$-spectrum. Additionally, we attempt to make a first-ever comparison between experimental
data for the high-transparency SNS junctions (more than $ 85~\%$) and theoretical predictions.
As a result, we calculate the temperature dependences of amplitudes and areas of Andreev features
within the extended KGN approach, which qualitatively agrees with our experimental data obtained
using a "break-junction" technique.
