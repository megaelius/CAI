Type II superconductors exhibit a fascinating phenomenology that is determined by the dynamical
properties of the vortex matter hosted by the material. A crucial element in this phenomenology
is vortex pinning by material defects, e.g., immobilizing vortices at small drives and thereby
guaranteeing dissipation-free current flow. Pinning models for vortices and other topological
defects, such as domain walls in magnets or dislocations in crystals, come in two standard variants:
i) weak collective pinning, where individual weak defects are unable to pin, while the random accumulation
of many force centers within a collective pinning volume combines into an effective pin, and ii)
strong pinning, where strong defects produce large vortex displacements and bistabilities that
lead to pinning on the level of individual defects. The transition between strong and weak pinning
is quantified by the Labusch criterion $\kappa \approx f_p/\bar{C}\xi = 1$, where $f_p$ and $\bar{C}$
are the force of one defect and the effective elasticity of the vortex lattice, respectively ($\xi$
is the coherence length). Here, we show that a third generic type of pinning becomes dominant when
the pinning force $f_p$ enters the weak regime, the pinning by rare events. We find that within an
intermediate regime $1/2 < \kappa < 1$, compact pairs of weak defects define strong pinning clusters
that extend the mechanism of strong pinning into the weak regime. We present a detailed analysis
of this cluster-pinning mechanism and show that its pinning-force density parametrically dominates
over the weak pinning result. The present work is a first attempt to include correlations between
defects into the discussion of strong pinning.
