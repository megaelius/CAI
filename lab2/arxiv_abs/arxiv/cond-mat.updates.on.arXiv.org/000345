We investigate the effect of disorder on the heat transport properties of the $S=\tfrac{1}{2}$
Heisenberg chain compound Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ upon chemically substituting Sr by increasing concentrations
of Ca. As Ca occupies sites outside but near the Cu-O-Cu spin chains, bond disorder, i.e. a spatial
variation of the exchange interaction $J$, is expected to be realized in these chains. We observe
that the magnetic heat conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{mag}}$) due to spinons propagating in
the chains is gradually but strongly suppressed with increasing amount of Ca, where the doping dependence
can be understood in terms of increased scattering of spinons due to Ca-induced disorder. This is
also reflected in the spinon mean free path which can be separated in a doping independent but temperature
dependent scattering length due to spinon-phonon scattering, and a temperature independent but
doping dependent spinon-defect scattering length. The latter spans from very large ($>$ 1300
lattice spacings) to very short ($\sim$ 12 lattice spacings) and scales with the average distance
between two neighboring Ca atoms. Thus, the Ca-induced disorder acts as an effective defect within
the spin chain, and the doping scheme allows to cover the whole doping regime between the clean and
the dirty limits. Interestingly, at maximum impurity level we observe, in Ca-doped SrCuO$_2$,
an almost linear increase of $\kappa_{\mathrm{mag}}$ at temperatures above 100 K which reflects
the intrinsic low temperature behavior of heat transport in a Heisenberg spin chain. These findings
are quite different from that observed for the Ca-doped double spin chain compound, SrCuO$_2$,
where the effect of Ca seems to saturate already at intermediate doping levels.
