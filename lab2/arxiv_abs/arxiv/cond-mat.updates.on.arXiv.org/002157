We present a novel approach to efficiently implement thermal expansion in the quasi-harmonic approximation
(QHA) for both isotropic and more importantly, anisotropic expansion. In this approach, we rapidly
determine a crystal's equilibrium volume and shape at a given temperature by integrating along
the gradient of expansion from zero Kelvin up to the desired temperature. We compare our approach
to previous isotropic methods that rely on a brute-force grid search to determine the free energy
minimum, which is infeasible to carry out for anisotropic expansion, as well as quasi-anisotropic
approaches that take into account the contributions to anisotropic expansion from the lattice
energy. We compare these methods for experimentally known polymorphs of piracetam and resorcinol
and show that both isotropic methods agree to within error up to 300 K. Using the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter
causes up to 0.04 kcal/mol deviation in the Gibbs free energy, but for polymorph free energy differences
there is a cancellation in error with all isotropic methods within 0.025 kcal/mol at 300 K. Anisotropic
expansion allows the crystals to relax into lattice geometries 0.01-0.23 kcal/mol lower in energy
at 300 K relative to isotropic expansion. For polymorph free energy differences all QHA methods
produced results within 0.02 kcal/mol of each other for resorcinol and 0.12 kcal/mol for piracetam,
the two molecules tested here, demonstrating a cancellation of error for isotropic methods. We
also find that when expanding in more than a single volume variable, there is a non-negligible rate
of failure of the basic approximations of QHA. Specifically, while expanding into new harmonic
modes as the box vectors are increased, the system often falls into alternate, structurally distinct
harmonic modes unrelated by continuous deformation from the original harmonic mode.
