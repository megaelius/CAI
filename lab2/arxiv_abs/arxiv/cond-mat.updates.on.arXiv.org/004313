We examine the interplay of motility and information exchange in a model of run-and-tumble active
particles where the particle's motility is encoded as a bit of information that can be exchanged
upon contact according to the rules of AND and OR logic gates in a circuit. Motile AND particles become
non-motile upon contact with a non-motile particle. Conversely, motile OR particles remain motile
upon collision with their non-motile counterparts. AND particles that have become non-motile
additionally recover their motility or ``reawaken'' at a fixed rate $\mu$, as in the SIS (Susceptible,
Infected, Susceptible) model of epidemic spreading, where an infected agent can become healthy
again, but keeps no memory of the recent infection, hence it is susceptible to a renewed infection.
For $\mu=0$, both AND and OR particles relax irreversibly to absorbing states of all non-motile
or all motile particles, respectively, although the relaxation kinetics is faster for OR particles
that remain active throughout the process. At finite $\mu$, the AND dynamics is controlled by the
interplay between reawakening and collision rates. The system evolves to a state of all motile particles
(an absorbing state in the language of absorbing phase transitions) for $\mu>\mu_c$ and to a mixed
state with coexisting motile and non-motile particles (an active state in the language of absorbing
phase transitions) for $\mu<\mu_c$. The final state exhibits a rich structure controlled by motility-induced
aggregation. Our work can be relevant to biochemical signaling in motile bacteria, the spreading
of epidemics and social consensus, as well as light-controlled organization of active colloids.
