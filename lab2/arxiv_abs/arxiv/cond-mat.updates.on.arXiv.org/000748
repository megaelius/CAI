We present comprehensive optical studies of recently discovered single photon sources in boron
nitride, which appear in form of narrow lines emitting centres. Here, we aim to compactly characterise
their basic optical properties, including the demonstration of several novel findings, in order
to inspire discussion about their origin and utility. Initial inspection reveals the presence
of narrow emission lines in boron nitride powder and exfoliated flakes of hexagonal boron nitride
deposited on Si/SiO2 substrates. Generally rather stable, the boron nitride emitters constitute
a good quality visible light source. However, as briefly discussed, certain specimens reveal a
peculiar type of blinking effects, which are likely related to existence of meta-stable electronic
states. More advanced characterisation of representative stable emitting centres uncovers a
strong dependence of the emission intensity on the energy and polarisation of excitation. On this
basis, we speculate that rather strict excitation selectivity is an important factor determining
the character of the emission spectra, which allows the observation of single and well-isolated
emitters. Finally, we investigate the properties of the emitting centres in varying external conditions.
Quite surprisingly, it is found that the application of a magnetic field introduces no change in
the emission spectra of boron nitride emitters. Further analysis of the impact of temperature on
the emission spectra and the features seen in second-order correlation functions is used to provide
an assessment of the potential functionality of boron nitride emitters as single photon sources
capable of room temperature operation.
