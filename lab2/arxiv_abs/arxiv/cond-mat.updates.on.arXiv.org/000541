The brain keeps its overall dynamics in a corridor of intermediate activity and it has been a long
standing question what possible mechanism could achieve this task. Mechanisms from the field of
statistical physics have long been suggesting that this homeostasis of brain activity could occur
even without a central regulator, via self-organization on the level of neurons and their interactions,
alone. Such physical mechanisms from the class of self-organized criticality exhibit characteristic
dynamical signatures, similar to seismic activity related to earthquakes. Measurements of cortex
rest activity showed first signs of dynamical signatures potentially pointing to self-organized
critical dynamics in the brain. Indeed, recent more accurate measurements allowed for a detailed
comparison with scaling theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena, proving the existence
of criticality in cortex dynamics. We here compare this new evaluation of cortex activity data to
the predictions of the earliest physics spin model of self-organized critical neural networks.
We find that the model matches with the recent experimental data and its interpretation in terms
of dynamical signatures for criticality in the brain. The combination of signatures for criticality,
power law distributions of avalanche sizes and durations, as well as a specific scaling relationship
between anomalous exponents, defines a universality class characteristic of the particular critical
phenomenon observed in the neural experiments. The spin model is a candidate for a minimal model
of a self-organized critical adaptive network for the universality class of neural criticality.
As a prototype model, it provides the background for models that include more biological details,
yet share the same universality class characteristic of the homeostasis of activity in the brain.
