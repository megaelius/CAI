A determinantal point process (DPP) is an ensemble of random nonnegative-integer-valued Radon
measures, whose correlation functions are all given by determinants specified by an integral kernel
called the correlation kernel. First we show our new scheme of DPPs in which a notion of partial isometies
between a pair of Hilbert spaces plays an important role. Many examples of DPPs in one-, two-, and
higher-dimensional spaces are demonstrated, where several types of weak convergence from finite
DPPs to infinite DPPs are given. Dynamical extensions of DPP are realized in one-dimensional systems
of diffusive particles conditioned never to collide with each other. They are regarded as one-dimensional
stochastic log-gases, or the two-dimensional Coulomb gases confined in one-dimensional spaces.
In the second section, we consider such interacting particle systems in one dimension. We introduce
a notion of determinantal martingale and prove that, if the system has determinantal martingale
representation (DMR), then it is a determinantal stochastic process (DSP) in the sense that all
spatio-temporal correlation function are expressed by a determinant. In the last section, we construct
processes of Gaussian free fields (GFFs) on simply connected proper subdomains of $\mathbb{C}$
coupled with interacting particle systems defined on boundaries of the domains. There we use multiple
Schramm--Loewner evolutions (SLEs) driven by the interacting particle systems. We prove that,
if the driving processes are time-changes of the log-gases studied in the second section, then the
obtained GFF with multiple SLEs are stationary. The stationarity defines an equivalence relation
of GFFs, which will be regarded as a generalization of the imaginary surface studied by Miller and
Sheffield.
