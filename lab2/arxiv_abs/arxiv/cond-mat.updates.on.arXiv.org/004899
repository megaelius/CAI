Hydrogen (H) induced damage in metals has been a long-standing woe for many industrial applications.
One form of such damage is linked to H clustering, for which the atomic origin remains contended,
particularly for non-hydride forming metals. In this work, we systematically studied H clustering
behavior in bcc metals represented by W, Fe, Mo, and Cr, combining first-principles calculations,
atomistic and Monte Carlo simulations. H clustering has been shown to be energetically favorable,
and can be strongly facilitated by anisotropic stress field, dominated by the tensile component
along one of the <001> crystalline directions. We showed that the stress effect can be well predicted
by the continuum model based on H formation volume tensor, and that H clustering is thermodynamically
possible at edge dislocations, evidenced by nanohydride formation at rather low levels of H concentration.
Moreover, anisotropy in the stress effect is well reflected in nanohydride morphology around dislocations,
with nanohydride growth occurring in the form of thin platelet structures that maximize one <001>
tension. In particular, the <001> type edge dislocation, with the <001> tensile component maximized,
has been shown to be highly effective in facilitating H aggregation, thus expected to play an important
role in H clustering in bcc metals, in close agreement with recent experimental observations. This
work explicitly and quantitatively clarifies the anisotropic nature of stress effect on H energetics
and H clustering behaviors, offering mechanistic insights critical towards understanding H-induced
damages in metals.
