Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is the newest technology that will be used in the semiconductor
industry for printing circuitry in the sub-20 nm scale. Low-energy electrons (LEEs) produced upon
illumination of resist materials with EUV photons (92 eV) play a central role in the formation of
the nanopatterns. However, up to now the details of this process are not well understood. In this
work, a novel experimental approach that combines Low-Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM), Electron
Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is used to study changes induced
by electrons in the 0-40 eV range in thin films of molecular organometallic EUV resists known as tin-oxo
cages. LEEM-EELS spectroscopic experiments were used to detect surface charging upon electron
exposure and to estimate the electron landing energy. AFM post-exposure analyses revealed that
irradiation of the resist with LEEs leads to the densification of the resist layer associated to
carbon loss. The same chemical processes that yield densification render the solubility change
responsible for the pattern formation in the lithographic application. Remarkably, electrons
as low as 1.2 eV are able to induce chemical reactions in the Sn-based resist. Based on the thickness
profiles resulting from LEE exposures in the 3-48 mC/cm 2 dose range, a simplified reaction model
is proposed where the resist undergoes sequential chemical reactions, yielding first a sparsely
cross-linked network, followed by the formation of a denser cross-linked network. This model allows
us to estimate a maximum reaction volume on the initial material of 0.15 nm 3 per incident electron
in the energy range studied, which means that less than 10 LEEs per molecule on average are needed
to turn the material insoluble and thus render a pattern.
