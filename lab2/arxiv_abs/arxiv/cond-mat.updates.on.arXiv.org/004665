We develop a computational database, web-apps and machine-learning (ML) models to accelerate
the design and discovery of two-dimensional (2D)-heterostructures. Using density functional
theory (DFT) based lattice-parameters and electronic band-energies for 674 non-metallic exfoliable
2D-materials, we generate 226779 possible heterostructures. We classify these heterostructures
into type-I, II and III systems according to Anderson rule, which is based on the band-alignment
with respect to the vacuum potential of non-interacting monolayers.We find that type-II is the
most common and the type-III the least common heterostructure type. We subsequently analyze the
chemical trends for each heterostructure type in terms of the periodic table of constituent elements.
The band alignment data can be also used for identifying photocatalysts and high-work function
2D-metals for contacts.We validate our results by comparing them to experimental data as well as
hybrid-functional predictions. Additionally, we carry out DFT calculations of a few selected
systems (MoS2/WSe2, MoS2/h-BN, MoSe2/CrI3) to compare the band-alignment description with the
predictions from Anderson rule. We develop web-apps to enable users to virtually create combinations
of 2D materials and predict their properties. Additionally, we develop ML tools to predict band-alignment
information for 2D materials. The web-apps, tools and associated data will be distributed through
JARVIS-Heterostructure website (https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/jarvish).Our analysis, results
and the developed web-apps can be applied to the screening and design applications, such as finding
novel photocatalysts, photodetectors, and high-work function 2D-metal contacts.
