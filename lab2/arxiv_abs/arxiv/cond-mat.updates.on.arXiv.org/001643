Fullerence encapsulation has been proven to be a powerful approach to enhance mechanical and electronic
properties of the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). However, some discrepancies emerge
in recent studies of the fullerence encapsulation effect on the thermal conductivity of SWCNTs.
More specifically, most previous theoretical works predicted slightly enhancement of the thermal
conductivity, but the recent experiment by Kodama et al. (Nat. Mat. 16, 892 (2017)) observed clear
reduction of the thermal conductivity in SWCNTs by fullerence encapsulation. We perform molecular
dynamics simulations to revisit this issue, by comparatively investigate the thermal conductivity
of the SWCNT (n, n) and the corresponding peapod (n, n) with n = 8, 9, 10, and 11. We find that the fullerence
encapsulation can reduce the thermal conductivity of narrower SWCNTs with n = 8 and 9, but it can slightly
enhance the thermal conductivity of thicker SWCNTs with n = 10 and 11. The underlying mechanisms
for these opposite effects are explored by analyzing the encapsulation induced structural deformation
and the variation of the phonon dispersion of the SWCNT. We illustrate that the reduction effect
observed in the recent experiment is related to the mechanism for reduction of the thermal conductivity
for narrower SWCNTs here, while previous numerical works correspond to the enhancement effect
for thicker SWCNTs found in the present work. Our findings shed lights on clarifying the discrepancy
between previous numerical predictions and experimental observations on the effect of the fullerence
encapsulation on the thermal conductivity of the SWCNT.
