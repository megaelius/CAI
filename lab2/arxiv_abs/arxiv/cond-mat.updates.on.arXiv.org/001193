An alternative exact explicit solution of 1D Ising chain is presented without using any boundary
conditions (or free boundary condition) by the help of applying successively block-spin transformation.
Exact relation are obtained between spin-spin correlation functions in the absence of external
field. To evaluate average magnetization (or the order parameter), it is assumed that the average
magnetization can be related to infinitely apart two spin correlation function as $<\sigma>^{2}=<\sigma_{0}\sigma_{N}>$.
A discussion to justify this consideration is given in the introduction with a relevant manner.
It is obtained that $<\sigma_{0}\sigma_{1}>=\tanh{K}$, which is exactly the same relation as
the previously derived relation by considering the configurational space equivalence of $\{\sigma_{i}\sigma_{i+1}\}=\{s_{i}\}$
and the result of transfer matrix method in the absence of external field. By applying further block-spin
transformation, it is obtained that $\{\sigma_{0}\sigma_{j}\}=(\tanh{K})^{j}$, here $j$ assumes
the values of $j=2^n$, here $n$ is an integer numbers. We believe that this result is really important
in that it is the only exact unique treatment of the 1D Ising chain beside with the transfer matrix
method. It is also pointed out the irrelevances of some of the alternative derivation appearing
in graduate level text books. The obtained unique correlation relation in this this study leads
in the limit of $N\rightarrow\infty$ to $<\sigma_{i}>=(\tanh{K})^{N/2}$, indicating that the
second order phase transition is only possible in the limit of $K\rightarrow\infty$. The obtained
results in this work are exactly the same as those of obtained by the transfer matrix method which
considers periodic boundary condition.
