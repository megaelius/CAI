Starting from the observation that one of the most successful methods for solving the Kohn-Sham
equations for periodic systems -- the plane-wave method -- is a spectral method based on eigenfunction
expansion, we formulate a spectral method designed towards solving the Kohn-Sham equations for
clusters. This allows for efficient calculation of the electronic structure of clusters (and molecules)
with high accuracy and systematic convergence properties without the need for any artificial periodicity.
The basis functions in this method form a complete orthonormal set and are expressible in terms of
spherical harmonics and spherical Bessel functions. Computation of the occupied eigenstates
of the discretized Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian is carried out using a combination of preconditioned
block eigensolvers and Chebyshev polynomial filter accelerated subspace iterations. Several
algorithmic and computational aspects of the method, including computation of the electrostatics
terms and parallelization are discussed. We have implemented these methods and algorithms into
an efficient and reliable package called ClusterES (Cluster Electronic Structure). A variety
of benchmark calculations employing local and non-local pseudopotentials are carried out using
our package and the results are compared to the literature. Convergence properties of the basis
set are discussed through numerical examples. Computations involving large systems that contain
thousands of electrons are demonstrated to highlight the efficacy of our methodology. The use of
our method to study clusters with arbitrary point group symmetries is briefly discussed.
