Phenomenological theories of interfacial interactions have targeted terrestrial applications
since long time and their exploitation has inspired our research programme to build up a macroscopic
theory of gas-surface interactions targeting the complex phenomenology of hypersonic reentry
flows as alternative to standard methods based on accommodation coefficients. The objective of
this paper is the description of methods employed and results achieved in an exploratory study,
that is, the unsteady heat transfer between two solids in contact with and without interface. It
is a simple numerical-demonstrator test case designed to facilitate quick numerical calculations
and to bring forth already sufficiently meaningful aspects relevant to thermal protection due
to the formation of the interface. The paper begins with a brief introduction on the subject matter
and a review of relevant literature. Then the case is considered in which the interface is absent.
The importance of tension continuity as boundary condition on the same footing of heat-flux continuity
is recognised and the role of the former in governing the establishment of the temperature-difference
distribution over the separation surface is explicitly shown. Evidence is given that the standard
temperature-continuity boundary condition is just a particular case. Subsequently the case in
which the interface is formed between the solids is analysed. The coupling among the heat-transfer
equations applicable in the solids and the balance equation for the surface thermodynamic energy
formulated in terms of the surface temperature is discussed. Results are illustrated for planar
and cylindrical configuration; they show unequivocally that the thermal-protection action of
the interface turns out to be driven exclusively by thermophysical properties of the solids and
of the interface; accommodation coefficients are not needed.
