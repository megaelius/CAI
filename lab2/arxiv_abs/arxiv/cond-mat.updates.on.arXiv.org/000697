For a quantum chain or wire, it is challenging to control or even alter the bulk properties or behaviors,
for instance a response to external fields by tuning solely the boundaries. This is expected, since
the correlations usually decay exponentially, and do not transfer the physics at the boundaries
to the bulk. In this work, we construct a quantum spin-$1/2$ chain of finite size, termed as controllable
spin wire (CSW), in which we have $\hat{S}^{z} \hat{S}^{z}$ (Ising) interactions with a transverse
field in the bulk, and the $\hat{S}^{x} \hat{S}^{z}$ and $\hat{S}^{z} \hat{S}^{z}$ couplings
with a canted field on the boundaries. The Hamiltonians on the boundaries, dubbed as tuning Hamiltonians
(TH's), bear the same form as the effective Hamiltonians emerging in the so-called "quantum entanglement
simulator" (QES) that mimics infinite models. We show that by tuning the TH's, the CSW surprisingly
exhibits two different types of behaviors in response to the transverse field in the bulk. In one
case, the staggered magnetization $M^s_z$ of the bulk exhibits a steep cliff, and the entanglement
entropy $S$ shows a high peak. In the other case, no cliff or peak of $M^s_z$ and $S$ exists. We show
that the behaviors of the CSW can be switched between these two types by solely tuning the TH's on the
boundaries. The CSW could potentially serve as the basic building blocks of quantum devices for
quantum sensing, quantum memories, or quantum computers. The CSW contains only nearest-neighboring
spin-$1/2$ interactions, and could be realized in future experiments with atoms/ions coupled
with artificial quantum circuits or dots.
