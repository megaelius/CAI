Eigenmodes of a broad class of "sparse" random matrices, with interactions concentrated near the
diagonal, exponentially localize in space, as initially discovered in 1957 by Anderson for quantum
systems. Anderson localization plays ubiquitous roles in varieties of problems from electrons
in solids to mechanical and optical systems. However, its implications in neuroscience (where
the connections can be strongly asymmetric) have been largely unexplored, mainly because synaptic
connectivity matrices of neural systems are often "dense", which makes the eigenmodes spatially
extended. Here, we explore roles that Anderson localization could be playing in neural networks
by focusing on "spatially structured" disorder in synaptic connectivity matrices. Recently,
neuroscientists have experimentally confirmed that the local excitation and global inhibition
(LEGI) ring attractor model can functionally represent head direction cells in Drosophila melanogaster
central brain. We first study a non-Hermitian (i.e. asymmetric) tight-binding model with disorder
and then establish a connection to the LEGI ring attractor model. We discover that (i) Principal
eigenvectors of the LEGI ring attractor networks with structured nearest neighbor disorder are
"quasi-localized", even with fully dense inhibitory connections. (ii) The quasi-localized eigenvectors
play dominant roles in the early time neural dynamics, and the location of the principal quasi-localized
eigenvectors predict an initial location of the "bump of activity" representing, say, a head direction
of an insect. Our investigations open up a new venue for explorations at the intersection between
the theory of Anderson localization and neural networks with spatially structured disorder.
