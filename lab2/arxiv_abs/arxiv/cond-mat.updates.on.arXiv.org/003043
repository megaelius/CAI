The algebraic spin liquid is a long-sought-after phase of matter characterized by the absence of
quasiparticle excitations, a low-energy description in terms of emergent Dirac fermions and gauge
fields interacting according to (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED3), and power-law correlations
with universal exponents. The prototypical algebraic spin liquid is the Affleck-Marston $\pi$-flux
phase, originally proposed as a possible ground state of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the 2D
square lattice. While the latter model is now known to order antiferromagnetically at zero temperature,
recent sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations of spin-1/2 fermions coupled to a compact
U(1) gauge field on the square lattice have shown that quantum fluctuations can destroy N\'eel order
and drive a direct quantum phase transition to the $\pi$-flux phase. We show this transition is in
the universality class of the chiral Heisenberg QED3-Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model with a single SU(2)
doublet of four-component Dirac fermions (i.e., $N_f=1$), pointing out important differences
with the corresponding putative transition on the kagome lattice. Using an $\epsilon$ expansion
below four spacetime dimensions to four-loop order, and a large-$N_f$ expansion up to second order,
we show the transition is continuous and compute various thermodynamic and susceptibility critical
exponents at this transition, setting the stage for future numerical determinations of these quantities.
As a byproduct of our analysis, we also obtain charge-density-wave and valence-bond-solid susceptibility
exponents at the semimetal-antiferromagnetic insulator transition in graphene.
