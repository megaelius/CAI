Electron-phonon coupling plays a central role in the transport properties and photophysics of
organic crystals. Successful models describing charge- and energy-transport in these systems
routinely include these effects. Most models for describing photophysics, on the other hand, only
incorporate local electron-phonon coupling to intramolecular vibrational modes, while nonlocal
electron-phonon coupling is neglected. One might expect nonlocal coupling to have an important
effect on the photophysics of organic crystals, because it gives rise to large fluctuation in the
charge-transfer couplings, and charge-transfer couplings play an important role in the spectroscopy
of many organic crystals. Here, we study the effects of nonlocal coupling on the absorption spectrum
of crystalline pentacene and 7,8,15,16-tetraazaterrylene. To this end, we develop a new mixed
quantum-classical approach for including nonlocal coupling into spectroscopic and transport
models for organic crystals. Importantly, our approach does not assume that the nonlocal coupling
is linear, in contrast to most modern charge-transport models. We find that the nonlocal coupling
broadens the absorption spectrum non-uniformly across the absorption line shape. In pentacene,
for example, our model predicts that the lower Davydov component broadens considerably more than
the upper Davydov component, explaining the origin of this experimental observation for the first
time. By studying a simple dimer model, we are able to attribute this selective broadening to correlations
between the fluctuations of the charge-transfer couplings. Overall, our method incorporates
nonlocal electron-phonon coupling into spectroscopic and transport models with computational
efficiency, generalizability to a wide range of organic crystals, and without any assumption of
linearity.
