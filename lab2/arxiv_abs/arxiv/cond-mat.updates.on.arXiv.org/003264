Combining both vertical and in-plane two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures opens up the possibility
to create an unprecedented architecture using 2D atomic layer building blocks. The thermal transport
properties of such mixed heterostructures, critical to various applications in nanoelectronics,
however, have not been thoroughly explored. Herein, we construct two configurations of multilayer
in-plane graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (Gr/h-BN) heterostructures (i.e. mixed heterostructures)
via weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions and systematically investigate the dependence of their
interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) on the number of layers using non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics (NEMD) simulations. The computational results show that the ITC of two configurations
of multilayer in-plane Gr/h-BN heterostructures (MIGHHs) decrease with increasing layer number
n and both saturate at n = 3. And surprisingly, we find that the MIGHH is more advantageous to interfacial
thermal transport than the monolayer in-plane Gr/h-BN heterostructure, which is in strong contrast
to the commonly held notion that the multilayer structures of Gr and h-BN suppress the phonon transmission.
The underlying physical mechanisms for these puzzling phenomena are probed through the analyses
of heat flux, temperature jump, stress concentration factor, overlap of phonon vibrational spectra
and phonon participation ratio. In particular, by changing the stacking angle of MIGHH, a higher
ITC can be obtained due to the thermal rectification behavior. Furthermore, we find that the ITC
in MIGHH can be well-regulated by controlling the coupling strength between layers. Our findings
here are of significance for understanding the interfacial thermal transport behaviors of multilayer
in-plane Gr/h-BN heterostructure, and are expected to attract extensive interest in exploring
its new physics and applications.
