Matrix product state techniques provide a very efficient way to numerically evaluate certain classes
of quantum Hall wave functions that can be written as correlators in two-dimensional conformal
field theories. Important examples are the Laughlin and Moore-Read ground states and their quasihole
excitations. In this paper, we extend the matrix product state techniques to evaluate quasielectron
wave functions, a more complex task because the corresponding conformal field theory operator
is not local. We use our method to obtain density profiles for states with multiple quasielectrons
and quasiholes, and to calculate the (mutual) statistical phases of the excitations with high precision.
The wave functions we study are subject to a known difficulty: the position of a quasielectron depends
on the presence of other quasiparticles, even when their separation is large compared to the magnetic
length. Quasielectron wave functions constructed using the composite fermion picture, which
are topologically equivalent to the quasielectrons we study, have the same problem. This flaw is
serious in that it gives wrong results for the statistical phases obtained by braiding distant quasiparticles.
We analyze this problem in detail and show that it originates from an incomplete screening of the
topological charges, which invalidates the plasma analogy. We demonstrate that this can be remedied
in the case when the separation between the quasiparticles is large, which allows us to obtain the
correct statistical phases. Finally, we propose that a modification of the Laughlin state, that
allows for local quasielectron operators, should have good topological properties for arbitrary
configurations of excitations.
