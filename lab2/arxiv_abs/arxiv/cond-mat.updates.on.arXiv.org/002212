Inspired by ion-dominated synaptic plasticity in human brain, artificial synapses for neuromorphic
computing adopt charge-related quantities as their weights. Despite the existing charge derived
synaptic emulations, schemes of controlling electron spins in ferromagnetic devices have also
attracted considerable interest due to their advantages of low energy consumption, unlimited
endurance, and favorable CMOS compatibility. However, a generally applicable method of tuning
a binary ferromagnet into a multi-state memory with pure spin-dominated synaptic plasticity in
the absence of an external magnetic field is still missing. Here, we show how synaptic plasticity
of a perpendicular ferromagnetic FM1 layer can be obtained when it is interlayer-exchange-coupled
by another in-plane ferromagnetic FM2 layer, where a magnetic-field-free current-driven multi-state
magnetization switching of FM1 in the Pt/FM1/Ta/FM2 structure is induced by spin-orbit torque.
We use current pulses to set the perpendicular magnetization state which acts as the synapse weight,
and demonstrate spintronic implementation of the excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic potentials
and spike timing-dependent plasticity. This functionality is made possible by the action of the
in-plane interlayer exchange coupling field which leads to broadened, multi-state magnetic reversal
characteristics. Numerical simulations, combined with investigations of a reference sample
with a single perpendicular magnetized Pt/FM1/Ta structure, reveal that the broadening is due
to the in-plane field component tuning the efficiency of the spin-orbit-torque to drive domain
walls across a landscape of varying pinning potentials. The conventionally binary FM1 inside our
Pt/FM1/Ta/FM2 structure with inherent in-plane coupling field is therefore tuned into a multi-state
perpendicular ferromagnet and represents a synaptic emulator for neuromorphic computing.
