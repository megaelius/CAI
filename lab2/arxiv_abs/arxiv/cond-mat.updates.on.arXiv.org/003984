MnSnTeO6, a new chiral antiferromagnet, was prepared both by topotactic transformation of the
metastable rosiaite-type polymorph and by direct synthesis from coprecipitated hydroxides.
Its structure, static and dynamic magnetic properties were studied comprehensively both experimentally
(through X-ray and neutron powder diffraction, magnetization, specific heat, dielectric permittivity
and ESR techniques) and theoretically (by means of ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations
within the spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation). MnSnTeO6 is isostructural with
MnSb2O6 (space group P321) and does not show any structural transition between 3 and 300 K. The magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat exhibit an antiferromagnetic ordering at TN=9.8 K, which is confirmed
by low-temperature neutron data. At the same time, the thermodynamic parameters demonstrate an
additional anomaly on the temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility chi(T), specific
heat Cp(T) and dielectric permittivity epsilon(T) at T*=4.9 K, which is characterized by significant
temperature hysteresis. Clear enhancement of the dielectric permittivity at T* is most likely
to reflect the coupling of dielectric and magnetic subsystems leading to development of electric
polarization. It was established that the ground state of MnSnTeO6 is stabilized by seven exchange
parameters, and neutron diffraction revealed incommensurate magnetic structure with propagation
vector k= (0, 0, 0.183) analogous to that of MnSb2O6. Ab initio DFT calculations demonstrate that
the strongest exchange coupling occurs between planes along diagonals. All exchange parameters
are antiferromagnetic and reveal moderate frustration.
