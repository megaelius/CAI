microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level by repressing target
RNA molecules. Competition to bind miRNAs tends in turn to correlate their targets, establishing
effective RNA-RNA interactions that can influence expression levels, buffer fluctuations and
promote signal propagation. Such a potential has been characterized mathematically for small
motifs both at steady state and \red{away from stationarity}. Experimental evidence, on the other
hand, suggests that competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) crosstalk is rather weak. Extended miRNA-RNA
networks could however favour the integration of many crosstalk interactions, leading to significant
large-scale effects in spite of the weakness of individual links. To clarify the extent to which
crosstalk is sustained by the miRNA interactome, we have studied its emergent systemic features
in silico in large-scale miRNA-RNA network reconstructions. We show that, although generically
weak, system-level crosstalk patterns (i) are enhanced by transcriptional heterogeneities,
(ii) can achieve high-intensity even for RNAs that are not co-regulated, (iii) are robust to variability
in transcription rates, and (iv) are significantly non-local, i.e. correlate weakly with miRNA-RNA
interaction parameters. Furthermore, RNA levels are generically more stable when crosstalk is
strongest. As some of these features appear to be encoded in the network's topology, crosstalk may
functionally be favoured by natural selection. These results suggest that, besides their repressive
role, miRNAs mediate a weak but resilient and context-independent network of cross-regulatory
interactions that interconnect the transcriptome, stabilize expression levels and support system-level
responses.
