The superfluid drag-coefficient of a weakly interacting three-component Bose-Einstein condensate
is computed deep into the superfluid phase, starting from a Bose-Hubbard model with component-conserving,
on-site interactions and nearest-neighbor hopping. Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory
is employed to provide an analytic expression for the drag density. In addition, the Hamiltonian
is diagonalized numerically to compute the drag within mean-field theory at both zero and finite
temperatures to all orders in inter-component interactions. Moreover, path integral Monte Carlo
simulations have been performed to support the mean-field results. In the two-component case the
drag increases monotonically with the magnitude of the inter-component interaction $\gamma_{AB}$
between the two components A and B. This no longer holds when an additional third component C is included.
Instead of increasing monotonically, the drag can either be strengthened or weakened depending
on the details of the interaction strengths, for weak and moderately strong interactions. The general
picture is that the drag-coefficient between component A and B is a non-monotonic function of the
inter-component interaction strength $\gamma_{AC}$ between A and a third component C. For weak
$\gamma_{AC}$ compared to the direct interaction $\gamma_{AB}$ between A and B, the drag-coefficient
between A and B can {\it decrease}, contrary to what one naively would expect. When $\gamma_{AC}$
is strong compared to $\gamma_{AB}$, the drag between A and B increases with increasing $\gamma_{AC}$,
as one would naively expect. We attribute the subtle reduction of $\rho_{d,AB}$ with increasing
$\gamma_{AC}$, which has no counterpart in the two-component case, to a renormalization of the
inter-component scattering vertex $\gamma_{AB}$ via intermediate excited states of the third
condensate $C$.
