The recent discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets offers unique opportunities for the experimental
exploration of low-dimensional magnetism4 and the magnetic proximity effects, and for the development
of novel magnetoelectric, magnetooptic and spintronic devices. These advancements call for 2D
materials with diverse magnetic structures as well as effective probes for their magnetic symmetries,
which is key to understanding intralayer magnetic order and interlayer magnetic coupling. Here
we apply second harmonic generation (SHG), a technique acutely sensitive to symmetry breaking,
to probe the magnetic structure of a new 2D magnetic semiconductor, CrSBr. We find that CrSBr monolayers
are ferromagnetically ordered below 146 K, an observation enabled by the discovery of a giant magnetic
dipole SHG effect in the centrosymmetric 2D structure. In multilayers, the ferromagnetic monolayers
are coupled antiferromagnetically, with the N\'eel temperature notably increasing with decreasing
layer number. The magnetic structure of CrSBr, comprising spins co-aligned in-plane with rectangular
unit cell, differs markedly from the prototypical 2D hexagonal magnets CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 with
out-of-plane moments. Moreover, our SHG analysis suggests that the order parameters of the ferromagnetic
monolayer and the antiferromagnetic bilayer are the magnetic dipole and the magnetic toroidal
moments, respectively. These findings establish CrSBr as an exciting 2D magnetic semiconductor
and SHG as a powerful tool to probe 2D magnetic symmetry, opening the door to the exploration of coupling
between magnetic order and excitonic/electronic properties, as well as the magnetic toroidal
moment, in a broad range of applications.
