We have used molecular dynamics to simulate an amorphous glassy polymer with long chains to study
deformation mechanism of crazing and associated void statistics. The Van der Waals interactions
and the entanglements between chains constituting the polymer play a crucial role in crazing. Thus,
we have reconstructed two underlying weighted networks, namely, the Van der Waals network and the
Entanglement network from polymer configurations extracted from the molecular dynamics simulation.
Subsequently, we have performed graph-theoretic analysis of the two reconstructed networks to
reveal the role played by them in crazing of polymers. Our analysis captured various stages of crazing
through specific trends in the network measures for Van der Waals networks and entanglement networks.
To further corroborate the effectiveness of network analysis in unraveling the underlying physics
of crazing in polymers, we have contrasted the trends in network measures for Van der Waals networks
and entanglement networks in the light of stress-strain behaviour and voids statistics during
deformation. We find that Van der Waals network plays a crucial role in craze initiation and growth.
Although, the entanglement network was found to maintain its structure during craze initiation
stage, it was found to progressively weaken and undergo dynamic changes during the hardening and
failure stages of crazing phenomena. Our work demonstrates the utility of network theory in quantifying
the underlying physics of polymer crazing and widens the scope of applications of network science
to characterization of deformation mechanisms in diverse polymers.
