Metal nanostructures are key elements in nanooptics owing to their strong resonant interaction
with light through local plasmonic charge oscillations. Their ability to shape light at the nanoscale
have made them important across a multitude of areas, including biosensing, energy conversion
and ultrathin flat metaoptics. Yet another dimension of avenues is foreseen for dynamic nanoantennas,
ranging from tuneable metalenses for miniaturized medical devices to adaptable windows that control
radiation flows in and out of buildings. However, enabling nano-optical antennas to be dynamically
controllable remains highly challenging and particularly so for traditional metals with fixed
permittivity. Here we present state-of-the-art conductive polymers as a new class of organic plasmonic
materials for redox-tuneable nano-optics. Through experiments and simulations, we show that
nanodisks of highly conductive polymers can provide clear optical extinction peaks via excitation
of dipolar localised surface plasmon resonances. Resonance frequencies redshift with increasing
nanodisk aspect ratio, in agreement with analytical calculations based on dipolar polarizability
theory. We furthermore demonstrate complete switching of the optical response of the organic nanoantennas
by chemical tuning of the polymer's redox state, which effectively modulates the material permittivity
between plasmonic and non-plasmonic regimes. Our results thereby show that conductive polymer
nanostructures can act as redox-tuneable plasmonic nanoantennas, based on bipolaronic charge
carriers rather than electrons as in conventional metals. Future directions may investigate different
polymers and geometries to further widen the plasmonic spectral range (here around 0.8 to 3.6 {\mu}m)
as well as different ways of tuning.
