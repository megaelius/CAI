Inelastic scattering of visible light (Raman effect) offers a window into properties of correlated
metals such as spin, electron and lattice dynamics as well as their mutual interactions. In this
review we focus on electronic and spin excitations in Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides in particular,
but not exclusively superconductors. After a general introduction to the basic theory including
the selection rules for the various scattering processes we provide an overview over the major results.
In the superconducting state below the transition temperature Tc the pair-breaking effect can
be observed, and the energy gap can be derived. The energies can be associated with the gaps and their
anisotropy on the electron and hole bands. In spite of the similarities of the overall band structures
the results are strongly dependent on the family and may even change qualitatively within one family.
In some of the compounds strong collective modes appear below Tc. In Ba1-xKxFe2As2, which has the
most isotropic gap of all Fe-based superconductors, there are indications that these modes are
exciton-like states appearing in the presence of a hierarchy of pairing tendencies. The strong
in-gap modes observed in Co-doped NaFeAs are interpreted in terms of quadrupolar orbital excitations
which become undamped in the superconducting state. The doping dependence of the scattering intensity
in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 is associated with a nematic resonance above a quantum critical point and interpreted
in terms of a critical enhancement at the maximal Tc. In the normal state the response from particle-hole
excitations reflects the resistivity. In addition, there are contributions from presumably critical
fluctuations in the energy range of kBT which can be compared to the elastic properties. Currently
it is not settled whether the fluctuations observed by light scattering are related to spin or charge.
