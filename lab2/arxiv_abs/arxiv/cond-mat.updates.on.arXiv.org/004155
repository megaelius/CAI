In this work, density functional theory calculations were carried out to explore the mechanical
response, dynamical/thermal stability, electronic/optical properties and photocatalytic
features of monoclinic As2X3 (X=S, Se and Te) nanosheets. Acquired phonon dispersions and ab-initio
molecular dynamics results confirm the stability of studied nanomembranes. Observation of relatively
weak interlayer interactions suggests that the exfoliation techniques can be potentially employed
to fabricate nanomembranes from their bulk counterparts. The studied nanosheets were found to
show highly anisotropic mechanical properties. Notably, new As2Te3 2D lattice predicted by this
study is found to exhibit unique superstretchability, which outperforms other 2D materials. In
addition, our results on the basis of HSE06 functional reveal the indirect semiconducting electronic
nature for the monolayer to few-layer and bulk structures of As2X3, in which a moderate decreasing
trend in the band-gap by increasing the thickness can be established. The studied nanomaterials
were found to show remarkably high and anisotropic carrier mobilities. Moreover, optical results
show that these nanosheets can absorb the visible light. In particular, the valence and conduction
band edge positions, high carrier mobilities and optical responses of As2Se3 nanosheets were found
to be highly desirable for the solar water splitting. The comprehensive vision provided by this
study not only confirm the stability and highly attractive electronic and optical characteristics
of As2S3, As2Se3 and As2Te3 nanosheets, but also offer new possibilities to design superstretchable
nanodevices.
