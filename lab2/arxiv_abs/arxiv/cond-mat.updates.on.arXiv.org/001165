We introduce a general procedure to extract the wave function of quasiparticles in AC-driven quantum
conductors. By incorporating the Bloch-Messiah reduction into the scattering theory approach
to quantum transport, we construct the many-body state from the scattering matrix, within which
the wave function of quasiparticles can be extracted. We find that two kinds of quasiparticles can
be excited, while both of them are superpositions of particle and hole states in the Fermi sea. Due
to the electron number conservation, the quasiparticles are always created in pairs, resulting
in particle-hole pair excitations in quantum conductors. We apply our approach to compare these
particle-hole pairs excited in perfectly transparent quantum contacts and mesoscopic capacitors
with single-level quantum dot. For the quantum contacts, multiple pairs can be excited, while the
excitation probability of each pair increases as the strength of the driving field increasing.
The particle(hole) components are always in phase (180 degrees out of phase) with the driving field.
These features agree with the results obtained via the extended Keldysh-Green's function technique.
For the mesoscopic capacitors, only one particle-hole pair can be excited, while the corresponding
excitation probability undergoes an oscillation as the strength of the driving field increasing.
A nonzero phase delay between the particle(hole) component and the driving field exists, which
can be tuned via the dot-lead coupling in the mesoscopic capacitor. These features are very distinct
from the case of quantum contacts, which can be attributed to the finite dwell time of electrons in
the mesoscopic capacitor. We also find that our approach can also offer a general way to extract the
wave function of quasiparticles from the Wigner function, making it helpful for the signal processing
of relevant experiments in electron quantum optics.
