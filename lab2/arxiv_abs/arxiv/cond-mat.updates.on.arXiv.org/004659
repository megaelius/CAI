Excitons play major roles in optical processes in modern semiconductors, such as single-wall carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs), transition metal dichalcogenides, and 2D perovskite quantum wells. They
possess extremely large binding energies (>100~meV), dominating absorption and emission spectra
even at high temperatures. The large binding energies imply that they are stable, that is, hard to
ionize, rendering them seemingly unsuited for optoelectronic devices that require mobile charge
carriers, especially terahertz emitters and solar cells. Here, we have conducted terahertz emission
and photocurrent studies on films of aligned single-chirality semiconducting SWCNTs and find
that excitons autoionize, i.e., spontaneously dissociate into electrons and holes. This process
naturally occurs ultrafast (<1~ps) while conserving energy and momentum. The created carriers
can then be accelerated to emit a burst of terahertz radiation when a dc bias is applied, with promising
efficiency in comparison to standard GaAs-based emitters. Furthermore, at high bias, the accelerated
carriers acquire high enough kinetic energy to create secondary excitons through impact exciton
generation, again in a fully energy and momentum conserving fashion. This exciton multiplication
process leads to a nonlinear photocurrent increase as a function of bias. Our theoretical simulations
based on nonequilibrium Boltzmann transport equations, taking into account all possible scattering
pathways and a realistic band structure, reproduce all our experimental data semi-quantitatively.
These results not only elucidate the momentum-dependent ultrafast dynamics of excitons and carriers
in SWCNTs but also suggest promising routes toward terahertz excitonics despite the orders-of-magnitude
mismatch between the exciton binding energies and the terahertz photon energies.
