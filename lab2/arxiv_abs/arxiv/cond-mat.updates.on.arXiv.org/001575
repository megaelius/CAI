Concentrated fabric softeners are water-based formulations containing around 10 - 15 wt. % of double
tailed esterquat surfactants primarily synthesized from palm oil. In recent patents, it was shown
that a significant part of the surfactant contained in today formulations can be reduced by circa
50 % and replaced by natural guar polymers without detrimental effects on the deposition and softening
performances. We presently study the structure and rheology of these softener formulations and
identify the mechanisms at the origin of these effects. The polymer additives used are guar gum polysaccharides,
one cationic and one modified through addition of hydroxypropyl groups. Formulations with and
without guar polymers are investigated using optical and cryo-transmission electron microscopy,
small-angle light and Xray scattering and finally rheology. Similar techniques are applied to
study the phase behavior of softener and cellulose nanocrystals considered here as a model for cotton.
The esterquat surfactants are shown to assemble into micron-sized vesicles in the dilute and concentrated
regimes. In the former, guar addition in small amounts does not impair the vesicular structure and
stability. In the concentrated regime, cationic guars induce a local crowding associated to depletion
interactions and leads to the formation of a local lamellar order. In rheology, adjusting the polymer
concentration at one tenth that of the surfactant is sufficient to offset the decrease of the elastic
property associated with the surfactant reduction. In conclusion, we have shown that through an
appropriate choice of natural additives it is possible to lower the concentration of surfactants
in fabric conditioners by about half, a result that could represent a significant breakthrough
in current home care formulations.
