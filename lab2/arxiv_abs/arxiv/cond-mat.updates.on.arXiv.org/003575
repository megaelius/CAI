We perform a theoretical study of the leading pairing instabilities and the associated superconducting
gap functions within the spin-fluctuation mediated pairing scenario in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). Focussing on iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), our model Hamiltonian consists
of a realistic density functional theory (DFT)-derived ten-band hopping term, spin-orbit coupling,
and electron-electron interactions included via the multi-orbital Hubbard-Hund Hamiltonian.
We perform an extensive parameter sweep and investigate different doping regimes including cases
with only hole- or only electron Fermi pockets. In addition, we explore two different bandstructures:
a rather generic band derived for LaFeAsO but known to represent standard DFT-obtained bands for
iron-based superconductors, and a band specifically tailored for FeSe which exhibits a notably
different Fermi surface compared to the generic case. It is found that for the generic FeSCs band,
even rather large SOC has negligible effect on the resulting gap structure; the $s_{+-}$ (pseudo-)spin
singlet pairing remains strongly favored and SOC does not lead to any SOC-characteristic gap oscillations
along the various Fermi surfaces. By contrast in the strongly hole-doped case featuring only hole-pockets
around the $\Gamma$-point, the leading solution is $d$-wave pseudo-spin singlet, but with a notable
SOC-driven tendency towards helical pseudo-spin triplet pairing, which may even become the leading
instability. In the heavily electron doped situation, featuring only electron pockets centered
around the $M$-point, the leading superconducting instabilities are pseudo-spin singlets with
SOC favoring the $s$-wave case as compared to $d$-wave pairing, which is the favored gap symmetry
for vanishing SOC.
