We theoretically study the non-monotonic (re-entrant) activated dynamics associated with a repulsive
glass to fluid to attractive glass transition in high density particle suspensions interacting
via strong short range attractive forces. The classic theoretical projection approximation that
replaces all microscopic forces by a single effective force determined solely by equilibrium pair
correlations is revisited based on the projectionless dynamic theory (PDT) that avoids force projection.
A hybrid-PDT is formulated that explicitly quantifies how attractive forces induce dynamical
constraints, while singular hard core interactions are treated based on the projection approach.
Both the effects of interference between repulsive and attractive forces, and structural changes
due to attraction-induced bond formation that competes with caging, are included. Combined with
the microscopic Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory of activated
relaxation, the resultant approach appears to properly capture both the re-entrant dynamic crossover
behavior and the strong non-monotonic variation of the activated structural relaxation time with
attraction strength and range at very high volume fractions. Qualitative differences with ECNLE
theory-based results that adopt the full projection approximation are identified, and testable
predictions made. The new formulation appears qualitatively consistent with multiple experimental
and simulation studies, and provides a new perspective for the overall problem that is rooted in
activated motion and interference between repulsive and attractive forces. This is conceptually
distinct from empirical shifting or other ad hoc modifications of ideal mode coupling theory which
do not take into account activated dynamics. Implications for thermal glass forming liquids are
briefly discussed.
