Although it is well accepted that the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet(TLHAF)
has a long range ordered ground state, a thorough understanding of its spin dynamics is still missing.
While the linear spin wave theory(LSWT) predicts three branches of magnon mode in the magnetic Brillouin
zone(MBZ), the 1/S expansion at the next order is found to break down in a large portion of the MBZ centered
around the M point, leaving the fate of the magnon modes there undecided. Recent neutron scattering
measurement on Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$, an ideal realization of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ TLHAF, provides
a surprising answer to this issue. Two, rather than three branches of magnon mode are observed around
the M point, whose dispersion are strongly renormalized with respect to the LSWT prediction and
exhibit pronounced roton-like minimum at the M point. This is accompanied by a strong spin fluctuation
continuum at higher energy, inside which two strong and broad spectral peaks of unknown origin are
observed. In this work, we propose a simple picture for these spectral anomalies by invoking the
resonating valence bond(RVB) physics in the description of the ground state of the system. We find
that the roton-like minimum in the magnon dispersion can be explained by the coupling between the
collective spin fluctuation and the continuum of Dirac spinon excitation moving in a $\pi$-flux
background. We also propose that the two broad peaks in the continuum can be understood respectively
as the Landau damped third magnon mode and the Landau damped longitudinal mode. Such a picture can
be verified by studying the polarization character of the various spectral features.
