In order to theoretically identify the factors governing superconductivity in multi-layer cuprates,
a three-layer Hubbard model is studied with the two-particle self-consistent (TPSC) approach
so as to incorporate electron correlations, and also the linearized Eliashberg equation is solved
for the gap function in a matrix form to resolve the role of outer CuO$_2$ planes (OPs) and inner plane
(IP). We show that OPs dominate IP in the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave superconductivity, while IP dominates
OPs in the antiferromagnetism in the trilayer system. This comes from an electron correlation effect
in that the electron correlation makes the doping rates different between OPs and IP (i.e. a self-doping
effect), which takes place in a sufficiently correlated regime. Namely, the antiferromagnetic
fluctuations in IP are stronger due to a stronger electron correlation, which simultaneously causes
the quasiparticle density of states in IP to be reduced with a suppressed $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave
superconductivity around the antinodal region. We also show that, whereas the off-diagonal (inter-layer)
elements in the gap function matrix are tiny, inter-layer pair scattering processes are in fact
at work in enhancing the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\text{c}}$ through the inter-layer
Green's functions. Specifically, the trilayer system has higher $T_{\text{c}}$ than the single-layer
one in a weak- and intermediate-coupling regimes due to the differentiation between OPs and IP.
This picture holds for a range of the on-site Hubbard repulsion $U$, which contains that estimated
for the cuprates. The present result is qualitatively consistent with nuclear magnetic resonance
experiments in multi-layer cuprates superconductors.
