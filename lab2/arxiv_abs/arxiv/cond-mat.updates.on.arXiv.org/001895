The effective diffusivity of Brownian tracer particles confined in periodic micro-channels is
smaller than the microscopic diffusivity due to entropic trapping. Here, we study diffusion in
two-dimensional periodic channels whose cross-section presents singular points, such as abrupt
changes of radius or the presence of thin walls, with openings, delimiting periodic compartments
composing the channel. Dispersion in such systems is analyzed using the Fick-Jacobs' approximation.
This approximation assumes a much faster equilibration in the lateral than in the axial direction,
along which the dispersion is measured. If the characteristic width $a$ of the channel is much smaller
than the period $L$ of the channel, i.e. $\varepsilon = a/L$ is small, this assumption is clearly
valid for Brownian particles. For discontinuous channels, the Fick-Jacobs' approximation is
only valid at the lowest order in $\varepsilon$ and provides a rough, though on occasions rather
accurate, estimate of the effective diffusivity. Here we provide formulas for the effective diffusivity
in discontinuous channels that are asymptotically exact at the next-to-leading order in $\varepsilon$.
Each discontinuity leads to a reduction of the effective diffusivity. We show that our theory is
consistent with the picture of effective {\em trapping rates} associated with each discontinuity,
for which our theory provides explicit and asymptotically exact formulas. Our analytical predictions
are confirmed by numerical analysis. Our results provide a precise quantification of the kinetic
entropic barriers associated with profile singularities.
