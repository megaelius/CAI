In the past two decades a range of fluorescence cell microscopy techniques have been developed which
can achieve ~10 nm spatial resolution, i.e. substantially beating the usual limits set by optical
diffraction. However, these methods rely on specialised labelling. This limits the applicability,
risks perturbing the biology, and it also makes them so-called "discovery techniques" that can
only be used when there is prior knowledge about the biological problem. The alternative, electron
microscopy (EM), requires complex and time-consuming sample preparation, that risks compromising
the sample's integrity. Samples have to withstand vacuum, and staining with heavy metals to make
them conductive, and give usable electron-contrast. None of these techniques can directly map
out drug distributions at a sub-cellular level. Recently infrared light-based scanning probe
techniques have demonstrated a capability for ~1 nm spatial resolution. However, they need samples
that are flat, dry and dimensionally stable and they only probe down to a depth commensurate with
the spatial resolution, so they yield essentially surface chemical information. Thus far they
have been applied only to artificially produced test samples, e.g. gold particles, or isolated
proteins on silicon. Here we show how these probe-based techniques can be adapted for use with routinely
prepared general biological specimens. This allows for "Mid-infrared Chemical Nano-imaging"
(MICHNI) that delivers chemical analysis at a ~10 nm spatial resolution, suitable for studying
cellular ultrastructure. We demonstrate its utility by performing label-free mapping of the anti-cancer
drug Bortezomib (BTZ) within a single human myeloma cell. We believe that this MICHNI technique
has the potential to become a widely applicable adjunct to EM across the bio-sciences.
