The origin of chirality has intrigued many generations of scientists, who explained it by physical
laws, chance, or the need for homochirality. The role of natural selection, however, has been largely
overlooked. Yet, chirality in shape, motility, and interactions with the environment can readily
evolve in unicellular organisms such as bacteria and cancer cells. Moreover, the change in chirality
is often accompanied by an increase in fitness. To answer whether chirality can provide a direct
fitness advantage, we developed a minimal reaction-diffusion model of chiral growth in compact
microbial colonies. For strains with equal chiralities, our model quantitatively reproduces
logarithmic twisting of boundaries between the strains and other spatial patterns observed in
the experiments. For strains with different chiralities, our model predicts either the exclusion
of the less chiral strain or stable coexistence. Selection for specific chirality is mediated by
bulges along the colony edge that appear in regions where the strains with different chiralities
meet. We developed an analytical framework to study this two-way coupling between selection and
colony shape, which is ubiquitous in spatially structured populations yet remains poorly understood.
For chiral strains, the theory of population dynamics is described by the chiral KPZ equation coupled
to the Burger's equation with multiplicative noise. We obtain exact solutions for the key features
of this theory including the shape of the bulges and their effect on competition between the strains.
Overall, our work suggests that chirality could be an important ecological trait that mediates
competition, invasion, and spatial structure in cellular populations.
