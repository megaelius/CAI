We study electronic structure of vortex core states of FeSe superconductors based on a $t_{2g}$
three-orbital model by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes(BdG) equation self-consistently. The
orbital-resolved vortex core states of different pairing symmetries manifest themselves as distinguishable
structures due to different behavior of the quasi-particle wavefunctions. The obtained vortices
are classified by the invariant subgroups of the symmetry group of the mean-field Hamiltonian in
the presence of magnetic field as isotropic $s$ and $s_{\pm}$ wave vortices have $G_5$ symmetry
for each orbital, whereas $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave vortices show $G^{*}_{6}$ symmetry for $d_{xz}$
and $d_{yz}$ orbitals and $G^{*}_{5}$ symmetry for $d_{xy}$ orbital. In the case of $d_{x^2-y^2}$
wave vortices, hybridized-pairing between $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals gives rise to a relative
phase difference in terms of winding structures of vortices between these two orbitals and $d_{xy}$
orbital, which is essentially caused by a transformation of co-representation of $G^{*}_{5}$
and $G^{*}_{6}$ group. Calculation of particle densities show common charging feature of vortices
in the cases of $s_{\pm}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave pairing states where the electron-like vortices
are observed for $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals while hole-like vortices for $d_{xy}$ orbital.
The results of orbital-resolved local density of states(LDOS) show that a local charge density
oscillation is induced by charged $s_{\pm}$ wave vortices, while hybridized $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave
vortices show a consistent pattern of LDOS with scanning tunneling microscopy(STM) measurement
results. The phase difference of orbital-resolved $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave vortices and their charging
effects can be verified by further experiment observation.
