We have conducted experiments on the effect of polymer solutions on the formation and propagation
of vortex rings. We study this effect in aqueous solution of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PAMH) at
different concentrations. Addition of PAMH imparts shear-rate dependent viscosity and elasticity
to the solvent. With increasing concentration of PAMH both the zero-shear-rate viscosity ($\eta_0$)
and the infinite-shear-rate viscosity ($\eta_{\infty}$) increase. The relaxation time also
increases with the increase in concentration. We generate vortex rings using a piston-cylinder
mechanism in a glass tank and measure vortex ring properties such as ring position, ring circulation,
enstrophy, kinetic energy and peak vorticity using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Experiments
are conducted by (1) matching impulse, and (2) matching Reynolds number. We show that, at constant
impulse, vortex ring properties in PAMH solution deviate from that in Newtonian water. As the concentration
of the PAMH solution increases, so too does the deviation from water. We further perform experiments
in water by matching the limiting Reynolds numbers of the PAMH solution corresponding to both $\eta_0$
and $\eta_{\infty}$. We find that while the circulation of PAMH solutions lies between the circulation
curves of the two extreme Reynolds number matched water experiments for an extended period of time,
the enstrophy and peak vorticity do not. We attribute this behavior to the modification of vorticity
distribution within the core of vortex rings in PAMH solutions. We also study the effect of polymer
solutions on the formation number. We find that the formation number remains the same even in polymer
solutions. We also demonstrate, using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF), the phenomenon
of ring reversal.
