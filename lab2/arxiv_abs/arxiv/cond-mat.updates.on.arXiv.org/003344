We demonstrate that the Lifshitz interaction energy (excluding the self-energies of the inner
and outer spherical regions) for three concentric spherical dielectric media can be evaluated
easily using the immense computation power in recent processors relative to those of a few decades
ago. As a prototype, we compute the Lifshitz interaction energy for a spherical shell of water immersed
in water vapor of infinite extent while enclosing a spherical ball of ice inside the shell, such that
two concentric spherical interfaces are formed: one between solid ice and liquid water and the other
between liquid water and gaseous vapor. We evaluate the Lifshitz interaction energy for the above
configuration at the triple point of water when the solid, liquid, and gaseous states of water coexist,
and, thus, extend the analysis of Elbaum and Schick in Phys. Rev. Lett. 66 (1991) 1713 to spherical
configurations. We find that, when the Lifshitz energy contributes dominantly to the total energy
of this system, which is often the case when electrostatic interactions are absent, a drop of water
surrounded by vapor of infinite extent is not stable at the triple point. This instability, that
is a manifestation of the quantum fluctuations in the medium, will induce nucleation of ice in water,
which will then grow in size indefinitely. This is a consequence of the finding here that the Lifshitz
energy is minimized for large (micrometer size) radius of the ice ball and small (nanometer size)
thickness of the water shell surrounding the ice. These results might be relevant to the formation
of hail in thunderclouds. These results are tentative in that the self-energies are omitted.
