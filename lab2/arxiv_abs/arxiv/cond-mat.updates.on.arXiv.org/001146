The anomalous surface states of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are usually thought
to be only possible in conjunction with the higher dimensional topological bulk. However, it has
recently been realized that a class of anomalous SPT surface states can be realized in the same dimension
if symmetries are allowed to act in a nonlocal fashion. An example is the particle-hole symmetric
half filled Landau level, which effectively realizes the anomalous surface state of a 3D chiral
Topological Insulator (class AIII). A dual description in terms of Dirac composite fermions has
also been discussed. Here we explore generalizations of these constructions to multicomponent
quantum Hall states. Our results include a duality mapping of the bilayer case to composite bosons
with Kramers degeneracy and the possibility of a particle hole symmetric integer quantum Hall state
when the number of components is a multiple of eight. Next, we make a further extension by half filling
other classes of topological bands and imposing particle hole symmetry. When applied to time-reversal
invariant topological insulators we realize a different chiral class (CII) topological surface
state. Notably, half-filling a 3D TI band allows for the realization of the surface of the otherwise
inaccessible 4D topological insulator, which supports an anomalous 3D Dirac cone. Surface topological
orders equivalent to the 3D Dirac cone (from the global anomaly standpoint) are constructed and
connections to Witten's SU(2) anomaly are made. These observations may also be useful for numerical
simulations of topological surface states and of Dirac fermions without fermion doubling.
