How the information microscopically processed in individual neurons is integrated and used for
organising macroscopic behaviour of an animal is a central question in neuroscience. Coherence
in dynamics over different scales has been suggested as a clue to the mechanisms underlying this
integration. Balanced excitation and inhibition amplify microscopic fluctuations to a macroscopic
level, and hence possibly provide a mechanism for generating coherent dynamics over the two scales.
Previous theories of brain dynamics, however, were restricted to the case in which population-averaged
activities were constrained to constant values, namely, the case with no macroscopic degrees of
freedom. In the present study, we investigate balanced neuronal networks with a nonzero number
of macroscopic degrees of freedom coupled to microscopic degrees of freedom. In these networks,
amplified microscopic fluctuations serve as driving forces of macroscopic dynamics, while macroscopic
dynamics determine statistics of microscopic fluctuations. We develop a novel type of mean-field
theory applicable to this class of interscale interactions to which an analytical approach was
previously unknown. Macroscopic irregular rhythms similar to those observed in the brain spontaneously
emerge as a result of such interactions. Microscopic inputs to a small number of neurons effectively
entrain the whole network through the amplification mechanism. Neuronal responses become coherent
as the magnitude of balanced excitation and inhibition or that of external inputs is increased.
Our mean-field theory successfully predicts the above behaviour of the model. Numerical results
further suggest that the coherent dynamics can be used for selective read-out of information. In
conclusion, our results show a novel form of neuronal information processing bridging different
scales and advance our understanding of the brain.
