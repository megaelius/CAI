The conditional quantum mutual information $I(A;B|C)$ of a tripartite state $\rho_{ABC}$ is an
information quantity which lies at the center of many problems in quantum information theory. Three
of its main properties are that it is non-negative for any tripartite state, that it decreases under
local operations applied to systems $A$ and $B$, and that it obeys the duality relation $I(A;B|C)=I(A;B|D)$
for a four-party pure state on systems $ABCD$. The present paper defines different $\alpha$-Renyi
generalizations $I_{\alpha}(A;B|C)$ of the conditional mutual information, some of which we
can prove converge to the conditional mutual information in the limit $\alpha \rightarrow 1$. Furthermore,
we prove that many of these generalizations satisfy non-negativity, duality, and monotonicity
with respect to local operations on one of the systems $A$ or $B$ (with it being left as an open question
to prove that monotoniticity holds with respect to local operations on both systems). The quantities
defined here should find applications in quantum information theory and perhaps even in other areas
of physics, but we leave this for future work. We also state a conjecture regarding the monotonicity
of the Renyi conditional mutual informations defined here with respect to the Renyi parameter $\alpha$.
We prove that this conjecture is true in some special cases and when $\alpha$ is in a neighborhood
of one. Finally, we discuss how our approach for conditional mutual information can be extended
to give Renyi generalizations of an arbitrary linear combination of von Neumann entropies with
coefficients chosen from the set $\{-1,0,1\}$, particular examples including the conditional
multipartite information and the topological entanglement entropy.
