Half-light half-matter quasiparticles termed exciton-polaritons arise through the strong coupling
of excitons and cavity photons. They have been used to demonstrate a wide array of fundamental phenomena
and potential applications ranging from Bose-Einstein like condensation to analog Hamiltonian
simulators and chip-scale interferometers. Recently the two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) owing to their large exciton binding energies, oscillator strength and valley degree of
freedom have emerged as a very attractive platform to realize exciton-polaritons at elevated temperatures.
Achieving electrical injection of polaritons is attractive both as a precursor to realizing electrically
driven polariton lasers as well as for high speed light-emitting diodes (LED) for communication
systems. Here we demonstrate an electrically driven polariton LED operating at room temperature
using monolayer tungsten disulphide (WS2) as the emissive material. To realize this device, the
monolayer WS2 is sandwiched between thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tunnel barriers with graphene
layers acting as the electrodes. The entire tunnel LED structure is embedded inside a one-dimensional
distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) based microcavity structure. The extracted external quantum
efficiency is ~0.1% and is comparable to recent demonstrations of bulk organic and carbon nanotube
based polariton electroluminescence (EL) devices. The possibility to realize electrically driven
polariton LEDs in atomically thin semiconductors at room temperature presents a promising step
towards achieving an inversionless electrically driven laser in these systems as well as for ultrafast
microcavity LEDs using van der Waals materials.
