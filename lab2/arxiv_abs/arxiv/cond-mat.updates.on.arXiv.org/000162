We construct a class of exact ground states for correlated electrons on pentagon chains in the high
density region and discuss their physical properties. In this procedure the Hamiltonian is first
cast in a positive semidefinite form using composite operators as a linear combination of creation
operators acting on the sites of finite blocks. In the same step, the interaction is also transformed
to obtain terms which require for their minimum eigenvalue zero at least one electron on each site.
The transformed Hamiltonian matches the original Hamiltonian through a nonlinear system of equations
whose solutions place the deduced ground states in restricted regions of the parameter space. In
the second step, nonlocal product wave functions in position space are constructed. They are proven
to be unique ground states which describe non-saturated ferromagnetic and correlated half metallic
states. These solutions emerge when the strength of the Hubbard interaction $U_i$ is site dependent
inside the unit cell. In the deduced phases, the interactions tune the bare dispersive band structure
such to develop an effective upper flat band. We show that this band flattening effect emerges for
a broader class of chains and is not restricted to pentagon chains. For the characterization of the
deduced solutions, uniqueness proofs, exact ground state expectation values for long-range hopping
amplitudes and correlation functions are also calculated. The study of physical reasons which
lead to the appearance of ferromagnetism has revealed a new mechanism for the emergence of an ordered
phase, described here in details (because of lack of space see the continuation in the paper).
