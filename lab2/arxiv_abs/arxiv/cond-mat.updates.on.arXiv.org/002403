In this work, the instabilities at the nanoscale (i.e. nanoinstabilities) of triangular pyramids-like
Cu2O porous nanostructured films (PNFs) are studied by heating treatments under different atmosphere
and temperature. It is found that the nanoscale building triangular-pyramids turn round preferentially
at the sharp angles and/or coalesce with their contacting ones by directional diffusion and plastic
flow of atoms, which are driven by the nonuniformly-distributed surface nanocurvature. As a result,
the triangular pyramids become quasi-sphere shape and the PNF evolves into a big, dense particles
film. It is also observed that the heating or thermal activation effect efficiently promotes the
reduction or oxidation of Cu2O pyramids and the crystallization or growth of the as-achieved Cu
or CuO grains. The above physical and chemical instabilities or changes at the nanoscale of Cu2O
PNFs can be well accounted for by the combined mechanism of nanocurvature effect and thermal activation
effect. The nanocurvature effect can lower the energy barrier for the atom diffusion or plastic
flow and lower the activation energy for the chemical reactions, while the thermal activation effect
can supply the required kinetic energy or activation energy and make the atomic transportations
and reactions kinetically possible. The findings reveal the evolution laws of morphology, crystal
structure and composition of triangular pyramids-like Cu2O PNF during heating treatments, which
can further be extended to other types of Cu2O PNFs. Also, the findings have important implications
for the nanoinstabilities of Cu2O PNFs-based devices, especially those working at a high temperature.
