Recent remarkable advances in the experimental techniques have provided a background for inferring
neuronal couplings from point process data that includes a great number of neurons. Here, we propose
a systematic procedure for pre- and post-processing generic point process data in an objective
manner, to handle data in the framework of a binary simple statistical model, the Ising or generalized
McCulloch--Pitts model. The procedure involves two steps: (1) determining time-bin size for transforming
the point-process data into discrete-time binary data and (2) screening relevant couplings from
the estimated couplings. For the first step, we decide the optimal time-bin size by introducing
the null hypothesis that all neurons would fire independently, then choosing a time-bin size so
that the null hypothesis is rejected with the most strict criterion. The likelihood associated
with the null hypothesis is analytically evaluated and used for the rejection process. For the second
post-processing step, after a certain estimator of coupling is obtained based on the pre-processed
dataset, the estimate is compared with many other estimates derived from datasets obtained by randomizing
the original dataset in the time direction. We accept the original estimate as relevant only if its
absolute value is sufficiently larger than them of randomized datasets. These manipulations suppress
false positive couplings induced by statistical noise. We apply this inference procedure to spiking
data from synthetic and in vitro neuronal networks. The results show that the proposed procedure
identifies the presence/absence of synaptic couplings fairly well including their signs, for
the synthetic and experimental data. In particular, the results support that we can infer the physical
connections of underlying systems in favorable situations, even when using the simple statistical
model.
