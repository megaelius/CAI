We highlight a general theory to engineer arbitrary Hermitian tight-binding lattice models in
electrical LC circuits, where the lattice sites are replaced by the electrical nodes, connected
to its neighbors and to the ground by capacitors and inductors. In particular, by supplementing
each node with $n$ subnodes, where the phases of the current and voltage are the $n$ distinct roots
of \emph{unity}, one can in principle realize arbitrary hopping amplitude between the sites or
the nodes via the \emph{shift capacitor coupling} between them. We then implement this general
principle to construct a plethora of topological model Hamiltonians in electrical circuits, also
known as \emph{topoelectric circuits}, where the robust zero-energy topological boundary modes
manifest through a large boundary impedance, when the circuit is tuned to the resonance frequency.
The simplicity of our circuit constructions is based on the fact that the existence of the boundary
modes relies only on the Clifford algebra of the corresponding Hermitian matrices entering the
Hamiltonian and not on their particular representation. This in turn enables to implement a wide
class of topological models through rather simple topoelectric circuits with nodes consisting
of only two subnodes. We anchor these outcomes from the numerical computation of the on-resonance
impedance in circuit realizations of first-order ($m=1$), such as Chern and quantum spin Hall insulators,
second- ($m=2$) and third- ($m=3$) order topological insulators in different dimensions, featuring
sharp localization on boundaries of codimensionality $d_c=m$. Finally, we develop \emph{stacked
topoelectric circuit} construction to engineer topological semimetals, among which three-dimensional
Weyl, nodal-loop and quadrupolar Dirac semimetals are the most prominent ones, respectively displaying
surface and hinge localized impedance.
