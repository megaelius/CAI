Unraveling the complexity of non-collinear magnetism in materials with strongly correlated electrons
is a considerable task that requires developing and applying state of the art theories and computational
methods. Using the Coury model Hamiltonian, which includes spin and orbital degrees of freedom
and generalizes the collinear Stoner Hamiltonian, we derive an extension of the collinear LSDA+U
approximation to non-collinear magnetic configurations and explore the magnetic ground state
of the archetypal spin-orbit correlated oxide UO2. To find the magnetic ground state of UO2 in the
non-collinear configuration space, we combine LSDA+U with a spin adiabatic occupation matrix
approach. Our results show that the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is the key factor stabilizing
the so-called 3k spin ordered magnetic ground state of UO2. Using a relativistic atomic Hamiltonian
we find that the SOC strength is colossal, 1.45 eV per uranium atom. This unusually strong SOC implies
that the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are virtually inseparable. As a result, to derive and
quantify spin-spin interactions it is necessary to adopt the pseudospin picture. By constructing
an extended effective multipolar pseudospin Hamiltonian, we prove the significance of octupolar
and dipole-dipole exchange couplings in establishing the 3k magnetic phase, consistent with the
non-collinear spin arrangement, and associated with the canted orbital ordering of uranium f-orbitals.
Importantly, our study reveals that despite the presence of strong spin-lattice interaction in
UO2, the cooperative Jahn-Teller instability does not contribute to the onset of the non-collinear
3k state, which remains the most favorable ground state even in the undistorted lattice.
