The failed "vortex-atoms" theory of matter by Kelvin and Tait had a profound impact on mathematics
and physics. Building on the understanding of vorticity by Helmholtz, and observing stability
of smoke rings, they hypothesised that elementary particles (at that time atoms) are indestructible
knotted vortices in luminiferous aether: the hypothetical ideal fluid filling the universe. The
vortex-atoms theory identified chemical elements as topologically different vortex knots, and
matter was interpreted as bound states of these knotted vortices. This work initiated the field
of knot theory in mathematics. It also influenced modern physics, where a close although incomplete
analogy exists with the theory of superfluidity, which started with Onsager's and Feynman's introduction
of quantum vortices. Indeed many macroscopic properties of superconductors and superfluids are
indeed determined by vortex lines forming different "aggregate states", such as vortex crystals
and liquids. While crucial importance of knots was understood for many physical systems in the recent
years, there is no known physical realization of the central element of Kelvin theory: the stable
particle-like vortex knot. Indeed, vortex loops and knots in superfluids and ordinary superconductors
form as dynamical excitations and are unstable by Derrick theorem. This instability in fact dictates
many of the universal macroscopic properties of superfluids. Here we show that there are superconducting
states with principally different properties of the vorticity: where vortex knots are intrinsically
stable. We demonstrate that such features should be realised near certain critical points, where
the hydro-magneto-statics of superconducting states yields stables vortex knots which behave
similar to those envisaged in Kelvin and Tait's theory of vortex-atoms in luminiferous aether.
