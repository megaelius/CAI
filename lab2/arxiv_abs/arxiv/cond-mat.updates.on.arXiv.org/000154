We describe the conditions under which the predicted (but not yet observed) zero-field inter-layer
excitonic condensation in double layer graphene has a critical temperature high enough to allow
detection. Both double monolayer and double bilayer graphene are considered in our theory. We present
the calculation of the critical temperature for the inter-layer excitonic superfluid transition
within the mean-field BCS theory for both optimistic and conservative approximations for the screening
of the inter-layer Coulomb interaction, and discuss how disorder arising from charged impurities
and corrugation in the lattice structure affect formation of the condensate via the charge inhomogeneity
they induce. In the former case, we use a numerical Thomas-Fermi-Dirac theory to describe the local
fluctuations in the electronic density in double layer graphene devices and estimate the effect
these realistic fluctuations have on the formation of the condensate. We also estimate the effect
of allowing dynamic contributions to the inter-layer screening. We then conduct similar calculations
for double quadratic bilayer graphene, showing that the quadratic nature of the low-energy bands
produces only a small qualitative change in the pairing strength. We compare the inter-layer interaction
potential for these two systems and find that, since screening is stronger in quadratic bilayer
graphene, it is probably not advantageous to search for the condensate in this system. We believe
that disorder-free closely spaced double layers of monolayer graphene provide the most likely
system for excitonic inter-layer superfluidity to manifest itself.
