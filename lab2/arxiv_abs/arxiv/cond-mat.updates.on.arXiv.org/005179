Recent progress in the realm of noisy, intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices represents an
exciting opportunity for many-body physics, by introducing new laboratory platforms with unprecedented
control and measurement capabilities. We explore the implications of NISQ platforms for many-body
physics in a practical sense: we ask which {\it physical phenomena}, in the domain of quantum statistical
mechanics, they may realize more readily than traditional experimental platforms. As a particularly
well-suited target, we identify discrete time crystals (DTCs), novel non-equilibrium states
of matter that break time translation symmetry. These can only be realized in the intrinsically
out-of-equilibrium setting of periodically driven quantum systems stabilized by disorder induced
many-body localization. While precursors of the DTC have been observed across a variety of experimental
platforms - ranging from trapped ions to nitrogen vacancy centers to NMR crystals - none have \emph{all}
the necessary ingredients for realizing a fully-fledged incarnation of this phase, and for detecting
its signature long-range \emph{spatiotemporal order}. We show that a new generation of quantum
simulators can be programmed to realize the DTC phase and to experimentally detect its dynamical
properties, a task requiring extensive capabilities for programmability, initialization and
read-out. Specifically, the architecture of Google's Sycamore processor is a remarkably close
match for the task at hand. We also discuss the effects of environmental decoherence, and how they
can be distinguished from `internal' decoherence coming from closed-system thermalization dynamics.
Already with existing technology and noise levels, we find that DTC spatiotemporal order would
be observable over hundreds of periods, with parametric improvements to come as the hardware advances.
