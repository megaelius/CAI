The selective solute partitioning within a polymeric network is of key importance to applications
in which controlled release or uptake of solutes in a responsive hydrogel is required. In this work
we investigate the impact of cross-links on solute adsorption in a swollen polymer network by means
of all-atom, explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on a representative network
subunit consisting of poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and $N$,$N'$-methylenebisacrylamide
(BIS/MBA) cross-linker types. Our studied system consists of one BIS-linker with four atactic
PNIPAM chains attached in a tetrahedral geometry. The adsorption of several representative solutes
of different polarity in the low concentration limit at the linker region is examined. We subdivide
the solute adsorption regions and distinguish between contributions stemming from polymer chains
and cross-link parts. In comparison to a single polymer chain, we observe that the adsorption of
the solutes to the cross-link region can significantly differ, with details depending on the specific
compounds' size and polarity. In particular, for solutes that have already a relatively large affinity
to PNIPAM chains the dense cross-link region (where many-body attractions are at play) amplifies
the local adsorption by an order of magnitude. We also find that the cross-link region can serve as
a seed for the aggregation of mutually attractive solutes at higher solute concentrations. Utilizing
the microscopic adsorption coefficients in a mean-field model of an idealized macroscopic polymer
network, we extrapolate these results to the global solute partitioning in a swollen hydrogel and
predict that these adsorption features may lead to non-monotonic partition ratios as a function
of the cross-link density.
