Background: Ab initio many-body methods whose numerical cost scales polynomially with the number
of particles have been developed over the past fifteen years to tackle closed-shell mid-mass nuclei.
Open-shell nuclei have been further addressed by implementing variants based on the concept of
spontaneous symmetry breaking (and restoration). Purpose: In order to access the spectroscopy
of open-shell nuclei more systematically while controlling the numerical cost, we design a novel
many-body method that combines the merit of breaking and restoring symmetries with those brought
about by low-rank individual excitations. Methods: The recently proposed truncated configuration-interaction
method based on optimized symmetry-broken and -restored states is extended to the z-signature
symmetry associated with a discrete subgroup of SU(2). The highly-truncated N-body Hilbert subspace
within which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized is spanned by a z-signature broken and restored Slater
determinant vacuum and associated low-rank excitations. Results: The proposed method provides
an excellent reproduction of the ground-state energy and of low-lying excitation energies of various
z-signatures and total angular momenta. In doing so, the successive benefits of (i) breaking the
symmetry, (ii) restoring the symmetry, (iii) including low-rank particle-hole excitations and
(iv) optimizing the amount by which the underlying vacuum breaks the symmetry are illustrated.
Conclusions: The numerical cost of the newly designed variational method is polynomial with respect
to the system size. The present study confirms the results obtained previously for the attractive
pairing Hamiltonian in connection with the breaking and restoration of U(1) global gauge symmetry.
These two studies constitute a strong motivation to apply this method to realistic nuclear Hamiltonians.
