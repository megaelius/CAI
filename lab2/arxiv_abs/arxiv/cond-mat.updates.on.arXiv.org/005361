New Nd-Fe-B crystal structures can be formed via the elemental substitution of LATX host structures,
including lanthanides LA, transition metals T, and light elements X as B, C, N, and O. The 5967 samples
of ternary LATX materials that are collected are then used as the host structures. For each host crystal
structure, a substituted crystal structure is created by substituting all lanthanide sites with
Nd, all transition metal sites with Fe, and all light element sites with B. High throughput first-principles
calculations are applied to evaluate the phase stability of the newly created crystal structures,
and 20 of them are found to be potentially formable. A data driven approach based on supervised and
unsupervised learning techniques is applied to estimate the stability and analyze the structure
stability relationship of the newly created NdFeB crystal structures. For predicting the stability
for the newly created NdFeB structures, three supervised learning models, kernel ridge regression,
logistic classification, and decision tree model, are learned from the LATX host crystal structures;
the models achieve the maximum accuracy and recall scores of 70.4 and 68.7 percent, respectively.
On the other hand, our proposed unsupervised learning model based on the integration of descriptor-relevance
analysis and a Gaussian mixture model achieves accuracy and recall score of 72.9 and 82.1 percent,
respectively, which are significantly better than those of the supervised models. While capturing
and interpreting the structure stability relationship of the NdFeB crystal structures, the unsupervised
learning model indicates that the average atomic coordination number and coordination number
of the Fe sites are the most important factors in determining the phase stability of the new substituted
NdFeB crystal structures.
