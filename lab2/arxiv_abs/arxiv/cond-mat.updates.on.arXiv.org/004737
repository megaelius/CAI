In this PhD thesis, we will present the theoretical and experimental work that led to the realization
of a radio-frequency circuit quantum electrodynamics system (RFcQED). In chapter 2, we provide
a detailed derivation of the Hamiltonian of circuit QED formulated in the context of the Rabi model,
and extract expressions for the cross-Kerr interaction. The resulting requirements for the coupling
rate in RFcQED are discussed, one of them being the need to dramatically increase the coupling rate
compared to typical circuit QED device. In chapter 3 we cover two experimental approaches to increasing
the coupling in a circuit QED system, one making use of a high impedance resonator, the second utilizing
a large coupling capacitor. In chapter 4, we combine these two approaches to implement RFcQED. Through
strong dispersive coupling, we could measure individual photons in a megahertz resonator, demonstrate
quantum control by cooling the resonator to the ground state or preparing Fock states, and finally
observe with nanosecond resolution the re-thermalization of these states. In chapter 5 we present
QuCAT or Quantum Circuit Analyzer Tool in Python, a software package that can be used for the design
of circuit QED systems such as the one presented in this thesis. In chapter 6 we discuss how certain
interplays between general relativity and quantum mechanics cannot be described using our current
laws of physics. In particular, we show how radio-frequency mechanical oscillators are perfect
candidates to perform experiments in this regime. In chapter 7 we present the prospects for coupling
such mechanical oscillator to weakly anharmonic superconducting circuits such as the transmon
qubit or RFcQED systems.
