In quantum mechanics, the spaces of momentum and its conjugate, the position, are related via Fourier
transforms and thus the properties are interwoven with their structure. In particular, for lattice
systems possessing an underlying discrete position space, the momentum becomes finite. Moreover,
if the lattice length is finite, $L<\infty$, the momentum space also becomes both finite and discrete
breaking altogether the continuity of the dispersion relation. This aspect is relevant in new systems
such as the topological materials. We address this point paving the path for new ways to the observation
of Majorana quasi-particles. Furthermore, the Kitaev model, which is the simplest Hamiltonian
supporting Majorana fermions, is therefore taken as a starting point for the theoretical description
of the work. Our study focuses on finding the zero-energy modes in an artificial arrangement of a
non-interacting superconducting finite nanowire by using a discrete-sine transform with the
purpose of going from position to momentum space considering hard-wall boundary conditions in
the process. Here, a new $L$-dimensional Nambu operator to diagonalize the system in the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes formalism is proposed and, further, we arrive to a new space with a considerable reduced dimension
allowing the treatment of larger system sizes. We also present a comparison between the numerical
and third order perturbation theory for the weak coupling regime results presenting an excellent
agreement. Finally, we analyze the wavefunctions of the retrieved zero-energy modes showing that
they are indeed edge states and thus they have an exponential decay.
