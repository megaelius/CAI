Various aspects of self-motility of chemically active colloids in Newtonian fluids can be captured
by simple models for their chemical activity plus a phoretic slip hydrodynamic boundary condition
on their surface. For particles of simple shapes (e.g., spheres) -- as employed in many experimental
studies -- which move at very low Reynolds numbers in an unbounded fluid, such models of chemically
active particles effectively map onto the well studied so-called hydrodynamic squirmers [S. Michelin
and E. Lauga, J. Fluid Mech. \textbf{747}, 572 (2014)]. Accordingly, intuitively appealing analogies
of "pusher/puller/neutral" squirmers arise naturally. Within the framework of self-diffusiophoresis
we illustrate the above mentioned mapping and the corresponding flows in an unbounded fluid for
a number of choices of the activity function (i.e., the spatial distribution and the type of chemical
reactions across the surface of the particle). We use the central collision of two active particles
as a simple, paradigmatic case for demonstrating that in the presence of other particles or boundaries
the behavior of chemically active colloids may be \textit{qualitatively} different, even in the
far field, from the one exhibited by the corresponding "effective squirmer", obtained from the
mapping in an unbounded fluid. This emphasizes that understanding the collective behavior and
the dynamics under geometrical confinement of chemically active particles necessarily requires
to explicitly account for the dependence of the hydrodynamic interactions on the distribution
of chemical species resulting from the activity of the particles.
