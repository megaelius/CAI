We study theoretically edge transport of a fractional quantum Hall liquid, in the presence of a quantum
dot inside the Hall bar with well controlled electron density and Landau level filling factor \nu,
and show that such transport studies can help reveal the nature of the fractional quantum Hall liquid.
In our first example we study the \nu=1/3 and \nu=2/3 liquids in the presence of a \nu=1 quantum dot.
When the quantum dot becomes large, its edge states join those of the Hall bar to reconstruct the edge
states configuration. Taking randomness around the edges into account, we find that in the disorder-irrelevant
phase the two-terminal conductance of the original \nu=1/3 system vanishes at zero temperature,
while that of the \nu=2/3 case remains finite. This distinction is rooted in the fact that the \nu=2/3
state is built upon the \nu=1 state. In the disorder-dominated phase, the two-terminal conductance
of \nu=1/3 system is (1/5)\frac{e^2}{h} and that of \nu=2/3 system is (1/2)\frac{e^2}{h}. We further
apply the same idea to the \nu=5/2 system which realizes either the Pfaffian or the anti-Pfaffian
states. In this case we study the edge transport in the presence of a central \nu=3 quantum dot. If
the quantum dot is large enough for its edge states joining those of the Hall bar, in the disorder-irrelevant
phase the total two-terminal conductance in the Pfaffian case is G^{Pf}_{tot}\rightarrow 2 \frac{e^2}{h}
while that of anti-Pfaffian case is higher but not universal, G^{aPf}_{tot}> 2 \frac{e^2}{h}.
This difference can be used to determine which one of these two states is realized at \nu=5/2. In the
disorder-dominated phase, however, the total two-terminal conductances in these two systems
are exactly the same, G^{Pf/aPf}_{tot}=(7/3)\frac{e^2}{h}.
