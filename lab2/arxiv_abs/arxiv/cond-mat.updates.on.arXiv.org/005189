GaTa$_4$Se$_8$ belongs to the lacunar spinel family. Its crystal structures is still a puzzle though
there have been intensive studies on its novel properties, such as the Mott insulator phase and superconductivity
under pressure. In this work, we investigate its phonon spectra through first-principle calculations
and proposed it most probably has crystal structure phase transition, which is consistent with
several experimental observations. For the prototype lacunar spinel with cubic symmetry of space
group $F\bar{4}3m$, its phonon spectra have three soft modes in the whole Brillouin zone, indicating
the strong dynamical instability of such crystal structure. In order to find the dynamically stable
crystal structure, further calculations indicate two new structures of GaTa$_4$Se$_8$, corresponding
to $R3m$ and $P\bar{4}2_{1}m$, verifying that at the ambient pressure, there does exist structure
phase transition of GaTa$_4$Se$_8$ from $F\bar{4}3m$ to other structures when the temperature
is lowered. We also performed electronic structure calculation for $R3m$ and $P\bar{4}2_{1}m$
structure, showing that $P\bar{4}2_{1}m$ structure GaTa$_4$Se$_8$ is band insulator, and obtained
Mott insulator state for $R3m$ structure by DMFT calculation under single-band Hubbard model picture
when interaction parameter U is larger than 0.40 eV vs. band width of 0.25 eV. It is reasonable to assume
that while lowering the temperature, $F\bar{4}3m$ structure GaTa$_4$Se$_8$ becomes $R3m$ structure
GaTa$_4$Se$_8$ first, then $P\bar{4}2_{1}m$ structure GaTa$_4$Se$_8$, because of the symmetry
of $P\bar{4}2_{1}m$ is lower than $R3m$ after Jahn-Teller distortion. The structure transition
may explain the magnetic susceptibility anomalous at low temperature.
