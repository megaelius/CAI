Vitrimers - a class of polymer networks which are covalently crosslinked and insoluble like thermosets,
but flow when heated like thermoplastics - contain dynamic links and/or crosslinks that undergo
an associative exchange reaction. These dynamic crosslinks enable vitrimers to have interesting
mechanical/rheological behavior, self-healing, adhesive, and shape memory properties. We demonstrate
that vitrimers can self-assemble into complex meso- and nanostructures when crosslinks and backbone
monomers strongly interact. Vitrimers featuring polyethylene (PE) as the backbone and dioxaborolane
maleimide as the crosslinkable moiety were studied in both the molten and semi-crystalline states.
We observed that PE vitrimers macroscopically phase separated into dioxaborolane maleimide rich
and poor regions, and characterized the extent of phase separation by optical transmission measurements.
This phase separation can explain the relatively low insoluble fractions and overall crystallinities
of PE vitrimers. Using synchrotron-sourced small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we discovered
that PE vitrimers and their linear precursors micro-phase separated into hierarchical nanostructures.
Fitting of the SAXS patterns to a scattering model strongly suggests that the nanostructures - which
persist in both the melt and amorphous fraction of the semi-crystalline state - may be described
as dioxaborolane maleimide rich aggregates packed in a mass fractal arrangement. These findings
of hierarchical meso- and nanostructures point out that incompatibility effects between network
components and resulting self-assembly must be considered for understanding behavior and the
rational design of vitrimer materials.
