We demonstrate the equivalence between two distinct Luttinger liquid impurity problems. The first
concerns a one-dimensional topological superconductor coupled at one end to the ends of two single
channel Luttinger liquids. The second concerns a point contact in the quantum spin Hall effect,
where four helical Luttinger liquids meet at a point. Both problems have been studied previously
and exhibit several stable phases depending on the Luttinger parameter K, that can be characterized
in terms of simple conformally invariant boundary conditions describing perfect normal (or Andreev)
transmission or reflection. In addition, both problems exhibit critical points that are described
by "intermediate" fixed points similar to those found in earlier studies of an impurity in a Luttinger
liquid with spin. Though these two models have different symmetries and numbers of modes, we show
they are equivalent and are related by a duality transformation, and we show that the non-trivial
intermediate critical points are the same. In the non-interacting limit, K=1, the duality involves
two distinct free fermion representations that are related by a non-local transformation that
derives from the triality of SO(8). Using the explicit translation between the two theories, we
translate results from one problem to the other and vice versa. This allows us to make new predictions
about the topological superconductor-Luttinger liquid junction, including predictions about
the global behavior of the critical conductance G*(K), as well predictions for the critical exponents
and universal crossover scaling functions. In this paper we introduce both models from scratch,
using a common notation that facilitates their comparison, and we discuss in detail the dualities
that relate them, along with their free fermion limits. We close with a discussion of open problems
and future directions.
