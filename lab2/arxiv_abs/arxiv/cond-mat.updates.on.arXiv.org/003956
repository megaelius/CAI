In this work, we put forward a generalized input-output method (GIOM) for studying charge transport
in molecular junctions accounting for strong electron-vibration interactions and including
electronic and phononic environments. The method radically expands the scope of the input-output
theory, which was originally proposed to treat quantum optic problems. Based on the GIOM we derive
a Langevin-type equation of motion for molecular operators, which posses a great generality and
accuracy, and permits the derivation of a stationary charge current expression involving only
two types of transfer rates. Furthermore, we devise the so-called "Polaron Transport in Electronic
Resonance" (PoTER) approximation, which allows to feasibly simulate electron dynamics in generic
tight-binding models with strong electron-vibration interactions. For short chains, the charge
current reduces to known limits and reasonably agrees with exact numerical simulations. For extended
junctions the current displays a turnover from phonon-assisted to phonon-suppressed transport.
Nevertheless, the onset of ohmic behavior requires extensions beyond the PoTER approximation.
As an additional application, we consider a cavity-coupled molecule junction. Here we identify
a cavity-induced suppression of charge current in the single-site case, and observe signatures
of polariton formation in the current-voltage characteristics in the strong light-matter coupling
regime. A critical understanding gained from the GIOM-PoTER scheme is that the single-site vibrationally-coupled
model is deceptively simpler, and amenable to approximations than multi-site models. Therefore,
benchmarking of methods should not be concluded with the single-site case. The work manifests that
the input-output framework, which is normally employed in quantum optics, can serve as a powerful
and feasible tool in the realm of electron transport junctions.
