Segregation at surfaces of metal-covalent binary liquids is often non-classical and in extreme
cases such as AuSi, the surface crystallizes above the melting point. In this study, we employ atomic-scale
computational frameworks to study the surface crystallization of AuSi films and droplets as a function
of composition, temperature and size. For temperatures in the range $T_s^\ast=765-780$K above
the melting point $(T_s^\ast\approx1.3\,T_m)$, both thin film and droplet surfaces undergo a
first order transition, from a 2D Au$_2$Si crystalline phase to a laterally disordered yet stratified
layer. The thin film surfaces exhibit an effective surface tension that increases with temperature
and decreases with Si concentration. On the other hand, for droplets in the size range $10-30$ nm,
the bulk Laplace pressure alters the surface segregation as it occurs with respect to a strained
bulk. Above $T_s^\ast$ the size effect on the surface tension is small, while for $T<T_s^\ast$ the
surface layer is strained and composed of 2D crystallites separated by extended grain boundary
scars that lead to large fluctuations in its energetics. As a specific application, all-atom simulations
of AuSi droplets on Si(111) substrate subject to Si surface flux show that the supersaturation dependent
surface tension destabilizes the contact line via formation of a precursor wetting film on the solid-vapor
interface, and has ramifications for size selection during VLS-based routes for nanowire growth.
Our study sheds light on the interplay between stability and energetics of surfaces in these unique
class of binary alloys and offers pathways for exploiting their surface structure for varied applications
such as catalytic nanocrystal growth, dealloying, and polymer crystallization.
