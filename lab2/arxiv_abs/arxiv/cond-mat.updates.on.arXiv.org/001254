We consider the $\alpha$-$T_3$ model which provides a smooth crossover between the honeycomb lattice
with pseudospin $1/2$ and the dice lattice with pseudospin $1$ through the variation of a parameter
$\alpha$. We study the dynamics of a wave packet representing a quasiparticle in the $\alpha$-T$_3$
model with zero and finite transverse magnetic field. For zero field, it is shown that the wave packet
undergoes a transient $zitterbewegung$ (ZB). Various features of ZB depending on the initial pseudospin
polarization of the wave packet have been revealed. For an intermediate value of the parameter $\alpha$
i.e. for $0<\alpha<1$ the resulting ZB consists of two distinct frequencies when the wave packet
was located initially in $rim$ site. However, the wave packet exhibits single frequency ZB for $\alpha=0$
and $\alpha=1$. It is also unveiled that the frequency of ZB corresponding to $\alpha=1$ gets exactly
half of that corresponding to the $\alpha=0$ case. On the other hand, when the initial wave packet
was in $hub$ site, the ZB consists of only one frequency for all values of $\alpha$. Using stationary
phase approximation we find analytical expression of velocity average which can be used to extract
the associated timescale over which the transient nature of ZB persists. On the contrary the wave
packet undergoes permanent ZB in presence of a transverse magnetic field. Due to the presence of
large number of Landau energy levels the oscillations in ZB appear to be much more complicated. The
oscillation pattern depends significantly on the initial pseudospin polarization of the wave
packet. Furthermore, it is revealed that the number of the frequency components involved in ZB depends
on the parameter $\alpha$.
