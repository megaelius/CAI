Bipolar carrier transport is often a limiting factor in the thermoelectric efficiency of narrow
bandgap materials (such as Bi2Te3 and PbTe) at high temperatures due to the introduction of an additional
term to the thermal conductivity and a reduction in the Seebeck coefficient. In this work, we present
a theoretical investigation into the ability of nanoinclusions to reduce the detrimental effect
of bipolar transport. Using the quantum mechanical non equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) transport
formalism, we simulate electronic transport through two-dimensional systems containing densely
packed nanoinclusions, separated by distances similar to the electron mean free path. Specifically,
considering an n type material, where the bipolar effect comes from the valence band, we insert nanoinclusions
that impose potential barriers only for the minority holes. We then extract the materials electrical
conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and electronic thermal conductivity including its bipolar
contribution. We show that nanoinclusions can indeed have some success in reducing the minority
carrier transport and the bipolar effect on both the electronic thermal conductivity and the Seebeck
coefficient. The benefits from reducing the bipolar conductivity are larger the more conductive
the minority band is to begin with (larger hole mean free path in particular), as expected. Interestingly,
however, the benefits on the Seebeck coefficient and the power factor are even more pronounced not
only when the minority mean free path is large, but when it is larger compared to the majority conduction
band mean free path. Finally, we extract an overall estimate for the benefits that nanoinclusions
can have on the ZT figure of merit.
