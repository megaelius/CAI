The recent discovered intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 have been met with unusual
success in hosting emergent phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator
states. However, the surface-bulk correspondence of the Mn-Bi-Te family, composed by the superlattice-like
MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n (n = 0, 1, 2, 3 ...) layered structure, remains intriguing but elusive. Here,
by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) techniques, we unambiguously assign the two distinct surface states of MnBi4Te7 (n = 1)
to the quintuple-layer (QL) Bi2Te3 termination and the septuple-layer (SL) MnBi2Te4 termination,
respectively. A comparison of the experimental observations with theoretical calculations reveals
the diverging topological behaviors, especially the hybridization effect between magnetic and
nonmagnetic layers, on the two terminations: a gap on the QL termination originating from the topological
surface states of the QL hybridizing with the bands of the beneath SL, and a gapless Dirac-cone band
structure on the SL termination with time-reversal symmetry. The quasi-particle interference
patterns further confirm the topological nature of the surface states for both terminations, continuing
far above the Fermi energy. The QL termination carries a spin-helical Dirac state with hexagonal
warping, while at the SL termination, a strongly canted helical state from the surface lies between
a pair of Rashba-split states from its neighboring layer. Our work elucidates an unprecedented
hybridization effect between the building blocks of the topological surface states, and also reveals
the termination-dependent time-reversal symmetry breaking in a magnetic topological insulator,
rendering an ideal platform to realize the half-integer quantum Hall effect and relevant quantum
phenomena.
