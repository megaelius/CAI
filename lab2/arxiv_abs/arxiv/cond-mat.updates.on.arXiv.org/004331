While reversibility is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, most reactions are not readily
reversible, especially in solid state physics. For example, thermal diffusion is a widely known
concept, used among others to inject dopant atoms into the substitutional positions in the matrix
and improve the device properties. Typically, such a diffusion process will create a concentration
gradient extending over increasingly large regions, without possibility to reverse this effect.
On the other hand, while the bottom up growth of semiconducting nanowires is interesting, it can
still be difficult to fabricate axial heterostructures with high control. In this paper, we report
a reversible thermal diffusion process occurring in the solid-state exchange reaction between
an Al metal pad and a Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ alloy nanowire observed by in-situ transmission electron
microscopy. The thermally assisted reaction results in the creation of a Si-rich region sandwiched
between the reacted Al and unreacted SixGe1-x part, forming an axial Al/Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ heterostructure.
Upon heating or (slow) cooling, the Al metal can repeatably move in and out of the Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$
alloy nanowire while maintaining the rod-like geometry and crystallinity, allowing to fabricate
and contact nanowire heterostructures in a reversible way in a single process step, compatible
with current Si based technology. This interesting system is promising for various applications,
such as phase change memories in an all crystalline system with integrated contacts, as well as Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$/Si
heterostructures for near-infrared sensing applications.
