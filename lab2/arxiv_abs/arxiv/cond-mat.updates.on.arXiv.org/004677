We report viscous flow properties of a redox-active organic molecule, N-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)phenothiazine
(MEEPT), a candidate for non-aqueous redox flow batteries, and two of its radical cation salts.
A microfluidic viscometer enabled the use of small sample volumes in determining viscosity as a
function of shear rate and concentration in the non-aqueous solvent, acetonitrile, both with and
without supporting salts. All solutions tested show Newtonian behavior over shear rates of up to
30,000 1/s, which is rationalized by scaling arguments for the diffusion-based relaxation time
of a single MEEPT molecule without aggregation. Neat MEEPT is flowable but with a large viscosity
(412 mPa s) at room temperature), which is approximately 1,000 times larger than acetonitrile.
When dissolved in acetonitrile, MEEPT solutions have low viscosities; at concentrations up to
0.5 M, the viscosity increases by less than a factor of two. From concentration-dependent viscosity
measurements, molecular information is inferred from intrinsic viscosity (hydrodynamic diameter)
and the Huggins coefficient (interactions). Model fit credibility is assessed using the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC). It is found that the MEEPT and its charged cation are "flowable" and
do not flocculate at concentrations up to 0.5 M. MEEPT has a hydrodynamic diameter of around 0.85
nm, which is largely insensitive to supporting salt and state of charge. This size is comparable
to molecular dimensions of single molecules obtained from optimized structures using density
function theory calculations. The results suggest that MEEPT is a promising candidate for redox
flow batteries in terms of its viscous flow properties.
