Motivated by a recent experiment [Revelle et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 235301 (2016)] that characterized
the one- to three-dimensional crossover in a spin-imbalanced ultracold gas of $^6$Li atoms trapped
in a two-dimensional array of tunnel-coupled tubes, we calculate the phase diagram for this system
using Hartree-Fock Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field theory, and compare the results with experimental
data. Mean-field theory predicts fully spin-polarized normal, partially spin-polarized normal,
spin-polarized superfluid, and spin-balanced superfluid phases in a homogeneous system. We use
the local density approximation to obtain density profiles of the gas in a harmonic trap. We compare
these calculations with experimental measurements in Revelle {\em et al.} as well as previously
unpublished data. Our calculations qualitatively agree with experimentally-measured densities
and coordinates of the phase boundaries in the trap, and quantitatively agree with experimental
measurements at moderate-to-large polarizations. Our calculations also reproduce the experimentally-observed
universal scaling of the phase boundaries for different scattering lengths at a fixed value of scaled
inter-tube tunneling. However, our calculations have quantitative differences with experimental
measurements at low polarization, and fail to capture important features of the one- to three-dimensional
crossover observed in experiments. These suggest the important role of physics beyond-mean-field
theory in the experiments. We expect that our numerical results will aid future experiments in narrowing
the search for the FFLO phase.
