The interlayer transmission rates of the side contacted parallel armchair nanotubes are calculated
by the perturbative calculations with the $\pi$ orbital tight binding model. One of the nanotubes
encapsulates dopants and touches another undoped nanotube. The effect of the dopants is represented
by $\varepsilon$ that is the difference between the two nanotubes in the site energy. In the isolated
armchair nanotube, the wave functions are either symmetric $(+)$ or anti-symmetric $(-)$ with
respect to the mirror plane. The Landauer's formula conductance is represented by $(2e^2/h)(T_{+,+}+T_{-,-}+T_{-,+}+T_{+,-})$
with the transmission rate $T_{\sigma',\sigma}$ from the left nanotube $\sigma$ state to the right
nanotube $\sigma'$ state. When the mirror planes of the two nanotubes do not coincide with each other,
the off-diagonal $T_{\mp,\pm}$ is non-zero. The off-diagonal $T_{\mp,\pm}$ and diagonal $T_{\pm,\pm}$
are proportional to the $(E-\frac{\varepsilon}{2})^{-2}\sin^2[C(E-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}
)]$ and $ \sin^2[C(E-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}) +\varphi ]$, respectively, where $C$ and $\varphi$
do not depend on the Fermi level $E$. Among the energy peaks of the former, that at $E=\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$
is much higher than the others. In other words, the former has a quasi-single peak at $E=\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$.
The heights of the periodic energy peaks of $T_{\pm,\pm}$ are reduced by increasing $|\varepsilon|$,
while that of the quasi-single peak of $T_{\mp,\pm}$ does not depend on $\varepsilon$. Thus the
quasi-single peak of $T_{+,-}+T_{-,+}$ is dominant over the periodic peaks of $T_{+,+}+T_{-,-}$
in the conductance when $|\varepsilon|$ is large enough.
