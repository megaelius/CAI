We explore various 4d Yang-Mills gauge theories (YM) living as boundary conditions of 5d gapped
short/long-range entangled (SRE/LRE) topological states. Specifically, we explore 4d time-reversal
symmetric pure YM of an SU(2) gauge group with a second-Chern-class topological term at $\theta=\pi$
(SU(2)$_{\theta=\pi}$ YM). Its higher 't Hooft anomalies of generalized global symmetries indicate
that the 4d SU(2)$_{\theta=\pi}$ YM, in order to realize all global symmetries locally, necessarily
couples to a 5d higher symmetry-protected topological state (SPTs, as an invertible TQFT, or as
a 5d 1-form-center-symmetry-protected interacting "topological superconductor" in condensed
matter). We revisit the 4d SU(2)$_{\theta=\pi}$ YM-5d SRE-higher-SPTs coupled systems in [arXiv:1812.11968]
and find their "Fantastic Four Siblings" with four sets of new higher anomalies associated with
the Kramers singlet/doublet and bosonic/fermionic properties of Wilson lines. Following Weyl's
gauge principle, by dynamically gauging the 1-form center symmetry, we transform a 5d bulk SRE SPTs
into an LRE symmetry-enriched topologically ordered state (SETs); thus we obtain the 4d SO(3)$_{\theta=\pi}$
YM-5d LRE-higher-SETs coupled system with dynamical higher-form gauge fields. Apply the tool
introduced in [arXiv:1612.09298], we derive new exotic anyonic statistics of extended objects
such as 2-worldsheet of strings and 3-worldvolume of branes, which physically characterize the
5d SETs. We discover new triple and quadruple link invariants potentially associated with the underlying
5d higher-gauge TQFTs, hinting a new intrinsic relation between non-supersymmetric 4d pure YM
and topological links in 5d. We provide lattice simplicial complex regularizations and "condensed
matter" realizations.
