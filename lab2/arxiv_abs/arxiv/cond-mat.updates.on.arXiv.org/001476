One of the central issues in the recent study of cuprate superconductors is the interplay of charge
order with superconductivity. Here the interplay of charge order with superconductivity in cuprate
superconductors is studied based on the kinetic-energy-driven superconducting (SC) mechanism
by taking into account the intertwining between the pseudogap and SC gap. It is shown that the appearance
of the Fermi pockets is closely associated with the emergence of the pseudogap. However, the distribution
of the spectral weight of the SC-state quasiparticle spectrum on the Fermi arc, or equivalently
the front side of the Fermi pocket, and back side of Fermi pocket is extremely anisotropic, where
the most part of the spectral weight is located around the tips of the Fermi arcs, which in this case
coincide with the hot spots on the electron Fermi surface (EFS). In particular, as charge order in
the normal-state, this EFS instability drives charge order in the SC-state, with the charge-order
wave vector that is well consistent with the wave vector connecting the hot spots on the straight
Fermi arcs. Furthermore, this charge-order state is doping dependent, with the charge-order wave
vector that decreases in magnitude with the increase of doping. Although there is a coexistence
of charge order and superconductivity, this charge order antagonizes superconductivity. The
results from the SC-state dynamical charge structure factor indicate the existence of a quantitative
connection between the low-energy electronic structure and collective response of the electron
density. The theory also shows that the pseudogap and charge order have a root in common, they and
superconductivity are a natural consequence of the strong electron correlation.
