The coupled cluster method (CCM) has previously been applied to study the ground- and excited-state
properties of many different types of frustrated and unfrustrated quantum spin systems. A common
feature in the application of the CCM is to rotate the local spin axes of the (often classical) model
state so that (notationally only) the spins all appear to point in the downwards $z$-direction.
Hitherto, we remark that only coplanar model states have been used because they do not lead to imaginary
terms in the new Hamiltonian. By contrast, non-coplanar "three-dimensional" (3D) model states
can lead to imaginary terms in the new Hamiltonian after rotation. In principle, however, macroscopic
quantities predicted by the CCM (such as the ground-state energy and order parameter) should still
be real (even though the Hamiltonian may be complex) because the transformations of local spin axes
are unitary. Here we explain how we may use such 3D model states for the CCM and how we may solve for the
(now possibly complex) CCM correlation coefficients. We present results for the spin-half triangular-lattice
antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field. We use both coplanar model states and a single 3D
non-coplanar model state. We calculate the ground-state energy and the lattice magnetisation
as a function of the magnetic field strength. We find that the energies of the coplanar states lie
lower than that of the non-coplanar state for all values of the external field, as seen in other approximate
studies for this model. We find that the non-coplanar state does not detect the well-known spin plateau
occurring in this model, although (as seen before) it is clearly observed for the coplanar model
states using the CCM. These results are an excellent initial validation of the new approach for the
application of the CCM using 3D model states.
