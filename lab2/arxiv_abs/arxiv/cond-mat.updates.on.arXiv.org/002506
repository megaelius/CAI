Understanding how particles are arranged on the sphere is not only central to numerous physical,
biological, and materials systems but also finds applications in mathematics and in analysis of
geophysical and meteorological measurements. In contrast to particle distributions in Euclidean
space, restriction that the particles should lie on the sphere brings about several important constraints.
These require a careful extension of quantities used for particle distributions in Euclidean space
to those confined to the sphere. We introduce a framework designed to analyze and classify structural
(dis)order in particle distributions constrained to the sphere. The classification is based on
the concept of hyperuniformity, which was introduced 15 years ago and since then studied extensively
in Euclidean space, yet has only very recently been considered for the sphere. We build our framework
on a generalization of the structure factor on the sphere, which we relate to the power spectrum of
the corresponding multipole expansion. The spherical structure factor is then shown to couple
with cap number variance, a measure of local density fluctuations, allowing us to derive different
forms of the variance. In this way, we construct a classification of hyperuniformity for scale-free
particle distributions on the sphere and show how it can be extended to other distributions as well.
We demonstrate that hyperuniformity on the sphere can be defined either through a vanishing spherical
structure factor at low multipole numbers or through a scaling of the cap number variance, in both
cases extending the Euclidean definition while pointing out crucial differences. Our work provides
a comprehensive tool for detecting long-range order on spheres and the analysis of spherical computational
meshes, biological and synthetic spherical assemblies, and ordering phase transitions in spherically-distributed
particles.
