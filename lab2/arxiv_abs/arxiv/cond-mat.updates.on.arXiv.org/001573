Ideal monolayers of common semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS$_2$,
WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$ possess many similar electronic properties. As it is the case for
all semiconductors, however, the physical response of these systems is strongly determined by
defects in a way specific to each individual compound. Here we investigate the ability of exfoliated
monolayers of these TMDCs to support high-quality, well-balanced ambipolar conduction, which
has been demonstrated for WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$, but not for MoS$_2$. Using ionic-liquid
gated transistors we show that, contrary to WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$, hole transport in exfoliated
MoS$_2$ monolayers is systematically anomalous, exhibiting a maximum in conductivity at negative
gate voltage (V$_G$) followed by a suppression of up to 100 times upon further increasing V$_G$.
To understand the origin of this difference we have performed a series of experiments including
the comparison of hole transport in MoS$_2$ monolayers and thicker multilayers, in exfoliated
and CVD-grown monolayers, as well as gate-dependent optical measurements (Raman and photoluminescence)
and scanning tunneling imaging and spectroscopy. In agreement with existing {\it ab-initio} calculations,
the results of all these experiments are consistently explained in terms of defects associated
to chalcogen vacancies that only in MoS$_2$ monolayers -- but not in thicker MoS$_2$ multilayers
nor in monolayers of the other common semiconducting TMDCs -- create in-gap states near the top of
the valence band that act as strong hole traps. Our results demonstrate the importance of studying
systematically how defects determine the properties of 2D semiconducting materials and of developing
methods to control them.
