We explore the influence of demagnetization interaction on magnetic memory effect by varying organization
geometry of anisotropic ZnFe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles in an ensemble. The static and dynamic behaviour
of two differently organized ensembles, compact ensemble (CE) and hollow core ensemble (HCE),
are extensively studied by both dc and ac susceptibility, magnetic memory effect and spin relaxation.
The frequency-dependence peak shifting of freezing temperature in both the systems is analyzed
properly with the help of two dynamic scaling models: Vogel-Fulcher law and power law. Presence
of cluster spin-glass phase is reflected from Vogel-Fulcher temperature $T_0$ $\simeq$ 142.58
K for CE, $\simeq$ 97 K for HCE and characteristic time constant $\tau_0$ $\simeq$ $8.85\times10^{-9}$
s for CE, $\simeq$ $3.8\times10^{-10}$ s for HCE; along with $\delta$T$_{Th}$ $\sim$ 0.1 for CE
and 0.2 for HCE. The power law fitting with dynamic exponent $zv'$ = 6.2 $\pm$ 1.1 for CE, 6.3 $\pm$
0.5 for HCE and single spin flip $\tau^*$ $\simeq$ $7.7\times10^{-11}$ s for CE, $\simeq$ $1.3\times10^{-10}$
s for HCE provide firm confirmation of cluster spin-glass phase. The progressive spin freezing
across multiple metastable states with prominent memory effects is reflected in both the systems
via nonequilibrium dynamics study. The hollow core geometry with anisotropic nanoparticles on
surface with closer proximity leads to complex anisotropy energy landscape with enhanced demagnetizing
field resulting highly frustrated surface spins. As a consequence, more prominent magnetic memory
effect is observed in HCE with higher activation energy, reduced blocking temperature and enhanced
coercivity than that of CE.
