In this perspective article, we present a multidisciplinary approach for characterizing protein
structure networks. We first place our approach in its historical context and describe the manner
in which it synthesizes concepts from quantum chemistry, biology of polymer conformations, matrix
mathematics, and percolation theory. We then explicitly provide the method for constructing the
protein structure network in terms of non-covalently interacting amino acid side chains and show
how a mine of information can be obtained from the graph spectra of these networks. Employing suitable
mathematical approaches, such as the use of a weighted, Laplacian matrix to generate the spectra,
enables us to develop rigorous methods for network comparison and to identify crucial nodes responsible
for the network integrity through a perturbation approach. Our scoring methods have several applications
in structural biology that are elusive to conventional methods of analyses. Here, we discuss the
instances of: (a) Protein structure comparison that include the details of side chain connectivity,
(b) The contribution to node clustering as a function of bound ligand, explaining the global effect
of local changes in phenomena such as allostery and (c) The identification of crucial amino acids
for structural integrity, derived purely from the spectra of the graph. We demonstrate how our method
enables us to obtain valuable information on key proteins involved in cellular functions and diseases
such as GPCR and HIV protease, and discuss the biological implications. We then briefly describe
how concepts from percolation theory further augment our analyses. In our concluding perspective
for future developments, we suggest a further unifying approach to protein structure analyses
and a judicious choice of questions to employ our methods for larger, more complex networks, such
as metabolic and disease networks.
