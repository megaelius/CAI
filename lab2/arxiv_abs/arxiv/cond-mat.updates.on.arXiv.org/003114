We perform systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess the performance
of various exchange-correlation potentials $V_{xc}$ in describing the chalcogenide GaM$_4$Q$_8$
lacunar spinels (M=Mo, V, Nb, Ta; Q=S, Se). We examine the dependency of crystal structure (in cubic
and rhombohedral symmetries), electronic structure, magnetism, optical conductivity, and lattice
dynamics in lacunar spinels at four different levels of $V_{xc}$: the local density approximation
(LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid with fractional Fock exchange.
We find that LDA significantly underperforms GGA and higher level functionals in predicting lattice
constants. LDA also fails to properly describe the magnetism in the family, and for some compositions
it does not find the ground state distorted crystal structure. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
and PBE revised for solids (PBEsol) GGA functionals perform reasonably well in predicting lattice
constants as well as the electronic structures. We find that the GGA with an on-site Coulomb interaction
(GGA$+U$) is unnecessary to produce a semiconducting state in the distorted polar $R3m$ phase.
Plus Hubbard $U$ values ranging from 1$\sim$2 eV, however, improve the quantitative performance
of the GGA functionals. The meta-GGA functional SCAN predicts reasonable lattice constants and
electronic structures; it exhibits behavior similar to the GGA$+U$ functionals for small $U$ values.
The hybrid functional HSE06 is accurate in predicting the lattice constants, but leads to a band
gap of $\approx$1 eV in the rhombohedral phase, which is higher than the experimental estimation
of 0.2 eV. Our findings suggest that accurate qualitative and quantitative simulations of the lacunar
spinel family with DFT requires careful attention to the nuances of the exchange-correlation functional
and considered spin structures.
