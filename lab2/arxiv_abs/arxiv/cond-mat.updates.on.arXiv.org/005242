We derive expressions for the leading-order far-field flows generated by mobile colloids trapped
at planar fluid-fluid interfaces. We consider both externally driven colloids and active colloids
(swimmers) either adjacent to or adhered to the interface. In the latter case, we assume a pinned
contact line. The Reynolds and capillary numbers are assumed much less than unity, in line with typical
micron-scale colloids involving air- or alkane-aqueous interfaces. At clean (surfactant-free)
interfaces, the hydrodynamic modes are essentially a restricted set of the usual Stokes multipoles
in a bulk fluid. To leading order, driven colloids simply exert Stokelets parallel to the interface,
while active colloids drive different kinds of fluid motion depending on their orientation with
respect to the interface. We then consider how these modes are altered by the presence of an incompressible
surfactant layer, which occurs at high Marangoni numbers. This limiting behavior is typical for
colloidal systems at small capillary numbers, even when scant surfactant is present. Compared
to a clean interface, incompressibility substantially constrains flow directed normal to the
interface. For both driven and active colloids, this flow arises only from asymmetry of the colloid
geometry or boundary motion with respect to the interfacial plane. The flow parallel to the interface
is also restructured dramatically. Moreover, surface-viscous stresses, if present, potentially
generate very long-ranged flow on the interface and the surrounding fluids. We examine the limiting
forms of such flows. Our results have important implications for colloid assembly and advective
mass transport enhancement near fluid boundaries.
