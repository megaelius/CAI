We derive a macroscopic theory of dynamical responses for semi-infinite materials (SIMs) without
invoking any type of boundary conditions including the widely used auxiliary boundary conditions.
The theory is universal with its basic structure independent of the particulars of electron dynamics
and can be generalized to other types of boundaries. General analytical expressions are obtained
of the charge density-density response function. It is shown that this function is naturally parsed
into two parts, one of which represents primarily a bulk property while the other a pure surface property.
We apply the theory to study the responses according to several common electron dynamics models
and provide a unified view of their limitations. The models studied include the local dielectric
model (DM), the dispersive hydrodynamic model (HDM) and specular reflection model (SRM), as well
as the less common semi-classical model (SCM). We show that, in terms of their basic equations, the
SRM is an extension of the HDM, just as the HDM is an extension of the DM. The SCM improves over the SRM
critically through the inclusion of translation symmetry breaking and surface roughness effects.
We further employ the response function to evaluate the dynamical structure factor, which plays
an important role in particle scattering. As expected, this factor reveals a peak due to the excitation
of surface plasma waves (SPWs). Surprisingly, however, the peak is shown to be considerably sharper
in the SCM than in other models, indicating an incipient instability of the system. We also study
the distribution of charges induced by a charged particle grazing over a SIM surface at constant
speed. This distribution is shown to contain model-specific features that are of immediate experimental
interest. Our work solves a long-standing fundamental problem in surface science and is expected
to find broad applications.
