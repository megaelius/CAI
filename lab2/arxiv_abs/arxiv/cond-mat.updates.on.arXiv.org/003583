A model is described, in which electrical breakdown in high-voltage systems is caused by stochastic
fluctuations of the mobile dislocation population in the cathode. In this model, the mobile dislocation
density normally fluctuates, with a finite probability to undergo a critical transition due to
the effects of the external field. It is suggested that once such a transition occurs, the mobile
dislocation density will increase deterministically, leading to electrical breakdown. Model
parametrization is achieved via microscopic analysis of OFHC Cu cathode samples from the CERN CLIC
project, allowing the creation and depletion rates of mobile dislocations to be estimated as a function
of the initial physical condition of the material and the applied electric field. We find analytical
expressions for the mean breakdown time and quasistationary probability distribution of the mobile
dislocation density, and verify these results by using a Gillespie algorithm. A least-squares
algorithm is used to fit these results with available experimental data of the dependence of the
breakdown rate on the applied strength of the electric field and on temperature. The effects of the
variation of some of the assumptions of the physical model are considered, and a number of additional
experiments to validate the model are proposed, which include examining the effects of the temperature
and pulse length, as well as of a time-dependent electric field, on the breakdown rate. Finally,
applications of the model are discussed, including the usage of the quasistatic probability distribution
to predict breakdowns, and applying the predictions of the model to improve the conditioning process
of the cathode material.
