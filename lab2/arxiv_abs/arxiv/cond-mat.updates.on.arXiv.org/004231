In recent years, machine learning (ML) for predicting material properties has emerged as a quicker
alternative to experimental and simulation-based investigations. Standard ML approaches tend
to utilize specific domain knowledge when designing feature inputs. Each ML property predictor
then requires a set of tailored structural features - this can commonly lead to drawbacks, due to
the small number of implemented features and their lack of prediction transferability across different
predictors. The latter has been empirically observed in the case of guest uptake predictors for
nanoporous materials, where local and global porosity features become dominant descriptors at
low and high pressures, respectively. Here, we provide a more holistic feature representation
for materials structures using tools from topological data analysis and persistent homology to
describe the geometry and topology of nanoporous materials at various scales. We demonstrate an
application of these topology-based feature representations to predict methane uptakes for zeolite
structures in the range of 1-200 bar. These predictions show a root-mean-square deviation decrease
of up to 50% at low pressures and up to 100% across high pressures in comparison to a model based on commonly
used local and global features. Similarly, the topology-based model shows an increase of 0.2-0.3
in R2 score in comparison to the commonly used porosity descriptors. Notably, unlike the standard
porosity features, the topology-based features show accuracy across multiple different pressures.
Furthermore, we show feature importance in terms of different topological features, thus elucidating
information about the channel and pore sizes that correlate best to adsorption properties. Finally,
we demonstrate that ML models relying on a combination of topological and commonly employed descriptors
provide even better guest uptake regressors.
