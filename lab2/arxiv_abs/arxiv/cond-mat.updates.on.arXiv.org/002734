The possible realization of Majorana fermions as quasiparticle excitations in condensed matter
physics has created much excitement. Most recent studies have focused on Majorana bound states
which can serve as topological qubits. More generally, akin to elementary particles, Majorana
fermions can propagate and display linear dispersion. These excitations have not yet been directly
observed, and can also be used for quantum information processing. One route to realizing this is
in a line junction between two phase-shifted superconductors coupled to topological surface states.
Recent theory indicates that in iron-based superconductors, a particular type of crystalline
defect, i.e., a domain wall (DW) between two regions with a half-unit cell shift between them, should
create a $\pi$-phase shift in the superconducting order parameter. Combined with recent data showing
topological surface states in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ we find that this is the ideal system to realize
helical 1D-dispersing Majorana modes. Here we report scanning tunneling spectroscopic (STS)
measurements of crystalline DWs in FeSe$_{0.45}$Te$_{0.55}$. By analyzing large-area superconducting
gap maps, we identify the gap in the topological surface state, demonstrating that our sample is
an effective Fu-Kane proximitized topological system. We further locate DWs across which the atoms
shift by half a unit cell. STS data on these DWs reveal a flat density of states inside the superconducting
gap, a hallmark of linearly dispersing modes in 1D. This unique signature is absent in DWs in the related
superconductor, FeSe which is not in the topological phase. Our combined data provide strong evidence
for the observation of dispersing Majorana states at a $\pi$-phase shift DW in a proximitized topological
material.
