We introduce and investigate a coarse-grained model for quasi one-dimensional ferrogels. In our
description the magnetic particles are represented by hard spheres with a magnetic dipole moment
in their centers. Harmonic springs connecting these spheres mimic the presence of a cross-linked
polymer matrix. A special emphasis is put on the coupling of the dipolar orientations to the elastic
deformations of the matrix, where a memory effect of the orientations is included. Although the
particles are displaced along one spatial direction only, the system already shows rich behavior:
as a function of the magnetic dipole moment, we find a phase transition between "soft-elastic" states
with finite interparticle separation and finite compressive elastic modulus on the one hand, and
"hardened" states with touching particles and therefore diverging compressive elastic modulus
on the other hand. Corresponding phase diagrams are derived neglecting thermal fluctuations of
the magnetic particles. In addition, we consider a situation in which a spatially homogeneous magnetization
is initially imprinted into the material. Depending on the strength of the magneto-mechanical
coupling between the dipole orientations and the elastic deformations, the system then relaxes
to a uniaxially ferromagnetic, an antiferromagnetic, or a spiral state of magnetization to minimize
its energy. One purpose of our work is to provide a largely analytically solvable approach that can
provide a benchmark to test future descriptions of higher complexity. From an applied point of view,
our results could be exploited, for example, for the construction of novel damping devices of tunable
shock absorbance.
