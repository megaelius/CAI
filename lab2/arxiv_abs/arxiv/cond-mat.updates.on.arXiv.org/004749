Resting on multi-scale modelling simulations, we explore dynamical aspects characterizing skyrmions
driven by spin-transfer-torque towards repulsive and pinning 3d and 4d single atomic defects embedded
in a Pd layer deposited on the Fe/Ir(111) surface. The latter is known to host sub-10 nm skyrmions
which are of great interest in information technology. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation
is parametrized with magnetic exchange interactions extracted from first-principles. Depending
on the nature of the defect and the magnitude of the applied magnetic field, the skyrmion deforms
by either shrinking or increasing in size, experiencing thereby elliptical distortions. After
applying a magnetic field of 10 Tesla, ultrasmall skyrmions are driven along a straight line towards
the various defects which permits a simple analysis of the impact of the impurities. Independently
from the nature of the skyrmion-defect complex interaction a gyrotropic motion is observed. A repulsive
force leads to a skyrmion trajectory similar to the one induced by an attractive one. We unveil that
the circular motion is clockwise around pinning impurities but counter clockwise around the repulsive
ones, which can be used to identify the interaction nature of the defects by observing the skyrmions
trajectories. Moreover, and as expected, the skyrmion always escapes the repulsive defects in
contrast to the pinning defects, which require a minimal depinning current to observe impurity
avoidance. This unveils the richness of the motion regimes of skyrmions. We discuss the results
of the simulations in terms of the Thiele equation, which provides a reasonable qualitative description
of the observed phenomena. Finally, we show an example of a double track made of pinning impurities,
where the engineering of their mutual distance allows to control the skyrmion motion with enhanced
velocity.
