Hole concentration in the CuO2 plane largely controls all the properties in the normal and superconducting
states of high-Tc cuprates. The critical current density, Jc, is no exception. Previous hole content
dependent studies have demonstrated that the role of intrinsic depairing current density in determining
the observed critical current density in copper oxide superconductors. It is also widely agreed
upon that the temperature and magnetic field dependent vortex pinning energy plays a major role
the Jc of a system.This pinning energy depends directly on the superconducting condensation energy.
Superconducting condensation energy, on the other hand, is proportional to the Cooper pair density
(superpair density), which is found to be highly dependent on the hole concentration, p, within
the CuO2 plane. We have calculated the Cooper pair density, rho_s, of YBCO (Y123), a typical hole
doped cuprate, as a function of p, in this study. A triangular pseudogap (PG), pinned at the Fermi
level, in the quasiparticle spectral density has been considered. The low-temperature critical
current density of a number of Y(Ca)BCO superconductors over wide range of compositions and hole
concentrations have been explored. The normalized values of the superpair density and the critical
current density exhibit a clear correspondence as the in-plane hole content is varied. This systematic
behavior provides us with strong evidence that the critical current density of hole doped cuprates
is primarily dependent on the superpair density, which in turn depends on the magnitude of the PG
energy.The agreement between the estimated p-dependent superpair density and the previously
experimentally determined superfluid density of Y(Ca)BCO is quite remarkable.
