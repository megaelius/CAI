We consider a 3D homogeneous superfluid at low temperature $T$ with 2 types of excitations, gapless
phonons with a linear dispersion relation at low wavenumber, and gapped quasiparticles with a quadratic
dispersion relation around extrema. We calculate the scattering amplitude of a phonon on a quasiparticle
to leading order in $T$ for all subsonic quasiparticle velocities, with a $S$-matrix formalism
between exact asymptotic states dressed by virtual phonons. We then characterize the erratic motion
of the quasiparticle in the superfluid due to its unceasing collisions with thermal phonons through
mean force $F(k)$, longitudinal and transverse $k$-dependent momentum diffusion coefficients,
and spatial diffusion coefficient. At the minimum location $k_0$ of the dispersion relation, where
the velocity vanishes, $F(k)$ varies linearly with velocity with an isotropic friction coefficient;
if $k_0=0$, the momentum diffusion is also isotropic and $F(k_0)=0$; if $k_0>0$, it is not, and $F(k_0)$
is nonzero but subleading with respect to friction by one order in $T$. The velocity time correlation
function, whose integral is the spatial diffusion coefficient, decays with the mean velocity damping
rate if $k_0=0$; if $k_0>0$, it has a second exponential component, with an amplitude and a damping
rate lower by a factor $\propto T$ (it is the velocity direction thermalization rate). We also characterize
force and momentum diffusion close to the stability domain sonic edge. Our general expressions
are expected to be exact to leading order in $T$. We illustrate them in the BCS approximation, for
a fermionic quasiparticle (an unpaired fermion) in a superfluid of spin 1/2 fermions, realisable
with cold atoms in flat bottom traps. We also refute the statement of Lerch, Bartosch and Kopietz
(2008), that there would be no fermionic quasiparticle in such a superfluid.
