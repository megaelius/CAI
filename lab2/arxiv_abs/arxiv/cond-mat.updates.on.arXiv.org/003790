Even though the Hubbard model is one of the most fundamental models of highly correlated electrons,
analytical and numerical data describing its thermodynamics at nonzero magnetization are relatively
scarce. We present a detailed investigation of the thermodynamic properties for the one dimensional
repulsive Hubbard model in the presence of an arbitrary magnetic field for all values of the filling
fraction and temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.005\, t.$ Our analysis is based on the system of integral
equations derived in the quantum transfer matrix framework. We determine the critical exponents
of the quantum phase transitions and also provide analytical derivations for some of the universal
functions characterizing the thermodynamics in the vicinities of the quantum critical points.
Extensive numerical data for the specific heat, susceptibility, compressibility, and entropy
are reported. The experimentally relevant double occupancy presents an interesting doubly nonmonotonic
temperature dependence at intermediate values of the interaction strength and also at large repulsion
and magnetic fields close to the critical value. The susceptibility in zero magnetic field has a
logarithmic singularity at low temperatures for all filling factors similar to the behavior of
the same quantity in the XXX spin chain. We determine the density profiles for a harmonically trapped
system and show that while the total density profile seems to depend mainly on the value of chemical
potential at the center of the trap the distribution of phases in the inhomogeneous system changes
dramatically as we increase the magnetic field.
