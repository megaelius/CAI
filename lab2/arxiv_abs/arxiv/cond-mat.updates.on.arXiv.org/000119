We study theoretically the Raman spectrum of the rotated double-layer graphene, consisting of
two graphene layers rotated with respect to each other by an arbitrary angle \theta. We find a relatively
simple dependence of the Raman G peak intensity on the angle \theta. On the other hand, the Raman 2D
peak position, intensity, and width show a much more complicated dependence on the angle \theta.
We account for all of these effects, including dependence on the incoming photon energy, in good
agreement with the experimental data. We find that it is sufficient to include the interaction between
the graphene layers on the electronic degrees of freedom (resulting in the occurrence of van Hove
singularities in the density of states). We assume that the phonon degrees of freedom are unaffected
by the interaction between the layers. Furthermore, we decompose the Raman 2D peak into two components
having very different linewidths; these widths are almost independent of the angle \theta. The
change in the intensity and the peak position of one of these two components gives insight into the
dependence of the overall Raman 2D peak features as a function of the angle \theta. Additionally,
we show regions in the phonon spectrum giving rise to the Raman 2D peak signal. This work provides
an insight into the interplay between the mechanical degree of freedom (angle \theta) and the electronic
degrees of freedom (singularities in the density of states) in rotated double-layer graphene.
Additionally, this work provides a way to establish experimentally the value of the rotation angle
\theta using Raman spectroscopy measurement. This procedure becomes even more robust if one repeats
the Raman spectroscopy measurement with a different incoming photon energy.
