We introduce two- and one-dimensional (2D and 1D) systems of two linearly-coupled Gross-Pitaevskii
equations (GPEs) with the cubic self-attraction and harmonic-oscillator (HO) trapping potential
in each GPE. The system models a Bose-Einstein condensate with a negative scattering length, loaded
in a double-pancake trap, combined with the in-plane HO potential. In addition to that, the 1D version
applies to the light transmission in a dual-core waveguide with the Kerr nonlinearity and in-core
confinement represented by the HO potential. The subject of the analysis is spontaneous symmetry
breaking in 2D and 1D ground-state (GS, alias fundamental) modes, as well as in 2D vortices and 1D
dipole modes (the latter ones do not exist without the HO potential). By means of the variational
approximation and numerical analysis, it is found that both the 2D and 1D systems give rise to a symmetry-breaking
bifurcation (SBB) of the supercrtical type. Stability of symmetric states and asymmetric ones,
produced by the SBB, is analyzed through the computation of eigenvalues for perturbation modes,
and verified by direct simulations. The asymmetric GSs are always stable, while the stability region
for vortices shrinks and eventually disappears with the increase of the linear-coupling constant,
$ \kappa $. The SBB in the 2D system does not occur if $\kappa $ is too large (at $\kappa >\kappa_{\max
}$); in that case, the two-component system behaves, essentially, as its single-component counterpart.
In the 1D system, both asymmetric and symmetric dipole modes feature an additional oscillatory
instability, unrelated to the symmetry breaking. This instability occurs in several regions,
which expand with the increase of $\kappa $.
