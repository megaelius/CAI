First-principles calculations in crystalline structures are often performed with a planewave
basis set. To make the number of basis functions tractable two approximations are usually introduced:
core electrons are frozen and the diverging Coulomb potential near the nucleus is replaced by a smoother
expression. The norm-conserving pseudopotential was the first successful method to apply these
approximations in a fully ab initio way. Later on, more efficient and more exact approaches were
developed based on the ultrasoft and the projector augmented wave formalisms. These formalisms
are however more complex and developing new features in these frameworks is usually more difficult
than in the norm-conserving framework. Most of the existing tables of norm- conserving pseudopotentials,
generated long ago, do not include the latest developments, are not systematically tested or are
not designed primarily for high accuracy. In this paper, we present our PseudoDojo framework for
developing and testing full tables of pseudopotentials, and demonstrate it with a new table generated
with the ONCVPSP approach. The PseudoDojo is an open source project, building on the AbiPy package,
for developing and systematically testing pseudopotentials. At present it contains 7 different
batteries of tests executed with ABINIT, which are performed as a function of the energy cutoff.
The results of these tests are then used to provide hints for the energy cutoff for actual production
calculations. Our final set contains 139 pseudopotentials split into a standard and a stringent
accuracy table. In total around 70.000 calculations were performed to test the pseudopotentials.
The process of developing the final table led to new insights into the effects of both the core-valence
partitioning and the non-linear core corrections on the stability, convergence, and transferability
of norm-conserving pseudopotentials. ...
