We consider lattice Hamiltonians that arise from putting Haldane pseudo-potentials into a second
quantized or "guiding-center-only" form. These are fascinating examples for frustration free
lattice Hamiltonians. This is so since even though their highest density zero energy ground states,
the Laughlin states, are known to have matrix-product structure (with unbounded bond dimension),
the frustration free character of these lattice Hamiltonians seems obscure, {\em unless} one goes
back to the original first quantized picture of analytic lowest Landau level wave functions. This
step involves putting back additional degrees of freedom associated with dynamical momenta, and
one wonders whether the addition of these degrees of freedom is truly necessary to recognize the
frustration free character of the underlying lattice Hamiltonian. Fundamentally, these degrees
of freedom have nothing to do with spectrum of a "guiding-center-only" Hamiltonian. Moreover,
such constructions are unfamiliar and not available in the study of simpler (finite range) frustration
free lattice Hamiltonians with matrix product ground states (of finite bond dimension). That the
zero mode properties of "lattice versions" of pseudo-potentials can be understood from a polynomial-free,
intrinsically lattice point of view is also suggested by the fact that these pseudo-potentials
are constructed from an algebra of reasonably simply looking operators. Here we show that zero mode
properties, and hence the frustration free character, of these lattice Hamitlonians can be understood
as a consequence of algebraic structures that these operators are part of. We believe that our results
will deepen insights into parent Hamiltonians of matrix product states with infinite bond dimensions,
as could be of use, especially, in the study of fractional Chern insulators.
