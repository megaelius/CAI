Strong-coupling between light and matter produces hybridized states (polaritons) whose delocalization
and electromagnetic character allow for novel modifications in spectroscopy and chemical reactivity
of molecular systems. Recent experiments have demonstrated remarkable distance-independent
long-range energy transfer between molecules strongly coupled to optical microcavity modes.
To shed light on the mechanism of this phenomenon, we present the first comprehensive theory of polariton
energy transfer based on strong-coupling of donor and/or acceptor chromophores to surface plasmons.
Application of our theory demonstrates that long-range energy transfer up to a micron is indeed
possible via strong-coupling. In particular, we report two regimes for polariton energy transfer:
in one case, strong-coupling to a single type of chromophore leads to transfer mediated largely
by plasmons while in the other case, strong-coupling to both types of chromophores creates energy
transfer pathways mediated by vibrational relaxation. Importantly, we highlight conditions
under which coherence enhances or deteriorates these processes. For instance, while strong-coupling
to donors only can enhance transfer to acceptors, the reverse turns out not to be true. However, strong-coupling
to acceptors can shift energy levels in a way that transfer to donors can occur, thus yielding a chromophore
role-reversal or "carnival effect." This theoretical study demonstrates the potential for polaritons
to control and mediate long-range energy transfer, thus opening doors to the design of remote mesoscale
interactions between molecular systems.
