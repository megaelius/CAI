We show how the formalism used for thermoelectric transport may be adapted to Smoluchowski's seminal
thought experiment also known as Feynman's ratchet and pawl system. Our analysis rests on the notion
of useful flux, which for a thermoelectric system is the electrical current and for Feynman's ratchet
is the effective jump frequency. Our approach yields original insight into the derivation and analysis
of the system's properties. In particular we define an entropy per tooth in analogy with the entropy
per carrier or Seebeck coefficient, and we derive the analogue to Kelvin's second relation for Feynman's
ratchet. Owing to the formal similarity between the heat fluxes balance equations for a thermoelectric
generator (TEG) and those for Feynman's ratchet, we introduce a distribution parameter that quantifies
the amount of heat that flows through the cold and hot sides of both heat engines. While it is well established
that $\gamma$ = 1/2 for a TEG, it is equal to 1 for Feynman's ratchet. This implies that no heat may be
rejected in the cold reservoir for the latter case. Further, the analysis of the efficiency at maximum
power shows that the so-called Feynman efficiency corresponds to that of an exoreversible engine,
with $\gamma$ = 1. Then, turning to the nonlinear regime, we generalize the approach based on the
convection picture and introduce two different types of resistance to distinguish the dynamical
behavior of the considered system from its ability to dissipate energy. We finally put forth the
strong similarity between the original Feynman ratchet and a mesoscopic thermoelectric generator
with a single conducting channel.
