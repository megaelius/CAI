Electrical and thermal transport properties of disordered materials have long been of both theoretical
interest and engineering importance. As a new class of materials with an intrinsic compositional
disorder, high/medium-entropy alloys (HEAs/MEAs) are being immensely studied mainly for their
excellent mechanical properties. By contrast, electrical and thermal transport properties of
HEAs/MEAs are less well studied. Here we investigate these two properties of silicon (Si)-germanium
(Ge)-tin (Sn) MEAs, where we keep the same content of Si and Ge while increasing the content of Sn from
0 to 1/3 to tune the configurational entropy and thus the degree of compositional disorder. We predict
all SiyGeySnx MEAs to be semiconductors with a wide range of bandgaps from near-infrared (0.28 eV)
to visible (1.11 eV) in the light spectrum. We find that the bandgaps and effective carrier masses
decrease with increasing Sn content. As a result, increasing the compositional disorder in SiyGeySnx
MEAs enhances their electrical conductivity. For the thermal transport properties of SiyGeySnx
MEAs, our molecular dynamics simulations show an opposite trend in the thermal conductivity of
these MEAs at room temperature, which decreases with increasing compositional disorder, owing
to enhanced Anderson localization and strong phonon-phonon anharmonic interactions. The enhanced
electrical conductivity and weakened thermal conductivity make SiyGeySnx MEAs with high Sn content
promising functional materials for thermoelectric applications. Our work demonstrates that
HEAs/MEAs not only represent a new class of structural alloys but also a novel category of functional
alloys with unique electrical and thermal transport properties.
