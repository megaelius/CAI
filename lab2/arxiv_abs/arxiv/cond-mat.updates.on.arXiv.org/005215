We study the following simple model where the Aharonov-Bohm effect manifests itself. Consider
a graphene tube in the shape of a right circular open-ended cylinder. A magnetic field everywhere
vanishing on the tube surface (or at least tangent to it) is adiabatically switched on, causing the
eigenvalues of the tight-binding Hamiltonian to move in the process. If the magnetic flux through
the tube in the final configuration has an integer number of flux quanta, then the electron energy
spectrum returns to the original position. Moreover, the spectral flow of the Hamiltonian, defined
as the net number of eigenvalues (counted with multiplicities) which pass through zero in the positive
direction, proves to be zero. A more detailed analysis reveals that the eigenfunctions corresponding
to these eigenvalues can be chosen to be localized near the Dirac points K and K' in the momentum space,
and if one separately counts the spectral flow for the eigenfunctions localized near K and near K',
then one obtains two ``partial'' spectral flows, which have opposite signs and the same modulus
(equal to the number of magnetic flux quanta through the tube). The physical interpretation is that
switching on the magnetic field creates electron-hole pairs (or, more precisely, pairs of ``electron''
and ``hole'' energy levels) in graphene, the number of pairs being determined by the magnetic flux.
If an electron level is created near K, then the corresponding hole level is created near K', and vice
versa. Further, the number of electron/hole levels created near K equals the spectral flow of the
family of Dirac operators approximating the tight-binding Hamiltonian near K (and the same is true
with K replaced by K'). We assign a precise meaning to the notion of partial spectral flow in such a
way that all the preceding assertions make rigorous sense (and are true).
