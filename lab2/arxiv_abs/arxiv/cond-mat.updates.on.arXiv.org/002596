Metal mono-chalcogenide compounds offer a large variety of electronic properties depending on
chemical composition, number of layers and stacking-order. Among them, the InSe has attracted
much attention due to the promise of outstanding electronic properties, attractive quantum physics,
and high photo-response. Metal mono-chalcogenide compounds offer a large variety of electronic
properties depending on chemical composition, number of layers and stacking-order. Among them,
the InSe has attracted much attention due to the promise of outstanding electronic properties,
attractive quantum physics, and high photo-response. Precise experimental determination of
the electronic structure of InSe is sorely needed for better understanding of potential properties
and device applications. Here, combining scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and two-photon
photoemission spectroscopy (2PPE), we demonstrate that InSe exhibits a direct band gap of about
1.25 eV located at the Gamma point of the Brillouin zone (BZ). STS measurements underline the presence
of a finite and almost constant density of states (DOS) near the conduction band minimum (CBM) and
a very sharp one near the maximum of the valence band (VMB). This particular DOS is generated by a poorly
dispersive nature of the top valence band, as shown by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) investigation. technologies. In fact, a hole effective mass of about m/m0 = -0.95 gammaK

bands of about 0.35 eV was evidenced. These findings allow a deeper understanding of the InSe electronic
properties underlying the potential of III-VI semiconductors for electronic and photonic
