In different materials, orientationally controlled assembling of building blocks results in
the development of nanoparticles and particles of different anisotropic shapes. These trends
are pronounced in atoms of metallic behavior under their re-crystallization state. For development
of their nanoparticles and particles, monolayer assembly of atoms is formed at first place. At air-solution
interface, when triangle-shaped packets of nano energy were supplied to compact monolayer assembly
of atoms, they bound in their size and shape. Blocks of joined triangle-shaped tiny particles developed
when tuned bipolar pulses were examined. A joined block of tiny particles separated into two while
bearing a bit disturbed forced exertion to electrons of atoms making their contact point. On electronically
flat solution surface, atoms of tiny particles, when in re-crystallization state, elongate to
both sides from their centers at equal rate. Electrons of left and right sides deal with exertion
of surface force exerting along opposite poles. Thus, bound atoms of arrays forming a tiny-shaped
particle now converted into structures of smooth elements. Such structures of smooth elements
flatten further by the forced energy of traveled photons along the interface. Originally, binding
of solid atoms, when in neutral state, is to be anticipated under the execution of confined inter-state
electron dynamics, where they possess ground point below the typical level of ground surface. Nevertheless,
such developed tiny particles when arriving from suitable zones of solution surface, they pack
at common point to develop a nanoparticle or particle of anisotropic shape, where their assembling
structures of smooth elements deal with forced exertion. On electronically controlled decreasing
solution surface, a forced exertion to electrons of elongated atoms is in the immersing format.
