Universality classes of non-unitary critical theories in two-dimensions are characterized by
a dimensional number, termed central charge or conformal anomaly. Conformal invariance predicts
that the leading finite-size correction to the free energy of a two-dimensional system at a conformal
invariant critical point is linearly related to the central charge of the corresponding conformal
field theory. However, experimental determination of the central charge of a non-unitary conformal
invariant critical theory has not been done before because of the intrinsic difficulty that complex
parameters occurs in non-unitary theory, which is not physical. Here we propose to extract the central
charge of the non-unitary conformal invariant critical point of a two-dimensional lattice models
from the quantum coherence measurement of a probe spin which is coupled to the two-dimensional lattice
models. A recent discovery shows that quantum decoherence of a probe spin which is coupled to a bath
is proportional to the partition function of the bath with a complex parameter. Thus the central
charge of a non-unitary conformal field theory could be extracted from quantum decoherence measurement
of a probe spin which is coupled to a bath. We have applied the method to a typical non-unitary conformal
invariant critical theory, namely the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the two-dimensional Ising
model and extracted the central charge of the Yang-Lee edge singularity in two-dimensional Ising
model with good precision and tested other predictions of non-unitary conformal field theory.
This work paves the way for the first experimental observation of the central charge of non-unitary
conformal field theory.
