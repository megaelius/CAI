The true random number generators (TRNGs) have received extensive attention because of their wide
applications in information transmission and encryption. The true random numbers generated by
TRNG are typically applied to the encryption algorithm or security protocol of the information
security core. Recently, TRNGs have also been employed in emerging stochastic computing paradigm
for reducing power consumption. Roughly speaking, TRNG can be divided into circuits-based, e.g.,
oscillator sampling or directly noise amplifying; and quantum physics-based, e.g., photoelectric
effect. The former generally requires a large area and has a large power consumption, whereas the
latter is intrinsic random but is more difficult to implement and usually requires additional post-processing
circuitry. Very recently, magnetic skyrmion has become a promising candidate for implementing
TRNG because of their nanometer size, high stability, and intrinsic thermal Brownian motion dynamics.
In this work, we propose a TRNG based on continuous skyrmion thermal Brownian motion in a confined
geometry at room temperature. True random bitstream can be easily obtained by periodically detecting
the relative position of the skyrmion without the need for additional current pulses. More importantly,
we implement a probability-adjustable TRNG, in which a desired ratio of 0 and 1 can be acquired by
adding an anisotropy gradient through voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect.
The behaviors of the skyrmion-based TRNG are verified by using micromagnetic simulations. The
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test results demonstrate that our proposed
random number generator is TRNG with good randomness. Our research provides a new perspective for
efficient TRNG realization.
