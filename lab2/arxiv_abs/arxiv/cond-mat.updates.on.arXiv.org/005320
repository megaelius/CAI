Beyond the snow line of protoplanetary discs and inside the dense core of molecular clouds, the temperature
of gas is low enough for water vapour to condense into amorphous ices on the surface of preexisting
refractory dust particles. Recent numerical simulations and laboratory experiments suggest
that condensation of the vapour promotes dust coagulation in such a cold region. However, in the
numerical simulations, cohesion of refractory materials is often underestimated, while in the
laboratory experiments, water vapour collides with surfaces at more frequent intervals compared
to the real conditions. Therefore, to re-examine the role of water ice in dust coagulation, we carry
out systematic investigation of available data on coagulation of water ice particles by making
full use of appropriate theories in contact mechanics and tribology. We find that the majority of
experimental data are reasonably well explained by lubrication theories, owing to the presence
of a quasi-liquid layer (QLL). Only exceptions are the results of dynamic collisions between particles
at low temperatures, which are, instead, consistent with the JKR theory, because QLLs are too thin
to dissipate their kinetic energies. By considering the vacuum conditions in protoplanetary discs
and molecular clouds, the formation of amorphous water ice on the surface of refractory particles
does not necessarily aid their collisional growth as currently expected. While crystallisation
of water ice around but outside the snow line eases coagulation of ice-coated particles, sublimation
of water ice inside the snow line is deemed to facilitate coagulation of bare refractory particles.
