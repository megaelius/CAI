We develop a stochastic scattering theory that quantifies multi-exciton excitation-induced
dephasing effects on time-resolved nonlinear coherent optical lineshapes. Our model captures
effects of time-dependent exciton-exciton $s$-wave scattering and dynamic Coulomb screening,
which we describe within a mean-field limit. The model reveals a number of features within a two-dimensional
non-linear coherent lineshape that can be attributed to many-body dynamics occurring in the background
of the exciton, including dynamic line narrowing, mixing of real and imaginary spectral components,
and multi-quantum states. We test the model by means of multidimensional coherent spectroscopy
on a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor that hosts tightly bound excitons and biexcitons
with strong polaronic character. We find that the exciton nonlinear coherent lineshape reflects
the effects of many-body correlations. Furthermore, we observe that the exciton lineshape evolves
with population time over time windows in which the population itself is static, in a manner that
indicates time-dependent excitation-induced dephasing. Specifically, the dephasing dynamics
slow down with time, at a rate that is governed by the strength of exciton many-body interactions
and on the dynamic Coulomb screening potential. The real part of the coherent optical lineshape
displays strong dispersive character at zero time, which dissipates on the timescale of excitation-induced
dephasing, while the imaginary part displays converse behavior. Our theoretical approach is sufficiently
flexible to allow for a wide exploration of how system-bath dynamics contribute to non-linear spectral
behavior.
