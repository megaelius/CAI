Soft colloids are increasingly used as model systems to address fundamental issues such as crystallisation
and the glass and jamming transitions. Among the available classes of soft colloids, microgels
are emerging as the gold standard. Since their great internal complexity makes their theoretical
characterization very hard, microgels are commonly modelled, at least in the small-deformation
regime, within the simple framework of linear elasticity theory. Here we show that there exist conditions
where its range of validity can be greatly extended, providing strong numerical evidence that microgels
adsorbed at an interface follow the two-dimensional Hertzian theory, and hence behave like 2D elastic
particles, up to very large deformations, in stark contrast to what found in bulk conditions. We
are also able to estimate the Young's modulus of the individual particles and, by comparing it with
its counterpart in bulk conditions, we demonstrate a significant stiffening of the polymer network
at the interface. Finally, by analyzing dynamical properties, we predict multiple reentrant phenomena:
by a continuous increase of particle density, microgels first arrest and then re-fluidify due to
the high penetrability of their extended coronas. We observe this anomalous behavior in a range
of experimentally accessible conditions for small and loosely crosslinked microgels. The present
work thus establishes microgels at interfaces as a new model system for fundamental investigations,
paving the way for the experimental synthesis and research on unique high-density liquidlike states.
In addition, these results can guide the development of novel assembly and patterning strategies
on surfaces and the design of novel materials with desired interfacial behavior.
