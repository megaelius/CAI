A nuclear-spin exchange interaction exits between two ultracold fermionic alkali-earth (like)
atoms in the electronic $^{1}{\rm S}_{0}$ state ($g$-state) and $^{3}{\rm P}_{0}$ state ($e$-state),
and is an essential ingredient for the quantum simulation of Kondo effect. We study the control of
this spin exchange interaction for two atoms simultaneously confined in a quasi-one-dimensional
(quasi-1D) tube, where the $g$-atom is freely moving in the axial direction while the $e$-atom is
further localized by an additional axial trap and behaves as a quasi zero-dimensional (quasi-0D)
impurity. In this system the two atoms experience an effective-1D spin-exchange interaction whose
intensity can be controlled by the characteristic lengths of the confinements via the confinement-induced-resonances
(CIRs). In current work we go beyond that pure-1D approximation. We model the transverse and axial
confinements by harmonic traps with finite characteristic lengths $a_\perp$ and $a_z$, respectively,
and exactly solve the "quasi-1D + quasi-0D" scattering problem between these two atoms. Using the
solutions we derive the effective 1D spin-exchange interaction and investigate the locations
and widths of the CIRs for our system. It is found that when the ratio $a_z/a_\perp$ is larger, the
CIRs can be induced by weaker confinements, which are easier to be realized experimentally. We also
show that our results are quantitatively consistent with the recent experiments by L. Riegger et.al.
(Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf 120}$, 143601 (2018)), and predict a new CIR which is broader than the ones
already being observed and may be realized in the current experimental system. Furthermore, our
results are advantageous for the control of either the spin-exchange interaction or other type
of interactions between ultracold atoms in quasi 1+0 dimensional systems.
