In this paper, we classify EF topological orders for 3+1D bosonic systems where some emergent pointlike
excitations are fermions. (1) We argue that all 3+1D bosonic topological orders have gappable boundary.
(2) All the pointlike excitations in EF topological orders are described by the representations
of $G_f=Z_2^f\leftthreetimes_{e_2} G_b$ -- a $Z_2^f$ central extension of a finite group $G_b$
characterized by $e_2\in H^2(G_b,Z_2)$. (3) We find that the EF topological orders are classified
by 2+1D anomalous topological orders $\mathcal{A}_b^3$ on their unique canonical boundary. Here
$\mathcal{A}_b^3$ is a unitary fusion 2-category with simple objects labeled by $\hat G_b=Z_2^m\leftthreetimes
G_b$. $\mathcal{A}_b^3$ also has one invertible fermionic 1-morphism for each object as well as
quantum-dimension-$\sqrt 2$ 1-morphisms that connect two objects $g$ and $gm$, where $g\in \hat
G_b$ and $m$ is the generator of $Z_2^m$. (4) When $\hat G_b$ is the trivial $Z_2^m$ extension, the
EF topological orders are called EF1 topological orders, which is classified by simple data $(G_b,e_2,n_3,\nu_4)$.
(5) When $\hat G_b$ is a non-trivial $Z_2^m$ extension, the EF topological orders are called EF2
topological orders, where some intersections of three stringlike excitations must carry Majorana
zero modes. (6) Every EF2 topological order with $G_f=Z_2^f\leftthreetimes G_b$ can be associated
with a EF1 topological order with $G_f=Z_2^f\leftthreetimes \hat G_b$. (7) We find that all EF topological
orders correspond to gauged 3+1D fermionic symmetry protected topological (SPT) orders with a
finite unitary symmetry group. (8) We further propose that the general classification of 3+1D topological
orders with finite unitary symmetries for bosonic and fermionic systems can be obtained by gauging
or partially gauging the finite symmetry group of 3+1D SPT phases of bosonic and fermionic systems.
