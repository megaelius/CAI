High temperature superconductor (HTS) (RE)Ba2Cu3Ox (REBCO) conductor on round core cable (CORC)
has high current carrying capacity for high field magnet and power applications. In REBCO CORC cables,
current redistribution occurs among tapes through terminal contact resistances when a local quench
occurs. Therefore, the quench behaviour of CORC cable is different from single tape situation,
for it is significantly affected by terminal contact resistances. To better understand the underlying
physical process of local quenches in CORC cables, a new 3D multi-physics modelling tool for CORC
cables is developed and presented in this paper. In this model, the REBCO tape is treated as a thin
shell without thickness, and four models are coupled: T-formulation model, A-formulation model,
a heat transfer model and an equivalent circuit model. The current redistribution, temperature
and tape voltage of CORC cable during hot spot induced quenches are analysed using this model. The
results show that the thermal stability of CORC cable can be considerably improved by reducing terminal
contact resistance. The minimum quench energy (MQE) increases rapidly with the reduction of terminal
contact resistance when the resistance is in a middle range. When the terminal contact resistance
is too low or too high, the MQE shows no obvious variation with terminal contact resistances. With
a low terminal contact resistance, a hot spot in one tape may induce an over-current quench on the
other tapes without hot spots. This will not happen in a cable with high terminal contact resistance.
In this case, the tape with hot spot will quench and burn out before inducing a quench on other tapes.
The modelling tool developed can be used to design CORC cables with improved thermal stability.
