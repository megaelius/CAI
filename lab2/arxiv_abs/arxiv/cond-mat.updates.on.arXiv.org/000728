We present a comparative theoretical study of magnetic resonance within the polaron pair recombination
(PPR) and the triplet exciton-polaron quenching (TPQ) models. Both models have been invoked to
interpret the photoluminescence detected magnetic resonance (PLDMR) in $\pi$-conjugated materials.
We show that resonance lineshapes calculated within the two models differ dramatically in several
regards. First, in the PPR model, the lineshape exhibits unusual behavior upon increasing the microwave
power: it evolves from fully positive at weak power to fully negative at strong power. In contrast,
in the TPQ model, the PLDMR is completely positive, showing a monotonic saturation. Second, the
two models predict different dependencies of the resonance signal on the photoexcitation power,
$P_L$. At low $P_L$, the resonance amplitude $\Delta I/I$ is $\propto P_L$ in the PPR model, while
it is $\propto P_L^2$ crossing over to $P_L^3$ in the TPQ model. On the physical level, the differences
stem from different underlying spin dynamics. Most prominently, a negative resonance within the
PPR model has its origin in the microwave-induced spin-Dicke effect, leading to the resonant quenching
of photoluminescence. The spin-Dicke effect results from the spin-selective recombination,
resulting in a highly correlated precession of the on-resonance pair-partners under the strong
microwave power. This effect is not relevant to TPQ, where the majority of triplets are off-resonance
due to the strong zero-field splitting. The analytical evaluation of lineshapes for the two models
is enabled by expressing these shapes via the eigenvalues of a complex Hamiltonian. This bypasses
the necessity of solving the much larger complex system of stochastic Liouville equations. Our
findings pave the way towards a reliable discrimination between the two mechanisms via cw PLDMR.
