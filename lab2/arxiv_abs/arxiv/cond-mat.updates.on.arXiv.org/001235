Fracton order is a new kind of quantum order characterized by topological excitations which exhibit
remarkable mobility restrictions and a robust ground state degeneracy (GSD) which can increase
exponentially with system size. In this manuscript, we present a generic lattice construction
(in three dimensions) for a generalized X-cube model of fracton order, where the mobility restrictions
of the subdimensional particles inherit the geometry of the lattice. This helps explain a previous
result that lattice curvature can produce a robust GSD, even on a manifold with trivial topology.
We provide explicit examples to show that the (zero temperature) phase of matter is sensitive to
the lattice geometry. In one example, the lattice geometry confines the dimension-1 particles
to small loops, which allows the fractons to be fully mobile charges, and the resulting phase is equivalent
to 3+1D toric code. However, the phase is sensitive to more than just lattice curvature; different
lattices without curvature (e.g. cubic or stacked kagome lattices) also result in different phases
of matter, which are separated by phase transitions. Unintuitively however, according to a previous
definition of phase [Chen, Gu, Wen 2010], even just a rotated or rescaled cubic results in different
phases of matter, which motivates us to propose a new and coarser definition of phase for gapped ground
states and fracton topological order. The new equivalence relation between ground states is given
by the composition of a local unitary transformation and a quasi-isometry (which can rotate and
rescale the lattice); equivalently, ground states are in the same phase if they can be adiabatically
connected by varying both the Hamiltonian and the positions of the degrees of freedom (via a quasi-isometry).In
light of the importance of geometry, we further propose that fracton orders should be regarded as
a geometric order.
