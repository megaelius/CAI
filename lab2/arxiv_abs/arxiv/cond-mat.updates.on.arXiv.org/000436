We performed systematic studies of the combined effects of annealing/quenching temperature ({\itshape
T}$_{A/Q}$) and T = Ni, Rh substitution ({\itshape x}) on the physical properties of Ca(Fe$_{1-x}$T$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$.
We constructed two-dimensional, {\itshape T}$_{A/Q}$-{\itshape x} phase diagrams for the low-temperature
states for both substitutions to map out the relations between ground states and compared them with
that of Co-substitution. Ni-substitution, which brings one more extra electron per substituted
atom and suppresses the {\itshape c}-lattice parameter at roughly the same rate as Co-substitution,
leads to a similar parameter range of antiferromagnetic/orthorhombic in the {\itshape T}$_{A/Q}$-{\itshape
x} space as that found for Co-substitution, but has the parameter range for superconductivity shrunk
(roughly by a factor of two). This result is similar to what is found when Co- and Ni-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$
are compared. On the other hand, Rh-substitution, which brings the same amount of extra electrons
as does Co-substitution, but suppresses the {\itshape c}-lattice parameter more rapidly, has
a different phase diagram. The collapsed tetragonal phase exists much more pervasively, to the
exclusion of the normal, paramagnetic, tetragonal phase. The range of antiferromagnetic/orthorhombic
phase space is noticeably reduced, and the superconducting region is substantially suppressed,
essentially truncated by the collapsed tetragonal phase. In addition, we found that whereas for
Co-substitution there was no difference between phase diagrams for samples annealed for one or
seven days, for Ni- and Rh- substitutions a second, reversible, effect of annealing was revealed
by seven-day anneals.
