Superconductivity owes its properties to the phase of the electron pair condensate that breaks
the $U(1)$ symmetry. In the most traditional ground state, the phase is uniform and rigid. The normal
state can be unstable towards special inhomogeneous superconducting states: the Abrikosov vortex
state, and the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state. Here we show that the phase-uniform superconducting
state can go into a fundamentally different and more ordered non-uniform ground state, that we denote
as a phase crystal. The new state breaks translational invariance through formation of a spatially
periodic modulation of the phase, manifested by unusual superflow patterns and circulating currents,
that also break time-reversal symmetry. We list the general conditions needed for realization
of phase crystals. Using microscopic theory we then derive an analytic expression for the superfluid
density tensor for the case of a non-uniform environment in a semi-infinite superconductor. We
demonstrate how the surface quasiparticle states enter the superfluid density and identify phase
crystallization as the main player in several previous numerical observations in unconventional
superconductors, and predict existence of a similar phenomenon in superconductor-ferromagnetic
structures. This analytic approach provides a new unifying aspect for the exploration of boundary-induced
quasiparticles and collective excitations in superconductors. More generally, we trace the origin
of phase crystallization to non-local properties of the gradient energy, which implies existence
of similar pattern-forming instabilities in many other contexts.
