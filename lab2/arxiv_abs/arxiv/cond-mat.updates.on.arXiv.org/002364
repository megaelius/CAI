Mesoscopic quantum systems exhibit complex many-body quantum phenomena, where interactions
between spins and charges give rise to collective modes and topological states. Even simple, non-interacting
theories display a rich landscape of energy states --- distinct many-particle configurations
connected by spin- and energy-dependent transition rates. The collective energy landscape is
difficult to characterize or predict, especially in regimes of frustration where many-body effects
create a multiply degenerate landscape. Here we use network science to characterize the complex
interconnection patterns of these energy-state transitions. Using an experimentally verified
computational model of electronic transport through quantum antidots, we construct networks
where nodes represent accessible energy states and edges represent allowed transitions. We then
explore how physical changes in currents and voltages are reflected in the network topology. We
find that the networks exhibit Rentian scaling, which is characteristic of efficient transportation
systems in computer circuitry, neural circuitry, and human mobility, and can be used to measure
the interconnection complexity of a network. Remarkably, networks corresponding to points of
frustration in quantum transport (due, for example, to spin-blockade effects) exhibit an enhanced
topological complexity relative to networks not experiencing frustration. Our results demonstrate
that network characterizations of the abstract topological structure of energy landscapes can
capture salient properties of quantum transport. More broadly, our approach motivates future
efforts to use network science in understanding the dynamics and control of complex quantum systems.
