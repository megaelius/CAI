When the ground state of a localized ion is a non-Kramers doublet, such localized ions may carry multipolar
moments. For example, Pr$^{3+}$ ions in a cubic environment would possess quadrupolar and octupolar,
but no magnetic dipole, moments. When such multipolar moments are placed in a metallic host, unusual
interactions between these local moments and conduction electrons arise, in contrast to the familiar
magnetic dipole interactions in the classic Kondo problem. In this work, we consider the interaction
between a single quadrupolar-octupolar local moment and conduction electrons with $p$-orbital
symmetry as a concrete model for the multipolar Kondo problem. We show that this model can be written
most naturally in the spin-orbital entangled basis of conduction electrons. Using this basis,
the perturbative renormalization group (RG) fixed points are readily identified. There are two
kinds of fixed points, one for the two-channel Kondo and the other for a novel fixed point. We investigate
the nature of the novel fixed point non-perturbatively using non-abelian bosonization, current
algebra and conformal field theory approaches. It is shown that the novel fixed point leads to a,
previously unidentified, non-Fermi liquid state with entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom,
which shows resistivity $\rho \sim T^{\Delta}$ and diverging specific heat coefficient $C/T \sim
T^{-1 + 2\Delta}$ with $\Delta=1/5$. Our results open up the possibility of myriads of non-Fermi
liquid states, depending on the choices of multipolar moments and conduction electron orbitals,
which would be relevant for many rare-earth metallic systems.
