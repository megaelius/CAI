In the laboratory study of extreme conditions of pressure, temperature, and timescale, the irradiation
of matter by high intensity sources has been of central importance. Here we investigate the performance
of layered targets in experiments involving very high intensity hard x-ray irradiation, motivated
by the advent of extremely high brightness x-ray sources such as free electron lasers. These sources
enable massive ($\mu$m to mm) scale targets with confinement of the directly irradiated regions
by thick, x-ray transparent tampers. The thermal and mechanical response of these layers, from
femtosecond-picosecond energy delivery, to mechanical relaxation on nanosecond timescales
and heat flow and dissipation on microseconds, is controlled by the differential energy deposition,
shock and release wave production, and thermal transport properties. Sample survival over one
or more exposures can depend on damage arising from heating or mechanical stresses induced by heating,
depending on the materials used and target geometry. This study also doubles as an investigation
into the properties of diamond anvil high pressure cells, long used in conjunction with x-ray synchrotron
sources, at new high intensity x-ray beamlines at free electron lasers and upgraded synchrotrons.
Configuring a tamped target as a high pressure cell confers certain advantages, such as resistance
to expansion and thermal stresses, and sample confinement, in conjunction with efficient control
of heat. This study suggests new routes to studying thermodynamic equilibrium states of high energy
density matter via the capacity to confine extreme states for particularly long durations.
