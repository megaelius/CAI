Understanding the evolution of interference patterns in two-particle momentum correlations
as a function of the strength of interatomic interactions is important in explorations of the nature
of quantum states of trapped particles. Together with the analysis of two-particle spatial correlations,
it promises to uncover fundamental symmetries and structures of correlated many-body states,
as well as opening vistas into potential control and utilization of correlated quantum states as
quantum information resources. With the use of the two-particle density matrix constructed via
configuration-interaction (CI) exact diagonalization of the microscopic Hamiltonian, we explored
here the systematic evolution of characteristic, damped, interference patterns in the two-particle
momentum and spatial correlation maps of two ultracold fermionic atoms trapped in a double-well
potential, over the entire range of variation of the contact repulsive interatomic interaction
strength. For the singlet ground state the two-particle momentum maps were found to transform from
a square-plaid pattern for non-interacting particles, to a system of striped interference fringes,
with the most intense fringe lying along the main diagonal indicating bunching. Two-particle momentum
correlation maps for low-lying excited states were also analyzed, with the triplet excited state
found to exhibit antibunching. A modified Hubbard-type effective model is described and used to
obtain the spatial and momentum two-body density matrices, and it is shown to reproduce well the
microscopic CI results. This led to uncovering of analytic expressions capturing the full evolution
of the two-particle momentum correlation maps over the entire range of interparticle interactions,
from the independent particle limit with a substantial site-double-occupancy fraction, to the
Mott insulating regime.
