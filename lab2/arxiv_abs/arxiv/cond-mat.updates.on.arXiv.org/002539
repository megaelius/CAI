Nanoindentation is a convenient method to investigate the mechanical properties of materials
on small scales by utilizing low loads and small indentation depths. However, the effect of grain
boundaries (GB) on the nanoindentation response remains unclear and needs to be studied by investigating
in detail the interactions between dislocations and GBs during nanoindentation. In the present
work, we employ a three-dimensional multiscale modeling framework, which couples three-dimensional
discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) with the Finite Element method (FEM) to investigate GB effects
on the nanoindentation behavior of an aluminum bicrystal. The interaction between dislocations
and GB is physically modeled in terms of a penetrable GB, where piled-up dislocations can penetrate
through the GB and dislocation debris at GBs can emit full dislocations into grains. In the simulation,
we confirmed two experimentally observed phenomena, namely, pop-in events and the dependence
of indentation hardness on the distance from GB. Two pop-in events were observed, of which the initial
pop-in event is correlated with the activation and multiplication of dislocations, while the GB
pop-in event results from dislocation transmission through the GB. By changing the distance between
the indenter and GB, the simulation shows that the indentation hardness increases with decreasing
GB-indenter distance. A quantitative model has been formulated which relates the dependency of
indentation hardness on indentation depth and on GB-indenter distance to the back stress created
by piled-up geometrically necessary dislocations in the plastic zone and to the additional constraint
imposed by the GB on the plastic zone size.
