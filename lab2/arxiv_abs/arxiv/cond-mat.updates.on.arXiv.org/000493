We explain in depth our previously proposed theory of the coherent Van der Waals(cVdW) interaction
- the counterpart of Van der Waals (VdW) force - emerging in spatially coherently fluctuating electromagnetic
fields. The general theory of cVdW systems provides us with the physical rationale for understanding
recent experiments that induce cVdW and generate complex hierarchies of self-organized morphologies
in paramagnetic colloidal systems. Most striking among these colloidal superstructures are dipolar
foams, for which we explain why they swell against gravity despite local cohesion. We show that cVdW
driven matter is strongly dominated by many body interactions, which are significantly stronger
than those in standard Van der Waals (VdW) systems. Remarkably, the leading 2- and 3-body interactions
are of the same order of magnitude with respect to the distance ~R^(-6), in contrast to the standard
VdW where many body effects are much weaker (~R^(-9)). Based on the microscopic theory it is shown
that the anisotropic cVdW many body interactions prefer the formation of low-dimensional structures
such as chains, membranes and vesicles with very unusual, non-local properties. In particular,
we show that cVdW chains display a logarithmically growing stiffness with the chain length, while
for cVdW membranes the effective bending modulus grows even stronger (linearly) with their size.
It is also argued that the cVdW anisotropic many body forces cause local cohesion but also a negative
effective "surface tension". We conclude by deriving the equation of state for cVdW materials and
propose new experiments to test the theory, in particular the peculiar dominant 3-body nature of
cVdW.
