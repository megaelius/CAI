With pulsed laser deposition we have grown c-axis oriented thin films of the nominal composition
LaMnO$_{3}$ (LMO) on LSAT(001) substrates. We find that, depending on the oxygen background pressure
during growth, the LMO films contain sizeable amounts of La and/or Mn vacancies that strongly influence
their electronic and magnetic properties. Specifically, we show that the Mn/La ratio can be systematically
varied from 0.92 at 0.11 mbar to 1.09 at 0.30 mbar of oxygen. These cationic vacancies lead to markedly
different disorder effects that become most pronounced once the samples are fully oxygenated and
thus strongly hole doped. All as-grown and thus slightly oxygen deficient LMO films are ferromagnetic
insulators with saturation moments in excess of 2.5 \mu $_{B}$ per Mn ion, their transport and optical
properties that can be understood in terms of trapped ferromagnetic polarons. Upon oxygen annealing,
the most La-deficient films develop a metallic response with an even larger ferromagnetic saturation
moment of 3.8 \mu $_{B}$ per Mn ion. In contrast, in the oxygenated Mn-deficient films the ferromagnetic
order is almost completely suppressed to less than 0.5 \mu $_{B}$ per Mn ion and the transport remains
insulator-like. We compare our results with the ones that were previously obtained on bulk samples
and present an interpretation in terms of the much stronger disorder potential of the Mn vacancies
as compared to the La vacancies. We also discuss the implications for the growth of LMO thin films
with well-defined physical properties that, for example, are a prerequisite for the study of interface
effects in multilayers.
