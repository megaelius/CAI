We develop a critical-state model of fused silica plasticity on the basis of data mined from molecular
dynamics (MD) calculations. The MD data is suggestive of an irreversible densification transition
in volumetric compression resulting in permanent, or plastic, densification upon unloading.
The MD data also reveals an evolution towards a critical state of constant volume under pressure-shear
deformation. The trend towards constant volume is from above, when the glass is overconsolidated,
or from below, when it is underconsolidated. We show that these characteristic behaviors are well-captured
by a critical state model of plasticity, where the densification law for glass takes the place of
the classical consolidation law of granular media and the locus of constant volume states denotes
the critical-state line. A salient feature of the critical-state line of fused silica, as identified
from the MD data, that renders its yield behavior anomalous is that it is strongly non-convex, owing
to the existence of two well-differentiated phases at low and high pressures. We argue that this
strong non-convexity of yield explains the patterning that is observed in molecular dynamics calculations
of amorphous solids deforming in shear. We employ an explicit and exact rank-2 envelope construction
to upscale the microscopic critical-state model to the macroscale. Remarkably, owing to the equilibrium
constraint the resulting effective macroscopic behavior is still characterized by a non-convex
critical-state line. Despite this lack of convexity, the effective macroscopic model is stable
against microstructure formation and defines well-posed boundary-value problems.
