$L$ functions based on Dirichlet characters are natural generalizations of the Riemann $\zeta(s)$
function: they both have series representations and satisfy an Euler product representation,
i.e. an infinite product taken over prime numbers. In this paper we address the Generalized Riemann
Hypothesis relative to the non-trivial complex zeros of the Dirichlet $L$ functions by studying
the possibility to enlarge the original domain of convergence of their Euler product. The feasibility
of this analytic continuation is ruled by the asymptotic behavior in $N$ of the series $B_N = \sum_{n=1}^N
\cos \bigl( t \log p_n - \arg \chi (p_n) \bigr)$ involving Dirichlet characters $\chi$ modulo $q$
on primes $p_n$. Although deterministic, these series have pronounced stochastic features which
make them analogous to random time series. We show that the $B_N$'s satisfy various normal law probability
distributions. The study of their large asymptotic behavior poses an interesting problem of statistical
physics equivalent to the Single Brownian Trajectory Problem, here addressed by defining an appropriate
ensemble $\mathcal{E}$ involving intervals of primes. For non-principal characters, we show
that the series $B_N$ present a universal diffusive random walk behavior $B_N = O(\sqrt{N})$ in
view of the Dirichlet theorem on the equidistribution of reduced residue classes modulo $q$ and
the Lemke Oliver-Soundararajan conjecture on the distribution of pairs of residues on consecutive
primes. This purely diffusive behavior of $B_N$ implies that the domain of convergence of the infinite
product representation of the Dirichlet $L$-functions for non-principal characters can be extended
from $\Re(s) > 1$ down to $\Re (s) = \frac{1}{2}$, without encountering any zeros before reaching
this critical line.
