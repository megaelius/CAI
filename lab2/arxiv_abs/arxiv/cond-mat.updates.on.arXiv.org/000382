Calculations of stable and metastable magnetic states as well as minimum energy paths for transitions
between states are carried out using a non-collinear extension of the multiple-impurity Alexander-Anderson
model and a magnetic force theorem which is derived and used to evaluate the total energy gradient
with respect to orientation of magnetic moments - an important tool for efficient navigation on
the energy surface. By using this force theorem, the search for stable and metastable magnetic states
as well as minimum energy paths revealing the mechanism and activation energy of transitions can
be carried out efficiently. For Fe monolayer on W(110) surface, the model gives magnetic moment
as well as exchange coupling between nearest and next-nearest neighbors that are in good agreement
with previous density functional theory calculations. When applied to nano-scale Fe islands on
this surface, the magnetic moment is predicted to be 10% larger for atoms at the island rim, explaining
in part an experimentally observed trend in the energy barrier for magnetization reversal in small
islands. Surprisingly, the magnetic moment of the atoms does not change much along the minimum energy
path for the transitions, which for islands containing more than 15 atom rows along either $[001]$
or $[1\bar{1}0]$ directions involves the formation of a thin, temporary domain wall. A novel, non-collinear
magnetic state is identified in a $7\times 7$ atomic row Fe island where the magnetic moments are
arranged in a saddle-like configuration with the central ones pointing out of the $(110)$ plane.
This illustrates how the model can describe complicated exchange interactions even though it contains
only a few parameters.
