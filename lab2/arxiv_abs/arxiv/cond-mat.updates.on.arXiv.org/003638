We present an overview of the microscopic theory of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) coupling in
strongly correlated 3d compounds. Most attention in the paper centers around the derivation of
the Dzyaloshinskii vector, its value, orientation, and sense (sign) under different types of the
(super)exchange interaction and crystal field. We consider both the Moriya mechanism of the antisymmetric
interaction and novel contributions, in particular, that of spin-orbital coupling on the intermediate
ligand ions. We have predicted a novel magnetic phenomenon, {\it weak ferrimagnetism} in mixed
weak ferromagnets with competing signs of the Dzyaloshinskii vectors. We revisit a problem of the
DM coupling for a single bond in cuprates specifying the local spin-orbital contributions to Dzyaloshinskii
vector focusing on the oxygen term. We predict a novel puzzling effect of the on-site staggered spin
polarization to be a result of the on-site spin-orbital coupling and the the cation-ligand spin
density transfer. The intermediate ligand NMR measurements are shown to be an effective tool to
inspect the effects of the DM coupling in an external magnetic field. We predict the effect of a $strong$
oxygen weak antiferromagnetism in edge-shared CuO$_2$ chains due to uncompensated oxygen Dzyaloshinskii
vectors. We revisit the effects of symmetric spin anisotropy directly induced by the DM coupling.
A critical analysis will be given of different approaches to exchange-relativistic coupling based
on the cluster and the DFT based calculations. Theoretical results are applied to different classes
of 3d compounds from conventional weak ferromagnets ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, FeBO$_3$, FeF$_3$,
RFeO$_3$, RCrO$_3$,.. ) to unconventional systems such as weak ferrimagnets (e.g., RFe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$),
helimagnets (e.g., CsCuCl$_3$), and parent cuprates (La$_2$CuO$_4$,...).
