The dissolution of a body into quiescent water leads to density stratifications at the interfaces
that drive buoyant flows. Where the stratification is unstable, the flow destabilizes into convective
solute plumes. By analogy with the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability where concentration replaces
temperature, this phenomenon is known as the solutal Rayleigh-B\'enard instability. Here we report
experiments of the dissolution of inclined rectangular blocks made of salt, caramel or plaster
in aqueous solutions of various concentrations. The solute flows along the block while forming
plumes before they detach and sink. This flow along the block organizes the emission of plumes within
longitudinal parallel stripes with a well-defined millimeter scale wavelength. The instability
of the flow reflects on the concentration field in the boundary layer, which engraves longitudinal
grooves onto the block. These grooves interact with the flow and turn into a paving of 3 dimensional
cup like patterns that grow in size and propagate upstream. These bedforms are reminiscent of the
scallop bedforms observed on the walls of cave or icebergs. Whereas the block interface is highly
dynamical and evolves through time, it remains flat on the global scale and recedes at a stationary
rate. We derive scaling laws for the receding velocity and the pattern genesis at the inclined interface
that is based on a concentration boundary layer of constant thickness, which is controlled by the
flow instability, but where the patterns nor the flow along the block do not play any role. We apply
these results to the formation of sublimation patterns.
