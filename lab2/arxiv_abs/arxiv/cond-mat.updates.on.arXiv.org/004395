Micromagnetic simulations have been performed to investigate the suppression of the skyrmion
Hall effect in nanotracks with their magnetic properties strategically modified. In particular,
we study two categories of magnetically modified nanotracks. One of them, repulsive edges have
been inserted in the nanotrack and, in the other, an attractive strip has been placed exactly on the
longest axis of the nanotrack. Attractive and repulsive interactions can be generated from the
engineering of magnetic properties. For instance, it is known that the skyrmion can be attracted
to a region where the exchange stiffness constant is decreased. On the other hand, the skyrmion can
be repelled from a region characterized by a local increase in the exchange stiffness constant.
In order to provide a background for experimental studies, we vary not only the magnetic material
parameters (exchange stiffness, perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
constant) but also the width of the region magnetically modified, containing either a local reduction
or a local increase for each one of these magnetic properties. In the numerical simulations, the
skyrmion motion was induced by a spin-polarized current and the found results indicate that it is
possible to transport skyrmions around the longest axis of the nanotrack. In practice, the skyrmion
Hall effect can be completely suppressed in magnetic nanotracks with strategically modified magnetic
properties. Furthermore, we discuss in detail 6 ways to suppress the skyrmion Hall effect by the
usage of nanotracks with repulsive edges and nanotracks with an attractive strip.
