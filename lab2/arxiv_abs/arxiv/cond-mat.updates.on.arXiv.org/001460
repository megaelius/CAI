The postulates of thermodynamics were originally formulated for macroscopic systems. They lead
to the definition of the entropy, which, for a homogeneous system, is a homogeneous function of order
one in the extensive variables and is maximized at equilibrium. We say that the macroscopic systems
are extensive and so it is also the entropy. For a mesoscopic system, by definition, the size and the
contacts with other systems influence its thermodynamic properties and therefore, if we define
an entropy, this cannot be a homogeneous of order one function in the extensive variables. So, mesoscopic
systems and their entropies are non-extensive. While for macroscopic systems and homogeneous
entropies the equilibrium conditions are clearly defined, it is not so clear how the non-extensive
entropies should be applied for the calculation of equilibrium properties of mesoscopic systems--for
example it is not clear what is the role played by the boundaries and the contacts between the subsystems.
We propose here a general definition of the entropy in the equilibrium state, which is applicable
to both, macroscopic and mesoscopic systems. This definition still leaves an apparent ambiguity
in the definition of the entropy of a mesoscopic system, but this we recognize as the signature of
the anthropomorphic character of the entropy (see Jaynes, Am. J. Phys. 33, 391, 1965). To exemplify
our approach, we analyze four formulas for the entropy (two for extensive and two for non-extensive
entropies) and calculate the equilibrium (canonical) distribution of probabilities by two methods
for each. We show that these methods, although widely used, are not equivalent and one of them is a
consequence of our definition of the entropy of a compound system.
