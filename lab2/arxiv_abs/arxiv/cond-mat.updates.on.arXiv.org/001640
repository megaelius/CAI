Impurity diffusion in Zr is potentially important for many applications of Zr alloys, and in particular
for their use of nuclear reactor cladding. However, significant uncertainty presently exists
about which elements are vacancy vs. interstitial diffusers, which can inhibit understanding
and prediction of their behavior under different temperature, irradiation, and alloying conditions.
Therefore, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been
employed to predict the temperature-dependent dilute impurity diffusion coefficients for 14
substitutional alloying elements in hexagonal closed packed (HCP) Zr. Vacancy-mediated diffusion
was modeled with the eight-frequency model. Interstitial contributions to diffusion are estimated
from interstitial formation and select migration energies. Formation energies for each impurity
in nine high-symmetry interstitial sites were determined, including significant effects of thermal
expansion. The dominant diffusion mechanism of each solute in HCP Zr was identified in terms of the
calculated vacancy-mediated activation energy, lower and upper bounds of interstitial activation
energy, and the formation entropy, suggesting a rough relation with the metallic radii of solutes.
It is predicted that Cr, Cu, V, Zn, Mo, W, Au, Ag, Al, Nb, Ta and Ti all diffuse predominantly by an interstitial
mechanism, while Hf, Zr, and Sn are likely to be predominantly vacancy-mediated diffusers at low
temperature and interstitial diffusers at high temperature, although the identification of mechanisms
for these elements at high-temperature is quite uncertain.
