It was predicted that solid metallic hydrogen can be obtained if solid molecular hydrogen is pressured
to high pressure at low temperature about 80 years ago. Furthermore, the solid metallic hydrogen
was theoretically predicted to show superconductivity at room temperature. In addition, surprising
prediction was made that the solid metallic hydrogen is a metastable metal with a potential barrier
of 1 eV. This prediction implies that the solid metallic hydrogen remains in the metallic solid phase
state even after it is released from high pressure. Shock compression synthesized liquid metallic
hydrogen so far. However, to obtain metallic hydrogen under ambient pressure at room temperature,
it is necessary to synthesize solid metallic hydrogen. It is theoretically predicted that an ultrahigh
pressure of ~500 GPa is required to produce solid metallic hydrogen. This pressure is close to the
limit of the high pressure that can be generated by the diamond anvil cell (DAC). Therefore, it is
difficult to synthesize metallic hydrogen by using DAC. Shock compression methods can generate
a sufficiently high pressure to synthesize metallic hydrogen. But it is impossible to synthesize
solid metallic hydrogen by these methods because these accompany generation of high temperature.
There is currently no definitive way to synthesize solid metallic hydrogen. Here we report a new
dynamic high-pressure apparatus which aims for synthesis of solid metallic hydrogen. We show that
by using this apparatus, it is possible to generate a high pressure of 1 TPa, the pressure maintaining
time is 103 to 106 times longer than the conventional dynamic compression method. Furthermore,
we show that this apparatus is not accompanied by the generation of high temperature unlike the conventional
dynamic compression method and then it is possible that solid metallic hydrogen might be synthesized
by this apparatus.
