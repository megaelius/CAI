Traditionally, strong-field physics explores phenomena in matter (atoms, molecules, and solids)
driven by an extremely strong laser field nonperturbatively. However, even in the complete absence
of an external electromagnetic field, strong-field phenomena can arise when matter strongly couples
with the zero-point field of the quantum vacuum state, i.e., fluctuating electromagnetic waves
whose expectation value is zero. Some of the most striking examples of this occur in a cavity setting,
in which an ensemble of two-level atoms resonantly interacts with a single photonic mode of vacuum
fields, producing vacuum Rabi splitting. In particular, the nature of the matter-vacuum-field
coupled system fundamentally changes when the coupling rate (equal to one half of the vacuum Rabi
splitting) becomes comparable to, or larger than, the resonance frequency. In this so-called ultrastrong
coupling regime, a non-negligible number of photons exist in the ground state of the coupled system.
Furthermore, the coupling rate can be cooperatively enhanced (via so-called Dicke cooperativity)
when the matter is comprised of a large number of identical two-level particles, and a quantum phase
transition is predicted to occur as the coupling rate reaches a critical value. Low-energy electronic
or magnetic transitions in many-body condensed matter systems with large dipole moments are ideally
suited for searching for these predicted phenomena. Here, we discuss two condensed matter systems
that have shown cooperative ultrastrong interactions in the terahertz frequency range: a Landau-quantized
two-dimensional electron gas interacting with high-quality-factor cavity photons, and an Er$^{3+}$
spin ensemble interacting with Fe$^{3+}$ magnons in ErFeO$_3$.
