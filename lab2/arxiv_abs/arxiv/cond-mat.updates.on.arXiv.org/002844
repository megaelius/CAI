We use the robust nearest-neighbour tight-binding approximation to study on the same footing interband
dipole transitions in narrow-bandgap carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons. It is demonstrated
that curvature effects in metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes and edge effects in gapless
graphene nanoribbons not only open up bang gaps, which typically correspond to THz frequencies,
but also result in a giant enhancement of the probability of optical transitions across these gaps.
Moreover, the matrix element of the velocity operator for these transitions has a universal value
(equal to the Fermi velocity in graphene) when the photon energy coincides with the band-gap energy.
Upon increasing the excitation energy, the transition matrix element first rapidly decreases
(for photon energies remaining in the THz range but exceeding two band gap energies it is reduced
by three orders of magnitude), and thereafter it starts to increase proportionally to the photon
frequency. A similar effect occurs in an armchair carbon nanotube with a band gap opened and controlled
by a magnetic field applied along the nanotube axis. There is a direct correspondence between armchair
graphene nanoribbons and single-walled zigzag carbon nanotubes. The described sharp photon-energy
dependence of the transition matrix element together with the van Hove singularity at the band gap
edge of the considered quasi-one-dimensional systems make them promising candidates for active
elements of coherent THz radiation emitters. The effect of Pauli blocking of low-energy interband
transitions caused by residual doping can be suppressed by creating a population inversion using
high-frequency (optical) excitation.
