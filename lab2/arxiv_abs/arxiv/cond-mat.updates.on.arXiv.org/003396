Topological semimetals feature protected nodal band degeneracies characterized by a topological
invariant known as the Chern number. The magnitude and sign of this invariant determine many of the
exotic properties of such semimetals, including the number of topologically protected surface
Fermi-arcs, the number of chiral landau levels in the presence of a magnetic field, or the direction
and strength of topological photocurrents in optical experiments. While formally the Chern number
C can take any integer value, any nodal crossing with linear dispersion is expected to have at most
|C|=4, realized in fourfold and sixfold nodes in spin-orbit coupled, non-symmorphic chiral crystals.
Despite multiple recent photoemission studies of predicted material candidates, this maximal
Chern number, measured by counting the number of Fermi-arcs, has not yet been observed experimentally.
Using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and ab-initio calculations, here we show that
the chiral topological semimetal candidate PdGa displays the required multifold nodes, which
are connected by long surface Fermi-arcs. Due to large spin-orbit coupling and the high crystallinity
of our sample surfaces, we are for the first time able to resolve 4 independent Fermi-arcs, proving
experimentally that the observed multifold nodes - which are a generic feature of many chiral metals
- display the maximal Chern number magnitude of 4. Furthermore, by comparing two crystals with mirrored
crystal structure, we observe a reversal of the Fermi arc velocities, which demonstrates that the
sign of the Chern numbers is tied to the handedness of the sample, which establishes an important
control parameter for future experiments probing topological responses in chiral topological
semimetals.
