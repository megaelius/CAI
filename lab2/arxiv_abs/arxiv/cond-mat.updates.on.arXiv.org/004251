Strain engineering of graphene takes advantage of one of the most dramatic responses of Dirac electrons
enabling their manipulation via strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields. Numerous theoretically
proposed devices, such as resonant cavities and valley filters, as well as novel phenomena, such
as snake states, could potentially be enabled via this effect. These proposals, however, require
strong, spatially oscillating magnetic fields while to date only the generation and effects of
pseudo-gauge fields which vary at a length scale much larger than the magnetic length have been reported.
Here we create a periodic pseudo-gauge field profile using periodic strain that varies at the length
scale comparable to the magnetic length and study its effects on Dirac electrons. A periodic strain
profile is achieved by pulling on graphene with extreme (>10%) strain and forming nanoscale ripples,
akin to a plastic wrap pulled taut at its edges. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy and atomistic
calculations, we find that spatially oscillating strain results in a new quantization different
from the familiar Landau quantization observed in previous studies. We also find that graphene
ripples are characterized by large variations in carbon-carbon bond length, directly impacting
the electronic coupling between atoms, which within a single ripple can be as different as in two
different materials. The result is a single graphene sheet that effectively acts as an electronic
superlattice. Our results thus also establish a novel approach to synthesize an effective 2D lateral
heterostructure - by periodic modulation of lattice strain.
