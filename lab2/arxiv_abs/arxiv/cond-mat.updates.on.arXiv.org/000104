The $t_2-V$ model (involving next-nearest-neighbor hopping and nearest-neighbor repulsion)
has been shown to depict the limiting case of strong electron-phonon coupling in a molecular chain
with cooperative breathing mode [R. Pankaj and S. Yarlagadda, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 86}, 035453 (2012)].
Our $t_2-V$ model can be mapped onto an extremely anisotropic Heisenberg model (with next-nearest-neighbor
XY interaction and nearest-neighbor ising interaction) and is of the form $J_{\perp}\sum_i (S^+_{i-1}
S^-_{i+1} + {\rm H.c.}) + J_{\parallel} \sum_i S^z_i S^z_{i+1}$. Using finite size scaling, at
non-half-fillings of the $t_2-V$ model (or non-zero magnetizations of the spin model), we numerically
obtain the critical repulsion for a quantum phase transition by using modified Lanczos method.
During the transition, away from half-filling (zero magnetization), the system undergoes a striking
discontinuous transition from a superfluid to a supersolid [i.e., a superfluid homogeneously
coexisting with a period-doubling charge-density-wave (antiferromagnetic) state]. At half-filling,
the charge-density-wave (N\'eel) state and the superfluid state are mutually exclusive. We also
derive microscopically, using Green's functions, the exact instability conditions in the two
limiting cases of the $t_2-V$ model for hard-core-bosons: the two-particle system and the half-filled
system. We show explicitly that the critical repulsion $V_c$ for the two-particle case is $V_c/t_2
= 4$ for a ring of any size while for the half-filled case the $V_c/t_2 = 2 \sqrt{2}$ in the thermodynamic
limit. Our spin model correspondingly lends itself to exact instability solutions (by the Green's
function method) in the two limiting cases of two-magnons (the non-trivial highest excited state)
and N\'eel antiferromagnet ground state.
