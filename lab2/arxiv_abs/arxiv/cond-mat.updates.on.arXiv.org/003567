The relaxation behaviour of monohydroxy alcohols (monoalcohols) in broadband dielectric spectroscopy
(BDS) is usually dominated by the Debye process. This process is regarded as a signature of the dynamics
of transient supramolecular structures formed by H-bonding. In phenyl propanols the steric hindrance
of the phenyl ring is assumed to influence chain formation and thereby to decrease or even suppress
the intensity of the Debye process. In the present paper we study this effect in a systematic series
of structural isomers of phenyl-1-propanol in comparison with 1-propanol. It turns out that by
combining BDS, Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) and calorimetry the dynamics of supramolecular
structures can be uncovered. While light scattering spectra show the same spectral shape of the
main relaxation for all investigated monoalcohols, the dielectric spectra differ in the Debye
contribution. Thus it becomes possible for the first time to unambiguously disentangle both relaxation
modes in the dielectric spectra. It turns out that the Debye relaxation gets weaker the closer the
position of phenyl ring is to the hydroxy group, in accordance with the analysis of the Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich
correlation factor. Even in 1-phenyl-1-propanol, which has the phenyl group attached at the closest
position to the hydroxy group, we can separate a Debye-contribution in the dielectric spectrum.
From this we conclude that hydrogen bonds are not generally suppressed by the increased steric hindrance
of the phenyl ring, but rather an equilibrium of ring and chain-like structures is shifted towards
ring-like shapes on shifting the phenyl ring closer to the hydroxy group. Moreover, the shape of
the alpha-relaxation as monitored by PCS and BDS remains unaffected by the degree of hydrogen bonding
and is the same among the investigated alcohols.
