Active particles, including swimming microorganisms, autophoretic colloids and droplets, are
known to self-organize into ordered structures at fluid-solid boundaries. The entrainment of
particles in the attractive parts of their spontaneous flows has been postulated as a possible mechanism
underlying this phenomenon. Here, combining experiments, theory and numerical simulations,
we demonstrate the validity of this flow-induced ordering mechanism in a suspension of active emulsion
droplets. We show that the mechanism can be controlled, with a variety of resultant ordered structures,
by simply altering hydrodynamic boundary conditions. Thus, for flow in Hele-Shaw cells, metastable
lines or stable traveling bands can be obtained by varying the cell height. Similarly, for flow bounded
by a plane, dynamic crystallites are formed. At a no-slip wall the crystallites are characterised
by a continuous out-of-plane flux of particles that circulate and re-enter at the crystallite edges,
thereby stabilising them. At an interface where the tangential stress vanishes the crystallites
are strictly two-dimensional, with no out-of-plane flux. We rationalize these experimental results
by calculating, in each case, the slow viscous flow produced by the droplets and the dissipative,
long-ranged, many-body active forces and torques between them. The results of numerical simulations
of motion under the action of the active forces and torques are in excellent agreement with experiments.
Our work elucidates the mechanism of flow-induced phase separation (FIPS) in active fluids, particularly
active colloidal suspensions, and demonstrates its control by boundaries, suggesting new routes
to geometric and topological phenomena in active matter.
