We investigate the optical excitation spectra and the photoluminescence depolarization dynamics
in bilayer WS$_2$. A different understanding of the optical excitation spectra in the recent photoluminescence
experimentby Zhu {\em et al.} [ arXiv:1403.6224 ] in bilayer WS$_2$ is proposed. In the experiment,
four excitations (1.68, 1.93, 1.99 and 2.37 eV) are observed and identified to be indirect exciton
for the $\Gamma$ valley, trion, A exciton and B exciton excitations, respectively, with the redshift
for the A exciton energy measured to be 30$\sim$50 meV when the sample synthesized from monolayer
to bilayer. According to our study, by considering there exist both the intra-layer and charge-transfer
excitons in the bilayer WS$_2$, with inter-layer hopping of the hole, there exists excimer state
composed by the superposition of the intra-layer and charge-transfer exciton states. Accordingly,
we show that the four optical excitations in the bilayer WS$_2$ are the A charge-transfer exciton,
${\rm A}'$ excimer, ${\rm B}'$ excimer and B intra-layer exciton states, respectively, with the
calculated resonance energies showing good agreement with the experiment. In our picture, the
speculated indirect exciton, which involves a high-order phonon absorption/emission process,
is not necessary. Furthermore, the binding energy for the excimer state is calculated to be 40 meV,
providing reasonable explanation for the experimentally observed energy redshift of the A exciton.
Based on the excimer states, we further derive the exchange interaction Hamiltonian. Then the photoluminescence
depolarization dynamics due to the electron-hole exchange interaction is studied in the pump-probe
setup by the kinetic spin Bloch equations. We find that ......
