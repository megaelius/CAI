Research over the years has shown that the formation of the Fe$_3$Si phase in FINEMET (Fe-Si-Nb-B-Cu)
alloys leads to superior soft magnetic properties. In this work, we use a CALPHAD approach to derive
Fe-Si phase diagrams to identify the composition-temperature domain where the Fe$_3$Si phase
can be stabilized. Thereafter, we have developed a precipitation model capable of simulating the
nucleation and growth of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals via Langer-Schwartz theory. For optimum magnetic
properties, prior work suggests that it is desirable to precipitate Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals with
10-15 nm diameter and with the crystalline volume fraction of about 70 \%. Based on our parameterized
model, we simulated the nucleation and growth of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals by isothermal annealing
of Fe$_{72.89}$Si$_{16.21}$B$_{6.90}$Nb$_{3}$Cu$_{1}$ (composition in atomic \%). In numerical
experiments, the alloys were annealed at a series of temperatures from 490 to 550 \degree C for two
hours to study the effect of holding time on mean radius, volume fraction, size distribution, nucleation
rate, number density, and driving force for the growth of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals. With increasing
annealing temperature, the mean radius of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals increases, while the volume fraction
decreases. We have also studied the effect of composition variations on the nucleation and growth
of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals. As Fe content decreases, it is possible to achieve the desired mean radius
and volume fraction within one hour holding time. The CALPHAD approach presented here can provide
efficient exploration of the nanocrystalline morphology for most FINEMET systems, for cases in
which the optimization of one or more material properties or process variables are desired.
