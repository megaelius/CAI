We theoretically investigate the subgapped transport phenomena through a normal-superconductor-normal
(NSN) junction made up of ultra thin topological insulator with proximity induced superconductivity.
The dimensional crossover from three dimensional ($3$D) topological insulator (TI) to thin two-dimensional
($2$D) TI introduces a new degree of freedom, the so-called hybridization or coupling between the
two surface states. We explore the role of hybridization in transport properties of the NSN junction,
especially how it affects the crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). We observe that a rib-like pattern
appears in CAR probability profile while examined as a function of angle of incidence and length
of the superconductor. Depending on the incoming and reflection or transmission channel, CAR probability
can be maneuvered to be higher than $97\%$ under suitable coupling between the two TI surface states
along with appropriate gate voltage and doping concentration in the normal region. Coupling between
the two surfaces also induces an additional oscillation envelope in the behavior of the angle averaged
conductance, with the variation of the length of the superconductor. The behavior of co-tunneling
(CT) probability is also very sensitive to the coupling and other parameters. Finally, we also explore
the shot noise cross correlation and show that the behavior of the same can be monotonic or non-monotonic
depending on the doping concentration in the normal region. Under suitable circumstances, shot
noise cross correlation can change sign from positive to negative or vice versa depending on the
relative strength of CT and CAR.
