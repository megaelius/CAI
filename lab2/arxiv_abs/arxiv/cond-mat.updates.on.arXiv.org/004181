Polycrystalline samples of Z-type hexaferrites, having nominal compositions $\mathrm{Ba_3Co_{2+x}Fe_{24-2x}M_xO_{41}}$
where M = $\mathrm{Ir^{4+}, Hf^{4+}, Mo^{4+}}$ and x=0 and 0.05, were processed via ceramic processing
protocols in pursuit of low magnetic and dielectric losses as well as equivalent permittivity and
permeability. Fine process control was conducted to ensure optimal magnetic properties. Organic
dispersants (i.e., isobutylene and maleic anhydride) were employed to achieve maximum densities.
Crystallographic structure, characterized by X-ray diffraction, revealed that doping with $\mathrm{Ir^{4+},
Hf^{4+}, Mo^{4+}}$ did not adversely affect the crystal structure and phase purity of the Z-type
hexaferrite. The measured microwave and magnetic properties show that the resonant frequency
shifts depending on the specific dopant allowing for tunability of the operational frequency and
bandwidth. The frequency bandwidth in which permittivity and permeability are very near equal
(i.e., ~400 MHz for $\mathrm{Mo^{4+}}$ (x), where x=0.05 doping) is shown to occur at frequencies
between 0.2 and 1.0 GHz depending on dopant type. These results give rise to low loss at 650 MHz, with
considerable size reduction of an order of magnitude, while maintaining the characteristic impedance
of free space (i.e., 377 $\mathrm{\Omega}$). These results allow for miniaturization and optimized
band-pass performance of magnetodielectric materials for communication devices such as antenna
and radomes that can be engineered to operate over desired frequency ranges using cost effective
and volumetric processing methodologies.
