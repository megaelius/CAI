We recently proposed quantum simulators of "twistronic-like" physics based on ultracold atoms
and syntheticdimensions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 030504 (2020)]. Conceptually, the scheme is based
on the idea that aphysical monolayer optical lattice of desired geometry is upgraded to a synthetic
bilayer system by identifyingthe internal states of the trapped atoms with synthetic spatial dimensions.
The couplings between the internalstates, i.e. between sites on the two layers, can be exquisitely
controlled by laser induced Raman transitions.By spatially modulating the interlayer coupling,
Moir\'e-like patterns can be directly imprinted on the latticewithout the need of a physical twist
of the layers. This scheme leads practically to a uniform pattern across thelattice with the added
advantage of widely tunable interlayer coupling strengths. The latter feature facilitates theengineering
of flat bands at larger "magic" angles, or more directly, for smaller unit cells than in conventionaltwisted
materials. In this paper we extend these ideas and demonstrate that our system exhibits topologicalband
structures under appropriate conditions. To achieve non-trivial band topology we consider imanaginarynext-to-nearest
neighbor tunnelings that drive the system into a quantum anomalous Hall phase. In particular,we
focus on three groups of bands, whose their Chern numbers triplet can be associated to a trivial insulator(0,0,0),
a standard non-trivial (-1,0,1) and a non-standard non-trivial (-1,1,0). We identify regimes
of parameterswhere these three situations occur. We show the presence of an anomalous Hall phase
and the appearance oftopological edge states. Our works open the path for experiments on topological
effects in twistronics without atwist
