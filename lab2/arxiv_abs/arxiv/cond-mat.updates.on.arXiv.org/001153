The discovery of superconductivity in the two-leg ladder compound BaFe$_2$S$_3$ has established
the 123-type iron chalcogenides as a novel and interesting subgroup of the iron-based superconductors
family. However, in this 123 series, BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ is an exceptional member, with a magnetic order
and crystalline structure different from all others. Recently, an exciting experiment reported
the emergence of superconductivity in BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ at high pressure [J.-J. Ying, et al., Phys.
Rev. B 95, 241109 (R) (2017)]. In this publication, we report a first principles study of BaFe$_2$Se$_3$.
Our analysis unveils a variety of qualitative differences between BaFe$_2$S$_3$ and BaFe$_2$Se$_3$,
including in the latter an unexpected chain of transitions with increasing pressure. First, by
gradually reducing the tilting angle of iron ladders, the crystalline structure smoothly transforms
from Pnma to Cmcm at ~6 GPa. Second, the system becomes metallic at 10.4 GPa. Third, its unique ambient
pressure Block antiferromagnetic ground state is replaced by the more common CX antiferromagnetic
order at ~12 GPa, the same magnetic state of the 123-S ladder. This transition is found at a pressure
very similar to the experimental superconducting transition. Finally, all magnetic moments vanish
at 30 GPa. This reported theoretical diagram of the complete phase evolution is important because
of the technical challenges to capture many physical properties in high-pressure experiments.
The information obtained in our calculations suggest different characteristics for superconductivity
in BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ and BaFe$_2$S$_3$: in 123-S pairing occurs when magnetic moments vanish, while
in 123-Se the transition region from Block- to CX-type magnetism appears to catalyze superconductivity.
Finally, an additional superconducting dome above ~30 GPa is expected to occur.
