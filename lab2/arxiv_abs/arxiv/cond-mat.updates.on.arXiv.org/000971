We formalize the appearance of new types of insulators in long-range (LR) fermionic systems. These
phases are not included in the "ten-fold way classification" (TWC) for the short-range (SR) topological
insulators. This conclusion is obtained studying at first specific one-dimensional LR examples,
in particular their phase diagrams and contents in symmetries and entanglement. The purely long-range
phases (LRP) are signaled by the violation of the area-law for the Von Neumann entropy and by corresponding
peculiar distributions for the entanglement spectrum (ES). The origin of the deviations from the
TWC is analyzed from a more general point of view and in any dimension. In particular, it is found related
with a particular type of divergences occurring in the spectrum, due to the LR couplings. A satisfying
characterization for the LRP can be achieved at least for one-dimensional systems, as well as the
connected definition of a nontrivial topology, provided a careful evaluation of the LR contributions.
Our results lead to reconsider the definition of correlation length in LR systems. The same analysis
also allows to infer, at least for one-dimensional models, the weakening of the bulk-boundary correspondence,
due to the important correlations between bulk and edges, and consequently to clarify the nature
of the massive edge states appearing in the topological LR. The emergence of this peculiar edge structure
is signaled by the bulk ES. The stability of the LRP against finite-size effects, relevant in current
experiments, and against local disorder is discussed, showing that the latter ingredient can even
strengthen the effect of the LR couplings. Finally, we analyze the entanglement content of the paradigmatic
LR Ising spin chain, inferring again important deviations from the SR regime, and the limitations
of bulk-boundary (tensor-network based) approaches to classify LR spin models.
