We present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study of the solution phase properties
of DNA-based family of nanoparticles - dendrimer-like DNA molecules (DL-DNA). These charged DNA
dendrimers are novel macromolecular aggregates, which hold high promise in targeted self-assembly
of soft matter systems in the bulk and at interfaces. To describe the behavior of this family of dendrimers
(with generations ranging from G1 to G7), we use a theoretical model in which base-pairs of a single
DL-DNA molecule are modeled by charged monomers, whose interactions are chosen to mimic the equilibrium
properties of DNA correctly. Experimental results on the sizes and conformations of DL-DNA are
based on static and 1dynamic light scattering; at the same time, Molecular Dynamics simulations
are employed to model the equilibrium properties of DL-DNA, which compare favorably with the findings
from experiments while at the same time providing a host of additional information and insight into
the molecular structure of the nanostructures. We also examine the salt-responsiveness of these
macromolecules, finding that despite the strong screening of electrostatic interactions, brought
about by the added salt, the macromolecules shrink only slightly, their size robustness stemming
from the high bending rigidity of the DNA-segments. The study of these charged dendrimer systems
is an important field of research in the area of soft matter due to their potential role for various
interdisciplinary applications, ranging from molecular cages and carriers for drug delivery
in a living organism to the development of dendrimer- and dendron-based ultra-thin films in the
area of nanotechnology. These findings are essential to determine if DL-DNA is a viable candidate
for the experimental realization of cluster crystals in the bulk, a novel form of solids with multiple
site occupancy.
