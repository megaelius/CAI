Bioelastomers have demonstrated tremendous value and potential in the field of tissue repair due
to increasing health demands. Improved non-invasive methods are required for monitoring tissue
development assisted by bioelastomers. In this paper, we present a novel theory of fluid-solid
coupling in a porous medium for application to the ultrasonic evaluation of tissue remodeling using
bioelastomers. The common assumption of equal solid and liquid displacements used in the conventional
description of a fluid-saturated porous solid cannot be applied to soft media, such as bioelastomers.
We revise the geoacoustic theory of Biot to allow for relative motion between a fluid and a solid in
an aggregate and derive an expression for a characteristic fluid-solid coupling parameter. Unlike
the conventional method, the propagation speed of shear waves observed by ultrasound shear wave
elastography is considered a known quantity in the novel theory, and the calculated value of the
coupling parameter is used to evaluate the status of tissue repair. The model is validated by analyzing
selected cases. The conditions under which the model can be applied are identified. However, further
development of the theory is required to extract dynamic parameters that can be used to monitor the
entire tissue remodeling process. In this paper, a theoretical approach is developed that can be
used to analyze the mechanics of tissue repair. The theory has potential applications in the field
of acellular in situ tissue engineering for non-invasive monitoring of the complex mechanical
remodeling process of tissue regeneration and bioelastomer degradation.
