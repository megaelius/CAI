The interplay of superconductivity with a non-trivial spin texture holds promises for the engineering
of non-abelian Majorana quasi-particles. A wide class of systems expected to exhibit exotic correlations
are based on nanoscale conductors with strong spin-orbit interaction, subject to a strong external
magnetic field. The strength of the spin-orbit coupling is a crucial parameter for the topological
protection of Majorana modes as it forbids other trivial excitations at low energy. The spin-orbit
interaction is in principle intrinsic to a material. As a consequence, experimental efforts have
been recently focused on semiconducting nano-conductors or spin-active atomic chains contacted
to a superconductor. Alternatively, we show how both a spin-orbit and a Zeeman effect can be autonomously
induced by using a magnetic texture coupled to any low dimensional conductor, here a carbon nanotube.
Transport spectroscopy through superconducting contacts reveals oscillations of Andreev like
states under a change of the magnetic texture. These oscillations are well accounted for by a scattering
theory and are absent in a control device with no magnetic texture. A large synthetic spin-orbit
energy of about 1.1 meV, larger than the intrinsic spin orbit energy in many other platforms, is directly
derived from the number of oscillations. Furthermore, a robust zero energy state, the hallmark
of devices hosting localized Majorana modes, emerges at zero magnetic field. Our findings synthetize
all the features for the emergence of Majorana modes at zero magnetic field in a controlled, local
and autonomous fashion. It could be used for advanced experiments, including microwave spectroscopy
and braiding operations, which are at the heart of new schemes of topological quantum computation.
