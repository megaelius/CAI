We develop a hyperelastic constitutive model for graphene --- describing in-plane deformations
involving both large isotropic and deviatoric strains --- based on the invariant-theoretic approach
to representation of anisotropic functions. The strain energy density function $\psi$ is expressed
in terms of special scalar-valued functions of the 2D logarithmic strain tensor $ \mathbf E^{(0)}$
--- called the symmetry-invariants --- that remain invariant w.r.t. the material symmetry group
of graphene, $\mathcal G = \mathcal C_{6v}$. Our constitutive model conforms to a larger set of \textit{ab
initio} energies/stresses while introducing fewer elastic constants than previously-proposed
models. In particular, when the strain energy is expressed in terms of symmetry invariants, the
material symmetry group is intrinsically incorporated within the constitutive response functions;
consequently, the elastic constants (of all orders) in the formulation are \textit{a priori} independent:
i.e., no two or more elastic constants are related by symmetry. This offers substantial simplification
in terms of formulation as it eliminates the need for identifying the independent elastic constants,
a task which can become particularly cumbersome as higher-order terms in the strain energy density
function are incorporated. We validate our constitutive model by computing (1) the stress and (2)
the elastic stability limit for a set of homogeneous finite deformations --- comprising uniaxial
stretch/stress along the armchair, and the zigzag directions; and equi-biaxial tension. The stress
values predicted by the model are in good agreement with the directly-calculated \textit{ab initio}
values. The elastic stability limits predicted by acoustic tensor analysis compare well with the
predictions from phonon calculations carried out independently using linear response density
functional perturbation theory.
