High-centrality nodes have disproportionate influence on the behavior of a network; therefore
controlling such nodes can efficiently steer the system to a desired state. Existing multiplex
centrality measures typically rank nodes assuming the layers are qualitatively similar. Many
real systems, however, are comprised of networks heterogeneous in nature, for example, social
networks may have both agnostic and affiliative layers. Here, we use rank aggregation methods to
identify intervention targets in multiplex networks when the structure, the dynamics, and our
intervention goals are qualitatively different for each layer. Our approach is to rank the nodes
separately in each layer considering their different function and desired outcome, and then we
use Borda count or Kemeny aggregation to identify a consensus ranking - top nodes in the consensus
ranking are expected to effectively balance the competing goals simultaneously among all layers.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of consensus ranking, we apply our method to a degree-based node
removal procedure such that we aim to destroy the largest component in some layers, while maintaining
large-scale connectivity in others. For any multi-objective intervention, optimal targets only
exist in the Pareto-sense; we, therefore, use a weighted generalization of consensus ranking to
investigate the trade-off between the competing objectives. We use a collection of model and real
networks to systematically investigate how this trade-off is affected by multiplex network structure.
We use the copula representation of the multiplex centrality distributions to generate model multiplex
networks with given rank correlations. This allows use to separately manipulate the marginal centrality
distribution of each layer and the interdependence between the layers and to independently investigate
the role of the two using both analytical and numerical methods.
