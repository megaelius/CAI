Exact expressions are derived for the intermediate scattering function (ISF) of a quantum particle
diffusing in a harmonic potential and linearly coupled to a harmonic bath. The results are valid
for arbitrary strength and spectral density of the coupling. The general, exact non-Markovian
result is expressed in terms of the classical velocity autocorrelation function, which represents
an accumulated phase during a scattering event. The imaginary part of the exponent of the ISF is proportional
to the accumulated phase, which is an antisymmetric function of the correlation time $t$. The expressions
extend previous results given in the quantum Langevin framework where the classical response of
the bath was taken as Markovian. For a special case of non-Markovian friction, where the friction
kernel decays exponentially in time rather than instantaneously, we provide exact results relating
to unconfined quantum diffusion, and identify general features that allow insight to be exported
to more complex examples. The accumulated phase as a function of the t has a universal gradient at
the origin, depending only on the mass of the diffusing system particle. At large t the accumulated
phase reaches a constant limit that depends only on the classical diffusion coefficient and is therefore
independent of the detailed memory properties of the friction kernel. Non-Markovian properties
of the friction kernel are encoded in the details of how the accumulated phase switches from its $t\rightarrow
-\infty$ to its $t\rightarrow -\infty$ limit, subject to the constraint of the universal gradient.
When memory effects are significant, the transition from one limit to the other becomes non-monotonic,
owing to oscillations in the classical velocity autocorrelation. The result is interpreted in
terms of a solvent caging effect, in which slowly fluctuating bath modes create transient wells
for the system particle.
