Quantum Szilard engine constitutes an adequate interplay of thermodynamics, information theory
and quantum mechanics. Szilard engines are in general operated by a Maxwell's Demon where Landauer's
principle resolves the apparent paradoxes. Here we propose a Szilard engine setup without featuring
an explicit Maxwell's demon. In a demonless Szilard engine, the acquisition of which-side information
is not required, but erasure and the related heat dissipation still take place implicitly by the
very nature of the work extraction process. We see that the insertion of the partition in a quantum
Szilard engine does not localize the particle to one side, instead it creates a superposition state
of the particle being in both sides. To be able to extract work from the system, particle has to be localized
at one side. The localization occurs as a result of quantum measurement on the particle, which shows
the importance of the measurement process regardless of whether one uses the acquired information
or not. In accordance with the Landauer's principle, localization by quantum measurement corresponds
to a logically irreversible operation and for this reason it has to be accompanied by the corresponding
heat dissipation. This shows the validity of the Landauer's principle even in quantum Szilard engines
without Maxwell's demon. Furthermore, we take quantum confinement effects fully into account
to analyze the Szilard cycle in the quantum regime thoroughly and obtain highly accurate analytical
expressions for work and heat exchanges. Our results show that Landauer's principle holds the key
role to understand the thermodynamics of the localization of the particle by quantum measurement,
which explicitly saves the second law in demonless engines and shows that quantum-mechanical considerations
are essential to reconcile thermodynamics and information theory.
