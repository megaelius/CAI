The incidence of topology on the band structure and physical properties of layered compounds has
been extensively studied in semimetals. How those evolve in presence of electronic correlations
has been less investigated so far. In the sodium cobaltates NaxCoO2 considered here, unexpected
magnetic properties associated with correlations on the Co sites have been disclosed about 15 years
ago. The distinct Na orders of the stable phases of these cobaltates have been shown to induce specific
Co charge disproportionation with large size unit cells in the CoO2 planes, linked with the diverse
magnetic behaviors. This provides an original playground in the studies of interplays between
topology and correlations in these layered materials. We present here transport measurements
on a series of single crystals and demonstrate that we do synthetize pure phases with quite reproducible
transport properties. We show that above room T those display a similar behavior whatever the Na
content. On the contrary we provide evidence for a great diversity in Hall effect low temperature
dependences which underlines the specificities of the Fermi Surface reconstructions induced
by the Na order. We study in some detail the difference between two metallic phases, one (x = 0.77)
antiferromagnetic below TN = 22 K and the second (x = 2/3) paramagnetic down to T = 0. Both show a sign
change in the Hall effect with decreasing T. We demonstrate that this can be attributed to quite distinct
physical effects. For the x = 0.77 phase the negative Hall effect occurs in similar conditions to
the anomalous Hall effect found in various magnetic metals. In the x = 2/3 phase have to be assigned
to specificities of its Fermi surface. In both cases the anomalies detected in the Hall effect are
certainly associated with the topology of their Co electronic bands.
