Additive manufacturing has revolutionized the building of materials direct from design, allowing
high resolution rapid prototyping in complex 3D designs with many materials. 3D printing hasenabled
high strength damage-tolerant structures, bioprinted artificial organs and tissues, ultralight
metals, medicine, education, prosthetics, architecture, consumer electronics,and as a prototyping
tool for engineers and hobbyists alike. 3D printing has emerged as a useful tool for complex electrode
and material assembly method for batteries and supercapacitors in recent years. The field initially
grew from extrusion-based methods such as fused deposition modelling, and evolved to photopolymerization
printing of intricate composites, while supercapacitor technologies less sensitive to solvents
more often involved material jetting processes. Underpinning every part of a 3D printable battery
and many other devices is the printing method and the nature of the feed material. Material purity,
printing fidelity, accuracy, complexity, and the ability to form conductive, ceramic, glassy,
or solvent-stable plastics relies on the nature of the feed material or composite to such an extent,
that the future of 3D printable batteries and electrochemical energy storage devices will depend
on materials and printing methods that are co-operatively informed by the requirements of the device
and how it is fabricated. In this Perspective, we address the materials and methods requirements
in 3D printable batteries and supercapacitors and outline requirements for the future of the field
by linking existing performance limitations to the requirements of printable energy storage materials,
casing materials and the direct printing of electrodes and electrolytes. We also look to the future
by taking inspiration from additive manufacturing, to posit links between materials and printing
methods to allow new form factor cells.
