Water vapor condensation is common in nature and widely used in industrial applications, including
water harvesting, power generation, and desalination. As compared to traditional filmwise condensation,
dropwise condensation on lubricant-infused surfaces (LIS) can lead to an order-of-magnitude
increase in heat transfer rates. Small droplets (with the diameter below 100 $\mu$m) account for
nearly 85 percent of the total heat transfer and droplet sweeping plays a crucial role in clearing
nucleation sites, allowing for frequent re-nucleation. Here, we focus on the dynamic interplay
of microdroplets with the thin lubricant film during water vapor condensation on LIS. Coupling
high-speed imaging, optical microscopy, and interferometry, we show that the initially uniform
lubricant film re-distributes during condensation. Governed by lubricant height gradients,
microdroplets as small as 2 $\mu$m in diameter undergo rigorous and gravity-independent self-propulsion,
travelling distances multiples of their diameters at velocities up to 1100 $\mu$m/s. Although
macroscopically the movement appears to be random, we show that on a microscopic level capillary
attraction due to asymmetrical lubricant menisci causes this gravity-independent droplet motion.
Based on a lateral force balance analysis, we quantitatively find that the sliding velocity initially
increases during movement, but decreases sharply at shorter inter-droplet spacing. The maximum
sliding velocity is inversely proportional to the oil viscosity and is strongly dependent of the
droplet size, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental observations. This novel and
non-traditional droplet movement is expected to significantly enhance the sweeping efficiency
during dropwise condensation, leading to higher nucleation and heat transfer rates.
