Recent progress in experimental techniques has enabled us to quantitatively study stochastic
and flexible behavior of biological systems. For example, gene regulatory networks perform stochastic
information processing and their functionalities have been extensively studied. In gene regulatory
networks, there are specific subgraphs called network motifs that occur at frequencies much higher
than those found in randomized networks. Further understanding of the designing principle of such
networks is highly desirable. In a different context, information thermodynamics has been devel-
oped as a theoretical framework that generalizes non-equilibrium thermodynamics to stochastically
fluctuating systems with information. Here we systematically characterize gene regulatory networks
on the basis of information thermodynamics. We model three-node gene regulatory patterns by a stochastic
Boolean model, which receive one or two input signals that carry external information. For the case
of a single input, we found that all the three-node patterns are classified into four types by using
information-thermodynamic quantities such as dissipation and mutual information, and reveal
to which type each network motif belongs. Next, we consider the case where there are two inputs, and
evaluate the capacity of logical operation of the three-node patterns by using tripartite mutual
information, and argue the reason why patterns with fewer edges are preferred in natural selection.
This result may also explain the difference of the occurrence frequencies among different types
of feedforward-loop network motifs, and therefore suggests a guiding principle of the network
formation.
