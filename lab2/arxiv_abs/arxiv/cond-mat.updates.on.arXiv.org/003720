Coarse-grained (CG) models are often parametrized to reproduce one-dimensional structural correlation
functions of an atomically-detailed model along the degrees of freedom governing each interaction
potential. While cross correlations between these degrees of freedom inform the optimal set of
interaction parameters, the correlations generated from the higher-resolution simulations
are often too complex to act as an accurate proxy for the CG correlations. Instead, the most popular
methods determine the interaction parameters iteratively, while assuming that individual interactions
are uncorrelated. While these iterative methods have been validated for a wide range of systems,
they also have disadvantages when parametrizing models for multi-component systems or when refining
previously established models to better reproduce particular structural features. In this work,
we propose two distinct approaches for the direct (i.e., non-iterative) parametrization of a CG
model by adjusting the high-resolution cross correlations of an atomistic model in order to more
accurately reflect correlations that will be generated by the resulting CG model. The derived models
more accurately describe the low-order structural features of the underlying AA model, while necessarily
generating inherently distinct cross correlations compared with the atomically-detailed reference
model. We demonstrate the proposed methods for a one-site-per-molecule representation of liquid
water, where pairwise interactions are incapable of reproducing the true tetrahedral solvation
structure. We then investigate the precise role that distinct cross-correlation features play
in determining the correct pair correlation functions, evaluating the importance of the placement
of correlation features as well as the balance between features appearing in different solvation
shells.
