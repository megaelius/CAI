The harmonic Kanzaki-Krivoglaz-Khachaturyan model of strain-induced interaction is generalized
to concentrated size-mismatched alloys and adapted to first-principles calculations. The configuration
dependence of both Kanzaki forces and force constants is represented by real-space cluster expansions
that can be constructed based on the calculated forces. The model is implemented for the fcc lattice
and applied to Cu$_{1-x}$Au$_x$ and Fe$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$ alloys for concentrations $x=0.25$, 0.5,
and 0.75. The asymmetry between the $3d$ and $5d$ elements leads to large quadratic terms in the occupation-number
expansion of the Kanzaki forces and thereby to strongly non-pairwise long-range interaction.
The main advantage of the full configuration-dependent lattice deformation model is its ability
to capture this singular many-body interaction. The roles of ordering striction and anharmonicity
in Cu-Au and Fe-Pt alloys are assessed. Although the harmonic force constants defined with respect
to the unrelaxed lattice are unsuitable for the calculation of the vibrational entropies, the phonon
spectra for ordered and disordered alloys are found to be in good agreement with experimental data.
The model is further adapted to concentration wave analysis and Monte Carlo simulations by means
of an auxiliary multi-parametric real-space cluster expansion, which is used to find the ordering
temperatures. Good agreement with experiment is found for all systems except CuAu$_3$ (due to the
known failure of the generalized gradient approximation) and FePt$_3$, where the discrepancy
is likely due to the neglect of magnetic disorder.
