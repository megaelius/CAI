Split-pulse x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy has been proposed as one of the unique capabilities
made possible with the x-ray free electron lasers. It enables characterization of atomic scale
structural dynamics that dictates the macroscopic properties of various disordered material
systems. Central to the experimental concept are x-ray optics that are capable of splitting individual
coherent femtosecond x-ray pulse into two distinct pulses, introduce an adjustable time delay
between them, and then recombine the two pulses at the sample position such that they generate two
coherent scattering patterns in rapid succession. Recent developments in such optics showed that,
while true 'amplitude splitting' optics at hard x-ray wavelengths remains a technical challenge,
wavefront and wavelength splitting are both feasible, able to deliver two micron sized focused
beams to the sample with sufficient relative stability. Here, we however show that the conventional
approach to speckle visibility spectroscopy using these beam splitting techniques can be problematic,
even leading to a decoupling of speckle visibility and material dynamics. In response, we discuss
the details of the experimental approaches and data analysis protocols for addressing issues caused
by subtle beam dissimilarities for both wavefront and wavelength splitting setups. We also show
that in some scattering geometries, the Q-space mismatch can be resolved by using two beams of slightly
different incidence angle and slightly different wavelengths at the same time. Instead of measuring
the visibility of weak speckle patterns, the time correlation in sample structure is encoded in
the 'side band' of the spatial autocorrelation of the summed speckle patterns, and can be retrieved
straightforwardly from the experimental data. We demonstrate this with a numerical simulation.
