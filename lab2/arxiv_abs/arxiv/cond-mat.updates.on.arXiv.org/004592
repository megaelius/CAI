In previous studies, we have reported that double perovskite La2NiMnO6 presents a non-negligible
potential for room temperature magnetocaloric tasks. With the aim of improving even further the
cooling performances and the working temperature range of double perovskites, we report the magnetic
and magnetocaloric properties of La2MnFeO6 and ALaMnFeO6 (A = Sr, Ba, Ca) compounds. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and Rietveld refinement show that La2MnFeO6 (LMFO) and CaLaMnFeO6 (CLMFO) samples crystallize
in an orthorhombic structure with the Pnma space group. However, a rhombohedral structure with
the R3C space group is obtained for BaLaMnFeO6 (BLMFO) and SrLaMnFeO6 (SLMFO) samples. Substituting
La by Ba or Sr in LMFO leads to a clear increase of the Curie temperature (Tc) compared to LMFO from 150
K for BLMFO up to 350 K for SLMFO. Moreover, CLMFO shows the smallest Tc down to 70 K. Ferromagnetic-like
behavior is observed for SLMFO and BLMFO while CLMFO's magnetism resembles that of LMFO. A clear
connection between the structural parameters and the magnetic properties of these doped LMFO samples
is unveiled as the highest Tc and the largest magnetization are observed for SLMFO which shows also
bond angles closest to 180{\deg} and the smallest bond lengths, thus optimizing the superexchange
interaction. The partial substitution of Sr for La leads in fact to a significant magnetocaloric
effect over a wide operating temperature range extending beyond 300 K. For some optimal growth conditions,
its entropy change varies slowly over an unusually large temperature range, which is of clear interest
from a practical point of view.
