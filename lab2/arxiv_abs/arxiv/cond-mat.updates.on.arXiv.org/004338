Long-range and fast transport of coherent excitons is important for development of high-speed
excitonic circuits and quantum computing applications. However, most of these coherent excitons
have only been observed in some low-dimensional semiconductors when coupled with cavities, as
there are large inhomogeneous broadening and dephasing effects on the exciton transport in their
native states of the materials. Here, by confining coherent excitons at the 2D quantum limit, we
firstly observed molecular aggregation enabled super-transport of excitons in atomically thin
two-dimensional (2D) organic semiconductors between coherent states, with a measured a high effective
exciton diffusion coefficient of 346.9 cm2/sec at room temperature. This value is one to several
orders of magnitude higher than the reported values from other organic molecular aggregates and
low-dimensional inorganic materials. Without coupling to any optical cavities, the monolayer
pentacene sample, a very clean 2D quantum system (1.2 nm thick) with high crystallinity (J type aggregation)
and minimal interfacial states, showed superradiant emissions from the Frenkel excitons, which
was experimentally confirmed by the temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) emission,
highly enhanced radiative decay rate, significantly narrowed PL peak width and strongly directional
in-plane emission. The coherence in monolayer pentacene samples was observed to be delocalized
over 135 molecules, which is significantly larger than the values (a few molecules) observed from
other organic thin films. In addition, the super-transport of excitons in monolayer pentacene
samples showed highly anisotropic behaviour. Our results pave the way for the development of future
high-speed excitonic circuits, fast OLEDs, and other opto-electronic devices.
