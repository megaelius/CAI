\textit{Ab-initio} calculations based on density functional theory with local spin density approximation
are used to study defects-driven magnetism in bulk $\alpha$-Li$ _{3}$N. Our calculations show
that bulk Li$ _{3} $N is a non-magnetic semiconductor. Two types of Li vacancies (Li-I and Li-II)
are considered, and Li-vacancies (either Li-I or Li-II type) can induce magnetism in Li$ _{3}$N
with a total magnetic moment of 1.0 $\mu_{\rm B}$ which arises mainly due to partially occupied N-$p$-orbitals
around the Li vacancies. The defect formation energies dictate that Li-II vacancy, which is in the
Li$ _{2}$N plane, is thermodynamically more stable as compared with Li-I vacancy. The electronic
structures of Li-vacancies show half-metallic behavior. On the other hand N-vacancy does not induce
magnetism and has a larger formation energy than Li-vacancies. N vacancy derived bands at the Fermi
energy are mainly contributed by the Li atoms. Carbon is also doped at Li-I and Li-II sites, and it
is expected that doping C at Li-I site is thermodynamically more stable as compared with Li-II site.
Carbon can induce metallicity with zero magnetic moment when doped at Li-I site, whereas magnetism
is observed when Li-II site is occupied by the C impurity atom and C-driven magnetism is spread over
the N atoms as well. Carbon can also induce half-metallic magnetism when doped at N site in Li$ _{3}$N,
and has a smaller defect formation energy as compared with Li-II site doping. The ferromagnetic
(FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between the C atoms is also investigated, and we conclude
that FM state is more stable than the AFM state.
