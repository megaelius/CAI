Broken symmetries in topological condensed matter systems have implications for the spectrum
of Fermionic excitations confined on surfaces or topological defects. The Fermionic spectrum
of confined (quasi-2D) $^3$He-A consists of branches of chiral edge states. The negative energy
states are related to the ground-state angular momentum, $L_z = (N/2) \hbar$, for $N/2$ Cooper pairs.
The power law suppression of the angular momentum, $L_z(T) \simeq (N/2)\,\hbar\,[1 - \frac{2}{3}(\pi
T/\Delta)^2 ]$ for $0 \le T \ll T_c$, in the fully gapped 2D chiral A-phase reflects the thermal excitation
of the chiral edge Fermions. We discuss the effects of wave function overlap, and hybridization
between edge states confined near opposing surfaces on the edge currents, ground-state angular
momentum and ground-state order parameter. Under strong lateral confinement, the chiral A phase
undergoes a sequence of phase transitions, first to a pair density wave (PDW) phase with broken translational
symmetry at $D_{c2} \approx 16 \xi_0$. The PDW phase is described by a periodic array of chiral domains
with alternating chirality, separated by domain walls. The period of PDW phase diverges as the confinement
length $D\rightarrow D_{c_2}$. The PDW phase breaks time-reversal symmetry, translation invariance,
but is invariant under the combination of time-reversal and translation by a one-half period of
the PDW. The mass current distribution of the PDW phase reflects this combined symmetry, and orignates
from the spectra of edge Fermions and the chiral branches bound to the domain walls. Under sufficiently
strong confinement a second-order transition occurs to the non-chiral "polar phase" at $D_{c1}
\approx 9\xi_0$, in which a single p-wave orbital state of Cooper pairs is aligned along the channel.
