We investigate the low temperature transport in 8 nm diameter Si junctionless nanowire field effect
transistors fabricated by top down techniques with a wrap-around gate and two different activated
doping densities. First we extract the intrinsic gate capacitance of the device geometry from a
device that shows Coulomb blockade at 13 mK with over 500 Coulomb peaks across a gate voltage range
of 6 V indicating the formation of a single island in the entire nanowire channel. In two other devices,
doped Si:P $4\times10^{19}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ and $2\times10^{20}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, we observe
quantum interference and use the extracted gate coupling to determine the dominant energy scale
and the corresponding mean-free paths. For the higher doped device the analysis yields a mean free
path of $4\pm2\,\text{nm}$, which is on the order of the average dopant spacing and suggests scattering
on unactivated or activated dopants. For the device with an activated dopant density of $4\times10^{19}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$
the quantum interference effects suggest a mean free path of $10\pm2\,\text{nm}$, which is comparable
to the nanowire width, and thus quasi-ballistic transport. A temperature dependent analysis of
Universal Conductance Fluctuations suggests a coherence length above the nanowire length for
temperatures below 1.9 K and decoherence from 1D electron-electron interactions for higher temperatures.
The mobility is limited by scattering on impurities rather than the expected surface roughness
scattering for nanowires with diameters larger or comparable to the Fermi wavelength. Our measurements
therefore provide insight into the performance limitations from dominant scattering and dephasing
mechanisms in technologically relevant silicon device geometries.
