This work deals with the effect of the contact location distribution on the crushing of granular
materials. At first, a simple drop weight experiment was designed in order to study the effect of
the location of three contact edges on the fracture pattern and the strength of a model cylindrical
particle. The sample was placed on two bottom contact edges symmetrically distributed with reference
to the vertical symmetry plane of the particle and subjected to an impact at the top. Angle $\alpha$
between the plane connecting a bottom contact edge to the centerline of the cylinder and a vertical
plane was varied. The energy required to fracture the particle was shown to be an increasing function
of angle $\alpha$. Peculiar crack patterns were also observed. Then, we present a discrete model
of grain fracture based on the work of Neveu et al. (2016) and employ it for a numerical analysis of
the problem. The cylindrical particle is discretized by means of a space filling Vorono\"i tessellation,
and submitted to a compression test for different values of angle $\alpha$. In agreement with experiments,
simulations predict a strong effect of the contact orientation on the strength of the particle as
well as similar fracture patterns. The effect of the number of contacts is also explored and the importance
of a potential pre-load is emphasized. We show that the fracture pattern: (i) is diametrical in case
of diametrically opposed edges, (ii) has an inverted Y-shape in the case of three or four edges. Interestingly,
in the latter case, if one of the lateral edges is slightly shifted, the fracture initiates and even
propagates diametrically. Furthermore, the particle strength increases with the number of contacts.
