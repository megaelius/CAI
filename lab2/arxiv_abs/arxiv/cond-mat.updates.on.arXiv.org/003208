We study Euler scale hydrodynamics of massless integrable quantum field theories interpolating
between two non-trivial renormalisation group fixed points after inhomogeneous quantum quenches.
Using a partitioning protocol with left and right initial thermal states and the recently developed
framework of generalised hydrodynamics, we focus on current and density profiles for the energy
and momentum as a function of \xi = x=t, where both x and t are sent to infinity. Studying the first few
members of the An and Dn massless flows we carry out a systematic treatment of these series and generalise
our results to other unitary massless models. In our analysis we find that the profiles exhibit extended
plateaux and that non-trivial bounds exist for the energy and momentum densities and currents in
the non-equilibrium stationary state, i.e. when \xi = 0. To quantify the magnitude of currents and
densities, dynamical central charges are defined and it is shown that the dynamical central charge
for the energy current satisfies a certain monotonicity property. We discuss the connection of
the Landauer-Buttiker formalism of transport with our results and show that this picture can account
for some of the bounds for the currents and for the monotonicity of the dynamical central charge.
These properties are shown to be present not only in massless flows but also in the massive sinh-Gordon
model suggesting their general validity and the correctness of the Landauer-Buttiker interpretation
of transport in integrable field theories. Our results thus imply the existence of a non-equilibrium
c-theorem as well, at least in integrable models. Finally we also study the interesting low energy
behaviour of the A2 model that corresponds to the massless flow from the tricritical to the critical
Ising field theory.
