Often in bacterial regulatory networks, small noncoding RNAs (sRNA) interact with several mRNA
species. The competition among mRNAs for binding to the same pool of sRNA might lead to crosstalk
between the mRNAs. This is similar to the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) effect wherein the competition
to bind to the same pool of miRNA in Eukaryotes leads to miRNA mediated crosstalk resulting in subtle
and complex gene regulation with stabilised gene expression. We study an sRNA-driven feedforward
loop (sFFL) where the top-tier regulator, an sRNA (RprA), translationally activates the target
protein (RicI) directly and also, indirectly, via up-regulation of its transcriptional activator
(RpoS/sigma^s). We show that the sRNA-mediated crosstalk between the two mRNA species leads to
maximum target protein synthesis for low synthesis rates of RpoS-mRNA. This indicates the possibility
of an optimal target protein synthesis with efficient utilisation of RpoS-mRNA which is typically
associated with various other stress response activities inside the cell. Since gene expression
is inherently stochastic due to the probabilistic nature of various molecular interactions associated
with it, we next quantify the fluctuations in the target protein level using generating function-based
approach and stochastic simulations. The coefficient of variation that provides a measure of fluctuations
in the concentration shows a minimum under conditions that also correspond to optimal target protein
synthesis. This prompts us to conclude that, in sFFL, the crosstalk leads to optimal target protein
synthesis with minimal noise and efficient utilisation of RpoS-mRNA.
