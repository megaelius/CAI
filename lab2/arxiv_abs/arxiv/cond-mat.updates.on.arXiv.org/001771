We propose and study a parafermionic generalization of the topological Kondo effect. The latter
has been predicted to arise for a Coulomb-blockaded mesoscopic topological superconductor (Majorana
box), where at least three normal leads are tunnel-coupled to different Majorana zero modes on the
box. The Majorana states represent a quantum impurity spin that is partially screened due to cotunneling
processes between leads, with a stable non-Fermi liquid ground state. Our theory studies a generalization
where (i) Majorana states are replaced by topologically protected parafermionic zero modes, (ii)
charging effects again define a spin-like quantum impurity on the resulting parafermion box, and
(iii) normal leads are substituted by fractional edge states. In this multi-terminal problem,
different fractional edge leads couple only via the parafermion box. We show that although the linear
conductance tensor exhibits similar behavior as in the Majorana case, both at weak and strong coupling,
our parafermionic generalization is actually not a Kondo problem but defines a rich new class of
quantum impurity problems. At the strong-coupling fixed point, a current injected through a reference
lead will be isotropically partitioned into outgoing currents in all other leads, together with
a universal negative current scattered into the reference lead. The device can thus be operated
as current extractor, where the current partitioning is noiseless at the fixed point. We describe
a fractional quantum Hall setup proximitized by superconductors and ferromagnets, which could
allow for an experimental realization in the near future.
