Solid-state cooling is an environmentally friendly and highly scalable technology that may solve
most of the problems associated with current refrigerant methods. Solid-state cooling consists
of applying external fields on caloric materials, which react thermally as a result of induced phase
transformations. From an energy efficiency point of view, mechanocaloric compounds, in which
the phase transitions of interest are driven by mechanical stresses, probably represent the most
encouraging type of caloric materials. Conventional mechanocaloric materials like shape-memory
alloys already display good cooling performances however in most cases they also present critical
mechanical fatigue and hysteresis problems that limit their applicability. Finding new mechanocaloric
materials and mechanisms able to overcome those problems while simultaneously rendering large
temperature shifts, is necessary to further advance the field of solid-state cooling. In this article,
we review novel families of mechanocaloric materials that in recent years have been shown to be specially
promising in the aspects that conventional mechanocaloric materials are not, and which exhibit
unconventional but significant caloric effects. We put an emphasis on elastocaloric materials,
in which the targeted cooling spans are obtained through uniaxial stresses, since from an applied
perspective these appear to be the most accomplished. Two different types of mechanocaloric materials
emerge as particularly hopeful from our analysis, compounds that exhibit field-induced order
disorder phase transitions involving either ions or molecules (fast-ion conductors and plastic
crystals), and multiferroics in which the structural parameters are strongly coupled with polar
and/or magnetic degrees of freedom (magnetic alloys and oxide perovskites).
