In different materials, orientationally controlled assembling of building blocks results in
the development of nanoparticles and particles of geometrical shapes. These trends are pronounced
in atoms of metallic behavior. In the developmental process of nanoparticles and particles, atoms
organize in monolayer assembly at first place. At air/solution interface, when triangle-shaped
packets of nano-energy were supplied to atoms of compact monolayer assembly, they bound in the shape
and size of nano-energy. Blocks of joined triangular shaped tiny particles developed when tuned
bipolar pulses were examined. On the exertion of uneven force to electrons of atoms at contact point,
their block of joined tiny-sized particles separated into two tiny particles of equilateral triangular
shape. On electronically flat solution surface, atoms of tiny particles in re-crystallization
state elongate at equal rate. From the centre of each transitional behavior atom, electrons of east-west
poles deal with the even exertion of surface force along with their opposite poles. Thus, arrays
of bound atoms formed a tiny-shaped particle developed in its structures of smooth elements. Such
structures of smooth elements flatten by the forced energy of traveled photons along the air/solution
interface. Originally, binding of solid atoms in neutral state is to be anticipated under the execution
of confined inter-state electron dynamics, where they possess ground point below the typical level
of ground surface. Nevertheless, such developed tiny particles come from suitable zones of solution
surface; they pack through the assembling of their structures of smooth elements to develop a shaped
mono layer of developing nanoparticle or particle in geometrical shape. In solution surface, a
shaped mono layer adheres to the underneath shaped mono layer in gap of a few microseconds...
