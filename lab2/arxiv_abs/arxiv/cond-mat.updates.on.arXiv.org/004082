Grain boundary tracer diffusion of Ni, Fe and Cr was studied in a Ni-base 602CA coarse-grained alloy.
A co-existence of several short-circuit contributions was distinguished at higher temperatures
in Harrison's B-type regime (773-873 K), which were related to different families of high-angle
grain boundaries with distinct coverages by precipitates and segregation levels as revealed by
HAADF-STEM combined with EDX measurements. Annealing at 873 K for 18 hours resulted in Cr23C6-type
carbides coexisting with an \alpha-Cr-Mn-enriched phase in addition to sequential segregation
layers of Al, Fe and Ni around them. Curved and hackly grain boundaries showed a high density of plate-like
carbides, whereas straight grain boundaries were composed of globular carbides with similar chemical
composition variations and additionally with alternating layers of Cr and Ni in between the carbides,
similar to microstructures after a spinodal decomposition. At lower temperatures, discontinuous
interfaces with Cr and Cr-carbide enrichment dominated and the alloy annealed at 403 K for 72 hours
contained plate-like Cr23C6-type carbides surrounded by a Ni-rich layer around them. The Ni grain
boundary diffusion rates at these relatively low temperatures (formally belonging to C-type kinetics)
showed an anomalous character being almost temperature independent. This specific diffusion
behaviour was explained by a concomitant relaxation of transformation-induced elastic strains
occurring on a longer time scale with respect to grain boundary diffusion. Thermodynamic insights
into the probable mechanism of decomposition at grain boundaries are provided.
