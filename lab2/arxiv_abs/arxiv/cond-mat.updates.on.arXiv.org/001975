We present a general methodology towards the systematic characterization of crystalline topological
insulating phases with time reversal symmetry (TRS). In particular, taking the two-dimensional
spinful hexagonal lattice as a proof of principle we study windings of Wilson loop spectra over cuts
in the Brillouin zone that are dictated by the underlying lattice symmetries. Our approach finds
a prominent use in elucidating and quantifying the recently proposed "topological quantum chemistry"
(TQC) concept. Namely, we prove that the split of an elementary band representation (EBR) by a band
gap must lead to a topological phase. For this we first show that in addition to the Fu-Kane-Mele $\mathbb{Z}_2$
classification, there is an obstructed $\mathbb{Z}$-type classification protected by crystalline
symmetries and TRS that accounts for all nontrivial Wilson loop windings of split EBRs. Then, by
systematically embedding all combinatorial four-band phases into six-band phases, we find a refined
topological feature of split EBRs. Namely, we show that while Wilson loop winding of split EBRs can
unwind when embedded in higher-dimensional band space, two-band subspaces that remain separated
by a band gap from the other bands conserve their Wilson loop winding, hence revealing a \textit{metastable}
topology of split EBRs. This clarifies the nature of "fragile topology" that has appeared very recently.
We then argue that in the many-band limit the stable Wilson loop winding is only determined by the
Fu-Kane-Mele $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant implying that further stable topological phases must
belong to the class of higher-order topological insulators.
