Noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) have recently attracted a lot of attention owing to the potential
emergence of exotic spin orders on geometrically frustrated lattices, which can be characterized
by corresponding spin chiralities. By performing first-principles density functional calculations
together with group-theory analysis and tight-binding modelling, here we systematically study
the spin-order dependent anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and magneto-optical effect (MOE) in representative
noncollinear AFMs Mn$_{3}X$N ($X$ = Ga, Zn, Ag, and Ni). The symmetry-related tensor shape of the
intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (IAHC) for different spin orders is determined by analyzing
the relevant magnetic point groups. We show that while only the ${xy}$ component of the IAHC tensor
is nonzero for right-handed spin chirality, all other elements, $\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{yz}$,
and $\sigma_{zx}$, are nonvanishing for a state with left-handed spin chirality owing to lowering
of the symmetry. Our tight-binding arguments reveal that the magnitude of IAHC relies on the details
of the band structure and that $\sigma_{xy}$ is periodically modulated as the spin rotates in-plane.
The IAHC obtained from first principles is found to be rather large, e.g., it amounts to 359 S/cm in
Mn$_{3}$AgN. By extending our analysis to finite frequencies, we calculate the optical isotropy
[$\sigma_{xx}(\omega)\approx\sigma_{yy}(\omega)\approx\sigma_{zz}(\omega)$] and the
magneto-optical anisotropy [$\sigma_{xy}(\omega)\neq\sigma_{yz}(\omega)\neq\sigma_{zx}(\omega)$]
of Mn$_{3}X$N. We argue that the spin-order dependent AHE and MOE are indispensable in detecting
complex spin structures in noncollinear AFMs.
