We have investigated a new cubic spinel LiZn$_{2}$V$_{3}$O$_{8}$ which crystallizes in the $\mathit{Fd\bar{\mathrm{3}}m}$
space group. From a Curie-Weiss fit of the susceptibility $\chi_{\mathrm{dc}}$($\mathit{T}$)
data, we obtained the Curie-Weiss temperature $\mathrm{\theta}_{\mathrm{CW}}$ = -185 K. This
suggests strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations among the magnetic ions. In low fields,
the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization data show bifurcation below
$T\mathrm{_{f}}$ $\backsimeq$ 3 K, indicating spin-glass behaviour which is evident from the
frequency dependence of the ac susceptibility ($\chi_{\mathrm{ac}}^{'}$) and the Vogel-Fulcher
law fitting of the freezing temperatures $\mathit{T_{\mathrm{f}}}$. The low value of the characteristic
frequency $\omega_{0}$ $\approx$ 3.56$\times$10$^{6}$ Hz and the critical time $\tau_{0}$ $\approx$
1.82$\times$10$^{-6}$ s confirms the formation of clusters in the spin-glass ground state. We
observed ageing phenomena and memory effects both in ZFC and FC modes. We found that a positive temperature
cycle erases the memory, as predicted by the hierarchical model. In heat capacity measurements,
we did not observe any sharp anomaly indicative of long-range ordering down to 2 K. The entropy change
$\Delta S_{\mathrm{m}}$ is only about 25% of what is expected for LiZn$_{2}$V$_{3}$O$_{8}$ per
formula unit. This is likely due to the presence of strong frustration within the system. The $^{7}$Li
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra show a shift and broadening with decreasing temperature.
The spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation rates show anomalies due to spin freezing around 3 K as
in the bulk magnetization.
