Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are complex systems in which many genes regulate mutually to adapt
the cell state to environmental conditions. In addition to function, the GRNs possess several kinds
of robustness. This robustness means that systems do not lose their functionality when exposed
to disturbances such as mutations or noise, and is widely observed at many levels in living systems.
Both function and robustness have been acquired through evolution. In this respect, GRNs utilized
in living systems are rare among all possible GRNs. In this study, we explored the fitness landscape
of GRNs and investigated how robustness emerged in highly-fit GRNs. We considered a toy model of
GRNs with one input gene and one output gene. The difference in the expression level of the output
gene between two input states, "on" and "off", was considered as fitness. Thus, the determination
of the fitness of a GRN was based on how sensitively it responded to the input.We employed the multicanonical
Monte Carlo method, which can sample GRNs randomly in a wide range of fitness levels, and classified
the GRNs according to their fitness. The following properties were found: (1) Highly-fit GRNs exhibited
bistability for intermediate input between "on" and "off". This means that such GRNs responded
to two input states by using different fixed points of dynamics. This bistability emerges necessarily
as fitness increases. (2) These highly-fit GRNs were robust against noise because of their bistability.
In other words, noise robustness is a byproduct of high fitness. (3) GRNs that were robust against
mutations were not extremely rare among the highly-fit GRNs. This implies that mutational robustness
is readily acquired through the evolutionary process. These properties are universal irrespective
of the evolutionary pathway, because the results do not rely on evolutionary simulation.
