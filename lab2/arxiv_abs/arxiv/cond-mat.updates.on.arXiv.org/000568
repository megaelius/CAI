Symmetry relations are manifestations of fundamental principles and constitute cornerstones
of modern physics. An example are the Onsager relations between coefficients connecting thermodynamic
fluxes and forces, central to transport theory and experiments. Initially formulated for classical
systems, these reciprocity relations are also fulfilled in quantum conductors. Surprisingly,
novel relations have been predicted specifically for thermoelectric transport. However, whereas
these thermoelectric reciprocity relations have to date not been verified, they have been predicted
to be sensitive to inelastic scattering, always present at finite temperature. The question whether
the relations exist in practice is important for thermoelectricity: whereas their existence may
simplify the theory of complex thermoelectric materials, their absence has been shown to enable,
in principle, higher thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency for a given material quality.
Here we experimentally verify the thermoelectric reciprocity relations in a four-terminal mesoscopic
device where each terminal can be electrically and thermally biased, individually. The linear
response thermoelectric coefficients are found to be symmetric under simultaneous reversal of
magnetic field and exchange of injection and emission contacts. Intriguingly, we also observe
the breakdown of the reciprocity relations as a function of increasing thermal bias. Our measurements
thus clearly establish the existence of the thermoelectric reciprocity relations, as well as the
possibility to control their breakdown with the potential to enhance thermoelectric performance
