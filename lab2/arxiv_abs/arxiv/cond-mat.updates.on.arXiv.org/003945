Electrically manipulating the quantum properties of nano-objects, such as atoms or molecules,
is typically done using scanning tunnelling microscopes and lateral junctions. The resulting
nanotransport path is well established in these model devices. Societal applications require
transposing this knowledge to nano-objects embedded within vertical solid-state junctions,
which can advantageously harness spintronics to address these quantum properties thanks to ferromagnetic
electrodes and high-quality interfaces. The challenge here is to ascertain the device's effective,
buried nanotransport path, and to electrically involve these nano-objects in this path by shrinking
the device area from the macro- to the nano-scale while maintaining high structural/chemical quality
across the heterostructure. We've developed a low-tech, resist- and solvent-free technological
process that can craft nanopillar devices from entire in-situ grown heterostructures, and use
it to study magnetotransport between two Fe and Co ferromagnetic electrodes across a functional
magnetic CoPc molecular layer. We observe how spin-flip transport across CoPc molecular spin chains
promotes a specific magnetoresistance effect, and alters the nanojunction's magnetism through
spintronic anisotropy. In the process, we identify three magnetic units along the effective nanotransport
path thanks to a macrospin model of magnetotransport. Our work elegantly connects the until now
loosely associated concepts of spin-flip spectroscopy, magnetic exchange bias and magnetotransport
due to molecular spin chains, within a solid-state device. We notably measure a 5.9meV energy threshold
for magnetic decoupling between the Fe layer's buried atoms and those in contact with the CoPc layer
forming the so-called 'spinterface'. This provides a first insight into the experimental energetics
of this promising low-power information encoding unit.
