Over the years attempts have been made to compensate for the inherent weaknesses in the bulk state
of the multiferroic BiFeO3, such as high leakage current and the absence of ferromagnetic correlation,
and exploit its magnetoelectric potential by forming solid solutions with other perovskites.
Studies in the recent few years have shown that alloying of BiFeO3 with BaTiO3, both with and without
additives, can induce both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic switching. While the coexistence
of both the ferroic orders is encouraging from the view point of technological applications, the
origin of ferromagnetism in this system remains elusive. Here, we synthesized such compositions
and carried out a detailed structural analysis employing magnetic separation of the powder particles.
We found that the origin of ferromagnetism lies in the spontaneous precipitation of a minor ( ~ 1 wt
%) barium hexaferrite (BaFe9O19) phase, often undetected in routine x-ray diffraction studies
of powders sampled from the entire specimen. We also demonstrate that inspite of the insignificant
fraction the ferrimagnetic phase, this self-grown composite exhibit noticeably enhanced ferroelectric
switching in the presence of external magnetic field. We obtained a dc magnetoelectric coupling
of ~ 9 x 10-8 s/m, a value which is comparable to what has been reported for layered ferroelectric/ferromagnetic
laminates and bilayer thin film ferroelectric-ferromagnetic hetrostructures. Our study suggests
that reasonably large magnetoelectric coupling is realizable in simple 0-3 ferroelectric-ferromagnetic
bulk composites provided synthesis strategies are developed which induces spontaneous precipitation
of the ferromagnetic phase in small volume fraction to ensure good insulating behaviour of the composite
thus developed.
