The \textit{Spirit} framework is designed for atomic scale spin simulations of magnetic systems
of arbitrary geometry and magnetic structure, providing a graphical user interface with powerful
visualizations and an easy to use scripting interface. An extended Heisenberg type spin-lattice
Hamiltonian including competing exchange interactions between neighbors at arbitrary distance,
higher-order exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and dipole-dipole interactions is used to describe
the energetics of a system of classical spins localised at atom positions. A variety of common simulations
methods are implemented including Monte Carlo and various time evolution algorithms based on the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion, which can be used to determine static ground state
and metastable spin configurations, sample equilibrium and finite temperature thermodynamical
properties of magnetic materials and nanostructures or calculate dynamical trajectories including
spin torques induced by stochastic temperature or electric current. Methods for finding the mechanism
and rate of thermally assisted transitions include the geodesic nudged elastic band method, which
can be applied when both initial and final states are specified, and the minimum mode following method
when only the initial state is given. The lifetime of magnetic states and rate of transitions can
be evaluated within the harmonic approximation of transition-state theory. The framework offers
performant CPU and GPU parallelizations. All methods are verified and applications to several
systems, such as vortices, domain walls, skyrmions and bobbers are described.
