This paper investigates some of the successes and failures of density functional theory in the study
of high-pressure solid hydrogen at low temperature. We calculate the phase diagram, metallization
pressure, phonon spectrum, and proton zero-point energy using three popular exchange-correlation
functionals: the local density approximation (LDA), the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized
gradient approximation, and the semi-local Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) functional. We focus
on the solid molecular P$6_3$/m, C2/c, Cmca-12, and Cmca structures in the pressure range from $100<P<500$
GPa over which phases I, II and III are observed experimentally. At the static level of theory, in
which proton zero-point energy is ignored, the LDA, PBE and BLYP functionals give very different
structural transition and metallization pressures, with the BLYP phase diagram in better agreement
with experiment. Nevertheless, all three functionals provide qualitatively the same information
about the band gaps of the four structures and the phase transitions between them. Going beyond the
static level, we find that the frequencies of the vibron modes observed above 3000 cm$^{-1}$ depend
strongly on the choice of exchange-correlation functional, although the low-frequency part of
the phonon spectrum is little affected. The largest and smallest values of the proton zero-point
energy, obtained using the BLYP and LDA functionals, respectively, differ by more than 10 meV/proton.
Including the proton zero-point energy calculated from the phonon spectrum within the harmonic
approximation improves the agreement of the BLYP and PBE phase diagrams with experiment. Taken
as a whole, our results demonstrate the inadequacy of mean-field-like density functional calculations
of solid molecular hydrogen in phases I, II and III and emphasize the need for more sophisticated
methods.
