Lithium intercalation into graphite is the foundation for the lithium-ion battery, and the thermodynamics
of the lithiation of graphitic electrodes have been heavily investigated. Intercalated lithium
in bulk graphite undergoes structural ordering known as staging to minimize electrostatic repulsions
within the crystal lattice. While this process is well-understood for bulk graphite, confinement
effects become important at the nanoscale, which can significantly impact the electrochemistry
of nanostructured electrodes. Therefore, graphene offers a model platform to study intercalation
dynamics at the nanoscale by combining on-chip device fabrication and electrochemical intercalation
with in situ characterization. We show that microscale mechanical strain significantly affects
the formation of ordered lithium phases in graphene. In situ Raman spectroscopy of graphene microflakes
mechanically constrained at the edge during lithium intercalation reveals a thickness-dependent
increase of up to 1.26 V in the electrochemical potential that induces lithium staging. While the
induced mechanical strain energy increases with graphene thickness to the fourth power, its magnitude
is small compared to the observed increase in electrochemical energy. We hypothesize that the mechanical
strain energy increases a nucleation barrier for lithium staging, greatly delaying the formation
of ordered lithium phases. Our results indicate that electrode assembly can critically impact
lithium staging dynamics important for cycling rates and power generation for batteries. We demonstrate
strain engineering in two-dimensional nanomaterials as an approach to manipulate phase transitions
and chemical reactivity.
