Although the richness of spatial symmetries has led to a rapidly expanding inventory of possible
topological crystalline (TC) phases of electrons, physical realizations have been slow to materialize
due to the practical difficulty to ascertaining band topology in realistic calculations. Here,
we integrate the recently established theory of symmetry indicators of band topology into first-principle
band-structure calculations, and test it on a databases of previously synthesized crystals. The
combined algorithm is found to efficiently unearth topological materials and predict topological
properties like protected surface states. On applying our algorithm to just 8 out of the 230 space
groups, we already discover numerous materials candidates displaying a diversity of topological
phenomena, which are simultaneously captured in a single sweep. The list includes recently proposed
classes of TC insulators that had no previous materials realization as well as other topological
phases, including: (i) a screw-protected 3D TC insulator, \b{eta}-MoTe2, with gapped surfaces
except for 1D helical "hinge" states; (ii) a rotation-protected TC insulator BiBr with coexisting
surface Dirac cones and hinge states; (iii) non-centrosymmetric Z2 topological insulators undetectable
using the well-established parity criterion, AgXO (X=Na,K,Rb); (iv) a Dirac semimetal MgBi2O6;
(v) a Dirac nodal-line semimetal AgF2; and (vi) a metal with three-fold degenerate band crossing
near the Fermi energy, AuLiMgSn. Our work showcases how the recent theoretical insights on the fundamentals
of band structures can aid in the practical goal of discovering new topological materials.
