The discovery of Fe-based superconductors (FBS) as the second class of high-temperature superconducting
transition (high-Tc) materials after the cuprates generated a significant impact on the community
of fundamental and applied superconductivity research. Whenever a new class of high-Tc superconducting
materials is discovered, a lot of effort is devoted to growing single crystals and epitaxial thin
films for exploring basic physical quantities. Although several properties of FBS are similar
to the cuprates (large upper critical fields, resulting from a short coherence lengths, and small
carrier density), others are distinctly different. For instance, in FBS the symmetry of the superconducting
order parameter is most likely not a d-wave but an s+-wave, depending on the stoichiometry, crystallographic
system, and doping level. Additionally, the critical current densities of FBS are less sensitive
to the presence of grain boundaries (GBs) than those of the high-Tc cuprates. These features are
highly beneficial for the realization of cheaper conductors for high-field magnets at low temperatures.
Indeed, several groups have demonstrated FBS thin films on technical metallic substrates and powder-in-tube
processed FBS wires as proof-of-principle studies for conductor applications. FBS on technical
substrates also give many opportunities for studying how GB networks affect the critical current
and how uniaxial strain impacts the superconducting properties. In this article, we review FBS
thin films, especially on technical metallic substrates, and focus on application-relevant properties
like pinning improvement by natural and artificial defects as well as the transparency of GBs and
GB networks. The recent development of FBS thin films on technical substrates and their superconducting
properties are presented and the performance gap with respect to films on single crystals is discussed.
