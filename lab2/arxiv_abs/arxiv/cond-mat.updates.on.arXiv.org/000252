We apply the Dynamical Mean Field (DMFT) approximation to the real, scalar phi^4 quantum field theory.
By comparing to lattice Monte Carlo calculations, perturbation theory and standard mean field
theory, we test the quality of the approximation in two, three, four and five dimensions. The quantities
considered in these tests are the critical coupling for the transition to the ordered phase and the
associated critical exponents nu and beta. We also map out the phase diagram in four dimensions.
In two and three dimensions, DMFT incorrectly predicts a first order phase transition for all bare
quartic couplings, which is problematic, because the second order nature of the phase transition
of lattice phi^4-theory is crucial for taking the continuum limit. Nevertheless, by extrapolating
the behaviour away from the phase transition, one can obtain critical couplings and critical exponents.
They differ from those of mean field theory and are much closer to the correct values. In four dimensions
the transition is second order for small quartic couplings and turns weakly first order as the coupling
increases beyond a tricritical value. In dimensions five and higher, DMFT gives qualitatively
correct results, predicts reasonable values for the critical exponents and considerably more
accurate critical couplings than standard mean field theory. The approximation works best for
small values of the quartic coupling. We investigate the change from first to second order transition
in the local limit of DMFT which is computationally much less intensive. We also discuss technical
issues related to the convergence of the non-linear self-consistency equation solver and the solution
of the effective single-site model using Fourier-space Monte Carlo updates in the presence of a
phi^4-interaction.
