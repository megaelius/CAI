In the nitrogen-incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond ((N)UNCD) films, representing an
$n$-type highly conductive two-phase material comprised of $sp^3$ diamond grains and $sp^2$-rich
graphitic grain boundaries, the current is carried by a high concentration of mobile electrons
within the large-volume grain boundary networks. Fabricated in a simple thin-film planar form,
(N)UNCD was found to be an efficient field emitter capable of emitting a significant amount of charge
starting at the applied electric field as low as a few V/$\mu$m which makes it a promising material
for designing electron sources. Despite the semimetallic conduction, field emission (FE) characteristics
of this material demonstrate a strong deviation from the Fowler-Nordheim law in a high-current-density
regime when (N)UNCD field emitters switch from a diode-like to resistor-like behavior. Such phenomenon
resembles the current-density saturation effect in conventional semiconductors. In the present
paper, we adapt the formalism developed for conventional semiconductors to study current-density
saturation in (N)UNCD field emitters. We provide a comprehensive theoretical investigation of
($i$) the influence of partial penetration of the electric field into the material, ($ii$) transport
effects (such as electric-field-dependent mobility), and ($iii$) features of a complex density-of-states
structure (position and shape of $\pi-\pi^*$ bands, controlling the concentration of charge carriers)
on the FE characteristics of (N)UNCD. We show that the formation of the current-density saturation
plateau can be explained by the limited supply of electrons within the impurity $\pi-\pi^*$ bands
and decreasing electron mobility in high electric field. Theoretical calculations are consistent
with experiment.
