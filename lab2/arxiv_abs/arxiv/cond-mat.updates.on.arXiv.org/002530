At ambient pressure CrAs undergoes a first-order transition into a double-helical magnetic state
at TN = 265 K, which is accompanied by a structural transition. The recent discovery of pressure-induced
superconductivity in CrAs makes it important to clarify the nature of quantum phase transitions
out of its coupled structural/helimagnetic order. Here we show, via neutron diffraction on the
single-crystal CrAs under hydrostatic pressure (P), that the combined order is suppressed at Pc
~ 10 kbar, near which bulk superconductivity develops with a maximal transition temperature Tc
~ 2 K. We further show that the coupled order is also completely suppressed by phosphorus doping in
CrAs1-xPx at a critical xc ~ 0.05, above which inelastic neutron scattering evidenced persistent
antiferromagnetic correlations, providing a possible link between magnetism and superconductivity.
In line with the presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations near Pc (xc), the A coefficient of the
quadratic temperature dependence of resistivity exhibits a dramatic enhancement as P (x) approaches
Pc (xc), around which Res(T) has a non-Fermi-liquid form. Accordingly, the electronic specific-heat
coefficient of CrAs1-xPx peaks out around xc. These properties provide clear evidences for quantum
criticality, which we interpret as originating from a nearly second-order helimagnetic quantum
phase transition that is concomitant with a first-order structural transition. Our findings in
CrAs highlight the distinct characteristics of quantum criticality in bad metals, thereby bringing
out new insights into the physics of unconventional superconductivity such as occurring in the
high-Tc iron pnictides.
