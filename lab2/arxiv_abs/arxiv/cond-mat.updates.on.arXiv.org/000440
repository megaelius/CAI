We develop a numerically exact scheme for resumming certain classes of Feynman diagrams in the self-consistent
perturbation expansion for the electron and magnon self-energies in the nonequilibrium Green
function formalism applied to a coupled electron-magnon (\mbox{e-m}) system which is driven out
of equilibrium by the applied finite bias voltage. Our scheme operates with the electronic and magnonic
GFs and the corresponding self-energies viewed as matrices in the Keldysh space, rather than conventionally
extracting their retarded and lesser components. This is employed to understand the effect of inelastic
\mbox{e-m} scattering on charge and spin current vs. bias voltage $V_b$ in F/I/F magnetic tunnel
junctions (MTJs), which are modeled on a one-dimensional (1D) tight-binding lattice for the electronic
subsystem and 1D Heisenberg model for the magnonic subsystem. For this purpose, we evaluate Fock
diagram for the electronic self-energy and the electron-hole polarization bubble diagram for
the magnonic self-energy. The respective electronic and magnonic GF lines within these diagrams
are the fully interacting ones, thereby requiring to solve the ensuing coupled system of nonlinear
integral equations self-consistently. Despite using the 1D model and treating \mbox{e-m} interaction
in many-body fashion only within a small active region consisting of few lattice sites around the
F/I interface, our analysis captures essential features of the so-called zero-bias anomaly observed
in both MgO- and AlO$_x$-based realistic 3D MTJs where the second derivative $d^2 I/dV_b^2$ (i.e.,
inelastic electron tunneling spectrum) of charge current exhibits sharp peaks of opposite sign
on either side of the zero bias voltage.
