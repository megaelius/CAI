Magnetic susceptibility measurements of 3-4 ML Fe/W(001) ferromagnetic films demonstrate that
this is a 2DXY system in which a finite size Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition occurs. The films
are grown in ultrahigh vacuum and their magnetic response is measured using the magneto-optic Kerr
effect (MOKE). The analysis of many independently grown films shows that the paramagnetic tail
of the susceptibility is described by $\chi(T) \sim \exp \bigr{(}B/(T/T_{KT}-1)^a\bigl{)}$,
where $a=0.50\pm0.03$ and $B=3.48\pm0.16$, in quantitative agreement with KT theory. Below the
finite size transition temperature $T_C(L)$, the behaviour is complicated by dissipation (likely
due to domain walls in the four-fold magnetic system). A subset of measurements with very small dissipation
most closely represents the idealized system treated by theory. In these, the temperature interval
between the fitted Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and the finite size transition
temperature is $T_C(L)/T_{KT} -1=0.065\pm0.016$. This yeids an estimate of the finite size affecting
the film as $L\sim \mu$m, and gives experimental support to the idea that even a mesoscopic limitation
of the vortex-antivortex gas results in a substantial finite size effect at the KT transition. In
contrast, fitting the paramagnetic tail to a power law, appropriate to a second order critical transition,
does not give reasonable results. The effective critical exponent $\gamma_{eff} \approx 3.7 \pm
0.7$ does not correspond to a known universality class, and the fitted transition temperature is
much further below the peak in the susceptibility than is reasonable.
