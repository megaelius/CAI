Microscale fluid flows generated by ensembles of beating eukaryotic flagella are crucial to fundamental
processes such as development, motility and sensing. Despite significant experimental and theoretical
progress, the underlying physical mechanisms behind this striking coordination remain unclear.
Here, we present a novel series of experiments in which the flagellar dynamics of two micropipette-held
somatic cells of Volvox carteri, with measurably different intrinsic beating frequencies, are
studied by high-speed imaging as a function of their mutual separation and orientation. From analysis
of beating time series we find that the interflagellar coupling, which is constrained by the lack
of chemical and mechanical connections between the cells to be purely hydrodynamical, exhibits
a spatial dependence that is consistent with theoretical predictions. At close spacings it produces
robust synchrony which can prevail for thousands of flagellar beats, while at increasing separations
this synchrony is systematically degraded by stochastic processes. Manipulation of the relative
flagellar orientation reveals the existence of both in-phase and antiphase synchronized states,
which is consistent with dynamical theories. Through dynamic flagellar tracking with exquisite
spatio-temporal precision, we quantify changes in beating waveforms that result from altered
coupling configuration and distance of separation. The experimental results of this study prove
unequivocally that flagella coupled solely through a fluid medium can achieve robust synchrony
despite significant differences in their intrinsic properties.
