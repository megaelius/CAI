The ground state phase diagram of a spin $S=1/2$ $XXZ$ Heisenberg chain with spatially modulated
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction $ {\cal H}= \sum_n J\left[\left(S^x_n S^x_{n+1} +S^y_n
S^y_{n+1}+\Delta S^z_n S^z_{n+1}\right)+(D_0+(-1)^n D_1)\left(S^x_n S^y_{n+1} -S^y_n S^{x}_{n+1}
\right) \right] $ is studied using the continuum-limit bosonization approach and extensive density
matrix renormalization group computations. It is shown that the effective continuum-limit bosonized
theory of the model is given by the double frequency sine-Gordon model (DSG) where the frequences
i.e. the scaling dimensions of the two competing cosine perturbation terms depend on the effective
anisotropy parameter $\gamma^*=J\Delta /\sqrt{J^2+D_0^2+D_1^2}$. Exploring the ground state
properties of the DSG model we have shown that the zero-temperature phase diagram contains the following
four phases: (i) the ferromagnetic phase at $\gamma^*<-1$; (ii) the gapless Luttinger-liquid
(LL) phase at $-1<\gamma^*< \gamma^*_{c1}=-1/\sqrt{2}$; (iii) the gapped composite (C1) phase
characterized by coexistence of the long-range-ordered (LRO) dimerization pattern $\epsilon
\sim (-1)^n (S_n S_{n+1})$ with the LRO alternating spin chirality pattern $\kappa \sim (-1)^{n}\left(S^{x}_{n}S^{y}_{n+1}
-S^{y}_{n}S^{x}_{n+1} \right)$ at $\gamma^{\ast}_{c1}<\gamma^{\ast} <\gamma^{\ast}_{c2}$;
and (iv) at $\gamma^{\ast} >\gamma^{\ast}_{c2}>1$ the gapped composite (C2) phase characterized
in addition to the coexisting spin dimerization and alternating chirality patterns, by the presence
of LRO antiferromagnetic order. The transition from the LL to the C1 phase at $\gamma^*_{c1}$ belongs
to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class, while the transition at $\gamma^*_{c2}$
from C1 to C2 phase is of the Ising type.
