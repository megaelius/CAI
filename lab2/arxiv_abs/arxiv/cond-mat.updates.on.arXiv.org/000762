We investigate the effects of Fe and Co substitutions on the phase stability of the martensitic phase,
mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties of magnetic shape memory system Mn$_{2}$NiGa
by first-principles Density functional theory(DFT) calculations. The evolution of these aspects
upon substitution of Fe and Co at different crystallographic sites are investigated by computing
the electronic structure, mechanical properties and magnetic exchange parameters. We find that
the martensitic phase of Mn$_{2}$NiGa gradually de-stabilises with increase in concentration
of Fe/Co due to the weakening of the minority spin hybridisation of Ni and Mn atoms occupying crystallographically
equivalent sites. The interplay between relative structural stability and the compositional
changes are understood from the variations in the elastic modulii and electronic structures. We
find that the elastic shear modulus C$^{\prime}$ can be considered as a predictor of composition
dependence of martensitic transformation temperature in substituted Mn$_{2}$NiGa. The magnetic
properties of Mn$_{2}$NiGa are found to be greatly improved by the substitutions due to stronger
ferromagnetic interactions in the compounds. The gradually weaker(stronger) Jahn-Teller distortion
(covalent bonding) in the minority spin densities of states due to substitutions lead to a half-metallic
like gap in these compounds resulting in materials with high spin-polarisation when the substitutions
are complete. The substitutions at the Ga site result in two new compounds Mn$_{2}$NiFe and Mn$_{2}$NiCo
with very high magnetic moments and Curie temperatures. Thus, our work indicates that although
the substitutions de-stabilise the martensitic phase in Mn$_{2}$NiGa, new magnetic materials
with very good magnetic parameters and potentially useful for novel magnetic applications can
be obtained.
