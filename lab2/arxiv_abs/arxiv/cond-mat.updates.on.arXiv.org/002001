Magnetic doping with transition metal ions is the most widely used approach to break timereversal
symmetry in a topological insulator, a prerequisite for unlocking the TIs exotic potential. Recently,
we reported the doping of Bi2Te3 thin films with rare earth ions, which, owing to their large magnetic
moments, promise commensurately large magnetic gap openings in the topological surface states.
However, only when doping with Dy has a sizable gap been observed in angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, which persists up to room-temperature. Although disorder alone could be ruled out
as a cause of the topological phase transition, a fundamental understanding of the magnetic and
electronic properties of Dy:Bi2Te3 remained elusive. Here, we present an X-ray magnetic circular
dichroism, polarized neutron reflectometry, muon spin rotation, and resonant photoemission
study of the microscopic magnetic and electronic properties. We find that the films are not simply
paramagnetic but that instead the observed behavior can be well explained by the assumption of slowly
fluctuating, inhomogeneous magnetic patches with increasing volume fraction as the temperature
decreases. At liquid helium temperatures, a large effective magnetization can be easily introduced
by the application of moderate magnetic fields, implying that this material is very suitable for
proximity coupling to an underlying ferromagnetic insulator or in a heterostructure with transition
metal-doped layers. However, the introduction of some charge carriers by the dopants cannot be
excluded at least in these highly doped samples. Nevertheless, we find that the magnetic order is
not mediated via the conduction channel in these rare earth doped samples and therefore magnetic
order and carrier concentration are expected to be independently controllable. This is not generally
the case for transition metal doped topological insulators.
