In this paper we study the non-equilibrium one dimensional physics with the example of quantum Hall
edge channel at integer filling factor Coulomb interacting with an artificial impurity. Electrons
in an integer quantum Hall system effectively behave as free fermions, thus the interaction with
a charged impurity normally leads to the orthogonality catastrophe and the Fermi edge singularity
(FES). Unlike in 3D materials where the FES is commonly observed, the artificial impurity allows
for a controllable interaction that can be made strong, leading to strong correlations and large
scattering phases, resulting in resonant suppression of coherence on the channel, which can be
detected by embedding the channel into an electronic interferometer and measuring the dip of the
visibility of the interference pattern. However, in equilibrium the transition rates at the impurity
satisfy the detailed balance equation and therefore the shape of the visibility dip is trivial.
Thus we consider the regime where the transitions are induced by the non-equilibrium partitioning
noise created in the interferometer itself by the beam splitter. The best method to describe such
a system is the non-equilibrium bosonization technique which reduces the problem to the calculation
of the full counting statistics of the currents after a tunneling contact. The full counting statistics
is calculated analytically in the Markovian limit in the regimes of weak tunneling or weak backscattering,
and supplemented by the direct numerical calculation of the electron correlation functions for
intermediate transparencies. The visibility is determined by both the FES and the non-equilibrium
physics via the FES exponent and the transparency of the noise emitting QPC. The non-equilibrium
effects are also manifested in the asymmetry of the visibility dip and in the non-trivial dependence
of the dip position on the transparency.
