Photodoped states are widely observed in laser-excited Mott insulators, in which charge excitations
are quickly created and can exist beyond the duration of the external driving. Despite the fruitful
experimental explorations, theoretical studies on the microscopic models face the challenge
to simultaneously deal with exponentially separated time scales, especially in multi-band systems,
where the long-time behaviors are often well beyond the reach of state-of-the-art numerical tools.
Here, we address this difficulty by introducing a steady-state description of photodoped Mott
insulators using an open-system setup, where the photodoped system is stabilized as a non-equilirium
steady-state (NESS) by a weak external driving. Taking advantage of the stationarity, we implement
and discuss the details of an efficient numerical tool using the steady-state Dynamical Mean-Field
Theory (DMFT), combined with the non-crossing approximation (NCA). We demonstrate that these
stationary photodoped states exhibit the same properties of their transient counterparts, while
being solvable with reasonable computational efforts. Furthermore, they can be parametrized
by just few physical quantities, including the effective temperature and the density of charge
excitations, which confirms the universal nature of photodoped states indeed independent of the
excitation protocols. As a first application, we consider the stationary photodoped states in
a two-band Hubbard model with intertwined spin-and-orbital ordering and find a family of hidden
phases unknown from the previous studies, implying an apparently unexplored time regime of the
relaxation of the intertwined orders.
