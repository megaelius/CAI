Machine learning methods are being actively considered as a new tool of describing many body physics.
However, so far, their capabilities has been only demonstrated in previously studied models, such
as e.g. Ising model. Here, we consider a simple problem, demonstrating that neural networks can
be successfully used to give new insights in statistical physics. Specifically, we consider 3D
lattice dimer model, which consists of sites forming a lattice and bonds connecting the neighboring
sites, in such a way that every bond can be either empty or filled with a dimer, and the total number
of dimers ending at one site is fixed to be one. Dimer configurations can be viewed as equivalent if
they are connected through a series of local flips, i.e. simultaneous 'rotation' of a pair of parallel
neighboring dimers. It turns out that the whole set of dimer configurations on a given 3D lattice
can be split into distinct topological classes, such that dimer configurations belonging to different
classes are not equivalent. In this paper we identify these classes by using neural networks. More
specifically, we train the neural networks to distinguish dimer configurations from two known
topological classes, and after it, we test them on dimer configurations from unknown topological
classes. We demonstrate that 3D lattice dimer model on a bipartite lattice can be described by an
integer topological invariant ('Hopf number'), whereas lattice dimer model on a non-bipartite
lattice is described by $Z_2$ invariant. Thus, we demonstrate that neural networks can be successfully
used to identify new topological phases in condensed matter systems, whose existence can be later
verified by other (e.g. analytical) techniques.
