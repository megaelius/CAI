In conventional solar cell semiconductor materials (predominantly Si) photons with energy higher
than the band gap initially generate hot electrons and holes, which subsequently cool down to the
band edge by phonon emission. Due to the latter process, the energy of the charge carriers in excess
of the band gap is lost as heat and does not contribute to the conversion of solar to electrical power.
If the excess energy is more than the band gap it can in principle be utilized through a process known
as carrier multiplication (CM) in which a single absorbed photon generates two (or more) pairs of
electrons and holes. Thus, through CM the photon energy above twice the band gap enhances the photocurrent
of a solar cell. In this review, we discuss recent progress in CM research in terms of fundamental
understanding, emergence of new materials for efficient CM, and CM based solar cell applications.
Based on our current understanding, the CM threshold can get close to the minimal value of twice the
band gap in materials where a photon induces an asymmetric electronic transition from a deeper valence
band or to a higher conduction band. In addition, the material must have a low exciton binding energy
and high charge carrier mobility, so that photoexcitation leads directly to the formation of free
charges that can readily be extracted at external electrodes of a photovoltaic device. Percolative
networks of coupled PbSe quantum dots, Sn/Pb based halide perovskites, and transition metal dichalcogenides
such as MoTe2 fulfill these requirements to a large extent. These findings point towards promising
prospects for further development of new materials for highly efficient photovoltaics.
