Neural dynamics is often investigated with tools from bifurcation theory. However, many neuron
models are stochastic, mimicking fluctuations in the input from unknown parts of the brain or the
spiking nature of input signals. Such noise in the input, however, changes the dynamics with respect
to the deterministic model. We formulate the stochastic neuron dynamics in the Martin-Siggia-Rose
De Dominicis-Janssen (MSDRJ) formalism and present the fluctuation expansion of the effective
action and the functional renormalization group (fRG) as two systematic ways to incorporate corrections
to the mean dynamics and time-dependent statistics due to fluctuations in the presence of nonlinear
neuronal gain. To formulate self-consistency equations, we derive a fundamental link between
the effective action in the Onsager-Machlup (OM) formalism, which lends itself to direct physical
interpretation, and the MSRDJ effective action, which is computationally advantageous. These
results in particular allow the extension of the OM formalism to non-Gaussian noise. This approach
naturally leads to effective deterministic equations for the first moment of the stochastic system;
they explain how nonlinearities and noise cooperate to produce memory effects. Moreover, the MSRDJ
formulation yields an effective linear system that has identical power spectra and linear response.
Starting from the better known loopwise approximation, we then discuss the use of the fRG as a method
to obtain self-consistency beyond the mean. We present a new efficient truncation scheme for the
hierarchy of flow equations for the vertex functions by adapting the Blaizot, M\'endez and Wschebor
(BMW) approximation from the derivative expansion to the vertex expansion. The methods are presented
by means of the simplest possible example of a stochastic differential equation that has generic
features of neuronal dynamics.
