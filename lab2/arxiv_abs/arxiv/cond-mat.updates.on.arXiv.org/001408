Mott insulator plays a central role in strongly correlated physics, where the repulsive Coulomb
interaction dominates over the electron kinetic energy and leads to insulating states with one
electron occupying each unit cell. Doped Mott insulator is often described by the Hubbard model,
which can give rise to other correlated phenomena such as unusual magnetism and even high temperature
superconductivity. A tunable Mott insulator, where the competition between the Coulomb interaction
and the kinetic energy can be varied in situ, can provide an invaluable model system for the study
of Mott physics. Here we report the realization of such a tunable Mott insulator in the ABC trilayer
graphene (TLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructure with a Moir\'e superlattice.
Unlike massless Dirac electrons in monolayer graphene, electrons in pristine ABC TLG are characterized
by quartic energy dispersion and large effective mass that are conducive for strongly correlated
phenomena. The Moir\'e superlattice in TLG/hBN heterostructures leads to narrow electronic minibands
that are gate-tunable. Each filled miniband contains 4 electrons in one Moir\'e lattice site due
to the spin and valley degeneracy of graphene. The Mott insulator states emerge at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings,
corresponding to one electron and two electrons per site, respectively. Moreover, the Mott states
in the ABC TLG/hBN heterostructure exhibit unprecedented tunablility: the Mott gap can be modulated
in situ by a vertical electrical field, and at the mean time the electron doping can be gate-tuned
to fill the band from one Mott insulating state to another. Our observation of a tunable Mott insulator
opens up tremendous opportunities to explore novel strongly correlated phenomena in two-dimensional
Moir\'e superlattice heterostructures.
