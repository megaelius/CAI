We derive relations between various observables for N particles with zero-range or short-range
interactions, in continuous space or on a lattice, in two or three dimensions, in an arbitrary external
potential. Some of our results generalise known relations between large-momentum behavior of
the momentum distribution, short-distance behavior of the pair correlation function and of the
one-body density matrix, derivative of the energy with respect to the scattering length or to time,
and the norm of the regular part of the wavefunction; in the case of finite-range interactions, the
interaction energy is also related to dE/da. The expression relating the energy to a functional
of the momentum distribution is also generalised, and is found to break down for Efimov states with
zero-range interactions, due to a subleading oscillating tail in the momentum distribution. We
also obtain new expressions for the derivative of the energy of a universal state with respect to
the effective range, the derivative of the energy of an efimovian state with respect to the three-body
parameter, and the second order derivative of the energy with respect to the inverse (or the logarithm
in the two-dimensional case) of the scattering length. The latter is negative at fixed entropy.
We use exact relations to compute corrections to exactly solvable three-body problems and find
agreement with available numerics. For the unitary gas, we compare exact relations to existing
fixed-node Monte-Carlo data, and we test, with existing Quantum Monte Carlo results on different
finite range models, our prediction that the leading deviation of the critical temperature from
its zero range value is linear in the interaction effective range r_e with a model independent numerical
coefficient.
