Y-doped BaZrO$_3$ is a promising proton conductor for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel
cells. In this work, a combination of static DFT calculations and DFT based molecular dynamics (DFT-MD)
was used to study proton conduction in such a material. Geometry optimisations of 100 structures
with a 12.5% dopant concentration allowed us to identify a clear correlation between the bending
of the metal-oxygen-metal angle and the energies of the simulated cells. Depending on the type of
bending, two configurations, designated as inwards bending and outwards bending, were defined.
The results demonstrate that a larger bending decreases the energy and that the lowest energies
are observed for structures combining inwards bending with protons being close to the dopant atoms.
These lowest energy structures are the ones with the strongest hydrogen bonds. DFT-MD simulations
in cells with different yttrium distributions provide complementary microscopic information
on proton diffusion as they capture the dynamic distortions of the lattice caused by thermal motion.
A careful analysis of the proton jumps between different environments confirmed that the inwards
and outwards bending states are relevant for the understanding of proton diffusion. Indeed, intra-octahedral
jumps were shown to only occur starting from an outwards configuration while the inwards configuration
seems to favor rotations around the oxygen. On average, in the DFT-MD simulations, the hydrogen
bond lengths are shorter for the outwards configuration which facilitates the intraoctahedral
jumps. Diffusion coefficients and activation energies were also determined and compared to previous
theoretical and experimental data showing a good agreement with previous data corresponding to
local proton motion.
