Although an intimate relation between entropy and diffusion has been advocated for many years and
even seems to have been verified in theory and experiments, a quantitatively reliable study, and
any derivation of an algebraic relation between the two does not seem to exist. Here we explore the
nature of this entropy-diffusion relation in three deterministic systems where an accurate estimate
of both can be carried out. We study three deterministic model systems, (a) the motion of a single
point particle with constant energy in a two-dimensional periodic potential energy landscape,
(b) the same in regular Lorentz gas where a point particle with constant energy moves between collisions
with hard disc scatterers and (c) motion of a point particle among the boxes with small apertures.
These models, introduced by Zwanzig, exhibit diffusive motion in the limit where ergodicity is
shown to exist. We then explore the diffusion-entropy relation by an accurate calculation of both
diffusion and entropy for the aforementioned model systems. We estimate the self-diffusion coefficient
of the particle by employing computer simulations and entropy by quadrature using Boltzmann's
formula. We observe an interesting crossover in the diffusion-entropy relation in some specific
regions which is attributed to the emergence of correlated returns. The crossover could herald
a breakdown of the Rosenfeld-like exponential scaling between the two, as observed at low temperatures.
Later, we modify the scaling relation to account for the correlated motions and present a detailed
analysis of the dynamical entropy obtained via Lyapunov exponent which is rather an important quantity
in the study of deterministic systems.
