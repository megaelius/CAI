The relaxation dynamics and the vibrational spectra of amorphous solids, such as metal alloys,
have been intensely investigated as well separated topics in the past. The aim of this review is to
summarize recent results in both these areas in an attempt to establish, or unveil, deeper connections
between the two phenomena of relaxation and vibration. Theoretical progress in the area of slow
relaxation dynamics of liquid and glassy systems and in the area of vibrational spectra of glasses
and liquids is reviewed. After laying down a generic modelling framework to connect vibration and
relaxation, the physics of metal alloys is considered where the emergence of power-law exponents
has been identified both in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) as well as in density correlations.
Also, theoretical frameworks which connect the VDOS to the relaxation behaviour and mechanical
viscoelastic response in metallic glasses are reviewed. The same generic interpretative framework
is then applied to the case of molecular glass formers where the emergence of stretched-exponential
relaxation in dielectric relaxation can be put in quantitative relation with the VDOS by means of
memory-function approaches. Further connections between relaxation and vibration are provided
by the study of phonon linewidths in liquids and glasses, where a natural starting point is given
by hydrodynamic theories. Finally, an agenda of outstanding issues including the appearance of
compressed exponential relaxation in the intermediate scattering function of experimental and
simulated systems (metal alloys, colloidal gels, jammed packings) is presented in light of available
(or yet to be developed) mathematical models, and compared to non-exponential behaviour measured
with macroscopic means such as mechanical spectroscopy/rheology.
