$\alpha$-graphyne is a two-dimensional sheet of $sp$-$sp^2$ hybridized carbon atoms in a honeycomb
lattice. While the geometrical structure is similar to that of graphene, the hybridized triple
bonds give rise to electronic structure that is different from that of graphene. Similar to graphene,
$\alpha$-graphyne can be stacked in bilayers with two stable configurations, but the different
stackings have very different electronic structures: one is predicted to have gapless parabolic
bands and the other a tunable band gap which is attractive for applications. In order to realize applications,
it is crucial to understand which stacking is more stable. This is difficult to model, as the stability
is a result of weak interlayer van der Waals interactions which are not well captured by density functional
theory (DFT). We have used quantum Monte Carlo simulations that accurately include van der Waals
interactions to calculate the interlayer binding energy of bilayer graphyne and to determine its
most stable stacking mode. Our results show that interlayer bindings of $sp$- and $sp^{2}$-bonded
carbon networks are significantly underestimated in a Kohn-Sham DFT approach, even with an exchange-correlation
potential corrected to include, in some approximation, van der Waals interactions. Finally, our
quantum Monte Carlo calculations reveal that the interlayer binding energy difference between
the two stacking modes is only 0.9(4) meV/atom. From this we conclude that the two stable stacking
modes of bilayer $\alpha$-graphyne are almost degenerate with each other, and both will occur with
about the same probability at room temperature unless there is a synthesis path that prefers one
stacking over the other.
