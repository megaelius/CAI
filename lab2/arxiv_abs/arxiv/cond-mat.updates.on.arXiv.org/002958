We develop the variational and correlated basis functions/parquet-diagram theory of strongly
interacting normal and superfluid systems. The first part of this contribution is devoted to highlight
the connections between the Euler equations for the Jastrow-Feenberg wave function on the one hand
side, and the ring, ladder, and self-energy diagrams of parquet-diagram theory on the other side.
We will show that these subsets of Feynman diagrams are contained, in a local approximation, in the
variational wave function. In the second part of this work, we derive the fully optimized Fermi-Hypernetted
Chain (FHNC-EL) equations for a superfluid system. Close examination of the procedure reveals
that the na\"ive application of these equations exhibits spurious unphysical properties for even
an infinitesimal superfluid gap. We will conclude that it is essential to go {\em beyond\/} the usual
Jastrow-Feenberg approximation and to include the exact particle-hole propagator to guarantee
a physically meaningful theory and the correct stability range. We will then implement this method
and apply it to neutron matter and low density Fermi liquids interacting via the Lennard-Jones model
interaction and the P\"oschl-Teller interaction. While the quantitative changes in the magnitude
of the superfluid gap are relatively small, we see a significant difference between applications
for neutron matter and the Lennard-Jones and P\"oschl-Teller systems. Despite the fact that the
gap in neutron matter can be as large as half the Fermi energy, the corrections to the gap are relatively
small. In the Lennard-Jones and P\"oschl-Teller models, the most visible consequence of the self-consistent
calculation is the change in stability range of the system.
