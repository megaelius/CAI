Identifying key players in a set of coupled individual systems is a fundamental problem in network
theory. Its origin can be traced back to social sciences and led to ranking algorithms based on graph
theoretic centralities. Coupled dynamical systems differ from social networks in that, they are
characterized by degrees of freedom with a deterministic dynamics and the coupling between individual
units is a well-defined function of those degrees of freedom. One therefore expects the resulting
coupled dynamics, and not only the network topology, to also determine the key players. Here, we
investigate synchronizable network-coupled dynamical systems such as high voltage electric
power grids and coupled oscillators. We search for nodes which, once perturbed by a local noisy disturbance,
generate the largest overall transient excursion away from synchrony. A spectral decomposition
of the coupling matrix leads to an elegant, concise, yet accurate solution to this identification
problem. We show that, when the internodal coupling matrix is Laplacian, these key players are peripheral
in the sense of a centrality measure defined from effective resistance distances. For linearly
coupled dynamical systems such as weakly loaded power grids or consensus algorithms, the nodal
ranking is efficiently obtained through a single Laplacian matrix inversion, regardless of the
operational synchronous state. We call the resulting ranking index LRank. For heavily loaded power
grids or coupled oscillators systems closer to the transition to synchrony, nonlinearities render
the nodal ranking dependent on the synchronous state. In this case a weighted Laplacian matrix inversion
gives another ranking index, which we call WLRank. Quite surprisingly, we find that LRank provides
a faithful ranking even for well developed coupling nonlinearities, corresponding to oscillator
angle differences up to $40^o$ approximately.
