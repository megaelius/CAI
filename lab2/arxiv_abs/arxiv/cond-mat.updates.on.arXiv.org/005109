Many-body physics aims to understand emergent properties of systems made of many interacting objects.
This article reviews recent progress on the topic of radiative heat transfer in many-body systems
consisting of thermal emitters interacting in the near-field regime. Near-field radiative heat
transfer is a rapidly emerging field of research in which the cooperative behavior of emitters gives
rise to peculiar effects which can be exploited to control heat flow at the nanoscale. Using an extension
of the standard Polder and van Hove stochastic formalism to deal with thermally generated fields
in $N$-body systems, along with their mutual interactions through multiple scattering, a generalized
Landauer-like theory is derived to describe heat exchange mediated by thermal photons in arbitrary
reciprocal and non-reciprocal multi-terminal systems. In this review, we use this formalism to
address both transport and dynamics in these systems from a unified perspective. Our discussion
covers: (i) the description of non-additivity of heat flux and its related effects, including fundamental
limits as well as the role of nanostructuring and material choice, (ii) the study of equilibrium
states and multistable states, (iii) the relaxation dynamics (thermalization) toward local and
global equilibria, (iv) the analysis of heat transport regimes in ordered and disordered systems
comprised of a large number of objects, density and range of interactions, and (v) the description
of thermomagnetic effects in magneto-optical systems and heat transport mechanisms in non-Hermitian
many-body systems. We conclude this review by listing outstanding challenges and promising future
research directions.
