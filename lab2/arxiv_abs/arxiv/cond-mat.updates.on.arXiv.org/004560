Excited states of molecules lie in the heart of photochemistry and chemical reactions. The recent
development in quantum computational chemistry leads to inventions of a variety of algorithms
that calculate the excited states of molecules on near-term quantum computers, but they require
more computational burdens than the algorithms for calculating the ground states. In this study,
we propose a scheme of supervised quantum machine learning which predicts the excited-state properties
of molecules only from their ground state wavefunction resulting in reducing the computational
cost for calculating the excited states. Our model is comprised of a quantum reservoir and a classical
machine learning unit which processes the measurement results of single-qubit Pauli operators
with the output state from the reservoir. The quantum reservoir effectively transforms the single-qubit
operators into complicated multi-qubit ones which contain essential information of the system,
so that the classical machine learning unit may decode them appropriately. The number of runs for
quantum computers is saved by training only the classical machine learning unit, and the whole model
requires modest resources of quantum hardware that may be implemented in current experiments.
We illustrate the predictive ability of our model by numerical simulations for small molecules
with and without noise inevitable in near-term quantum computers. The results show that our scheme
well reproduces the first and second excitation energies as well as the transition dipole moment
between the ground states and excited states only from the ground state as an input. We expect our
contribution will enhance the applications of quantum computers in the study of quantum chemistry
and quantum materials.
