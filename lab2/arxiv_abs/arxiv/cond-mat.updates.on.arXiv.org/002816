For a wide range of values of the incoming solar radiation, the Earth features at least two attracting
states, which correspond to competing climates. The warm climate is analogous to the present one;
the snowball climate features global glaciation and conditions that can hardly support life forms.
Paleoclimatic evidences suggest that in past our planet flipped between these two states. The main
physical mechanism responsible for such instability is the ice-albedo feedback. In a previous
work, we defined the Melancholia states that sit between the two climates. Such states are embedded
in the boundaries between the two basins of attraction and feature extensive glaciation down to
relatively low latitudes. Here, we explore the global stability properties of the system by introducing
random perturbations as modulations to the intensity of the incoming solar radiation. We observe
noise-induced transitions between the competing basins of attractions. In the weak noise limit,
large deviation laws define the invariant measure and the statistics of escape times. By empirically
constructing the instantons, we show that the Melancholia states are the gateways for the noise-induced
transitions. In the region of multistability, in the zero-noise limit, the measure is supported
only on one of the competing attractors. For low (high) values of the solar irradiance, the limit
measure is the snowball (warm) climate. The changeover between the two regimes corresponds to a
first order phase transition in the system. The framework we propose seems of general relevance
for the study of complex multistable systems. At this regard, we relate our results to the debate
around the prominence of contigency vs. convergence in biological evolution. Finally, we propose
a new method for constructing Melancholia states from direct numerical simulations, thus bypassing
the need to use the edge-tracking algorithm.
