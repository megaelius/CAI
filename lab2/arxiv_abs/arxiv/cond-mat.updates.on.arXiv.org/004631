Hydrogen embrittlement in 304L (18wt.% Cr, 8-10wt.% Ni) austenitic stainless steel (ASS) fabricated
by laser powder-bed-fusion (LPBF) was investigated by tensile testing after electrochemical
hydrogen pre-charging and compared to conventionally available 304L ASSs with two different processing
histories, (i) casting plus annealing (CA) and (ii) CA plus thermomechanical treatment (TMT).
It was revealed that hydrogen-charging led to a significant reduction in ductility for the CA sample,
but only a small effect of hydrogen was observed for the LPBF and CA-TMT samples. Hydrogen-assisted
cracking behavior was found to be strongly linked to strain-induced martensitic transformation.
In addition, the amount of alpha' martensite was much higher in the CA sample than in other samples,
suggesting that severe hydrogen embrittlement can be correlated with the low mechanical stability
of austenite. Detailed microstructural characterization showed that low austenite stability
of the CA sample was mainly attributed to the retained content of delta ferrite and the chemical inhomogeneity
inside the gamma matrix (gamma close to delta has ~2 wt.% higher Cr but ~2 wt.% lower Ni), but TMT enhanced
the chemical homogeneity and thus austenite stability. By contrast, the LPBF process led directly,
i.e. without any thermomechanical treatment, to a fully austenitic structure with homogeneous
elemental distribution in the ASS. These results confirmed that the presence of delta and the chemical
inhomogeneity inside gamma matrix, which promoted the deformation-induced martensitic transformation
and the associated H enrichment at the gamma-alpha' interface, was the primary reason for the severe
H-assisted failure.
