The finite-size renormalization-group approach for isotropic O$(n)$-symmetric systems introduced
previously [V. Dohm, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 110}, 107207 (2013)] is extended to weakly anisotropic
O$(n)$-symmetric systems. Our theory is formulated within the $\varphi^4$ model with lattice
anisotropy in a $d$-dimensional block geometry with periodic boundary conditions. It describes
the crossover from low- to high-temperature fluctuations including Goldstone-dominated and
critical fluctuations for $1\leq n \leq \infty$ in $2<d<4$ dimensions. An exact representation
is derived for the large-distance behavior of the bulk correlation function of anisotropic systems
in terms of the principal correlation lengths and an anisotropy matrix ${\bf \bar A}$. This includes
the long-ranged correlations with an anisotropic algebraic decay at low temperatures due to the
Goldstone modes for $n>1$. We calculate the finite-size scaling functions of the excess free energy
and thermodynamic Casimir force. Exact results are derived in the large-$n$ limit. Applications
are given for $L_\parallel^{d-1} \times L$ slab geometries with a finite aspect ratio $\rho=L/L_\parallel$
as well as for the film limit $\rho \to 0$. For weakly anisotropic systems two-scale-factor universality
is replaced by multiparameter universality. This implies a substantial reduction of the predictive
power of bulk and finite-size theory for anisotropic systems as compared to isotropic systems.
The validity of multiparameter universality is confirmed analytically for a nontrivial example
of the $d=2,n=1$ universality class. Anisotropy-dependent minima of the Casimir force scaling
function are found below $T_c$. Both the sign and magnitude of the Casimir amplitude in the Goldstone
and critical regimes are affected by the lattice anisotropy. Quantitative predictions are made
that can be tested by Monte Carlo simulations.
