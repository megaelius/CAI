The advent of nanotechnology has hurtled the discovery and development of nanostructured materials
with stellar chemical and physical functionalities in a bid to address issues in energy, environment,
telecommunications and healthcare. In this quest, a class of two-dimensional layered materials
consisting of alkali or coinage metal atoms sandwiched between slabs exclusively made of transition
metal and chalcogen (or pnictogen) atoms arranged in a honeycomb fashion have emerged as materials
exhibiting fascinatingly rich crystal chemistry, high-voltage electrochemistry, fast cation
diffusion and play host to varied exotic electromagnetic and topological phenomena. Currently,
with a niche application in energy storage as high-voltage materials, this class of honeycomb layered
oxides serves as ideal pedagogical exemplars of the innumerable capabilities of nanomaterials
drawing immense interest in multiple fields ranging from materials science, solid-state chemistry,
electrochemistry and condensed matter physics. In this review, we delineate the relevant chemistry
and physics of honeycomb layered oxides, and discuss their functionalities for tunable electrochemistry,
superfast ionic conduction, optics, electromagnetism and topology. Moreover, we elucidate the
unexplored albeit vastly promising crystal chemistry space whilst outlining effective ways to
identify regions within this compositional space, particularly where interesting electromagnetic
and topological properties could be lurking within the aforementioned alkali and coinage-metal
honeycomb layered oxide structures. We conclude by pointing towards possible future research
directions, particularly the prospective realisation of Kitaev-Heisenberg-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions with single crystals and Floquet theory in closely-related honeycomb layered oxide
materials.
