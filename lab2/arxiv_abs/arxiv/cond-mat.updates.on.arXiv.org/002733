Low density two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) with spin-orbit coupling are highly sensitive
to an in-plane magnetic field, which impacts their Fermi surfaces and transport properties. Such
2DEGs, formed at transition metal oxide surfaces or interfaces, can also undergo surface phase
transitions leading to polar metals which exhibit electronic nematicity. Motivated by experiments
on such systems, we theoretically study magnetotransport in $t_{2g}$ orbital systems, using Hamiltonians
which include atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken inversion symmetry, for both square
symmetry (001) and hexagonal symmetry (111) 2DEGs. Using a numerical solution to the full multiband
matrix-Boltzmann equation, together with insights gleaned from the impurity scattering overlap
matrix, we explore the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in the presence of impurities which
favor small momentum scattering. We find that transport in the (001) 2DEG is dominated by a single
pair of bands, weakly coupled by impurity scattering, one of which has a larger Fermi velocity while
the other provides an efficient current-relaxation mechanism. This leads to strong angle-dependent
current damping and a large AMR with many angular harmonics. In contrast, AMR in the (111) 2DEG typically
features a single $\cos(2\vartheta)$ harmonic, with the angle-averaged magnetoresistance being
highly tunable by a symmetry-allowed trigonal distortion. We also explore how the (111) 2DEG Fermi
sufaces are impacted by electronic nematicity via a surface phase transition into a 2D polar metal
for which we discuss a Landau theory, and show that this leads to distinct symmetry components and
higher angular harmonics in the AMR. Our results are in qualitative agreement with experiments
from various groups for 2DEGs at the SrTiO$_3$ surface or the LaAlO$_3$-SrTiO$_3$ interface.
