Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations are used to study the translocation dynamics of a coarse-grained
polymer through a cylindrical nanopore. We consider the case of short polymers, with a polymer length,
N, in the range N=21-61. The rate of translocation is controlled by a tunable friction coefficient,
gamma_{0p}, for monomers inside the nanopore. In the case of unforced translocation, the mean translocation
time scales with polymer length N as <tau_1>~ (N-N_p)^alpha, where N_p is the average number
of monomers in the nanopore. The exponent approaches the value alpha=2 when the pore friction is
sufficiently high, in accord with the prediction for the case of the quasi-static regime where pore
friction dominates. In the case of forced translocation, the polymer chain is stretched and compressed
on the cis and trans sides, respectively, for low gamma_{0p}. However, the chain approaches conformational
quasi-equilibrium for sufficiently large gamma_{0p}. In this limit the observed scaling of <tau_1>
with driving force and chain length supports the FP prediction that <tau> is proportional
to N/f_d for sufficiently strong driving force. Monte Carlo simulations are used to calculate translocation
free energy functions for the system. The free energies are used with the Fokker-Planck equation
to calculate translocation time distributions. At sufficiently high gamma_{0p}, the predicted
distributions are in excellent agreement with those calculated from the BD simulations. Thus,
the FP equation provides a valid description of translocation dynamics for sufficiently high pore
friction for the range of polymer lengths considered here. Increasing N will require a corresponding
increase in pore friction to maintain the validity of the FP approach. Outside the regime of low N
and high pore friction, the polymer is out of equilibrium, and the FP approach is not valid.
