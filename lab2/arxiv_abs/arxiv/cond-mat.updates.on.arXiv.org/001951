Synchronization of neurons forming a network with a hierarchical structure is essential for the
brain to be able to function optimally. In this paper we study synchronization of phase oscillators
on the most basic example of such a network, namely, the hierarchical lattice. Each site of the lattice
carries an oscillator that is subject to noise. Pairs of oscillators interact with each other at
a strength that depends on their hierarchical distance, modulated by a sequence of interaction
parameters. We look at block averages of the oscillators on successive hierarchical scales, which
we think of as block communities. In the limit as the number of oscillators per community tends to
infinity, referred to as the hierarchical mean-field limit, we find a separation of time scales,
i.e., each block community behaves like a single oscillator evolving on its own time scale. We argue
that the evolution of the block communities is given by a renormalized mean-field noisy Kuramoto
equation, with a synchronization level that depends on the hierarchical scale of the block community.
We find three universality classes for the synchronization levels on successive hierarchical
scales, characterized in terms of the sequence of interaction parameters. What makes our model
specifically challenging is the non-linearity of the interaction betweenthe oscillators. The
main results of our paper therefore come in three parts: (I) a conjecture about the nature of the renormalisation
transformation connecting successive hierarchical scales; (II) a truncation approximation
that leads to a simplified renormalization transformation; (III) a rigorous analysis of the simplified
renormalization transformation. We provide compelling arguments in support of (I) and (II), but
a full verification remains an open problem.
