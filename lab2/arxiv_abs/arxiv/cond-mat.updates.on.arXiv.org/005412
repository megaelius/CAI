By quantitative low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) we investigate the extensively studied
commensurate charge density wave (CDW) phase of trigonal tantalum disulphide (1T-TaS$_2$), which
develops at low temperatures with a $\left(\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}\right)$R13.9{\deg} periodicity.
A full-dynamical analysis of the energy dependence of diffraction spot intensities reveals the
entire crystallographic surface structure, i.e. the detailed atomic positions within the outermost
two trilayers consisting of 78 atoms as well as the CDW stacking. The analysis is based on an unusually
large data set consisting of spectra for 128 inequivalent beams taken in the energy range 20-250
eV and an excellent fit quality expressed by a bestfit Pendry R-factor of R=0.110. The LEED intensity
analysis reveals that the well-accepted model of star-of-David-shaped clusters of Ta atoms for
the bulk structure also holds for the outermost two TaS$_2$ trilayers. Specifically, in both layers
the clusters of Ta atoms contract laterally by up to 0.25 $\r{A}$ and also slightly rotate within
the superstructure cell, causing respective distortions as well as heavy bucklings (up to 0.23
$\r{A}$) in the adjacent sulphur layers. Most importantly, our analysis finds that the CDWs of the
1$^{\text{st}}$ and 2$^{\text{nd}}$ trilayer are vertically aligned, while there is a lateral
shift of two units of the basic hexagonal lattice (6.71 $\r{A}$) between the 2$^{\text{nd}}$ and
3$^{\text{rd}}$ trilayer. The results may contribute to a better understanding of the intricate
electronic structure of the reference compound 1T-TaS$_2$ and guide the way to the analysis of complex
structures in similar quantum materials.
