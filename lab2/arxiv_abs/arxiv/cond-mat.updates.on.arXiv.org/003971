Doped SrTiO$_3$, one of the most dilute bulk systems to display superconductivity, is perhaps the
first example of an unconventional superconductor, as it does not fit into the standard BCS paradigm.
More than five decades of research has revealed a rich temperature-carrier concentration phase
diagram that showcases a superconducting dome, proximity to a putative quantum critical point,
Lifshitz transitions, a multi-gap pairing state and unusual normal-state transport properties.
Research has also extended beyond bulk SrTiO$_3$, ushering the new field of SrTiO$_3$-based heterostructures.
Because many of these themes are also featured in other quantum materials of contemporary interest,
recent years have seen renewed interest in SrTiO$_3$. Here, we review the challenges and recent
progress in elucidating the superconducting state of this model system. At the same time that its
extreme dilution requires to revisit several of the approximations that constitute the successful
Migdal-Eliashberg description of electron-phonon superconductivity, including the suppression
of the Coulomb repulsion via the Tolmachev-Anderson-Morel mechanism, it opens interesting routes
for alternative pairing mechanisms whose applicability remains under debate. For instance, pairing
mechanisms involving longitudinal optical phonons have to overcome the hurdles created by the
anti-adiabatic nature of the pairing interaction, whereas mechanisms that rely on the soft transverse
optical phonons associated with incipient ferroelectricity face challenges related to the nature
of the electron-phonon coupling. Proposals in which pairing is mediated by plasmons or promoted
locally by defects are also discussed. We finish by surveying the existing evidence for multi-band
superconductivity and outlining promising directions that can potentially shed new light on the
rich problem of superconductivity in SrTiO$_3$.
