The semiconductor Bloch equations for a two-band model including inter- and intraband excitation
are used to study the nonlinear absorption of single and multiple light pulses by direct-gap semiconductors.
For a consistent analysis the contributions to the absorption originating from both the interband
polarization and the intraband current need to be included. In the Bloch equation approach theses
contributions as well as different excitation pathways in terms of sequences of inter- and intraband
excitations can be evaluated separately which allows for a transparent analysis, the identification
of the dominant terms, and analyzing their dependence on the excitation conditions. In the perturbative
regime, we obtain analytical expressions for the multi-photon absorption coefficients for continuous-wave
excitation. These results are shown to agree well with numerical results for short pulses and/or
finite dephasing and relaxation times and we confirm the previously predicted strong enhancement
of two-photon absorption for non-degenerate conditions for pulsed excitation. We discuss the
dependencies on the light frequencies, initial band populations, and the time delay between the
pulses. The frequency dependence of the two-photon absorption coefficient for non-degenerate
excitation is evaluated perturbatively in third-order. The higher-order contributions to the
optical absorption include three- and four-photon absorption and show a rich frequency dependence
including negative regions and dispersive lineshapes. Non-perturbative solutions of the Bloch
equations demonstrate a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the intensity-dependent optical
absorption for a single incident pulse and in a pump-probe set-up.
