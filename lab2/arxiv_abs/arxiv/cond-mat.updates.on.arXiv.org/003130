The class of strongly pseudo-additive entropies, which can be represented as an increasing continuous
transformation of Shannon and R\'enyi entropies, have intensively been studied in previous decades.
Although their mathematical structure has thoroughly been explored and established by GSK axioms,
the analyzies of their thermostatical properties have mostly been limited to special cases which
belongs to two parameter Sharma-Mittal entropy class, such as Tsallis, R\'enyi and Gaussian entropies.
In this paper we present a general analysis of the strongly pseudo-additive entropies thermostatics
by taking into account both linear and escort constraints on internal energy. We develop two type
dualities between the thermostatics formalisms. By the first one, the formalism of R\'enyi entropy
is transformed in the formalism of SPA entropy under general energy constraint and, by the second
one, the generalized thermostatics which corresponds to the linear constraint is transformed
into the one which corresponds to the escort constraint. Thus, we establish the equivalence between
four different thermostatic formalisms based on R\'enyi and SPA entropies coupled with linear
and escort constraints and we provide the transformation formulas. In this way we obtain a general
framework which is applicable to the wide class of entropies and constraints previously discussed
in the literature. As an example, we rederive maximum entropy distributions for Sharma-Mittal
entropy and we establish new relationships between the corresponding thermodynamic potentials
and temperatures. We obtain, as special cases, previously developed expressions for maximum entropy
distributions and thermodynamical quantities for Tsallis, R\'enyi and Gaussian entropies. In
addition, the results are applied for derivation of thermostatistical relationships for supra
extensive entropy, which has not previously been considered.
