Photon correlations are the basic conveyor of optical information in the quantum information age.
By regulating a stream of photons and/or endowing them with quantum correlations such as entanglement,
one can use them as qubits or to distribute cryptographic keys. Every time that a platform demonstrates
its ability to generate photons that have such correlations, new prospects arise to extend the frontiers
of quantum technology. One rising star to engineer quantum states in solid state optics are microcavity
polaritons. These semiconductor heterostructures can trap both light (cavity photons) and matter
(electron-hole pairs) to keep them under strong interaction for a long time. The resulting eigenstates,
polaritons, have had resounding successes in the investigation of quantum phases such as Bose-Einstein
condensates, superfluids and nonlinear quantum fluids. They also progress quickly to implement
actual devices. Lately, their quantum character was consolidated by the observation of squeezing,
indicating nonclassical features at a macroscopic level. Only missing to the polariton prize list
is quantum correlation at the single particle level. In this Letter, we report the observation of
single-photon antibunching from the emission of an out-of-equilibrium Bose-Eintein condensate.
This is made possible thanks to generalized photon correlations that preserve the energy information
as well as their time of detection. The success of this technique and its results open the era of quantum
polaritonics in microcavities and demonstrate the concept of a new class of quantum correlations
that can be pursued in a wide range of optical platforms.
