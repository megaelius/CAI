We complement previous functional renormalization group (fRG) studies of the two-dimensional
Hubbard model by mean-field calculations. The focus falls on Van Hove filling and the the hopping
amplitude t'/t=0.341. The fRG data suggest a quantum critical point (QCP) in this region and in its
vicinity a singular fermionic self-energy, Im $\Sigma(\omega)/\omega \sim |\omega|^{-\gamma}$
with $\gamma\approx 0.26$. Here we start a more detailed investigation of this QCP using a bosonic
formulation for the effective action, where the bosons couple to the order parameter fields. To
this end, we use the channel decomposition of the fermionic effective action developed in [Phys.
Rev. B 79, 195125 (2009)], which allows to perform Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations for all
relevant order parameter fields at any given energy scale. We stop the flow at a scale where the correlations
of the order parameter field are already pronounced, but the flow is still regular, and derive the
effective boson theory. It contains d-wave superconducting, magnetic, and density-density interactions.
We analyze the resulting phase diagram in the mean-field approximation. We show that the singular
fermionic self-energy suppresses gap formation both in the superconducting and magnetic channel
already at the mean-field level, thus rounding a first-order transition (without self-energy)
to a quantum phase transition (with self-energy). We give a simple effective model that shows the
generality of this effect. In the two-dimensional Hubbard model, the effective density-density
interaction is peaked at a nonzero frequency, so that solving the mean-field equations already
involves a functional equation instead of simply a matrix equation (on a technical level, similar
to incommensurate phases). Within a certain approximation, we show that such an interaction leads
to a short quasiparticle lifetime.
