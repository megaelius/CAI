Inhibition of bubble coalescence in electrolyte solutions enables the formation of oceanic whitecaps
and affects the heat and mass transfer in many bubble related engineering processes. For different
electrolytes, the ability to inhibit bubble coalescence correlates to the ion specificity at the
air water interface at an abnormal cation-anion pair relationship, rather than the typically expected
cation or anion series that was widely reported in atmospheric, bio- and chemical processes. Here
we show that the inhomogeneous interfacial flow, at a different electrolyte concentration from
the solution because of the surface specificity of both cation and anion, contributes to the bubble
coalescence inhibition behavior in electrolyte solutions. The interfacial flow, achieved with
the mobile air-water interface, contributes to the continuous change of electrolyte concentration
within the liquid film formed between two colliding bubbles, thereby resulting in a concentration
gradient of electrolytes between the thin film and the bulk solution. The electrolyte concentration
gradient, hence surface tension gradient, becomes significant to resist film thinning when the
film thickness reaches tens of nanometers. The retarded film thinning between two bubbles and delayed
bubble coalescence were experimentally captured by high-speed interferometry and quantitatively
explained by the proposed electrolyte transportation model. This finding clearly highlights
the coupled effect of interfacial flow and ion specificity, and shows important implications for
improved understanding of ocean waves, for future development of colloidal science in high concentration
electrolyte solutions that is critical for biology, and benefits many applied fields like water
splitting and mineral extraction.
