The defining characteristic of hole-doped cuprates is $d$-wave high temperature superconductivity.
However, intense theoretical interest is now focused on whether a pair density wave state (PDW)
could coexist with cuprate superconductivity (D. F. Agterberg et al., Annual Review of Condensed
Matter Physics 11, 231 (2020)). Here, we use a strong-coupling mean-field theory of cuprates, to
model the atomic-scale electronic structure of an eight-unit-cell periodic, $d$-symmetry form
factor, pair density wave (PDW) state coexisting with $d$-wave superconductivity (DSC). From
this PDW+DSC model, the atomically-resolved density of Bogoliubov quasiparticle states N(r,E)
is predicted at the terminal BiO surface of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ and compared with high-precision
electronic visualization experiments using spectroscopic imaging STM. The PDW+DSC model predictions
include the intra-unit-cell structure and periodic modulations of N(r,E), the modulations of
the coherence peak energy $\Delta_p$ (r), and the characteristics of Bogoliubov quasiparticle
interference in scattering-wavevector space (q-space). Consistency between all these predictions
and the corresponding experiments indicates that lightly hole-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$
does contain a PDW+DSC state. Moreover, in the model the PDW+DSC state becomes unstable to a pure
DSC state at a critical hole density p*, with empirically equivalent phenomena occurring in the
experiments. All these results are consistent with a picture in which the cuprate translational
symmetry breaking state is a PDW, the observed charge modulations are its consequence, the antinodal
pseudogap is that of the PDW state, and the cuprate critical point at p* ~ 19% occurs due to disappearance
of this PDW.
