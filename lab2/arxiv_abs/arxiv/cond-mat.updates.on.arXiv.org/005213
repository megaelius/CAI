The electrical characterisation of graphene, either in plane sheets or in properly geometrised
form can be approached using non-contact methods already employed for thin film materials. The
extraordinary thinness (and, correspondingly, the volume) of graphene, however, makes the proper
application of these methods difficult. The electrical properties of interest (sheet electrical
resistivity/conductivity, concentration and mobility of charge carriers) must be indirectly
derived from the measurement outcome by geometrical and electrical modelling; the assumptions
behind such models (e.g., uniformity and isotropy, effective value of the applied fields, etc.)
require careful consideration. The traceability of the measurement to the International System
of units and a proper expression of measurement uncertainty is an issue. This guide focuses on non-contact
and high-throughput methods, that are methods where the graphene sample surface is not physically
contacted with any metallic electrodes at any stage. A companion guide about contact methods is
also available. The methods discussed are: - Measurement of surface potential and work function
using Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy (SKPM); - Measurement of sheet resistance by Microwave
Resonant Cavity; - Measurement of sheet resistance by Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS);
For each method, a corresponding measurement protocol is discussed, which describes: - The measurement
principle; - Sample requirements and preparation; - A description of the measurement equipment
/ apparatus; - Calibration standards and ways to achieve a traceable measurement;
