How the information microscopically processed by individual neurons is integrated and used in
organizing the behavior of an animal is a central question in neuroscience. The coherence of neuronal
dynamics over different scales has been suggested as a clue to the mechanisms underlying this integration.
Balanced excitation and inhibition may amplify microscopic fluctuations to a macroscopic level,
thus providing a mechanism for generating coherent multiscale dynamics. Previous theories of
brain dynamics, however, were restricted to cases in which inhibition dominated excitation and
suppressed fluctuations in the macroscopic population activity. In the present study, we investigate
the dynamics of neuronal networks at a critical point between excitation-dominant and inhibition-dominant
states. In these networks, the microscopic fluctuations are amplified by the strong excitation
and inhibition to drive the macroscopic dynamics, while the macroscopic dynamics determine the
statistics of the microscopic fluctuations. Developing a novel type of mean-field theory applicable
to this class of interscale interactions, we show that the amplification mechanism generates spontaneous,
irregular macroscopic rhythms similar to those observed in the brain. Through the same mechanism,
microscopic inputs to a small number of neurons effectively entrain the dynamics of the whole network.
These network dynamics undergo a probabilistic transition to a coherent state, as the magnitude
of either the balanced excitation and inhibition or the external inputs is increased. Our mean-field
theory successfully predicts the behavior of this model. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate
that the coherent dynamics can be used for state-dependent read-out of information from the network.
These results show a novel form of neuronal information processing that connects neuronal dynamics
on different scales.
