Phase transitions give crucial insight into many-body systems, as crossovers between different
regimes of order are determined by the underlying dynamics. These dynamics, in turn, are often constrained
by dimensionality and geometry. For example, in one- and two-dimensional systems with continuous
symmetry, thermal fluctuations prevent the formation of long-range order[1,2]. Two-dimensional
systems are particularly significant, as vortices can form in the plane but cannot tilt out of it.
At high temperatures, random motion of these vortices destroys large-scale coherence. At low temperatures,
vortices with opposite spin can pair together, cancelling their circulation and allowing quasi-long-range
order to appear. This Berezenskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition[3,4] is essentially
classical, arising for example in the traditional XY model for spins, but to date experimental evidence
has been obtained only in cold quantum systems. Measurements of superfluid sound speed[5] and critical
velocity[6] have been consistent with scaling predictions, and vortices have been observed directly
in cold atom experiments[7,8]. However, the presence of trapping potentials restricts measurement
to vortex density, rather than number, and obscures the process of vortex unbinding. Further, atom
and fluid experiments suffer from parasitic heating and difficulties in phase recording, leading
to results that differ from theory in many quantitative aspects. Here, we use a nonlinear optical
system to directly observe the ideal BKT transition, including vortex pair dynamics and the correlation
properties of the wavefunction, for both repulsive and attractiveinteractions (the photonic
equivalent of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic conditions[9]). The results confirm the thermodynamics
of the BKT transition and expose outstanding issues in the crossovers to superfluidity and Bose-Einstein
condensation.
