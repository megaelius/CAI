The competition between crystallization and vitrification in glass-forming materials manifests
as a non-monotonic behavior in the time-temperature transformation (TTT) diagrams, which quantify
the time scales for crystallization as a function of temperature. We develop a coarse-grained lattice
model, the Arrow-Potts model, to explore the physics behind this competition. Using Monte Carlo
simulations, the model showcases non-monotonic TTT diagrams resulting in polycrystalline structures,
with two distinct regimes limited by either crystal nucleation or growth. At high temperatures,
crystallization is limited by nucleation and results in the growth of compact crystal grains. At
low temperatures, crystal growth is influenced by glassy dynamics, and proceeds through dynamically
heterogeneous and hierarchical relaxation pathways producing fractal and ramified crystals.
To explain these phenomena, we combine the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami theory with the field
theory of nucleation, a random walk theory for crystal growth, and the dynamical facilitation theory
for glassy dynamics. The unified theory yields an analytical formula relating crystallization
timescale to the nucleation and growth rates through universal exponents governing glassy dynamics
of the model. We show that the formula with the universal exponents yields excellent agreement with
the Monte Carlo simulation data and thus, it also accounts for the non-monotonic TTT diagrams produced
by the model. Both the model and theory can be used to understand structural ordering in various glassy
systems including bulk metallic glass alloys, organic molecules, and colloidal suspensions.
