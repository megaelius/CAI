Describing the way strongly interacting quantum systems approach thermal equilibrium remains
an important open problem. Recent works discovered systems in which thermalization rates may depend
very sensitively on the initial conditions, via a mechanism reminiscent of quantum scars in chaotic
billiards. While strongly interacting systems do not always have an obvious quasiclassical limit,
time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) allows one to project the unitary dynamics onto the
matrix-product state manifold, resulting in a classical nonlinear dynamical system. We show that
such dynamical systems exhibit a mixed phase space which includes both regular and chaotic regions.
Provided TDVP errors are small, the mixed phase space leaves a footprint on the exact dynamics of
the quantum model: when the system is initialized in a state situated on the stable periodic orbit,
it exhibits robust many-body revivals. Intriguingly, the initial state giving rise to strongest
revivals may be entangled. Surprisingly, even when TDVP errors are large, as in the thermalizing
Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, initializing the system in the regular region
of phase space leads to a slowdown of thermalization. Our work establishes TDVP as a method for identifying
interacting quantum systems with anomalous dynamics. Mixed-phase space classical variational
equations allow one to find slowly-thermalizing initial conditions in interacting models. These
results provide an intriguing connection between classical and quantum chaos, pointing towards
possible extensions of classical KAM theorem to quantum systems.
