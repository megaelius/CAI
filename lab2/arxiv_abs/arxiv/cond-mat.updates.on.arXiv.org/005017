The realization of antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations in ultracold fermionic atoms on an optical
lattice is a significant achievement. Experiments have been carried out in one, two, and three dimensions,
and have also studied anisotropic configurations with stronger tunneling in some lattice directions.
Such anisotropy is relevant to the physics of cuprate superconductors and other strongly correlated
materials. Moreover, this anisotropy might be harnessed to enhance AF order. Here we investigate
a simple realization of anisotropy in the 3D Hubbard model in which the tunneling between planes,
$t_\perp$, is unequal to the intraplane tunneling $t$. This model interpolates between the three-dimensional
isotropic ($t_\perp = t$) and two-dimensional ($t_\perp =0$) systems. We show that at fixed interaction
strength to tunneling ratio ($U/t$), anisotropy can enhance the magnetic structure factor relative
to both 2D and 3D results. However, this enhancement occurs at interaction strengths below those
for which the N\'eel temperature $T_{\rm N\acute{e}el}$ is largest, in such a way that the structure
factor cannot be made to exceed its value in isotropic 3D systems at the optimal $U/t$. We characterize
the 2D-3D crossover in terms of the magnetic structure factor, real space spin correlations, number
of doubly-occupied sites, and thermodynamic observables. An interesting implication of our results
stems from the entropy's dependence on anisotropy. As the system evolves from 3D to 2D, the entropy
at a fixed temperature increases. Correspondingly, at fixed entropy, the temperature will decrease
going from 3D to 2D. This suggests a cooling protocol in which the dimensionality is adiabatically
changed from 3D to 2D.
