Gravity-driven size segregation is important in mountain streams where a wide range of grain sizes
are transported as bedload. More particularly, vertical size segregation is a multi-scale process
that originates in interactions at the scale of particles with important morphological consequences
on the reach scale. To address this issue, a volume-averaged multi-phase flow model for immersed
bidisperse granular flows was developed based on an interparticle segregation force (Guillard
et al. 2016) and a granular Stokesian drag force (Tripathi and Khakhar 2013). An advection-diffusion
model was derived from this model yielding parametrisations for the advection and diffusion coefficients
based on the interparticle interactions. This approach makes it possible to bridge the gap between
grain-scale physics and continuum modelling. Both models were successfully tested against existing
Discrete Element Model (DEM) simulations of size segregation in bedload transport (Chassagne
et al. 2020). Through a detailed investigation of the granular forces, it is demonstrated that the
observed scaling of the advection and diffusion coefficients with the inertial number can be explained
by the granular drag force dependency on the viscosity. The drag coefficient was shown to be linearly
dependent on the small particle concentration. The scaling relationship of the segregation force
with the friction coefficient is confirmed and additional non-trivial dependencies including
the inertial number and small particle concentration are identified. Lastly, adding a size ratio
dependency in the segregation force perfectly reproduces the DEM results for a large range of small
particle concentrations and size-ratios.
