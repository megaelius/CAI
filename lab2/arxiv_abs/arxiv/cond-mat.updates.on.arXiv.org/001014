Topologically protected superfluid phases of $^3$He allow one to simulate many important aspects
of relativistic quantum field theories and quantum gravity in condensed matter. Here we discuss
a topological Lifshitz transition of the effective quantum vacuum in which the determinant of the
tetrad field changes sign through a crossing to a vacuum state with a degenerate fermionic metric.
Such a transition is realized in polar distorted superfluid $^3$He-A in terms of the effective tetrad
fields emerging in the vicinity of the superfluid gap nodes: the tetrads of the Weyl points in the
chiral A-phase of $^3$He and the degenerate tetrad in the vicinity of a Dirac nodal line in the polar
phase of $^3$He. The continuous phase transition from the $A$-phase to the polar phase, i.e. in the
transition from the Weyl nodes to the Dirac nodal line and back, allows one to follow the behavior
of the fermionic and bosonic effective actions when the sign of the tetrad determinant changes,
and the effective chiral space-time transforms to anti-chiral "anti-spacetime". This condensed
matter realization demonstrates that while the original fermionic action is analytic across the
transition, the effective action for the orbital degrees of freedom (pseudo-EM) fields and gravity
have non-analytic behavior. In particular, the action for the pseudo-EM field in the vacuum with
Weyl fermions (A-phase) contains the modulus of the tetrad determinant. In the vacuum with the degenerate
metric (polar phase) the nodal line is effectively a family of $2+1$d Dirac fermion patches, which
leads to a non-analytic $(B^2-E^2)^{3/4}$ QED action in the vicinity of the Dirac line.
