In different materials, orientationally controlled assembling of building blocks results in
the development of nanoparticles and particles of geometrical shapes. These trends are pronounced
in atoms of metallic behavior. In the development process of nanoparticles and particles, atoms
configure in monolayer assembly at first place. At air-solution interface, when triangle-shaped
packets of nano energy were supplied to compact monolayer assembly of atoms, atoms bound in the shape
of nano energy. Blocks of joined triangular shape tiny particles developed when tuned bipolar pulses
were examined. On exertion of uneven force to electrons of atoms at point of contact, a block of joined
tiny-sized particles separated into two tiny particles having their equilateral triangular shape.
On electronically flat solution surface, atoms of tiny particles when in re-crystallization state
elongate at equal rate. From the centre of each transitional behavior atom, electrons of east-west
poles deal with even exertion of surface force along the opposite poles. Thus, arrays of bound atoms
formed a tiny-shaped particle developed in its structures of smooth elements. Such structures
of smooth elements flatten by the forced energy of traveled photons along the air-solution interface.
Originally, binding of solid atoms, when in neutral state, is to be anticipated under the execution
of confined inter-state electron dynamics, where they possess ground point below the typical level
of ground surface. Nevertheless, such developed tiny particles when arriving from suitable zones
of solution surface, they pack through the assembling of their structures of smooth elements to
develop a mono layer shape of developing nanoparticle or particle of geometrical shape. In solution
surface, a shaped mono layer adheres to the underneath shaped mono layer in gap of few microseconds
where exerting force ...
