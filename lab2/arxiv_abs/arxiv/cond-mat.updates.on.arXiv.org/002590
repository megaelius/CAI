We fabricated epitaxial YBCO thin films on single crystal STO, MgO and LSAT substrates. By scanning
across patterned YBCO microbridges with a $30\,\mathrm{keV}$ focused He ion beam (He-FIB), we
create Josephson barriers with properties that can be adjusted by the He irradiation dose $D$. For
"medium" dose $D\approx 200 \ldots 1000\,\mathrm{ions/nm}$, we obtain current-voltage characteristics
(IVCs) at $4.2\,\mathrm{K}$ that are well described by the resistively and capacitively shunted
junction model with critical current density $j_\mathrm{c}=10^4 \ldots 10^6\,\mathrm{A/cm^2}$
and with excess current for high $j_{\rm c}$. Devices on MgO and LSAT show non-hysteretic IVCs, while
devices on STO show a small hysteresis. "Low" dose $D\lesssim 150\,\mathrm{ions/nm}$ yields $j_{\rm
c}\gtrsim 10^6\,\mathrm{A/cm^2}$ and flux-flow-type IVCs. $j_{\rm c}(D)$ decays exponentially,
but significantly faster for devices on LSAT. Moreover, the characteristic voltage $V_{\rm c}$
scales $\propto j_{\rm c}^{1/2}$. He-FIB irradiation with "high" dose $D\gtrsim 1000\,\mathrm{ions/nm}$
produces barriers with $j_{\rm c}=0$ and high resistance $10\,\mathrm{k\Omega}\ldots1\,\mathrm{G\Omega}$
at $4.2\,\mathrm{K}$. This provides the possibility to write highly resistive walls or areas into
YBCO using a He-FIB. Transmission electron microscopy shows that irradiated areas stay crystalline
for "low" and "medium" dose but become amorphous for "high" dose. Finally, we have "drawn" complete
superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) using a He-FIB. We have used medium dose
to produce Josephson junctions and high dose to define the SQUID hole. The SQUIDs show high performance
with a root-mean-square spectral density of flux noise in the thermal white noise limit $S_{\Phi,w}^{1/2}\le
500\,{\rm n}\Phi_0/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for a device with inductance $L = 20\,\mathrm{pH}$.
