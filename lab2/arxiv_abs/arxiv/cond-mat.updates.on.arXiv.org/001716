Plastic deformation, at all strain rates, is accommodated by the collective motion of crystalline
defects known as dislocations. Here, we extend an analysis for the energetic stability of a straight
dislocation, the so-called line tension ($\Gamma$), to steady-state moving dislocations within
elastically anisotropic media. Upon simplification to isotropy, our model reduces to an explicit
analytical form yielding insight into the behavior of $\Gamma$ with increasing velocity. We find
that at the first shear wave speed within an isotropic solid, the screw dislocation line tension
diverges positively indicating infinite stability. The edge dislocation line tension, on the
other hand, changes sign at approximately $80\%$ of the first shear wave speed, and subsequently
diverges negatively indicating that the straight configuration is energetically unstable. In
anisotropic crystals, the dependence of $\Gamma$ on the dislocation velocity is significantly
more complex; At velocities approaching the first shear wave speed within the plane of the crystal
defined by the dislocation line, $\Gamma$ tends to diverge, with the sign of the divergence strongly
dependent on both the elastic properties of the crystal, and the orientation of the dislocation
line. We interpret our analyses within the context of recent molecular dynamics simulations (MD)
of the motion of dislocations near the first shear wave speed. Both the simulations and our analyses
are indicative of instabilities of nominally edge dislocations within fcc crystals approaching
the first shear wave speed. We apply our analyses towards predicting the behavior of dislocations
within bcc crystals in the vicinity of the first shear wave speed.
