We report $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) / nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies on LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$. There are two superconducting
domes in this material. The first one appears at 0.03 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 0.2 with $T_{\rm c}$$^{max}$
= 27 K, and the second one at 0.25 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 0.75 with $T_{\rm c}$$^{max}$ = 30 K. By NMR and TEM,
we demonstrate that a $C4$-to-$C2$ structural phase transition (SPT) takes place above both domes,
with the transition temperature $T_{\rm s}$ varying strongly with $x$. In the first dome, the SPT
is followed by an antiferromagnetic (AF) transition, but neither AF order nor low-energy spin fluctuations
are found in the second dome. In LaFeAsO$_{0.97}$F$_{0.03}$, we find that AF order and superconductivity
coexist microscopically via $^{75}$As nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/$T_1$) measurements.
In the coexisting region, 1/$T_1$ decreases at $T_{\rm c}$ but becomes to be proportional to $T$
below 0.6$T_{\rm c}$, indicating gapless excitations. Therefore, in contrast to the early reports,
the obtained phase diagram for $x \leq$ 0.2 is quite similar to the doped BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ system.
The electrical resistivity in the second dome can be fitted by $\rho = {{\rho }_{0}}+A{{T}^{n}}$
with $n$ = 1 and a maximal coefficient $A$ at around $x_{opt}$ = 0.5$\sim$0.55 where $T_{\rm s}$ extrapolates
to zero and $T_{\rm c}$ is the maximal, which suggest the importance of quantum critical fluctuations
associated with the SPT. We have constructed a complete phase diagram of LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$,
which provides insight into the relationship between SPT, antiferromagnetism and superconductivity.
