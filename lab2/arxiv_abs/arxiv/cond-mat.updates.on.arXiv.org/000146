The mechanisms and efficiency of charge transport in lithium peroxide (Li2O2) are key factors in
understanding the performance of non-aqueous Li-air batteries. Towards revealing these mechanisms,
here we use first-principles calculations to predict the concentrations and mobilities of charge
carriers and intrinsic defects in Li2O2 as a function of cell voltage. Our calculations reveal that
changes in the charge state of O2 dimers controls the defect chemistry and conductivity of Li2O2.
Negative lithium vacancies (missing Li+) and small hole polarons are identified as the dominant
charge carriers. The electronic conductivity associated with polaron hopping (5 x 10-20 S/cm)
is comparable to the ionic conductivity arising from the migration of Li-ions (4 x 10-19 S/cm), suggesting
that charge transport in Li2O2 occurs through a mixture of ionic and polaronic contributions. These
data indicate that the bulk regions of crystalline Li2O2 are insulating, with appreciable charge
transport occurring only at moderately high charging potentials that drive partial delithiation.
The implications of limited charge transport on discharge and recharge mechanisms are discussed,
and a two-stage charging process linking charge transport, discharge product morphology, and
overpotentials is described. We conclude that achieving both high discharge capacities and efficient
charging will depend upon access to alternative mechanisms that bypass bulk charge transport.
More generally, we describe how the presence of a species that can change charge state - e.g., O2 dimers
in alkaline metal-based peroxides - may impact rechargeability in metal-air batteries.
