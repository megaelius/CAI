The development of Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) oxides as oxygen exchange and transport materials will
benefit from mechanistic understanding of how oxygen transports through these materials. Using
Density Functional Theory, we found there are two distinct oxygen interstitial diffusion mechanisms
involving two different oxygen interstitial species that can be active in La2-xSrxNiO4+delta,
and, we believe, in hyperstoichiometric RP oxides in general. The first mechanism is the previously
proposed interstitialcy-mediated mechanism, which consists of diffusing oxide interstitials.
The second mechanism is newly discovered in this work, and consists of both oxide and peroxide interstitial
species. This mechanism exhibits a similar or possibly lower migration barrier than the interstitialcy
mechanism for high oxidation states. Which mechanism contributes to the oxygen interstitial diffusion
is the result of the change in relative stability between the oxide interstitial and peroxide interstitial.
The stability of the oxide and peroxide, and the competition between the two oxygen diffusion mechanisms,
is sensitive to the overall oxidation state of the system. Therefore, the oxygen diffusion mechanism
is a function of the material composition, oxygen off-stoichiometry, operating temperature and
oxygen partial pressure. We also examined the effect of epitaxial strain on both oxygen diffusion
mechanisms, and found that tensile and compressive epitaxial strain of up to 2% had less than 100
meV/(% strain) effects on oxygen interstitial formation, migration, and activation energies,
and that total achievable activation energy reductions are likely less than 100 meV for -2% to +2%
epitaxial strain. The presented understanding of factors governing interstitial oxygen diffusion
has significant implications for the engineering of RP oxides in numerous alternative energy technologies.
