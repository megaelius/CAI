Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a critical material for 2D electronic devices for graphene and
has attracted a considerable amount of attention owing to its structural similarity and semiconducting
property. However, modifying its wide-band gap is a challenge. Hydrogenation is a potential method
of altering the electrical properties, although is seldom experimentally measured. Here, the
complex permittivity of h-BN after various hydrogen treatments have been investigated. For untreated
h-BN, a frequency independent dielectric constant was measured ($\sim4.2 \pm0.2$) and an immeasurably
low dielectric loss, demonstrating the ideal dielectric nature of h-BN across the $10^3$ to $10^{10}$
Hz range. However, after atomic H-plasma treatment in a microwave chemical vapour deposition (CVD)
reactor, the complex permittivity amplifies dramatically, introducing dielectric dispersion
through Debye-type dielectric relaxations ($\varepsilon_{\textrm{s}}\approx20\pm2$, $\varepsilon_{\infty}\approx4.2\pm0.2$)
and a percolating long range conductivity ($\sim0.32$ mS/m). Annealing in molecular hydrogen
at similar CVD temperatures showed minimal effect. Raman spectroscopy also detected minimal change
in all samples, implying the increase is not due to other phases. This leads to the experimental conclusion
that hydrogenation, through atomic H-plasma treatment, results in a moderate increase in room
temperature electrical conductivity, an associated finite dielectric loss factor. The potential
as a tunable wide-band gap semiconductor is highlighted however for insulating dielectric substrate
applications, microwave CVD may destroy these desirable properties.
