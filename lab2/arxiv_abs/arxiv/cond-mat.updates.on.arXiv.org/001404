In this work we study shock-induced plasticity in Mo single crystals, impacted along the <110> crystal
orientation. In particular, the shear relaxation behind the shock front is quantitatively inspected.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to simulate the deformation during shock, followed
by post-processing to identify and quantify the dislocation lines nucleated behind the shock front.
The information on the dislocation lines is ensemble averaged inside slabs of the simulation box
and over different realizations of the MD simulations, from which continuous dislocation fields
are extracted using the Discrete-to-Continuous method. The continuous dislocation fields are
correlated with the stress and strain fields obtained from the MD simulations. Based on this analysis,
we show that the elastic precursor overshoots the shear stress, after which dislocations on a specific
group of slip planes are nucleated, slightly lagging behind the elastic front. Consequently, the
resolved shear stress is relaxed, but the principal lateral stress increases. The latter leads
to an increase in the resolved shear stress on a plane parallel to the shock wave, resulting in an additional
retarded front of dislocation nucleation on planes parallel to the shock front. Finally, the two-stage
process of plasticity results in an isotropic stress state in the plane parallel to the shock wave.
The MD simulation results are employed to calculate the dislocation densities on specific slip
planes and the plastic deformation behind the shock, bridging the gap between the information on
the atomic scale and the continuum level.
