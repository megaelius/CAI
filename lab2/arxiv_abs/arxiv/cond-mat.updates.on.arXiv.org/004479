We study the sandpile model on three-dimensional spanning Ising clusters with the temperature
$T$ treated as the control parameter. By analyzing the three dimensional avalanches and their two-dimensional
projections (which show scale-invariant behavior for all temperatures), we uncover two universality
classes with different exponents (an ordinary BTW class, and SOC$_{T=\infty}$), along with a tricritical
point (at $T_c$, the critical temperature of the host) between them. The transition between these
two criticalities is induced by the transition in the support. The SOC$_{T=\infty}$ universality
class is characterized by the exponent of the avalanche size distribution $\tau^{T=\infty}=1.27\pm
0.03$, consistent with the exponent of the size distribution of the Barkhausen avalanches in amorphous
ferromagnets (Phys. Rev. L 84, 4705 (2000)). The tricritical point is characterized by its own critical
exponents. In addition to the avalanche exponents, some other quantities like the average height,
the spanning avalanche probability (SAP) and the average coordination number of the Ising clusters
change significantly the behavior at this point, and also exhibit power-law behavior in terms of
$\epsilon\equiv \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$, defining further critical exponents. Importantly the
finite size analysis for the activity (number of topplings) per site shows the scaling behavior
with exponents $\beta=0.19\pm 0.02$ and $\nu=0.75\pm 0.05$. A similar behavior is also seen for
the SAP and the average avalanche height. The fractal dimension of the external perimeter of the
two-dimensional projections of avalanches is shown to be robust against $T$ with the numerical
value $D_f=1.25\pm 0.01$.
