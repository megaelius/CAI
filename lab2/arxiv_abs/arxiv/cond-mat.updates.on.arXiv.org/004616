Even though the study of interfacial phenomena dates back to Laplace and was formalised by Gibbs,
it appears that some concepts and relations among them are still causing some confusion and debates
in the literature, particularly for interfaces involving solids. Moreover, ever since the Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations have started to be widely used in the study of surface properties, these
debates only intensified. In this work, we present a systematic description of the interfacial
properties from the thermodynamic and statistical mechanics points of view. In particular, we
link our derivations to MD simulations, describing precisely what different quantities represent
and how they can be calculated. We do not follow the usual way that consists of describing the thermodynamics
of the surfaces in general and then considering specific cases (e.g. liquid-liquid interface,
liquid-solid interface). Instead, we present our analysis of various properties of surfaces in
a hierarchical way, starting with the simplest case that we have identified: a single component
liquid-vacuum interface, and then adding more and more complications when we progress to more complex
interfaces involving solids. We propose that the term "surface tension" should not be used in the
description of surfaces and interfaces involving solids, since its meaning is ambiguous. Only
"Surface Free Energy" and "Surface Stress" are well defined and represent distinct, but related,
properties of the interfaces. We demonstrate that these quantities, as defined in thermodynamics
and measured in MD simulations, satisfy the Shuttleworth equation.
