The field of quantum Hamiltonian complexity lies at the intersection of quantum many-body physics
and computational complexity theory, with deep implications to both fields. The main object of
study is the LocalHamiltonian problem, which is concerned with estimating the ground-state energy
of a local Hamiltonian and is complete for the class QMA, a quantum generalization of the class NP.
A major challenge in the field is to understand the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian problem in
more physically natural parameter regimes. One crucial parameter in understanding the ground
space of any Hamiltonian in many-body physics is the spectral gap, which is the difference between
the smallest two eigenvalues. Despite its importance in quantum many-body physics, the role played
by the spectral gap in the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian is less well-understood. In this work,
we make progress on this question by considering the precise regime, in which one estimates the ground-state
energy to within inverse exponential precision. Computing ground-state energies precisely is
a task that is important for quantum chemistry and quantum many-body physics. In the setting of inverse-exponential
precision, there is a surprising result that the complexity of LocalHamiltonian is magnified from
QMA to PSPACE, the class of problems solvable in polynomial space. We clarify the reason behind this
boost in complexity. Specifically, we show that the full complexity of the high precision case only
comes about when the spectral gap is exponentially small. As a consequence of the proof techniques
developed to show our results, we uncover important implications for the representability and
circuit complexity of ground states of local Hamiltonians, the theory of uniqueness of quantum
witnesses, and techniques for the amplification of quantum witnesses in the presence of postselection.
