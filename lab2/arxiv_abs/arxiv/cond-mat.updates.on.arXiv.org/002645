By means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the behaviour of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide),
PNIPAM, in water at temperatures below and above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST),
including the undercooled regime. The transition between water soluble and insoluble states at
the LCST is described as a cooperative process involving an intramolecular coil-to-globule transition
preceding the aggregation of chains and the polymer precipitation. In this work we investigate
the molecular origin of such cooperativity and the evolution of the hydration pattern in the undercooled
polymer solution. The solution behaviour of an atactic 30-mer at high dilution is studied in the
temperature interval from 243 to 323 K with a favourable comparison to available experimental data.
In the PNIPAM water soluble states we detect a correlation between polymer segmental dynamics and
diffusion motion of bound water, occurring with the same activation energy. Simulation results
show that below the coil-to-globule transition temperature PNIPAM is surrounded by a network of
hydrogen bonded water molecules and that the cooperativity arises from the structuring of water
clusters in proximity to hydrophobic groups. Differently, the perturbation of the hydrogen bond
pattern involving water and amide groups occurs above the transition temperature. Altogether
these findings reveal that even above the LCST PNIPAM remains largely hydrated and that the coil-to-globule
transition is related with a significant rearrangement of the solvent in proximity of the surface
of the polymer. The comparison between the hydrogen bonding of water in the surrounding of PNIPAM
isopropyl groups and in bulk displays a decreased structuring of solvent at the hydrophobic polymer-water
interface across the transition temperature, as expected because of the topological extension
along the chain of such interface.
