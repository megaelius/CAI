The phenomenon whereby atoms deal with the positive or negative charge by losing or gaining the electron
forms the basis of familiar processes. The elements in which the atoms comprise unfilled states
can be considered as eligible for electron dynamics indicate that they can never be ionized. At required
level, solid atoms of unfilled states elongate or deform as per exerting surface force to their electrons.
At required level, gas atoms of unfilled states condense or squeeze before reaching to their possible
liquid state. The dynamics of electrons in such atoms can be for transition of states or for transition
of infinitesimal displacements. In case of inert gas atoms, an alternate process takes place. Atoms
of inert gases, when flowing at suitable rate, split into electron streams under excessive population
of photons having characteristics of current. As a result, when photons, while leaving inter-state
electron gaps of those splitting atoms, enter air-medium, their characteristics become obvious
and they expose the phenomenon of the light glow. By splitting inert gas atoms, electrons carry forced
energy of photons. When electrons impinge on underneath elongated atoms of solid at a suitable inclination
under their carried forced energy, they elongate them further. When electrons of carried forced
energy do not impinge on underneath elongated atoms at a suitable inclination, instead of elongating
further, they deform under the non-orientationally based stretching of energy knots clamped to
electrons. The splitting of inert gas atoms into electrons and their carried forced energy indicate
that silicon solar cells and other similar kind of gadgets generate photons having characteristics
of current. Different microscopic analyses of morphology and structure of specimens are due to
the...
