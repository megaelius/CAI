The discovery of superconductivity at 203K in SH$_3$ is an important step toward higher values of
$T_c$. Predictions based on state-of-the-art DFT for the electronic structure, including one
preceding experimental confirmation, showed the mechanism to be the electron-phonon interaction.
This was confirmed in optical spectroscopy measurements. For photon energies between $\sim 450$
and 600 meV in SH$_3$, the reflectance in the superconducting state is below that in its normal state.
This difference decreases as $T$ approaches $T_c$. Decreasing absorption with increasing $T$
is opposite to what is expected in ordinary metals. Such an anomalous behavior can be traced back
to the energy dependence of the superconducting density of states which is highly peaked at the energy
gap value $\Delta$ but decays back to the constant normal state value as energy is increased, on a
scale of a few $\Delta$, or by increasing $T$ towards $T=T_c$. The process of phonon-assisted optical
absorption is encoded with a knowledge of the $T$-dependence of $\Delta$, the order parameter of
the superconducting state. Should the energy of the phonon involved be very large, of order 200 meV
or more, this process offers the possibility of observing the closing of the superconducting order
parameter with $T$ at correspondingly very large energies. The very recent experimental observation
of a $T_c\simeq 250$ K in LaH$_{10}$ has further heightened interest in the hydrides. We compare
the relevant phonon structure seen in optics with related features in the real and imaginary part
of the frequency dependent gap, quasiparticle density of states, reflectance, absorption, and
optical scattering rate. The phonon structures all carry information on the $T_c$ value and the
$T$-dependence of the order parameter, and can be used to confirm that the mechanism involved in
superconductivity is the electron-phonon interaction.
