Gradient structured (GS) metals processed by severe plastic deformation techniques can be designed
to achieve simultaneously high strength and high ductility. Significant kinematic hardening
is key to their excellent strain hardening capacity which results in a favorable strength-ductility
combination. Unfortunately, no constitutive model has been established to simulate and analyze
the characteristic kinematic hardening behavior of GS metal to understand the relationship between
their microstructure and macroscopic response. In this work, we developed a deformation-mechanismbased
strain gradient plasticity model considering the plasticity heterogeneities from the grain to
the sample scale. A back stress model, which accounts for the dependency of dislocation pile-ups
on grain size, is established to describe the cyclic deformation properties of GS materials. The
established model unified the geometrically necessary dislocations accommodating internal
plasticity heterogeneities, the resulting back stress and reversible dislocations during reverse
loading into a strain gradient plasticity framework, without introducing excessive numbers of
independent material parameters. A finite element implementation of the model quantitatively
predicts the uniaxial tensile and tensile-compressive responses of a GS copper bar as well as of
a reference sample with homogeneous grain size. It is found that GS copper exhibits enhanced kinematic
hardening which results mainly from fine grains in the GS layer and contributes to the considerable
ductility of the GS material. The model allows to investigate the mechanical response and optimize
the properties of materials with various types of spatially heterogeneous grain microstructures.
