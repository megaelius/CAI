Coupling phase-stable single-cycle terahertz (THz) pulses to scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) junctions enables spatio-temporal imaging with femtosecond temporal and \r{A}ngstrom
spatial resolution. The time resolution achieved in such THz-gated STM is ultimately limited by
the sub-cycle temporal variation of the tip-enhanced THz field acting as an ultrafast voltage pulse,
and hence by the ability to feed high-frequency, broadband THz pulses into the junction. Here, we
report on the coupling of ultrabroadband (1-30 THz) single-cycle THz pulses from a spintronic THz
emitter (STE) into a metallic STM junction. We demonstrate broadband phase resolved detection
of the tip-enhanced THz waveform via THz-field-induced modulation of ultrafast photocurrents
across the junction. Comparison to the unperturbed far-field THz waveform reveals the antenna
response of the STM tip. Despite tip-induced low-pass filtering, frequencies up to 15 THz can be
detected in the enhanced near-field, resulting in THz transients with a half-cycle period of 115
fs. We further demonstrate versatile phase and polarity control of the THz waveform depending on
the STE excitation conditions and magnetization, and show that up to 2 Volts THz bias at 1 MHz repetition
rate can be achieved in the current setup. Finally, we find a nearly constant THz voltage and waveform
over a wide range of tip-sample distances, which by comparison to numerical simulations confirms
the quasi-static nature of the THz pulses. Our results demonstrate the suitability of spintronic
THz emitters for ultrafast THz-STM and provide insight into the femtosecond response of defined
nanoscale junctions.
