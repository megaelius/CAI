A pressure-induced collapse of magnetic ordering in $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ at $P_m\sim1.5- 2$
GPa has previously been interpreted as evidence for possible emergence of spin liquid states in
this hyperhoneycomb iridate, raising prospects for experimental realizations of the Kitaev model.
Based on structural data obtained at \emph{room temperature}, this magnetic transition is believed
to originate in small lattice perturbations that preserve crystal symmetry, and related changes
in bond-directional anisotropic exchange interactions. Here we report on the evolution of the
crystal structure of $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ under pressure at low temperatures ($T\leq50$ K)
and show that the suppression of magnetism coincides with a change in lattice symmetry involving
Ir-Ir dimerization. The critical pressure for dimerization shifts from 4.4(2) GPa at room temperature
to $\sim1.5-2$ GPa below 50 K. While a direct $Fddd \rightarrow C2/c$ transition is observed at room
temperature, the low temperature transitions involve new as well as coexisting dimerized phases.
Further investigation of the Ir ($L_3$/$L_2$) isotropic branching ratio in x-ray absorption spectra
indicates that the previously reported departure of the electronic ground state from a $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$
state is closely related to the onset of dimerized phases. In essence, our results suggest that the
predominant mechanism driving the collapse of magnetism in $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ is the pressure-induced
formation of Ir$_2$ dimers in the hyperhoneycomb network. The results further confirm the instability
of the $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ moments and related non-collinear spiral magnetic ordering against
formation of dimers in the low-temperature phase of compressed $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$.
