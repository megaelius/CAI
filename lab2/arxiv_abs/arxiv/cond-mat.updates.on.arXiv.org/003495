Recent experimental progress in the fields of cold quantum gases and ultrafast optical spectroscopy
of quantum materials allows to controllably induce and probe non-adiabatic dynamics of superconductors
and superfluids. The time-evolution of the gap function before relaxation with the lattice is determined
by the superposition of coherently evolving individual Cooper pairs within the manifold of the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wavefunction. While dynamics following an abrupt quench of
the pairing interaction strength in the single-band BCS model has been exactly solved due to the
integrability of the model, the dynamics of post-quench multi-band superconductors remain under
scrutiny. Here, we develop a generalization of the Volkov-Kogan Laplace-space perturbative method
that allows us to determine the non-adiabatic gap dynamics of two-band fully gapped superconductors
for a wide range of quench amplitudes. Our approach expands the long-time dynamics around the steady-state
asymptotic value of the gap, which is self-consistently determined, rather than around the equilibrium
value of the gap. We explicitly demonstrate that this method recovers the exact solution of the long-time
gap dynamics in the single-band case and perfectly agrees with a numerical solution of the two-band
model. We discover that dephasing of Cooper pairs from different bands leads to faster collisionless
relaxation of the gap oscillation with a power-law of $t^{-3/2}$ instead of the well-known $t^{-1/2}$
behavior found in the single-band case. Furthermore, the gap oscillations display beating patterns
arising from the existence of two different asymptotic gap values. Our results have important implications
to a variety of two-band superconductors driven out of equilibrium, such as iron-based superconductors,
MgB$_{2}$, and SrTiO$_{3}$.
