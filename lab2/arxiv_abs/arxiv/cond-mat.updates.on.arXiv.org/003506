We present exact analytical results for the distribution of shortest path lengths (DSPL) in a directed
network model that grows by node duplication. Such models are useful in the study of the structure
and growth dynamics of gene regulatory networks and scientific citation networks. Starting from
an initial seed network, at each time step a random node, referred to as a mother node, is selected
for duplication. Its daughter node is added to the network and duplicates each outgoing link of the
mother node with probability $p$. In addition, the daughter node forms a directed link to the mother
node itself. Thus, the model is referred to as the corded directed-node-duplication (DND) model.
In this network not all pairs of nodes are connected by directed paths, in spite of the fact that the
corresponding undirected network consists of a single connected component. More specifically,
in the large network limit only a diminishing fraction of pairs of nodes are connected by directed
paths. To calculate the DSPL between those pairs of nodes that are connected by directed paths we
derive a master equation for the time evolution of the probability $P_t(L=\ell)$, $\ell=1,2,\dots$,
where $\ell$ is the length of the shortest directed path. Solving the master equation, we obtain
a closed form expression for $P_t(L=\ell)$. It is found that the DSPL at time $t$ consists of a convolution
of the initial DSPL $P_0(L=\ell)$, with a Poisson distribution and a sum of Poisson distributions.
The mean distance ${\mathbb E}_t[L|L<\infty]$ between pairs of nodes which are connected by directed
paths is found to depend logarithmically on the network size $N_t$. However, since in the large network
limit the fraction of pairs of nodes that are connected by directed paths is diminishingly small,
the corded DND network is not a small-world network, unlike the corresponding undirected network.
