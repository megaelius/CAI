Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)
utilize molecular systems with a small energy splitting between singlet and triplet states. This
can either be realized in intramolecular charge transfer states of molecules with near-orthogonal
donor and acceptor moieties or in intermolecular exciplex states formed between a suitable combination
of individual donor and acceptor materials. Here, we investigate 4,4'-(9H,9'H-[3,3'-bicarbazole]-9,9'-diyl)bis(3-(trifluoromethyl)
benzonitrile) (pCNBCzoCF3), which shows intramolecular TADF but can also form exciplex states
in combination with 4,4',4''-tris[phenyl(m-tolyl)amino]triphenylamine (m-MTDATA). We observed
that orange emitting exciplex-based OLEDs also generate a sky-blue emission from the intramolecular
emitter with an intensity that can be voltage-controlled. The main drawback of all-optical methods
and electro-optical device characterization is their lack of sensitivity for the spin degree of
freedom as long as no magnetic field is applied. In this work, we use electroluminescence detected
magnetic resonance (ELDMR) to study the thermally activated spin-dependent triplet to singlet
up-conversion in operating devices. Thereby, we can investigate intermediate excited states
involved in OLED operation and derive the corresponding activation energy for both, intra- and
intermolecular based TADF. Furthermore, we can give a lower estimate for the extent of the triplet
wavefunction to be >1.2 nm. Photoluminescence detected magnetic resonance (PLDMR) reveals the
population of molecular triplets in optically excited thin films. Overall, our findings allow
us to draw a comprehensive picture of the spin-dependent emission from intra- and intermolecular
TADF OLEDs.
