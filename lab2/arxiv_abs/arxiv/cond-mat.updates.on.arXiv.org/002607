Magnetic monopoles are hypothetical elementary particles exhibiting quantized magnetic charge
$m_0=\pm(h/\mu_0e)$ and quantized magnetic flux $\Phi_0=\pm h/e$. A classic proposal for detecting
such magnetic charges is to measure the quantized jump in magnetic flux $\Phi$ threading the loop
of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) when a monopole passes through it. Naturally,
with the theoretical discovery that a plasma of emergent magnetic charges should exist in several
lanthanide-pyrochlore magnetic insulators, including Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, this SQUID technique
was proposed for their direct detection. Experimentally, this has proven extremely challenging
because of the high number density, and the generation-recombination (GR) fluctuations, of the
monopole plasma. Recently, however, theoretical advances have allowed the spectral density of
magnetic-flux noise $S_{\Phi}(\omega,T)$ due to GR fluctuations of $\pm m_*$ magnetic charge
pairs to be determined. These theories present a sequence of strikingly clear predictions for the
magnetic-flux noise signature of emergent magnetic monopoles. Here we report development of a
high-sensitivity, SQUID based flux-noise spectrometer, and consequent measurements of the frequency
and temperature dependence of $S_{\Phi}(\omega,T)$ for Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ samples. Virtually
all the elements of $S_{\Phi}(\omega,T)$ predicted for a magnetic monopole plasma, including
the existence of intense magnetization noise and its characteristic frequency and temperature
dependence, are detected directly. Moreover, comparisons of simulated and measured correlation
functions $C_{\Phi}(t)$ of the magnetic-flux noise $\Phi(t)$ imply that the motion of magnetic
charges is strongly correlated because traversal of the same trajectory by two magnetic charges
of same sign is forbidden.
