We demonstrate that the spin of a Cr atom in a quantum dot (QD) can be controlled optically and we discuss
the main properties of this single spin system. The photoluminescence of individual Cr-doped QDs
and their evolution in magnetic field reveal a large magnetic anisotropy of the Cr spin induced by
local strain. This results in a splitting of the Cr spin states and in a thermalization on the lower
energy states states S$_z$=0 and S$_z$=$\pm$1. The magneto-optical properties of Cr-doped QDs
can be modelled by an effective spin Hamiltonian including the spin to strain coupling and the influence
of the QD symmetry. We also show that a single Cr spin can be prepared by resonant optical pumping.
Monitoring the intensity of the resonant fluorescence of the QD during this process permits to probe
the dynamics of the optical initialization of the spin. Hole-Cr flip-flops induced by an interplay
of the hole-Cr exchange interaction and the coupling with acoustic phonons are the main source of
relaxation that explains the efficient resonant optical pumping. The Cr spin relaxation time is
measured in the $\mu s$ range. We evidence that a Cr spin couples to non-equilibrium acoustic phonons
generated during the optical excitation inside or near the QD). Finally we show that the energy of
any spin state of an individual Cr atom can be independently tuned by a resonant single mode laser
through the optical Stark effect. All these properties make Cr-doped QDs very promising for the
development of hybrid spin-mechanical systems where a coherent mechanical driving of an individual
spin in an oscillator is required.
