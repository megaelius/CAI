Heat transfer between bodies separated by nanoscale vacuum gap distances has been extensively
studied for potential applications in thermal management, energy conversion and data storage.
For vacuum gap distances down to 20 nm, state-of-the-art experiments demonstrated that heat transport
is mediated by near-field thermal radiation, which can exceed Planck's blackbody limit due to the
tunneling of evanescent electromagnetic waves. However, at sub-10-nm vacuum gap distances, current
measurements are in disagreement on the mechanisms driving thermal transport. While it has been
hypothesized that acoustic phonon transport across single-digit nanometre vacuum gaps (or acoustic
phonon tunneling) can dominate heat transfer, the underlying physics of this phenomenon and its
experimental demonstration are still unexplored. Here, we use a custom-built high-vacuum shear
force microscope (HV-SFM) to measure heat transfer between a silicon (Si) tip and a feedback-controlled
platinum (Pt) nanoheater in the near-contact, asperity-contact, and bulk-contact regimes. We
demonstrate that in the near-contact regime (i.e., single-digit nanometre or smaller vacuum gaps
before making asperity contact), heat transfer between Si and Pt surfaces is dominated by force-induced
acoustic phonon transport that exceeds near-field thermal radiation predictions by up to three
orders of magnitude. The measured thermal conductance shows a gap dependence of $d^{-5.7\pm1.1}$
in the near-contact regime, which is consistent with acoustic phonon transport modelling based
on the atomistic Green's function (AGF) framework. Our work suggests the possibility of engineering
heat transfer across single-digit nanometre vacuum gaps with external force stimuli, which can
make transformative impacts to the development of emerging thermal management technologies.
