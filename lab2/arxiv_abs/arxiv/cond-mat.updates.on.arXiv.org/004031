Advancing and receding angles are physical quantities frequently measured to characterize the
wetting properties of a rough surface. Thermodynamically, the advancing and receding angles are
often interpreted as the maximum and minimum contact angles that can be formed by a droplet without
losing its stability. Despite intensive research on wetting of rough surfaces, the gravitational
effect on these angles has been overlooked because most studies have considered droplets smaller
than the capillary length. In this study, however, by combining theoretical and numerical modeling,
we show that the shape of a droplet smaller than the capillary length can be substantially modified
by gravity under advancing and receding conditions. First, based on the Laplace pressure equation,
we predict the shape of a two-dimensional Cassie-Baxter droplet on a textured surface with gravity
at each pinning point. Then the stability of the droplet is tested by examining the interference
between the liquid surface and neighboring pillars as well as analyzing the free energy change upon
depinning. Interestingly, it turns out that the apparent contact angles under advancing and receding
conditions are not affected by gravity, while the overall shape of a droplet and the position of the
pinning point is affected by gravity. In addition, the advancing and receding of the droplet with
continuously increasing or decreasing volume is analyzed, and it is showed that the gravitational
effect plays a key role on the movement of the droplet tip. Finally, the theoretical predictions
were validated against line-tension based front tracking modeling that seamlessly captures the
attachment and detachment between the liquid surface and the solid substrate.
