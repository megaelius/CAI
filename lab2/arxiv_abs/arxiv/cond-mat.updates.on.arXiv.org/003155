Using two pairs of lattice equations deduced from a microscopic dipole lattice model taking into
account electronic polarization (EP) of ions and local field effects (LFEs) self-consistently,
in-plane and out-of-plane optical vibrations in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal BN are studied
theoretically. The three mutually independent coefficients of either pair of lattice equations
are determined by a set of three generally known quantities such as the 2D electronic and static susceptibilities
and phonon frequency, making the lattice equations very useful for calculating the lattice dynamical
properties. Explicit expressions are obtained for lattice vibrational energy density, and phonon
dispersion, group velocity and density of states. The transparent phonon dispersion relations
describe the previous numerical calculations very well, and the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon
dispersion relation is identical to the analytical expression of Sohier {\it et al}. [Nano Lett.
{\bf 17}, 3758 (2017)]. The out-of-plane phonon frequency is finite owing to ionic EP. A 2D lattice
dielectric function $\epsilon(k,\omega)$ is derived--due solely to the LO vibrations--which
also allows the LO phonon dispersion to be rederived simply from $\epsilon(k,\omega)=0$, similar
to the bulk case. A 2D Lyddane--Sachs--Teller relation and a frequency--susceptibility relation
are obtained for the in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations, respectively, connecting the phonon
frequencies to the 2D dielectric functions or susceptibilities. Using three first-principles
calculated parameters, the lattice dynamical properties are studied comprehensively, particular
attention being paid to the EP and LFEs. The ionic EP and LFEs should be included simultaneously,
but otherwise neglecting either or both causes large discrepancies to the calculated dynamical
properties.
