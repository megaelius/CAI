We study the effect of electron-acoustic phonon interactions in twisted bilayer graphene on resistivity
in the high-temperature transport and superconductivity in the low-temperature phase diagram.
We theoretically show that twisted bilayer graphene should have an enhanced and strongly twist-angle
dependent linear-in-temperature resistivity in the metallic regime with the resistivity magnitude
increasing as the twist angle approaches the magic angle. The slope of the resistivity versus temperature
could approach one hundred ohms per kelvin with a strong angle dependence, but with a rather weak
dependence on the carrier density. This higher-temperature density-independent linear-in-$T$
resistivity crosses over to a $T^4$ dependence at a low density-dependent characteristic temperature,
becoming unimportant at low temperatures. This angle-tuned resistivity enhancement arises from
the huge increase in the effective electron-acoustic phonon coupling in the system due to the suppression
of graphene Fermi velocity induced by the flatband condition in the moir\'e superlattice system.
Our calculated temperature dependence is reminiscent of the so-called `strange metal' transport
behavior except that it is arising from the ordinary electron-phonon coupling in a rather unusual
parameter space due to the generic moir\'e flatband structure of twisted bilayer graphene. We also
show that the same enhanced electron-acoustic phonon coupling also mediates effective attractive
interactions in $s$, $p$, $d$ and $f$ pairing channels with a theoretical superconducting transition
temperature on the order of $\sim$5 K near magic angle. The fact that ordinary acoustic phonons can
produce exotic non-$s$-wave superconducting pairing arises from the unusual symmetries of the
system.
