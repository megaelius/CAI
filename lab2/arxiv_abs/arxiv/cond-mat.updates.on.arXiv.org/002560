In presence of strong enough disorder one dimensional systems of interacting spinless fermions
at non-zero filling factor are known to be in a many body localized phase. When represented in Fock
space, the Hamiltonian of such a system looks like that of a single particle hopping on a Fock lattice
in the presence of a random disordered potential. The coordination number of the Fock lattice increases
linearly with the system size L in 1D. Thus in the thermodynamic limit, the disordered interacting
problem in 1D maps on to an Anderson model with infinite coordination number. Despite this, this
system displays localization which appears counterintuitive. A close observation of the on-site
disorders on the Fock lattice reveals a large degree of correlation among them as they are derived
from an exponentially smaller number of on-site disorders in real space. This indicates that the
correlations between the on-site disorders on a Fock lattice has a strong effect on the localization
properties of the corresponding many-body system. In this work we perform a systematic quantitative
exploration of the nature of correlations of the Fock space potential required for localization.
Without changing the typical strength of the on-site disorders in Fock lattice we show that changing
the correlation strength can induce thermalization or localization in systems. From among the
various functional forms of correlations we study through exact diagonalization, we find that
only the linear variation of correlations with Hamming distance in Fock space is able to drive a thermal-MBL
phase transition where the transition is driven by the correlation strength. Systems with the other
forms of correlations we study are found to be ergodic.
