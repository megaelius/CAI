The ongoing depletion of fossil fuels has led to an intensive search for additional renewable energy
sources. Solar-based technologies could provide sufficient energy to satisfy the global economic
demands in the near future. Photovoltaic (PV) cells are the most promising man-made devices for
direct solar energy utilization. Understanding the charge separation and charge transport in
PV materials at a molecular level is crucial for improving the efficiency of the solar cells. Here,
we use light-induced EPR spectroscopy combined with DFT calculations to study the electronic structure
of charge separated states in blends of polymers (P3HT, PCDTBT, and PTB7) and fullerene derivatives
(C60-PCBM and C70-PCBM). Solar cells made with the same composites as active layers show power conversion
efficiencies of 3.3% (P3HT), 6.1% (PCDTBT), and 7.3% (PTB7), respectively. Under illumination
of these composites, two paramagnetic species are formed due to photo-induced electron transfer
between the conjugated polymer and the fullerene. They are the positive, P+, and negative, P-, polarons
on the polymer backbone and fullerene cage, respectively, and correspond to radical cations and
radical anions. Using the high spectral resolution of high-frequency EPR (130 GHz), the EPR spectra
of these species were resolved and principal components of the g-tensors were assigned. Light-induced
pulsed ENDOR spectroscopy allowed the determination of 1H hyperfine coupling constants of photogenerated
positive and negative polarons. The experimental results obtained for the different polymer-fullerene
composites have been compared with DFT calculations, revealing that in all three systems the positive
polaron is distributed over distances of 40-60 A on the polymer chain. This corresponds to about
15 thiophene units for P3HT, approximately three units PCDTBT, and about three to four units for
PTB7. No spin density...
