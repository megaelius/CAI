Multilayer networks allow one to represent diverse and coupled connectivity patterns --- e.g.,
time-dependence, multiple subsystems, or both --- that arise in many applications and which are
difficult or awkward to incorporate into standard network representations. In the study of multilayer
networks, it is important to investigate mesoscale (i.e., intermediate-scale) structures, such
as dense sets of nodes known as communities, to discover network features that are not apparent at
the microscale or the macroscale. The ill-defined nature of mesoscale structure and its ubiquity
in empirical networks make it crucial to develop generative models that can produce the features
that one encounters in empirical networks. Key purposes of such generative models include generating
synthetic networks with empirical properties of interest, benchmarking mesoscale-detection
methods and algorithms, and inferring structure in empirical multilayer networks. In this paper,
we introduce a framework for the construction of generative models for mesoscale structures in
multilayer networks. Our framework provides a standardized set of generative models, together
with an associated set of principles from which they are derived, for studies of mesoscale structures
in multilayer networks. It unifies and generalizes many existing models for mesoscale structures
in fully-ordered (e.g., temporal) and unordered (e.g., multiplex) multilayer networks. One can
also use it to construct generative models for mesoscale structures in partially-ordered multilayer
networks (e.g., networks that are both temporal and multiplex). Our framework has the ability to
produce many features of empirical multilayer networks, and it explicitly incorporates a user-specified
dependency structure between layers.
