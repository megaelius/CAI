A new mathematical representation for nonlinear viscoelasticity is presented based on application
of the Volterra series expansion to the general nonlinear relationship between shear stress and
shear strain history. This theoretical and experimental framework, which we call Medium Amplitude
Parallel Superposition (MAPS) Rheology, reveals a new material property, the third order complex
modulus, which describes completely the weakly nonlinear response of a viscoelastic material
in an arbitrary simple shear flow. In this first part, we discuss several theoretical aspects of
this mathematical formulation and new material property. For example, we show how MAPS measurements
can be performed in strain- or stress-controlled contexts and provide relationships between the
weakly nonlinear response functions measured in each case. We show that the MAPS response function
is a super-set of the response functions that have been previously reported in medium amplitude
oscillatory shear and parallel superposition rheology experiments. We also show how to exploit
inherent symmetries of the MAPS response function to reduce it to a minimal domain for straightforward
measurement and visualization. We compute this material property for a few constitutive models
to illustrate the potential richness of the data sets generated by MAPS experiments. Finally, we
discuss the MAPS framework in the context of some other nonlinear, time-dependent rheological
probes and explain how the MAPS methodology has a distinct advantage over these others because it
generates data embedded in a very high dimensional space without driving fluid mechanical instabilities,
and is agnostic to the flow protocol.
