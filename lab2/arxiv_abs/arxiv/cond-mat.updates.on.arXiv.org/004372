Competition between superconductivity and charge order is a recurring theme in contemporary condensed
matter physics. This is quintessentially captured in the attractive Hubbard model, a simple theoretical
model where the competition can be directly tuned. In previous studies by the current authors, it
has been suggested that the Hubbard model maps to an $SO(3)$ non-linear sigma model, where the phase
competition becomes manifest. In this article, we rigorously demonstrate this mapping and use
it to study thermal disordering of a supersolid. Starting with the attractive Hubbard model in the
presence of an orbital field, we take the limit of strong coupling where a pseudospin description
emerges. The in-plane pseudospin components represent superconducting pairing while the out-of-plane
component encodes charge density wave order. We obtain an effective spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonian with
ferromagnetic in-plane couplings and antiferromagnetic z-z couplings. In addition, the orbital
field gives rise to a textured Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that has the same periodicity
as the magnetic unit cell. In order to examine the nature of ordering in this spin model, we consider
it in the classical limit. We assume slowly varying fields, leading to the $SO(3)$ non-linear sigma
model description. As an application of these ideas, we study the nature of ordering using simulated
annealing and classical Monte Carlo simulations. The ground state represents a supersolid with
coexisting superconductivity and charge order. It can be viewed as a `meron crystal', a regular
arrangement of superconducting vortices with charge-ordered cores. The coherent overlap of core
regions gives rise to coherent long-ranged charge order. As the temperature is raised, this charge
order is lost via a sharp phase transition in the Ising universality class.
