Visualization of thermal counterflow in He II using PIV (particle image velocimetry) and PTV (particle
tracking velocimetry) is difficult because tracer particle motion can be influenced by both the
normal fluid and superfluid components of He II as well as the quantized vortex tangle. For instance,
an early PTV experiment observed particles moving at the normal fluid velocity $v_n$, while a PIV
experiment observed particles moving at $v_n/2$, though the range of heat flux applied in these
experiments differed by an order of magnitude. To resolve this apparent discrepancy and explore
statistics of particle motion in thermal counterflow, we have applied PTV to a wide range of heat
flux at several fluid temperatures. We introduce a scheme for analyzing the velocity of particles
presumably moving with the normal fluid separately from those presumably influenced by the vortex
tangle. Our results show two distinct peaks in the streamwise particle velocity PDF (probability
density function) for lower heat flux, one centered at the normal fluid velocity $v_n$ ("G2") and
one near $v_n/2$ ("G1"). For higher heat flux there is a single peak centered near $v_n/2$ ("G3").
Using our separation scheme we show there is no size difference between particles contributing
to G1 and G2. We also show that non-classical features of the transverse velocity PDF arise entirely
from G1, while the corresponding PDF for G2 exhibits classical Gaussian form. G2 transverse velocity
fluctuation, backed up by second sound attenuation in decaying counterflow, suggests large scale
turbulence in the normal fluid is absent from the two peak region. We offer a brief discussion of physical
mechanisms that may be responsible for our observations, revealing that G1 velocity fluctuations
may be linked to fluctuations of vortex line velocity, and suggest numerical simulations that may
reveal underlying physics in detail.
