A prototypical model of a one-dimensional metallic monatomic solid containing noninteracting
electrons is studied, where the argument of the cosine potential energy periodic with the lattice
contains the first reciprocal lattice vector G1 = 2 pi/a, where a is the lattice constant. The time-independent
Schroedinger equation can be written in reduced variables as a Mathieu equation for which numerically-exact
solutions for the band structure and wave functions are obtained. The band structure has band gaps
that increase with increasing amplitude q of the cosine potential. In the extended-zone scheme,
the energy gaps decrease with increasing index n of the Brillouin-zone boundary ka = n pi where k is
the crystal momentum of the electron. The wave functions of the band electron are derived for various
combinations of k and q as complex combinations of the real Mathieu functions with even and odd parity
and the normalization factor is discussed. The wave functions at the bottoms and tops of the bands
are found to be real or imaginary, respectively, corresponding to standing waves at these energies.
Irrespective of the wave vector k within the first Brillouin zone, the electron probability density
is found to be periodic with the lattice with a relatively small variation versus position for different
k values. The Fourier components of the wave functions are derived versus q, which reveal multiple
reciprocal-lattice wave vector components with variable amplitudes in the wave functions unless
q = 0. The magnitudes of the Fourier components are found to decrease exponentially as a power of n
for n ~ 3 to 45 for ka = pi/2 and q = 2 and a precise fit is obtained to the data. Finally, the band structure
is calculated from the central equation and compared to the numerically-exact band structure.
