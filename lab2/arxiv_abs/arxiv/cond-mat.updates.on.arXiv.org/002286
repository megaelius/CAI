We study the formation of magnetic clusters in frustrated magnets in their cooperative paramagnetic
regime. For this purpose, we consider the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ classical Heisenberg model on kagome
and pyrochlore lattices with $J_2 = J_3=J$. In the absence of farther-neighbor couplings, $J=0$,
the system is in the Coulomb phase with magnetic correlations well characterized by pinch-point
singularities. Farther-neighbor couplings lead to the formation of magnetic clusters, which
can be interpreted as a counterpart of topological-charge clusters in Ising frustrated magnets
[T. Mizoguchi, L. D. C. Jaubert and M. Udagawa, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 119}, 077207 (2017)]. The concomitant
static and dynamical magnetic structure factors, respectively $\mathcal{S}({\bm{q}})$ and
$\mathcal{S}({\bm{q}},\omega)$, develop half-moon patterns. As $J$ increases, the continuous
nature of the Heisenberg spins enables the half-moons to coalesce into connected `star' structures
spreading across multiple Brillouin zones. These characteristic patterns are a dispersive complement
of the pinch point singularities, and signal the proximity to a Coulomb phase. Shadows of the pinch
points remain visible at finite energy, $\omega$. This opens the way to observe these clusters through
(in)elastic neutron scattering experiments. The origin of these features are clarified by complementary
methods: large-$N$ calculations, semi-classical dynamics of the Landau-Lifshitz equation,
and Monte Carlo simulations. As promising candidates to observe the clustering states, we revisit
the origin of "spin molecules" observed in a family of spinel oxides $AB_2$O$_4$ ($A=$ Zn, Hg, Mg,
$B=$ Cr, Fe).
