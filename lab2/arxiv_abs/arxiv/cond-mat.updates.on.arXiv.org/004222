Zircon is the most frequently used mineral for dating terrestrial and extraterrestrial rocks.
However, the system of zircon in mafic/ultramafic melts has been rarely explored experimentally
and most existing models based on the felsic, intermediate and/or synthetic systems are probably
not applicable for prediction of zircon survival in terrestrial shallow asthenosphere. In order
to determine the zircon stability in such natural systems, we have performed high-temperature
experiments of zircon dissolution in natural mid-ocean ridge basaltic and synthetic haplobasaltic
melts coupled with in situ electron probe microanalyses of the experimental products at high current.
Taking into account the secondary fluorescence effect in zircon glass pairs during electron microprobe
analysis, we have calculated zirconium diffusion coefficient necessary to predict zircon survival
in asthenospheric melts of tholeiitic basalt composition. The data imply that typical 100 micron
zircons dissolve rapidly (in 10 hours) and congruently upon the reaction with basaltic melt at mantle
pressures. We observed incongruent (to crystal ZrO2 and SiO2 in melt) dissolution of zircon in natural
mid-ocean ridge basaltic melt at low pressures and in haplobasaltic melt at elevated pressure.
Our experimental data raise questions about the origin of zircons in mafic and ultramafic rocks,
in particular, in shallow oceanic asthenosphere and deep lithosphere, as well as the meaning of
the zircon-based ages estimated from the composition of these minerals. Large size zircon megacrysts
in kimberlites, peridotites, alkali basalts and other magmas suggest the fast transport and short
interaction between zircon and melt.The origin of zircon megacrysts is likely related to metasomatic
addition of Zr into mantle as any mantle melting episode should obliterate them.
