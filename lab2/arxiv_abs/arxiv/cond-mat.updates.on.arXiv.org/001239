The current-driven domain wall motion along two exchange-coupled ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular
anisotropy is studied by means of micromagnetic simulations and compared to the conventional case
of a single ferromagnetic layer. Our results, where only the lower ferromagnetic layer is subjected
to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and to the spin Hall effect, indicate that
the domain walls can be synchronously driven in the presence of a strong interlayer exchange coupling,
and that the velocity is significantly enhanced due to the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling
as compared with the single-layer case. On the contrary, when the coupling is of ferromagnetic nature,
the velocity is reduced. We provide a full micromagnetic characterization of the current-driven
motion in these multilayers, both in the absence and in the presence of longitudinal fields, and
the results are explained based on a one-dimensional model. The interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction, only necessary in this lower layer, gives the required chirality to the magnetization
textures, while the interlayer exchange coupling favors the synchronous movement of the coupled
walls by a dragging mechanism, without significant tilting of the domain wall plane. Finally, the
domain wall dynamics along curved strips is also evaluated. These results indicate that the antiferromagnetic
coupling between the ferromagnetic layers mitigates the tilting of the walls, which suggest these
systems to achieve efficient and highly packed displacement of trains of walls for spintronics
devices. A study, taking into account defects and thermal fluctuations, allows to analyze the validity
range of these claims.
