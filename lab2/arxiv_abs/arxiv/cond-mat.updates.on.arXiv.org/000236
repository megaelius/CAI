In this work a phenomenological stochastic differential equation is proposed to model the time
evolution of the radius of a pre-critical molecular cluster during nucleation (the classical order
parameter). Such a stochastic differential equation constitutes the basis for the calculation
of the (nucleation) induction time under Kramers' theory of thermally activated escape processes.
Considering the nucleation stage as a Poisson rare-event, analytical expressions for the induction
time statistics are deduced for both steady and unsteady conditions, the latter assuming the semiadiabatic
limit. These expressions can be used to identify the underlying mechanism of molecular cluster
formation (distinguishing between homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation from the nucleation
statistics is possible) as well as to predict induction times and induction time distributions.
The predictions of this model are in good agreement with experimentally measured induction times
at constant temperature, unlike the values obtained from the classical equation, but agreement
is not so good for induction time statistics. Stochastic simulations truncated to the maximum waiting
time of the experiments confirm that this fact is due to the time constraints imposed by experiments.
Correcting for this effect, the experimental and predicted curves fit remarkably well. Thus, the
proposed model seems to be a versatile tool to predict cluster size distributions, nucleation rates,
(nucleation) induction time and induction time statistics for a wide range of conditions (e.g.
time-dependent temperature, supersaturation, pH, etc.) where classical nucleation theory is
of limited applicability.
