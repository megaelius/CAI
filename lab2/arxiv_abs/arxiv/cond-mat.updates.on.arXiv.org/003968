Many molecular junctions display stochastic telegraphic switching between two distinct current
values, which is therefore an important source of fluctuations in nanoscale quantum transport.
We investigate electronic fluctuations arising via Markovian master equations; identifying
regions of non-renewal behavior due to telegraphic switching. Non-renewal behavior is characterized
by the emergence of correlations between successive first-passage times of detection in one of
the leads. Our method of including telegraphic switching is general for any source-molecule-drain
setup, but we consider three specific cases. In the first, we model stochastic transitions between
an Anderson impurity with and without an applied magnetic field $B$. The last two scenarios couple
the electronic level to a single vibrational mode via the Holstein model. We then stochastically
switch between two vibrational conformations, with different electron-phonon coupling and vibrational
frequency, which corresponds to different molecular conformations. Finally, we model the molecule
attaching and detaching from an electrode by switching between two different molecule-electrode
coupling strengths. We find, for all three cases, that including the telegraph process in the master
equation induces relatively strong positive correlations, with Pearson coefficient $p \approx
0.5$, between successive first-passage times. These correlations only appear, however, when
there is telegraphic switching between two significantly different transport scenarios, and
we show that it arises from the underlying physics of the model. We also find that, in order for correlations
to appear, the switching rate $\nu$ must be much smaller than the rate of electron transfer $\gamma$.
