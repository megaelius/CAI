Many industrial soft materials often include oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions at the core of their
formulations. By using tuneable interface stabilizing agents, such emulsions can self-assemble
into complex structures. DNA has been used for decades as a thermoresponsive highly specific binding
agent between hard and, recently, soft colloids. Up until now, emulsion droplets functionalized
with DNA had relatively low coating densities and were expensive to scale up. Here a general O/W DNA-coating
method using functional non-ionic amphiphilic block copolymers, both diblock and triblock, is
presented. The hydrophilic polyethylene glycol ends of the surfactants are functionalized with
azides, allowing for efficient, dense and controlled coupling of dibenzocyclooctane functionalized
DNA to the polymers through a strain-promoted alkyne-azide click reaction. The protocol is readily
scalable due to the triblock's commercial availability. Different production methods (ultrasonication,
microfluidics and membrane emulsification) are used with different oils (hexadecane and silicone
oil) to produce functional droplets in various size ranges (sub-micron, $\sim 20\,\mathrm{\mu
m}$ and $> 50\,\mathrm{\mu m}$), showcasing the generality of the protocol. Thermoreversible
sub-micron emulsion gels, hierarchical "raspberry" droplets and controlled droplet release
from a flat DNA-coated surface are demonstrated. The emulsion stability and polydispersity is
evaluated using dynamic light scattering and optical microscopy. The generality and simplicity
of the method opens up new applications in soft matter and biotechnological research and industrial
advances.
