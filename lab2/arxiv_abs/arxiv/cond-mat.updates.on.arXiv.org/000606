We introduce a block Lanczos (BL) recursive technique to construct quasi-one-dimensional models,
suitable for density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, from single- as well
as multiple-impurity Anderson models in any spatial dimensions. This new scheme, named BL-DMRG
method, allows us to calculate not only local but also spatially dependent static and dynamical
quantities of the ground state for general Anderson impurity models without losing elaborate geometrical
information of the lattice. We show that the BL-DMRG method can be easily extended to treat a multi-orbital
Anderson impurity model. We also show that the symmetry adapted BL bases can be utilized, when it
is appropriate, to reduce the computational cost. As a demonstration, we apply the BL-DMRG method
to three different models for graphene: (i) a single adatom on the honeycomb lattice, (ii) a substitutional
impurity in the honeycomb lattice, and (iii) an effective model for a single carbon vacancy in graphene.
Our analysis reveals that, for the particle-hole symmetric case at half filling of electron density,
the ground state of model (i) behaves as an isolated magnetic impurity with no Kondo screening while
the ground state of the other two models forms a spin singlet state. We also calculate the real-space
dependence of the spin-spin correlation functions between the impurity site and the conduction
sites for these three models. Our results clearly show that, reflecting the presence of absence
of unscreened magnetic moment at the impurity site, the spin-spin correlation functions decay
as $r^{-3}$, differently from the non-interacting limit ($r^{-2}$), for model (i) and as $ r^{-4}$,
exactly the same as the non-interacting limit, for models (ii) and (iii) in the asymptotic $r$, where
$r$ is the distance between the impurity site and the conduction site.
