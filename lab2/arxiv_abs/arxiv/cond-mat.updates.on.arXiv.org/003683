Electronic band structures dictate the mechanical, optical and electrical properties of crystalline
solids. Their experimental determination is therefore of crucial importance for technological
applications. While the spectral distribution in energy bands is routinely measured by various
techniques, it is more difficult to access the topological properties of band structures such as
the Berry phase {\gamma}. It is usually thought that measuring the Berry phase requires applying
external electromagnetic forces because these allow realizing the adiabatic transport on closed
trajectories along which quantum mechanical wave-functions pick up the Berry phase. In graphene,
the anomalous quantum Hall effect results from the Berry phase {\gamma} = {\pi} picked up by massless
relativistic electrons along cyclotron orbits and proves the existence of Dirac cones. Contradicting
this belief, we demonstrate that the Berry phase of graphene can be measured in absence of any external
magnetic field. We observe edge dislocations in the Friedel oscillations formed at hydrogen atoms
chemisorbed on graphene. Following Nye and Berry in describing these topological defects as phase
singularities of complex fields, we show that the number of additional wave-fronts in the dislocation
is a real space measurement of the pseudo spin winding, i.e. graphene's Berry phase. Since the electronic
dispersion can also be retrieved from Friedel oscillations, our study establishes the electronic
density as a powerful observable to determine both the dispersion relation and topological properties
of wavefunctions. This could have profound consequences for the study of the band-structure topology
of relativistic and gapped phases in solids.
