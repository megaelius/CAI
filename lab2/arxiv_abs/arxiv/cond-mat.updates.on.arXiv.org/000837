In the early years of the rise of graphene, Kane & Mele [Kane, C. L., and Mele, E. J., Phys. Rev. Lett.
95, 226801 (2005); id, 146802 (2005)] predicted that the symmetry-allowed spin orbit potential
in graphene gives rise to a spin-Hall insulating state. This novel electronic state of matter would
be gapped in the bulk, while supporting spin and charge transport along the sample boundaries. The
magnitude of the bulk gap, which is proportional to the spin-orbit coupling, thus determines a topological
insulator phase of matter that is distinct from any ordinary insulator. However, this intrinsic
gap has not been established experimentally in graphene to this date and theoretical controversy
exists with regard to its precise magnitude[Min, H., et al. Phys. Rev. B 74, 165310 (2006), Yao, Y.,
et al. Phys. Rev. B 75, 041401(R) (2007), Konschuh, et al. Phys. Rev. B 82, 245412 (2010), Boettger,
. J. C., et al. Phys. Rev. B 75, 121402(R) (2007)]. The gapless edge states are helical, that is, the
spin degree of freedom follows the movement of the carriers. We exploit this feature and probe the
distinct spin states experimentally, by employing microwave excitation in a resistively detected
electron spin resonance. The external light source allows us to couple the different bands, whose
imprints are reflected in the resistivity of a Hall-bar graphene structure. We develop in parallel
a model that allows us to resolve the quantum numbers and occupation of the different low-lying energy
bands of graphene, and hence, to predict and interpret the experimental signatures in the resistivity.
We present evidence of a spin-Hall insulator to Dirac semimetal phase transition and determine
the intrinsic gap to be 42 {\mu}eV, implying an experimentally accessible topological phase in
graphene.
