Populations of self-propelled mobile agents - animal groups, robot swarms or crowds of people -
that exchange information with their surrounding, host fascinating cooperative behaviors. While
in many situations of interest the agents motion is driven by the transmission of information (e.g.
the presence of an approaching predator) from neighboring peers, previous modeling efforts have
focused on situations where agents either sit on static networks, or move independently of the information
spreading across the population. Here, we introduce a reference model to tackle this current lack
of general framework. We consider mobile agents which align their direction of motion (based on
the Kuramoto dynamics) and carry an internal state governed by the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
(SIS) epidemic process, characterizing the spread of information in the population, and affecting
the way agents move in space. We show that the feedback between the agents motion and information
spreading is responsible for (i) the enhancement of both flocking and information spreading, (ii)
the emergence of complex spatial structures, or swarms, which can be controlled by the velocity
of the agents. The SIS dynamics is able to drive a flocking phase transition even in the absence of
explicit velocity-alignment, recovering a behavior reminiscent of Vicsek-like systems but featuring
macro-phase separation rather than micro-phase separation. We show that the formation of dense
swarms at low velocities reduces the epidemic threshold of information spreading with respect
to the mean field limit. By bridging together soft active matter physics and agent based modeling
of complex systems, we shed light upon a general positive feedback mechanism that crucially affects
the collective behavior of mobile agents, providing a reference framework to study realistic situations
where this mechanism is at play.
