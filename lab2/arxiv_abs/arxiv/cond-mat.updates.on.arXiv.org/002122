Controlling the shape and structure of metallic colloids is an important topic. Here, different
morphology and structure of colloidal gold particles are controlled under the investigation of
different parameters while employing pulse-based electron-photon-solution interface process.
Different gold tiny-shaped particles are developed where packets of nanoshape energy converted
monolayer assembly into their own shape depending on the ratio of pulse OFF to ON time. Tiny particles
in joined triangular-shape developed under the certain ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time. However,
under unipolar pulse, triangular-shaped tiny particles directly developed in a triangular-shape.
When the ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time was very large, the resulted particles developed in
distorted shapes while those developed at smaller values of this ratio possess geometric anisotropic
shapes. When the ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time was 3, resulted particles developed in low aspect
ratio to those developed at the inverse value of this ratio. Under the certain mechanism, atoms of
one-dimensional arrays of tiny-shaped particles convert into structures of smooth elements.
For longer pulse ON time, structures of smooth elements developed in width less than their inter-spacing
distance where travelling photons of increased density along the interface sharpen them. Due to
misalignment of elongated atoms of tiny particles, they do not recover for structures of smooth
elements even when photons are travelling along the interface, so, their structure is messed up.
Morphology and structure of tiny-sized particles and their extended shape particles under mainly
different set pulse OFF to ON time is discussed here opening multiple routes of research.
