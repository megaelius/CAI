Networks that are fragmented into small disconnected components are prevalent in a large variety
of systems. These include the secure communication networks of commercial enterprises, government
agencies and illicit organizations, as well as networks that suffered multiple failures, attacks
or epidemics. The properties of such networks resemble those of subcritical random networks, which
consist of finite components, whose sizes are non-extensive. Surprisingly, such networks do not
exhibit the small-world property that is typical in supercritical random networks, where the mean
distance between pairs of nodes scales logarithmically with the network size. Unlike supercritical
networks whose structure has been studied extensively, subcritical networks have attracted little
attention. A special feature of these networks is that the statistical and geometric properties
vary between different components and depend on their sizes and topologies. The overall statistics
of the network can be obtained by a summation over all the components with suitable weights. We use
a topological expansion to perform a systematic analysis of the degree distribution and the distribution
of shortest path lengths (DSPL) on components of given sizes and topologies in subcritical Erdos-Renyi
(ER) networks. From this expansion we obtain an exact analytical expression for the DSPL of the entire
subcritical network, in the asymptotic limit. The DSPL, which accounts for all the pairs of nodes
that reside on the same finite component (FC), is found to follow a geometric distribution of the
form $P_{\rm FC}(L=\ell|L<\infty)=(1-c)c^{\ell-1}$, where $c<1$ is the mean degree. We confirm
the convergence to this asymptotic result using computer simulations. Using the duality relations
between subcritical and supercritical ER networks, we obtain the DSPL on the non-giant components
above the percolation transition.
