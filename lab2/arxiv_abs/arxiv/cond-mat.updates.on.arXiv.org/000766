Motivated by a freely suspended graphene and polymerized membranes in soft and biological matter
we present a detailed study of a tensionless elastic sheet in the presence of thermal fluctuations
and quenched disorder. The manuscript is based on an extensive draft dating back to 1993, that was
circulated privately. It presents the general theoretical framework and calculational details
of numerous results, partial forms of which have been published in brief Letters (Le Doussal and
Radzihovsky 1992). The experimental realization of atom-thin graphene sheets has driven a resurgence
in this fascinating subject, making our dated predictions and their detailed derivations timely.
To this end we analyze the statistical mechanics of a generalized D-dimensional elastic "membrane"
embedded in d dimensions using a self-consistent screening approximation (SCSA), that has proved
to be unprecedentedly accurate in this system, exact in three complementary limits: d --> infinity,
D --> 4, and D=d. Focusing on the critical "flat" phase, for a homogeneous two-dimensional membrane
embedded in three dimensions, we predict its universal length-scale dependent roughness, elastic
moduli exponents, and a universal negative Poisson ratio of -1/3. We also extend these results to
short- and long-range correlated random heterogeneity, predicting a variety of glassy wrinkled
membrane states. Finally, we also predict and analyze a continuous crumpling transition in a "phantom"
elastic sheet. We hope that this detailed presentation of the SCSA theory will be useful for further
theoretical developments and corresponding experimental investigations on freely suspended
graphene.
