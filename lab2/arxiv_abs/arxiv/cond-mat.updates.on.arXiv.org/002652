The paper focuses on spin superfluid transport, observation of which was recently reported in antiferromagnet
Cr$_2$O$_3$ [Yuan et al., Sci. Adv. 4, eaat1098 (2018)]. The paper analyzes the role of dissipation
in transformation of spin current injected with incoherent magnons to a superfluid spin current
near the interface where spin is injected. It is shown that the Gilbert damping parameter in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
theory does not describe dissipation properly, and the dissipation parameters are calculated
from the Boltzmann equation for magnons scattered by defects. The two-fluid theory is developed
similar to the two-fluid theory for superfluids. This theory shows that the influence of temperature
variation in bulk on the superfluid spin transport (bulk Seebeck effect) is weak at low temperatures.
The scenario that the results of Yuan {\em et al.} are connected with the Seebeck effect at the interface
between the spin detector and the sample is also discussed. The Landau criterion for an antiferromagnet
put in a magnetic field is derived from the spectrum of collective spin modes. The Landau instability
starts in the gapped mode earlier than in the Goldstone gapless mode, in contrast to easy-plane ferromagnets
where the Goldstone mode becomes unstable. The structure of the magnetic vortex in the geometry
of the experiment is determined. The vortex core has the skyrmion structure with finite magnetization
component normal to the magnetic field. This magnetization creates stray magnetic fields around
the exit of the vortex line from the sample, which can be used for experimental detection of vortices.
