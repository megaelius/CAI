The growing interest in the dynamical properties of colloidal suspensions, both in equilibrium
and under an external drive such as shear or pressure flow, requires the development of accurate
methods to correctly include hydrodynamic effects due to the suspension in a solvent. In the present
work, we generalize Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD) to be able to deal with soft, polymeric
colloids. Our methods build on the knowledge of the monomer density profile that can be obtained
from monomer-resolved simulations without hydrodynamics or from theoretical arguments. We hereby
propose two different approaches. The first one simply extends the MPCD method by including in the
simulations effective monomers with a given density profile, thus neglecting monomer-monomer
interactions. The second one considers the macromolecule as a single penetrable soft colloid (PSC),
which is permeated by an inhomogeneous distribution of solvent particles. By defining an appropriate
set of rules to control the collision events between the solvent and the soft colloid, both linear
and angular momenta are exchanged. We apply these methods to the case of linear chains and star polymers
for varying monomer lengths and arm number, respectively, and compare the results for the dynamical
properties with those obtained within monomer-resolved simulations. We find that the effective
monomer method works well for linear chains, while the PSC method provides very good results for
stars. These methods pave the way to extend MPCD treatments to complex macromolecular objects such
as microgels or dendrimers and to work with soft colloids at finite concentrations.
