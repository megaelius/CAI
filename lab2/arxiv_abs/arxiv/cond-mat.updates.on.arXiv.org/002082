A topological superconductor is characterized by having a pairing gap in the bulk and gapless self-hermitian
Majorana modes at its boundary. In one dimension, these are zero-energy modes bound to the ends,
while in two dimensions these are chiral gapless modes traveling along the edge. Majorana modes
have attracted a lot of interest due to their exotic properties, which include non-abelian exchange
statistics. Progress in realizing topological superconductivity has been made by combining spin-orbit
coupling, conventional superconductivity, and magnetism. The existence of protected Majorana
modes, however, does not inherently require the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by magnetic
fields. Indeed, pairs of Majorana modes can reside at the boundary of a \emph{time-reversal-invariant}
topological superconductor (TRITOPS). It is the time-reversal symmetry which then protects this
so-called Majorana Kramers' pair from gapping out. This is analogous to the case of the two-dimensional
topological insulator, with its pair of helical gapless boundary modes, protected by time-reversal
symmetry. Realizing the TRITOPS phase will be a major step in the study of topological phases of matter.
In this paper we describe the physical properties of the TRITOPS phase, and review recent proposals
for engineering and detecting them in condensed matter systems, in one and two spatial dimensions.
We mostly focus on extrinsic superconductors, where superconductivity is introduced through
the proximity effect. We emphasize the role of interplay between attractive and repulsive electron-electron
interaction as an underlying mechanism. When discussing the detection of the TRITOPS phase, we
focus on the physical imprint of Majorana Kramers' pairs, and review proposals of transport measurement
which can reveal their existence.
