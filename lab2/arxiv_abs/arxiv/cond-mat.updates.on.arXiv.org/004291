The number of topological defects created in a system driven through a quantum phase transition
exhibits a power-law scaling with the driving time. This universal scaling law is the key prediction
of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), and testing it using a hardware-based quantum simulator is
a coveted goal of quantum information science. Here we provide such a test using quantum annealing.
Specifically, we report on extensive experimental tests of topological defect formation via the
one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model on two different D-Wave quantum annealing devices.
We find that the results are in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions for a closed
quantum system, but deviate from them quantitatively. Taking into account the effects of coupling
to a bosonic environment reduces the quantitative deviations significantly but not completely.
Other factors, such as random control errors and transient effects arising from the limited annealing
time, are likely contributors to the deviations. In addition, we probe physics beyond the KZM by
identifying signatures of universality in the distribution of the number of kinks, and again find
good qualitative agreement with the quantum simulator results. To check whether an alternative,
classical interpretation of these results is possible, we used the spin-vector Monte Carlo algorithm,
a candidate classical description of the D-Wave device We find that it too provides a qualitative
fit to both the predictions of the KZM and the quantum simulator (D-Wave device) results, but the
degree of quantitative agreement with the data from D-Wave annealing devices is better for the KZM,
a quantum theory, than for the classical spin-vector Monte Carlo. Our work provides an experimental
test of quantum critical dynamics in an open quantum system, and paves the way to new directions in
quantum simulation experiments.
