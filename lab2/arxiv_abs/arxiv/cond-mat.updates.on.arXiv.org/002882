We predict from DFT based electronic structure calculations that a monolayer made up of Carbon and
Arsenic atoms, with a chemical composition (CAs3) forms an energetically and dynamically stable
system. The optimized geometry of the monolayer is slightly different from the buckled geometric
configuration observed for silicene and germanene. The results of electronic structure calculations
predict that it is a semi-metal. Interestingly, the electronic band structure of this material
possesses a linear dispersion and a Dirac cone at the Fermi level around the high symmetric K point
in the reciprocal lattice. Thus, at low energy excitation (up to 105 meV), the charge carriers in
this system behave as massless Dirac-Fermions. Detailed analysis of partial density of state suggests
that the 2pz orbital of C atoms plays vital role in determining the nature of the states, which has
a linear dispersion and hence the Dirac cone, around the Fermi level. Thus, the electronic properties
of CAs3 monolayer are similar to those of graphene and other group IV based monolayers. In addition,
we have also investigated the influence of mechanical strain on the properties of CAs3 monolayer.
The buckled configuration becomes the planar configuration for a tensile strain beyond 18%. Our
results indicate that the monolayer possesses linear dispersion in the electronic band structure
for a wide range of mechanical strain from -12 to 20%, though the position of Dirac point may not lie
exactly at the Fermi level. The linear dispersion disappears for a compressive strain beyond -12%
& it is due to the drastic changes in the geometrical environment around C atom. Finally, we wish to
point out that CAs3 monolayer belongs to the class of Dirac materials where the behaviour of particles,
at low energy excitations, are characterized by the Dirac-like Hamiltonian rather than the Schrodinger
Hamiltonian.
