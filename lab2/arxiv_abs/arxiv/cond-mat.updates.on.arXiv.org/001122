A general procedure to investigate the elastic response and calculate the elastic constants of
stressed and unstressed materials through continuum field modeling, particularly the phase field
crystal (PFC) models, is presented. It is found that for a complete description of system response
to elastic deformation, the variations of all the quantities of lattice wave vectors, their density
amplitudes (including the corresponding anisotropic variation and degeneracy breaking), the
average atomic density, and system volume should be incorporated. The quantitative and qualitative
results of elastic constant calculations highly depend on the physical interpretation of the density
field used in the model, and also importantly, on the intrinsic pressure that usually pre-exists
in the model system. A formulation based on thermodynamics is constructed to account for the effects
caused by constant pre-existing stress during the homogeneous elastic deformation, through the
introducing of a generalized Gibbs free energy and an effective finite strain tensor used for determining
the elastic constants. The elastic properties of both solid and liquid states can be well produced
by this unified approach, as demonstrated by an analysis for the liquid state and numerical evaluations
for the bcc solid phase. The numerical calculations of bcc elastic constants and Poisson's ratio
through this method generate results that are consistent with experimental conditions, and better
match the data of bcc Fe given by molecular dynamics simulations as compared to previous work. The
general theory developed here is applicable to the study of different types of stressed or unstressed
material systems under elastic deformation.
