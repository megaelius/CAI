Homo- or hetero-junctions of two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unprecedented opportunities
for the exploration of quantum phases. Among them, heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs) are attractive because they not only inherit the strong Coulomb correlation and valley
pseudo spin from constituent monolayers, but also yield long-lived and charge separated interlayer
excitons to facilitate exciton condensation. Moreover, the great band tunability by interlayer
twist angle opens the door to a rich spectrum of phenomena, such as moir\'e exciton lattices, topological
mosaics, and correlated many-body physics associated with band flattening. Here we explore electronic
phase transitions of interlayer excitons in the MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer. We show direct evidence
for the Mott transition from an insulating exciton gas to a conducting plasma when excitation density
(n_ex) is increased above the Mott density, n_Mott ~ 3x10^12 cm^-2. The upper limit in photo-generated
density of charge separated electron/hole plasma is over 10^14 cm^-2, which is within the range
for superconductivity demonstrated before in gate-doped TMDCs. We use time and space resolved
photoluminescence imaging to map excitonic phase transitions and show that diffusivity is a strong
function of n_ex. As n_ex is lowered, the diffusion coefficient decreases by ~3 orders of magnitude
in the plasma phase, becomes nearly constant in the exciton phase, but further decreases again by
one order of magnitude as nex approaches ~ 10^11 cm^-2. The latter is consistent with interlayer
exciton trapping in periodic potential wells on the moir\'e landscape. These findings reveal fundamental
bounds for potentially achieving different interlayer exciton phases, such as moir\'e exciton
lattices, exciton condensates, conducting electron/hole plasmas, and superconductors.
