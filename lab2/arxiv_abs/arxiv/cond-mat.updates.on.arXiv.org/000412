Understanding the nature of metal/1D-semiconductor contacts such as metal/carbon nanotubes
is a fundamental scientific and technological challenge for realizing high performance transistors\cite{Francois,Franklin}.
A Schottky Barrier(SB) is usually formed at the interface of the $2D$ metal electrode with the $1D$
semiconducting carbon nanotube. As yet, experimental\cite{Appenzeller,Chen, Heinze, Derycke}
and numerical \cite{Leonard, Jimenez} studies have generally failed\cite{Svensson} to come
up with any functional relationship among the relevant variables affecting carrier transport
across the SB owing to their unique geometries and complicated electrostatics. Here, we show that
localized states called the metal induced gap states (MIGS)\cite{Tersoff,Leonard} already present
in the barrier determines the transistor drain characteristics. These states seem to have little
or no influence near the ON-state of the transistor but starts to affect the drain characteristics
strongly as the OFF-state is approached. The role of MIGS is characterized by tracking the dynamics
of the onset bias, $V_o$ of non-linear conduction in the drain characteristics with gate voltage
$V_g$. We find that $V_o$ varies with the zero-bias conductance $G_o(V_g)$ for a gate bias $V_g$
as a power-law: $V_o$ $\sim $ ${G_o(V_g)}^x$ with an exponent $x$. The origin of this power-law relationship
is tentatively suggested as a result of power-law variation of effective barrier height with $V_g$,
corroborated by previous theoretical and experimental results\cite{Appenzeller}. The influence
of MIGS states on transport is further verified independently by temperature dependent measurements.
The unexpected scaling behavior seem to be very generic for metal/CNT contact providing an experimental
forecast for designing state of the art CNT devices.
