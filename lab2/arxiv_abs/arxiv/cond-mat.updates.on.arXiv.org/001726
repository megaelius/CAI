The interactions between nanoparticles and solvents play a critical role in the formation of complex,
metastable nanostructures. However, direct observation of such interactions with high spatial
and temporal resolution is challenging with conventional liquid-cell transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) experiments. Here, a windowless system consisting of polymer nanoreactors deposited
via scanning probe block copolymer lithography (SPBCL) on an amorphous carbon film is used to investigate
the coarsening of ultrafine (1-3 nm) Au-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles as a function of solvent evaporation.
In such reactors, homogeneous Au-Pt nanoparticles are synthesized from metal ion precursors in
situ under electron irradiation. The non-uniform evaporation of the thin polymer film not only
concentrates the nanoparticles, but also accelerates the coalescence kinetics at the receding
polymer edges. Qualitative analysis of the particle forces influencing coalescence suggests
that capillary dragging by the polymer edges plays a significant role in accelerating this process.
Taken together, this work: 1) provides fundamental insight into the role of solvents in the chemistry
and coarsening behavior of nanoparticles during the synthesis of polyelemental nanostructures,
2) provides insight into how particles form via the SPBCL process, and 3) shows how SPBCL-generated
domes, instead of liquid cells, can be used to study nanoparticle formation. More generally, it
shows why conventional models of particle coarsening, which do not take into account solvent evaporation,
cannot be used to describe what is occurring in thin film, liquid-based syntheses of nanostructures.
