Over the last couple of decades, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as novel alternatives
to ionic liquids that are extensively used in synthesis of innovative materials, metal processing,
catalysis, etc. However, their usage is limited, primarily because of the large viscosity and poor
conductivity. Therefore, an understanding of the molecular origin of these properties is essential
to improve their industrial applicability. Here, we present the report of the nanoscopic diffusion
mechanism of acetamide in a DES synthesized with lithium perchlorate as studied using neutron scattering
and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques. Although, the acetamide based DES (ADES) has
remarkably lower freezing point compared to pure acetamide, the molecular mobility is found to
be enormously restricted in the former. MD simulation indicates a diffusion model with two distinct
processes, corresponding to, long range jump diffusion and localised diffusion within a restricted
volume. This model is validated by analysis of neutron scattering data in both molten acetamide
and ADES. The long range diffusion process of acetamide is slower by a factor of three in ADES in comparison
with molten acetamide. MD simulation reveals that the long range diffusion in ADES is restricted
mainly due to the formation of hydrogen bond mediated complexes between the ionic species of the
salt and acetamide molecules. Hence, the origin of higher viscosity observed in ADES can be attributed
to the complexation. The complex formation also explains the inhibition of the crystallisation
process while cooling and thereby results in depression of the freezing point of ADES.
