The two-phase composite approach of Estrin et al. (1998) describes an evolving dislocation cell
structure. Mckenzie et al. (2007) enhanced the model to capture the effects of hydrostatic pressure
and temperature during severe plastic deformation. The goal of the present study is to incorporate
this microstructural model into the macroscopic viscoplasticity framework proposed by Shutov
and Krei\ss ig (2008a). Thereby, the two-phase composite approach is examined carefully. Both
physical and numerical drawbacks are revealed and possible solutions are presented, thus leading
to a refined micro model. Moreover, some improvements concerning reliable parameter identification
are suggested as well. The material parameters of the refined micro model are identified for an aluminum
alloy using TEM cell size measurements. Then, an extension to non-proportional deformation is
performed in such a way that the evolution of dislocation densities becomes sensitive to load path
changes. Experimental findings suggest that such deformation modes can significantly influence
the evolution of microstructure, including the dissolution of cells and the reduction of total
dislocation density shortly after the load path change. In order to capture such effects, some tensor-valued
state variables are introduced which couple the refined micro model with the macroscopic viscoplasticity
model. As a result, a new system of constitutive equations is obtained. In order to demonstrate its
capability to respond to load path changes, load cases as typical for Equal Channel Angular Pressing
(ECAP) are considered. The obtained evolution of dislocation populations differs signficantly
depending on which ECAP route is applied.
