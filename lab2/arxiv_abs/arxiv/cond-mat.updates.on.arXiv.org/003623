The Planck constant, with its mathematical symbol $h$, is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics
that is associated with the quantization of light and matter. It is also of fundamental importance
to metrology, such as the definition of ohm and volt, and the latest definition of kilogram. One of
the first measurements to determine the Planck constant is based on the photoelectric effect, however,
the values thus obtained so far have exhibited a large uncertainty. The accepted value of the Planck
constant, 6.62607015$\times$10$^{-34}$ J$\cdot$s, is obtained from one of the most precise methods,
the Kibble balance, which involves quantum Hall effect, Josephson effect and the use of the International
Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK) or its copies. Here we present a precise determination of the Planck
constant by modern photoemission spectroscopy technique. Through the direct use of the Einstein's
photoelectric equation, the Planck constant is determined by measuring accurately the energy
position of the gold Fermi level using light sources with various photon wavelengths. The precision
of the measured Planck constant, 6.62610(13)$\times$10$^{-34}$ J$\cdot$s, is four to five orders
of magnitude improved from the previous photoelectric effect measurements. It has rendered photoemission
method to become one of the most accurate methods in determining the Planck constant. We propose
that this direct method of photoemission spectroscopy has advantages and a potential to further
increase its measurement precision of the Planck constant to be comparable to the most accurate
methods that are available at present.
