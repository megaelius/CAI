Understanding the causes and effects of spatial patterns of vegetation is a fundamental problem
in ecology, especially because these can be used as early predictors of catastrophic shifts such
as desertification processes. Empirical studies of the vegetation cover in some areas such as drylands
and semiarid regions have revealed the existence of vegetation patches of broadly diverse sizes.
In particular, the probability distribution of patch sizes can be fitted by a power law, i.e. vegetation
patches are approximately scale free. Different explanatory mechanisms, such as plant-plant
interactions and plant-water feedback loops have been proposed to rationalize the emergence of
such scale-free patterns, yet a full understanding has not been reached. Using a simple model for
vegetation dynamics, we show that environmental temporal variability --a well-recognized feature
of semiarid environments-- promotes in a robust way (i.e. for a broad range of parameter values)
the emergence of scale-free vegetation patches. Furthermore, this observation is related to a
percolation phenomenon that occurs in an intermittent or fluctuating way. The model also reveals
that the emerging power-law exponents depend on the overall vegetation-cover density, in agreement
with empirical observations, suggesting that environmental variability plays a key role in the
formation of scale-free vegetation patterns. From a practical viewpoint, this may be of importance
to predict the effects that changes in environmental conditions may have in real ecosystems. From
a theoretical side, our study sheds new light on a novel type of percolation phenomenon occurring
under temporally-varying external conditions.
