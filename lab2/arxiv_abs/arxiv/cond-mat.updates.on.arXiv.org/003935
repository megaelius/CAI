We study the bulk and boundary properties of fragile topological insulators (TIs) protected by
inversion symmetry, mostly focusing on the class A of the Altland-Zirnbauer classification. First,
we propose an efficient method for diagnosing fragile band topology by using the symmetry data in
momentum space. Using this method, we show that among all the possible parity configurations of
inversion-symmetric insulators, at least 17 percent of them have fragile topology in 2D while fragile
TIs are less than 3 percent in 3D. Second, we study the bulk-boundary correspondence of fragile TIs
protected by inversion symmetry. In particular, we generalize the notion of $d$-dimensional ($d$D)
$k$th-order TIs, which is normally defined for $0<k\le d$, to the cases with $k>d$, and show that
they all have fragile topology. In terms of the Dirac Hamiltonian, a $d$D $k$th-order TI has $(k-1)$
boundary mass terms. We show that a minimal fragile TI with the filling anomaly can be considered
as the $d$D $(d+1)$th-order TI, and all the other $d$D $k$th-order TIs with $k>(d+1)$ can be constructed
by stacking $d$D $(d+1)$th-order TIs. Although $d$D $(d+1)$th-order TIs have no in-gap states,
the boundary mass terms carry an odd winding number along the boundary, which induces localized
charges on the boundary at the positions where the boundary mass terms change abruptly. In the cases
with $k>(d+1)$, we show that the net parity of the system with boundaries can distinguish topological
insulators and trivial insulators. Also, by studying the (nested) Wilson loop spectra, we determine
the minimal number of bands to resolve the Wannier obstruction, which is consistent with the prediction
from our diagnosis method of fragile topology. Finally, we show that a $(d+1)$D $(k-1)$th-order
TI can be obtained by an adiabatic pumping of $d$D $k$th-order TI, which generalizes the previous
study of the 2D 3rd-order TI.
