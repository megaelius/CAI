Universality has been a key concept for the classification of equilibrium critical phenomena,
allowing associations among different physical processes and models. When dealing with non-equilibrium
problems, however, the distinction in universality classes is not as clear and few are the examples,
as phase separation and kinetic roughening, for which universality has allowed to classify results
in a general spirit. Here we focus on an out-of-equilibrium case, unstable crystal growth, lying
in between phase ordering and pattern formation. We consider a well established 2+1 dimensional
family of continuum nonlinear equations for the local height $h(\mathbf{x},t)$ of a crystal surface
having the general form ${\partial_t h(\mathbf{x},t)} = -\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot {[\mathbf{j}(\nabla
h) + \mathbf{\nabla}(\nabla^2 h)]}$: $\mathbf{j}(\nabla h)$ is an arbitrary function, which
is linear for small $\nabla h$, and whose structure expresses instabilities which lead to the formation
of pyramid-like structures of planar size $L$ and height $H$. Our task is the choice and calculation
of the quantities that can operate as critical exponents, together with the discussion of what is
relevant or not to the definition of our universality class. These aims are achieved by means of a
perturbative, multiscale analysis of our model, leading to phase diffusion equations whose diffusion
coefficients encapsulate all relevant informations on dynamics. We identify two critical exponents:
i) the coarsening exponent, $n$, controlling the increase in time of the typical size of the pattern,
$L\sim t^n$; ii) the exponent $\beta$, controlling the increase in time of the typical slope of the
pattern, $M \sim t^{\beta}$ where $M\approx H/L$. Our study reveals that there are only two different
universality classes...
