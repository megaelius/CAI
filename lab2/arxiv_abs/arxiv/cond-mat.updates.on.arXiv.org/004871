Recently EuCd$_2$As$_2$ was predicted to be a magnetic Weyl semi-metal with a lone pair of Weyl nodes
generated by A-type antiferromagnetism and protected by a rotational symmetry. However, it was
soon discovered that the actual magnetic structure broke the rotational symmetry and internal
pressure was later suggested as a route to stabilize the desired magnetic state. In this work we test
this prediction by synthesizing a series of Eu$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$Cd$_2$As$_2$ single crystals and
studying their structural, magnetic and transport properties via both experimental techniques
and first-principles calculations. We find that small concentrations of Ba ($\sim 3-10\% $) lead
to a small out-of-plane canting of the Eu moment. However, for higher concentrations this effect
is suppressed and a nearly in-plane model is recovered. Studying the transport properties we find
that all compositions show evidence of an Anomalous Hall Effect dominated by the intrinsic mechanism
as well as large negative magnetoresistances in the longitudinal channel. A non-monotonic evolution
of the transport properties is seen across the series which correlates to the proposed canting suggesting
canting may enhance the topological effects. Careful density functional theory calculations
using an all-electron approach revise prior predictions finding a purely ferromagnetic ground
state with in-plane moments for both the EuCd$_2$As$_2$ and Eu$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$Cd$_2$As$_2$
compounds - corroborating our experimental findings. This work suggests that Ba substitution
can tune the magnetic properties in unexpected ways which correlate to changes in measures of topological
properties, encouraging future work to locate the ideal Ba concentration for Eu moment canting.
