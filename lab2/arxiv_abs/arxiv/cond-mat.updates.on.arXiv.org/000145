Although the Vlasov equation is used as a good approximation for a sufficiently large $N$, Braun
and Hepp have showed that the time evolution of the one particle distribution function of a $N$ particle
classical Hamiltonian system with long range interactions satisfies the Vlasov equation in the
limit of infinite $N$. Here we rederive this result using a different approach allowing a discussion
of the role of inter-particle correlations on the system dynamics. Otherwise for finite N collisional
corrections must be introduced. This has allowed the a quite comprehensive study of the Quasi Stationary
States (QSS) but many aspects of the physical interpretations of these states remain unclear. In
this paper a proper definition of timescale for long time evolution is discussed and several numerical
results are presented, for different values of $N$. Previous reports indicates that the lifetimes
of the QSS scale as $N^{1.7}$ or even the system properties scales with $\exp(N)$. However, preliminary
results presented here shows indicates that time scale goes as $N^2$ for a different type of initial
condition. We also discuss how the form of the inter-particle potential determines the convergence
of the $N$-particle dynamics to the Vlasov equation. The results are obtained in the context of following
models: the Hamiltonian Mean Field, the Self Gravitating Ring Model, and a 2-D Systems of Gravitating
Particles. We have also provided information of the validity of the Vlasov equation for finite $N$,
i. e.\ how the dynamics converges to the mean-field (Vlasov) description as $N$ increases and how
inter-particle correlations arise.
