In many materials, formation of building blocks and their controlled-angle packing results into
various geometric anisotropic shaped particles. Monolayer triangular shape tiny particles are
vital as they are the building blocks of shaped particles under certain modification. When packets
of nano energy shape-like equilateral triangle are being placed over those atoms dealing transition
state, they crop from monolayer assembly resting at atomically flat surface into tiny particles
of own shape and size following by simultaneous elongation as per successively influencing force
till packing at common centre dealing no force of surface format. Each atom of one-dimensional array
of tiny particle elongates uniformly forming a square shape under stretching of energy knots clamping
electron states equally to both sides at centre when deal no force of north south poles and only the
force of surface format is influencing in opposite manner along the single axis, thus, working as
one unit. At this instance, binding of atoms is due to re-crystallization behavior of their electrons
under certain level of tickling to clamping energy knots. On one step down under the force of gravity
where mono layer bind under those electrons of structure of smooth elements dealing yet the contraction
of their clamping energy knots to the above one mono layer under those electrons of structure of smooth
elements dealing yet the expansion of their clamping energy knots while dealing the forces of space
and grounded formats, respectively, which is termed as lateral diffusion. In this work, the basic
idea of formation of such building block is suggested. Study further sheds light on the role of forces
on elongation of such tiny particles.
