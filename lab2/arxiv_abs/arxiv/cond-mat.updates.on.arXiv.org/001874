The phenomenon whereby atoms deal a positive or negative charge by losing or gaining an electron
forms the basis of familiar processes. But, in those elements where their atoms comprise unfilled
state(s) of electron(s), they can be eligible to execute electron-dynamics under certain force-energy
behaviors indicating that they can never be ionized. At ground surface, atoms of many elements for
certain transition state elongate as per exerting existed force of surface format. In the case of
inert gas atoms, an alternative process takes place. Atoms of inert gases under certain flow rate
split into electron streams as photons characteristic current in excess rate propagate through
their inter-state electron gaps where increasing wavelength of travelling photons to a visible
range revealing the light glow. The resulted forced-energy electron streams of splitted atoms
when impinge to underlying solid atoms elongated under the exerting existed force at a certain fixed
angle resulting into further elongation as per transported punched forcing energy of electrons.
When electrons of punched forcing energy do not impinge at a fixed angle to the naturally elongated
atoms, deformation of elongated atoms take place where clamped energy knots to their electrons
stretch non-orientationally because of exerting force to their electrons in a non-uniform manner.
In silicon solar cells and other similar kind of gadgets, photonic current is generated. All sorts
of microscopes visualizing topography image and structure are due to the spatially resolved surface
noticing by certain set-pace reflected photons. To identify the structure, its selected area electron
diffraction is, in fact, the selected area photon reflection. Many phenomena are discussed inferring
photonic current instead of electric. These fundamental revolutions bring vast changes in the
existing state of science.
