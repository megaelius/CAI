The trigonal title compound has recently been discussed in terms of its topological band properties.
These are intertwined with its magnetic properties. Here detailed studies of the magnetic, thermal,
and electronic transport properties of single crystals are presented. The Eu{+2} spins-7/2 exhibit
an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at a temperature TN = 6.7 K as previously reported. By analyzing
the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility chi data below TN in terms of molecular-field theory (MFT),
the AFM structure is inferred to be a c-axis helix with a turn angle between the moments in adjacent
ordered-moment planes along the c axis of about 120 degrees. An alternate but less likely magnetic
structure is a planar structure with nearest-neighbor Eu spins aligned at about 120 degrees with
respect to each other, where these ordered-moment layers are stacked along the c axis. The magnetic
heat capacity exhibits a lambda anomaly at TN with evidence of dynamic short-range magnetic fluctuations
both above and below TN. The high-T limit of the magnetic entropy is close to the theoretical value
for spins-7/2. The in-plane electrical resistivity rho(T) data indicate metallic character with
a mild and disorder-sensitive upturn below T{min}=23$ K. An anomalous rapid drop on cooling below
TN as found in zero field is replaced by a two-step decrease in magnetic fields. The rho(T) measurements
also reveal an additional transition below TN in applied fields of unknown origin that is not observed
in the other measurements and may be associated with an incommensurate to commensurate AFM transition.
The dependence of TN on the c-axis magnetic field Hperp was derived from the field-dependent chi(T),
Cp(T), and rho(T) measurements. This TN(Hperp) was found to be consistent with the prediction of
MFT for a c-axis helix with S = 7/2 and was used to generate a phase diagram in the Hperp-T plane.
