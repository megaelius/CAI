We study a thermal gradient induced current $\left(I_{th}\right)$ flow in potassium-doped two-dimensional
anisotropic black phosphorus (BP) with semi-Dirac dispersion. The prototype device is a BP channel
clamped between two contacts maintained at unequal temperatures. The choice of BP lies in the predicted
efficient thermolectric behaviour. A temperature-induced difference in the Fermi levels of the
two contacts drives the current (typified by the electro-thermal conductance) which we calculate
using the Landauer transport equation. The current shows an initial rise when the device is operated
at lower temperatures. The rise stalls at progressively higher temperatures and $I_{th}$ acquires
a plateau-like flat profile indicating a competing effect between a larger number of transmission
modes and a corresponding drop in the Fermi level difference between the contacts. The current is
computed for both \textit{n}- and \textit{p}-type BP and the difference thereof is attributed
to the particle-hole asymmetry. The utility of such calculations lie in conversion of the heat production
and an attendant temperature gradient in miniaturized devices to useful electric power and a possible
realization of solid-state Peltier cooling. Unlike the flow of $I_{th}$ that removes heat, the
ability of a material to maintain a steady temperature is reflected in its heat capacity which is
formulated in this work for BP via a Sommerfeld expansion. In the concluding part, we draw a microscopic
connection between the two seemingly disparate processes of heat removal and absorption by pinning
down their origin to the underlying density of states. Finally, a qualitative analysis of a Carnot-like
efficiency of the considered thermoelectric engine is performed drawing upon the previous results
on thermal current and heat capacity.
