We performed molecular dynamics simulations to study relaxation phenomena during vapor-liquid
transitions in a single component Lennard-Jones system. Results from two different overall densities
are presented; one in the neighborhood of the vapor branch of the coexistence curve and the other
being close to the critical density. The nonequilibrium morphologies, growth mechanisms and growth
laws in the two cases are vastly different. In the low density case growth occurs via diffusive coalescence
of droplets in a disconnected morphology. On the other hand, the elongated structure in the higher
density case grows via advective transport of particles inside the tube-like liquid domains. The
objective in this work has been to identify how the decay of the order-parameter autocorrelation,
an important quantity to understand aging dynamics, differs in the two cases. In the case of the disconnected
morphology, we observe a very robust power-law decay, as a function of the ratio of the characteristic
lengths at the observation time and at the age of the system, whereas the results for the percolating
structure appear rather complex. To quantify the decay in the latter case, unlike standard method
followed in a previous study, here we have performed a finite-size scaling analysis. Outcome of
this analysis shows the presence of a strong preasymptotic correction, while revealing that in
this case also, albeit in the asymptotic limit, the decay follows a power-law. Even though the corresponding
exponents in the two cases differ drastically, this study, combined with a few recent ones, suggests
that power-law behavior of this correlation function is rather universal in coarsening dynamics.
