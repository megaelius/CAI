The electrons in the edge channels of two-dimensional topological insulators can be described
as a helical Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. They couple to nuclear spins embedded in the host materials
through the hyperfine interaction, and are therefore subject to elastic spin-flip backscattering
on the nuclear spins. We investigate the nuclear-spin-induced edge resistance due to such backscattering
by performing a renormalization-group analysis. Remarkably, the effect of this backscattering
mechanism is stronger in a helical edge than in nonhelical channels, which are believed to be present
in the trivial regime of InAs/GaSb quantum wells. In a system with sufficiently long edges, the disordered
nuclear spins lead to an edge resistance which grows exponentially upon lowering the temperature.
On the other hand, electrons from the edge states mediate an anisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
nuclear spin-spin interaction, which induces a spiral nuclear spin order below the transition
temperature. We discuss the features of the spiral order, as well as its experimental signatures.
In the ordered phase, we identify two backscattering mechanisms, due to charge impurities and magnons.
The backscattering on charge impurities is allowed by the internally generated magnetic field,
and leads to an Anderson-type localization of the edge states. The magnon-mediated backscattering
results in a power-law resistance, which is suppressed at zero temperature. Overall, we find that
in a sufficiently long edge the nuclear spins, whether ordered or not, suppress the edge conductance
to zero as the temperature approaches zero.
