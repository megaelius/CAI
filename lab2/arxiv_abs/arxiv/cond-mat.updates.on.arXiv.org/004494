A particle entering a scattering and absorbing medium executes a random walk through a sequence
of scattering events. The particle ultimately achieves first-passage, leaving the medium or it
is absorbed. The Kubelka-Munk model describes a flux of particles moving perpendicular to the surface
of a plane-parallel medium. The particle path alternates between the positive direction into the
medium and the negative direction back towards the surface. Backscattering events from the positive
to the negative direction occur at local maxima or peaks, while backscattering from the negative
to the positive direction occur at local minima or valleys. The probability of a particle avoiding
absorption as it follows its path decreases exponentially with the path-length \(\lambda\). The
reflectance of a semi-infinite slab is therefore the Laplace transform of the distribution of path-length
that ends with a first-passage out of the medium. In the case of a constant scattering rate the random
walk is a Poisson process. We verify our results with two iterative calculations, one using the properties
of iterated convolution with a symmetric kernel and the other via direct calculation with an exponential
step-length distribution. We present a novel demonstration, based on fluctuation theory of sums
of random variables, that the first-passage probability as a function of the number of peaks in the
alternating path is a step-length distribution-free combinatoric expression. Counting paths
with backscattering on the real half-line results in the same Catalan number coefficients as Dyck
paths on the whole numbers. Including a separate forward-scattering Poisson process results in
an expression related to counting Motzkin paths. We therefore connect walks on the real line to discrete
path combinatorics.
