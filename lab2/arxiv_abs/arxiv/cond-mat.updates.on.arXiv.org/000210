We study non-linear gravitational clustering from cold gaussian power-law initial conditions
in a family of scale-free EdS models, characterized by a free parameter \kappa fixing the ratio between
the mass driving the expansion and the mass which clusters. As in the "usual" EdS model, corresponding
to \kappa=1, self-similarity provides a powerful instrument to delimit the physically relevant
clustering resolved by a simulation. Likewise, if stable clustering applies, it implies scale-free
non-linear clustering. We derive the corresponding exponent \gamma_{sc} (n, \kappa) of the two
point correlation function. We then report the results of extensive N-body simulations, of comparable
size to those previously reported in the literature for the case \kappa=1, and performed with an
appropriate modification of the GADGET2 code. We observe in all cases self-similarity in the two
point correlations, down to a lower cut-off which decreases monotonically in time in comoving coordinates.
The self-similar part of the non-linear correlation function is fitted well in all cases by a single
power-law with an exponent in good agreement with \gamma_{sc} (n, \kappa). Our results thus indicate
that stable clustering provides an excellent approximation to the non-linear correlation function
over the resolved self-similar scales, at least down to \gamma_{sc} (n, \kappa) \approx 1, corresponding
to the case n=-2 for \kappa=1. We conclude, in contrast with some results reported in the literature,
that a clear identification of the breakdown of stable clustering in self-similar models - and the
possible existence of a "universal" region in which non-linear clustering becomes independent
of initial conditions - remains an important open problem, which should be addressed further in
significantly larger simulations.
