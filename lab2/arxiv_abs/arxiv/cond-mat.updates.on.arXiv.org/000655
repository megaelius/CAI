Motivated by the experimental detection of superconductivity in the low-carrier density half-Heusler
compound YPtBi, we study the pairing instabilities of three-dimensional strongly spin-orbit
coupled semimetals with a quadratic band touching point. In these semimetals the electronic structure
at the Fermi energy is described by spin j=3/2 quasiparticles, which are fundamentally different
from those in ordinary metals with spin j=1/2. We develop a general approach to analyzing pairing
instabilities in j=3/2 materials by decomposing the pair scattering interaction into irreducible
channels, projecting them to the Fermi surface and deriving the corresponding Eliashberg theory.
Applying our method to a generic density-density interaction in YPtBi we establish the following
results: (i) The pairing strength in each channel uniquely encodes the j=3/2 nature of the Fermi
surface band structure--a manifestation of the fundamental difference with ordinary metals.
In particular, this implies that Anderson's theorem, which addresses the effect of spin-orbit
coupling and disorder on pairing states of spin-1/2 electrons, cannot be applied in this case. (ii)
The leading pairing instabilities are different for electron and hole doping. This implies that
superconductivity depends on carrier type. (iii) In the case of hole doping--relevant to YPtBi,
we find two odd-parity channels in close competition with s-wave pairing. One of these two channels
is a multicomponent pairing channel, allowing for the possibility of time-reversal symmetry breaking.
(iv) In the case of Coulomb interactions mediated by the long-ranged electric polarization of optical
phonon modes, a significant coupling strength is generated in spite of the extremely low density
of carriers. Furthermore, non-linear response and Fermi liquid corrections can favor non-s-wave
pairing and potentially account for the experimentally-observed Tc.
