A key property of Majorana zero modes is their protection against local perturbations. In the standard
picture this is the result of a high degree of spatial wavefunction non-locality. A careful quantitative
definition of non-locality in relation to topological protection goes beyond purely spatial separation,
and must also take into account the projection of wavefunction spin. Its form should be physically
motivated from the susceptibility of the Majorana mode to different local perturbations. Non-locality
can then be expressed as one of various wavefunction overlaps depending on the type of perturbation.
We quantify Majorana non-locality using this approach and study its dependence with Majorana nanowire
parameters in several classes of experimentally relevant configurations. These include inhomogeneous
nanowires with sharp and smooth depletion and induced pairing, barriers and quantum dots. Smooth
inhomogeneities have been shown to produce near-zero modes below the critical Zeeman field in the
bulk. We study how accurately their non-locality can be estimated using a purely local measurement
on one end of the nanowire, accessible through conventional transport experiments. In uniform
nanowires the local estimator quantifies non-locality with remarkable accuracy, but less so in
nanowires with inhomogeneities greater than the superconducting gap. We further analyse the Majorana
wavefunction structure, spin texture and the spectral features associated with each type of inhomogeneity.
Our results highlight the strong connection between internal wavefunction degrees of freedom,
non-locality and protection in smoothly inhomogeneous nanowires.
