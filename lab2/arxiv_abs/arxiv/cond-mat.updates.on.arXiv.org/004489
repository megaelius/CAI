The advent of nanotechnology has hurtled the discovery and development of nanostructured materials
with stellar chemical and physical functionalities in a bid to address issues in energy, environment,
telecommunications and healthcare. In this quest, honeycomb layered oxides have emerged as materials
exhibiting fascinatingly rich crystal chemistry and play host to varied exotic electromagnetic
and topological phenomena. These oxide materials, consisting of alkali or alkaline-earth metal
atoms sandwiched between slabs of transition metal atoms arranged in a honeycomb fashion, are of
great utility and diverse interest in a multiple fields ranging from materials science, solid-state
chemistry, electrochemistry to condensed matter physics. Currently, with a niche application
in energy storage as high-voltage materials, the honeycomb layered oxides serve as ideal pedagogical
exemplars of the innumerable capabilities of nanomaterials. In this Review, we delineate the relevant
chemistry and physics of honeycomb layered oxides, and discuss their functionalities for tunable
electrochemistry, superfast ionic conduction, optics, electromagnetism and topology. Moreover,
we elucidate the unexplored albeit vastly promising crystal chemistry space whilst outlining
effective ways to identify regions within this compositional space, particularly where interesting
electromagnetic and topological properties could be lurking within the aforementioned alkali
and alkaline-earth honeycomb layered oxide structures. We conclude by pointing towards possible
future research directions, particularly the prospective realisation of Kitaev-Heisenberg-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions with single crystals and Floquet theory in closely-related honeycomb layered oxide
materials.
