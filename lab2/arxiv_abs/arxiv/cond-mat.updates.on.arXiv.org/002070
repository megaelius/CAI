We study the robustness of the quantization of the Hall conductivity in the Harper-Hofstadter model
towards the details of the protocol with which a longitudinal uniform driving force $F_x(t)$ is
turned on. In the vector potential gauge, through Peierls substitution, this involves the switching-on
of complex time-dependent hopping amplitudes $\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\mathcal{A}_x(t)}$
in the $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$-direction such that $\partial_t \mathcal{A}_x(t)=F_x(t)$. The switching-on
can be sudden, $F_x(t)=\theta(t) F$, where $F$ is the steady driving force, or more generally smooth
$F_x(t)=f(t/t_{0}) F$, where $f(t/t_{0})$ is such that $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=1$. We investigate
how the time-averaged (steady-state) particle current density $j_y$ in the $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$-direction
deviates from the quantized value $j_y \, h/F = n$ due to the finite value of $F$ and the details of the
switching-on protocol. Exploiting the time-periodicity of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}(t)$, we
use Floquet techniques to study this problem. In this picture the (Kubo) linear response $F\to 0$
regime corresponds to the adiabatic limit for $\hat{H}(t)$. In the case of a sudden quench $j_y \,
h/F$ shows $F^2$ corrections to the perfectly quantized limit. When the switching-on is smooth,
the result depends on the switch-on time $t_{0}$: for a fixed $t_{0}$ we observe a crossover force
$F^*$ between a quadratic regime for $F<F^*$ and a {\em non-analytic} exponential $\mathrm{e}^{-\gamma/|F|}$
for $F>F^*$. The crossover $F^*$ decreases as $t_{0}$ increases, eventually recovering the topological
robustness. These effects are in principle amenable to experimental tests in optical lattice cold
atomic systems with synthetic gauge fields.
