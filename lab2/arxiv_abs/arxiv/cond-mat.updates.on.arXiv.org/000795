The phenomenon whereby atoms take a positive or negative charge by losing or gaining one or more electrons
forms the basis of the known chemical or physical processes. However, atoms those have unfilled
state of bare surface excite electron on absorbing heat energy depending on the nature of element.
Such atoms when in solid-state deform or elongate on impinging electron streams from the external
source or under the process of synergy. In the case of inert gas atoms, an alternative process takes
place. Atoms of flowing inert gas split into electron streams under certain field of photons characteristic
current propagating in inter-state gap of electrons and leaving gaps of electrons those photons
travel into open medium where reveal glow while increasing wavelengths in the visible range. The
light glow is observed if it is in the resolute limit of eyes as in the case of a neon lamp. In silicon
solar cells and same kinds of gadgets, photonic current is generated. All sorts of microscopes reveal
details of surface topography on resolving the image, micrometers size to subatomic level, is owing
to reflected photons. The selected area photon reflection patterns of ordered structure specify
as well that spotted dots are due to intensity of reflected photons instead of diffraction of electrons
at targeted surface. Many phenomena are discussed which infer photonic current instead of electronic.
These fundamental revolutions that atoms execute transitions of electrons deform or elongate
but do not ionize and those all filled states, on splitting, switch photonic current to increasing
wavelength photons bring vast changes in the existing state of science.
