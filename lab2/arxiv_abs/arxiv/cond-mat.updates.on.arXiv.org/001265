Finite topologically non-trivial systems are often characterised by the presence of bound states
at their physical edges. These topological edge modes can be distinguished from usual Shockley
waves energetically, as their energies remain finite and in-gap. On a clean 1D or reducible 2D model,
in either the commensurate or semi-infinite case, the edge modes can be obtained analytically,
as shown in [PRL 71, 3697 (1993)] and [PRA 89, 023619 (2014)]. We put forward a method for obtaining
the spectrum and wave functions of topological edge modes for arbitrary finite lattices, including
the incommensurate case. A small number of parameters are easily determined numerically, with
the form of the eigenstates remaining fully analytical. We also obtain the bulk modes in the finite
system analytically and their eigenenergies, which lie within the infinite-size limit continuum.
Our method is general and can be easily applied to obtain the properties of non-topological models
and/or extended to include impurities. As an example, we consider the case of an impurity located
next to one edge of a 1D system, equivalent to a softened boundary in a separable 2D model. We show that
a localised impurity can have a drastic effect on the edge modes of the system. Using the periodic
Harper and Hofstadter models to illustrate our method, we find that, on increasing the impurity
strength, edge states can enter or exit the continuum, and a trivial Shockley state bound to the impurity
may appear. The fate of the topological edge modes in the presence of impurities can be addressed
by quenching the impurity strength. We find that at certain critical impurity strengths, the transition
probability for a particle initially prepared in an edge mode to decay into the bulk exhibits discontinuities
that mark the entry and exit points of edge modes from and into the bulk spectrum.
