A wide variation in the disorder strength, as inferred from an order of magnitude variation in the
longitudinal resistivity of Co2FeSi (CFS) Huesler alloy thin films of fixed (50 nm) thickness,
has been achieved by growing these films on Si(111) substrates at substrate temperatures ranging
from room temperature (RT) to 600 C. An in-depth study of the influence of disorder on anomalous Hall
resistivity,longitudinal resistivity(LR) and magnetoresistance, enabled by this approach,
reveals the following. The side-jump mechanism gives a dominant contribution to anomalous Hall
resistivity (AHR) in the CFS thin films, regardless of the degree of disorder present. A new and novel
contribution to both LR and AHR characterized by the logarithmic temperature dependence at temperatures
below the minimum, exclusive to the amorphous CFS films, originates from the scattering of conduction
electrons from the diffusive hydrodynamic modes associated with the longitudinal component of
magnetization, called diffusons. In these amorphous CFS films, the electron-diffuson, e d, scattering
and weak localization (WL) mechanisms compete with that arising from the inelastic electron magnon,
e m, scattering to produce the minimum in longitudinal resistivity, whereas the minimum in AHR is
caused by the competing contributions from the e d and e m scattering, as WL does not make any contribution
to AHR. In sharp contrast, in crystalline films, enhanced electron electron Coulomb interaction
(EEI), which is basically responsible for the resistivity minimum, makes no contribution to AHR
with the result that AHR does not exhibit a minimum.
