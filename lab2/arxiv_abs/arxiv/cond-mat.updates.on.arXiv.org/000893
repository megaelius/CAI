In 1989, Sir Sam Edwards made the visionary proposition to treat jammed granular materials using
a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states in analogy to thermal equilibrium statistical
mechanics, despite their inherent athermal features. Since then, the statistical mechanics approach
for jammed matter has garnered an extraordinary amount of attention by both theorists and experimentalists.
Here, we review a systematic approach to jammed matter based on the Edwards statistical mechanical
ensemble. We discuss the construction of microcanonical and canonical ensembles based on the volume
function, which replaces the Hamiltonian in jammed systems. The importance of approximation schemes
at various levels is emphasized leading to quantitative predictions for ensemble averaged quantities
such as packing fractions and contact force distributions. An overview of the phenomenology of
jammed states and experiments, simulations, and theoretical models scrutinizing the strong assumptions
underlying Edwards' approach is given including recent results suggesting the validity of Edwards
ergodic hypothesis for jammed states. A theoretical framework for packings whose constitutive
particles range from spherical to non-spherical shapes like dimers, polymers, ellipsoids, spherocylinders
or tetrahedra, hard and soft, frictional, frictionless and adhesive, monodisperse and polydisperse
particles in any dimensions is discussed providing insight into an unifying phase diagram for all
jammed matter. Furthermore, the connection between the Edwards' ensemble of metastable jammed
states and metastability in spin-glasses is established. This highlights that the packing problem
can be understood as a constraint satisfaction problem for excluded volume and force and torque
balance leading to a unifying framework between the Edwards ensemble of equiprobable jammed states
and out-of-equilibrium spin-glasses.
