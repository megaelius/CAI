We study the collisionless dynamics of two classes of nonintegrable pairing models. One is a BCS
model with separable energy-dependent interactions, the other - a 2D topological superconductor
with spin-orbit coupling and a band-splitting external field. The long-time quantum quench dynamics
at integrable points of these models are well understood. Namely, the squared magnitude of the time-dependent
order parameter $\Delta(t)$ can either vanish (Phase I), reach a nonzero constant (Phase II), or
periodically oscillate as an elliptic function (Phase III). We demonstrate that nonintegrable
models too exhibit some or all of these nonequilibrium phases. Remarkably, elliptic periodic oscillations
persist, even though both their amplitude and functional form change drastically with integrability
breaking. Striking new phenomena accompany loss of integrability. First, an extremely long time
scale emerges in the relaxation to Phase III, such that short-time numerical simulations risk erroneously
classifying the asymptotic state. This time scale diverges near integrable points. Second, an
entirely new Phase IV of quasiperiodic oscillations of $|\Delta|$ emerges in the quantum quench
phase diagrams of nonintegrable pairing models. As integrability techniques do not apply for the
models we study, we develop the concept of asymptotic self-consistency and a linear stability analysis
of the asymptotic phases. With the help of these new tools, we determine the phase boundaries, characterize
the asymptotic state, and clarify the physical meaning of the quantum quench phase diagrams of BCS
superconductors. We also propose an explanation of these diagrams in terms of bifurcation theory.
