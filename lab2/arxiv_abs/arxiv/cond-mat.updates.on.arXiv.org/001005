The driving force dependence of the surface velocity and the average height of faceted merged steps,
the terrace-surface-slope, and the elementary step velocity in the non-equilibrium steady-state
are studied using the Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo study is based on a lattice model, the restricted
solid-on-solid model with point-contact type step--step attraction (p-RSOS model). The temperature
is selected to be in the step-faceting zone where the surface is surrounded by the (001) terrace and
the (111) faceted step at equilibrium. Long time simulations are performed at this temperature
to obtain steady-states for the different driving forces that influence the growth/recession
of the surface. A Wulff figure of the p-RSOS model is produced through the anomalous surface tension
calculated using the density-matrix renormalization group method. Although the p-RSOS model
is a simplified model, the model shows a wide variety of dynamics in the step-faceting zone. There
are four characteristic driving forces, $\Delta \mu_y$, $\Delta \mu_f$, $\Delta \mu_{co}$, and
$\Delta \mu_R$. For $\Delta \mu_{co}<|\Delta \mu|<\Delta \mu_R$, the surface grows/recedes
with the successive attachment-detachment of steps to/from a macrostep. When $|\Delta \mu|$ exceeds
$\Delta \mu_R $, the macrostep vanishes and the surface roughens kinetically. Classical 2D heterogeneous
multi-nucleation was determined to be valid with slight modifications based on the Monte Carlo
results of the step velocity and the change in the surface slope of the "terrace". The finite size
effects were also determined to be distinctive near equilibrium.
