We investigate the localization properties of driven models that exhibit a sub-extensive number
of extended states in the static setting. We consider instances where the extended modes are or are
not protected by topological considerations. To this end, we contrast the strongly driven disordered
lowest Landau level, which we refer to as the random Landau model (RLM), with the random dimer model
(RDM); the latter also has a sub-extensive set of delocalized modes in the middle of the spectrum
whose origin is not topological. We map the driven models on to a higher dimensional effective model
and numerically compute the localization length as a function of disorder strength, drive amplitude
and frequency using the recursive Green's function method. Our numerical results indicate that
in the presence of a strong drive (low frequency and/or large drive amplitude), the topologically
protected RLM continues to exhibit a spectrum with both localized and delocalized (or critical)
modes, but the spectral range of delocalized modes is enhanced by the driving. This occurs due to
an admixture of the localized modes with extended modes arising due to the topologically protected
critical energy in the middle of the spectrum. On the other hand, in the RDM, a weak drive immediately
localizes the entire spectrum. This occurs in contrast to the naive expectation from perturbation
theory that mixing between localized and delocalized modes generically enhances the delocalization
of all modes. Our work highlights the importance of the origin of the delocalized modes in the localization
properties of the corresponding Floquet model.
