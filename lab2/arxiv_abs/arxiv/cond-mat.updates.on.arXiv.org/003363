Hybrid organic-inorganic (HOI) compounds are excellent candidates for a wide spectrum of applications
in diverse fields such as optics, electronics, energy and biotechnology. Their broad range of versatility
is achieved by combining the functionalities of organic and inorganic materials to generate unique
properties. Current research has mostly focused on perovskite HOIs due to their wide range of uses
in solar cells, photo detectors and memory devices. However, drawbacks such as instability and
lead toxicity limit further implementation into other new areas. Thus, there is a need to develop
stable and non-toxic HOI perovskite materials. Zinc is an attractive substitute for Pb in HOIs.
Here, we apply a functionality based materials selection approach to screen for Zn-based HOI compounds
from two crystallographic repositories; Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and American Mineralogist
Crystal Structure Database. We successfully identify thirteen Zn-based HOI compounds. The electronic
structure and optical properties of these compounds are investigated using density functional
theory. The calculated optical absorbance fall within the far ultra-violet (FUV) region of 200-112
nm wavelength. We selected four of these compounds and calculated their band gaps; they were found
to range between 4.9-5.7 eV. Considering that the UV absorbance is three times larger than average
tissue absorbance and the refractive index (> 1.49) is greater than typical tissue materials, one
could consider these Zn-based HOI compounds for selective photothermolysis treatment and UV protectant
coating for electronic devices.
