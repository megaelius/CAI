In this work, we consider the phase-space picture of quantum mechanics. We then introduce non-negative
Wigner-like (operational) distributions \widetilde{\mathcal W}_{rho;alpha}(x,p) corresponding
to the density operator \hat{rho} and being proportional to {W_{rho^(alpha/2)}(x,p)}^2, where
W_{rho}(x,p) denotes the usual Wigner function. In doing so, we utilize the formal symmetry between
the purity measure Tr(rho^2) and its Wigner representation (2 pi hbar) \int dx dp {W_{rho}(x,p)}^2
and then consider, as a generalization, such symmetry between the fractional moment Tr(\hat{rho}^{alpha})
and its Wigner representation (2 pi hbar) \int dx dp {W_{rho^{alpha/2}}(x,p)}^2. Next, we create
a framework that enables explicit evaluation of the Renyi-Wigner entropies for the classical-like
distributions \widetilde{\mathcal W}_{rho;alpha}(x,p). Consequently, a better understanding
of some non-Gaussian features of a given state rho will be given, by comparison with the Gaussian
state rho_G defined in terms of its Wigner function W_{rho_G}(x,p) and essentially determined
by its purity measure T(rho_G)^2 alone. To illustrate the validity of our framework, we evaluate
the distributions \widetilde{\mathcal W}_{beta;alpha}(x,p) corresponding to the (non-Gaussian)
thermal state rho_{\beta} of a single particle confined by a one-dimensional infinite potential
well with either the Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition and then analyze the resulting Renyi
entropies. Our phase-space approach will also contribute to a deeper understanding of non-Gaussian
states and their properties either in the semiclassical limit (hbar \to 0) or in the high-temperature
limit (beta \to 0), as well as enabling us to systematically discuss the quantal-classical Second
Law of Thermodynamics on the single footing.
