We present a novel approach to efficiently implement thermal expansion in the quasi-harmonic approximation
(QHA) for both isotropic and more importantly, anisotropic expansion. In this approach, we rapidly
determine a crystals equilibrium volume and shape at a given temperature by integrating along the
gradient of expansion from zero Kelvin up to the desired temperature. We compare our approach to
previous isotropic methods that rely on a brute-force grid search to determine the free energy minimum,
which is infeasible to carry out for anisotropic expansion. We compare these methods for experimentally
known polymorphs of piracetam and resorcinol and show that both isotropic methods agree to within
error up to 300 K. Use of the Gr\"uneisen parameter causes up to 0.04 kcal/mol deviation in the Gibbs
free energy, but for polymorph free energy differences there is a cancellation in error with all
isotropic methods within 0.025 kcal/mol at 300 K. Anisotropic expansion allows the crystals to
relax into lattice geometries 0.01-0.23 kcal/mol lower in energy at 300 K relative to isotropic
expansion. For polymorph free energy differences all QHA methods produced results within 0.02
kcal/mol of each other for resorcinol and 0.12 kcal/mol for piracetam, the two molecules tested
here, showing a cancellation of error of isotropic methods. We also find that when expanding in more
than a single volume variable, there appears to be a non-negligible rate of failure of the basic approximations
of QHA. Specifically, while expanding into new harmonic modes as the box vectors are increased,
the system often falls into alternate, structurally distinct harmonic modes unrelated by continuous
deformation alone from the original harmonic mode.
