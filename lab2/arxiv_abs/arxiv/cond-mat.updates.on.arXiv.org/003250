Adopting thin Si wafers for PV reduces capital expenditure (capex) and manufacturing cost, and
accelerates the growth of PV manufacturing. There are two key questions about thin Si today: (a)
how much can we still benefit economically from thinning wafers? (b) what are the technological
challenges to transition to thin wafers? In this work, we re-evaluate the benefits and challenges
of thin Si for current and future PV modules using a comprehensive techno-economic framework that
couples device simulation, bottom-up cost modeling, and a cash-flow growth model. When adopting
an advanced technology concept that features sufficiently good surface passivation, similarly
high efficiencies are achievable for 50-{\mu}m wafers as for 160-{\mu}m ones. We then quantify
the economic benefits for thin Si wafers in terms of poly-Si-to-module manufacturing capex, module
cost, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility PV systems. Particularly, LCOE favors
thinner wafers for all investigated device architectures, and can potentially be reduced by more
than 5% from the value of 160-{\mu}m wafers. With further improvements in module efficiency, an
advanced thin-wafer device concept with 50-{\mu}m wafers could reduce manufacturing capex by
48%, module cost by 28%, and LCOE by 24%. Furthermore, we apply a sustainable growth model to investigate
PV deployment scenarios in 2030. It is found that the state-of-the-art industry concept could not
achieve the climate targets even with very aggressive financial scenarios, therefore the capex
reduction benefit of thin wafers is needed to facilitate more rapid PV growth. Lastly, we discuss
the remaining technological challenges and areas for innovation to enable high-yield manufacturing
of high-efficiency PV modules with thin Si wafers.
