The notion of fractional charges was up until now reserved for quasiparticle excitations emerging
in strongly correlated quantum systems, such as Laughlin states in the fractional quantum Hall
effect, Luttinger quasiparticles, or parafermions. Here, we consider topological transitions
in the full counting statistics of standard sequential electron tunneling, and find that they lead
to the same type of charge fractionalization - strikingly without requiring exotic quantum correlations.
This conclusion relies on the realization that fundamental integer charge quantization fixes
the global properties of the transport statistics whereas fractional charges can only be well-defined
locally. We then show that the reconciliation of these two contradicting notions results in a nontrivially
quantized geometric phase defined in the detector space. In doing so, we show that detector degrees
of freedom can be used to describe topological transitions in nonequilibrium open quantum systems.
Moreover, the quantized geometric phase reveals a profound analogy between the fractional charge
effect in sequential tunneling and fractional Josephson effect in topological superconducting
junctions, where likewise the Majorana- or parafermions exhibit a charge which is at odds with the
Cooper pair charge as the underlying unit of the supercurrent. In order to provide means for an experimental
verification of our claims, we demonstrate the fractional nature of transport statistics at the
example of highly feasible transport models, such as weakly tunnel-coupled quantum dots or charge
islands. We then show that the geometric phase can be accessed through the detector's waiting time
distribution. Finally, we find that topological transitions in the transport statistics could
even lead to new applications, such as the unexpected possibility to directly measure features
beyond the resolution limit of a detector.
