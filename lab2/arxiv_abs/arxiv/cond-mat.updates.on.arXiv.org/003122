Fine particle suspensions (such as cornstarch mixed with water) exhibit dramatic changes in viscosity
when sheared, producing fascinating behaviors that captivate children and rheologists alike.
Recent examination of these mixtures in simple flow geometries suggests inter-granular repulsion
is central to this effect --- for mixtures at rest or shearing slowly, repulsion prevents frictional
contacts from forming between particles, whereas, when sheared more forcefully, granular stresses
overcome the repulsion allowing particles to interact frictionally and form microscopic structures
that resist flow. Previous constitutive studies of these mixtures have focused on particular cases,
typically limited to two-dimensional, steady, simple shearing flows. In this work, we introduce
a predictive and general, three-dimensional continuum model for this material, using mixture
theory to couple the fluid and particle phases. Playing a central role in the model, we introduce
a micro-structural state variable, whose evolution is deduced from small-scale physical arguments
and checked with existing data. Our space- and time-dependent model is implemented numerically
in a variety of unsteady, non-uniform flow configurations where it is shown to accurately capture
a variety of key behaviors: (i) the continuous shear thickening (CST) and discontinuous shear thickening
(DST) behavior observed in steady flows, (ii) the time-dependent propagation of `shear jamming
fronts', (iii) the time-dependent propagation of `impact activated jamming fronts', and (iv)
the non-Newtonian, `running on oobleck' effect wherein fast locomotors stay afloat while slow
ones sink.
