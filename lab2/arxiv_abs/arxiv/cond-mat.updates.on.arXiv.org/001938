The study establishes that the degree of optically induced spin polarization that can be achieved
for NV$^- $in 1b diamond is limited by the concentration of single substitutional nitrogen, N$^0$
. The polarization of the individual NV centres in the diamond is dependent on the separation of the
NV$^-$ and the nitrogen donor. When the NV$^-$ - N$^+$ pair separation is large the properties of
the pair will be as for single sites and a high degree of spin polarization attainable. When the separation
decreases the emission is reduced, the lifetime shortened and the spin polarization downgraded.
The deterioration occurs as a consequence of electron tunneling in the excited state from NV$^-$
to N$^+$ and results in an optical cycle that includes NV$^0$. The tunneling process is linear in
optical excitation and more prevalent the closer the N$^+$ is to the NV$^-$ centre. However, the
separation between the NV$^-$ and its donor N$^+$ can be effected by light through the excitation
of NV$^-$ and/or ionization of N$^0$. The optical excitation that creates the spin polarization
can also modify the sample properties and during excitation creates charge dynamics. The consequence
is that the magnitude of spin polarization, the spin relaxation and coherence times T$_1$ and T$_2$
have a dependence on the nitrogen concentration and on the excitation wavelength. The adjacent
N$^+$ gives an electric field that Stark shifts the NV$^-$ transitions and for an ensemble results
in line broadening. It is observation of changes of these Stark induced effects that allow the variation
in NV$^-$ - N$^+$ separation to be monitored. Spectroscopic measurements including that of the
varying line widths are central to the study. They are made at low temperatures and include extensive
measurements of the NV$^-$ optical transition at 637 nm, the infrared transition at 1042 nm and ODMR
at 2.87 GHz.
