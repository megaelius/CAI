Density functional theory augmented with Hubbard-$U$ corrections (DFT+$U$) is currently one
of the widely used methods for first-principles electronic structure modeling of insulating transition
metal oxides (TMOs). Since $U$ is relatively large compared to band widths, the magnetic excitations
in TMOs are expected to be well described by a Heisenberg model. However, in practice the calculated
exchange parameters $J_{ij}$ depend on the magnetic configuration from which they are extracted
and on the functional used to compute them. In this work we investigate how the spin polarization
dependence of the underlying exchange-correlation functional influences the calculated magnetic
exchange constants of TMOs. We perform a systematic study of the predictions of calculations based
on the local density approximation plus $U$ (LDA+$U$) and the local spin density approximation
plus $U$ (LSDA+$U$) for the electronic structures, total energies and magnetic exchange interactions
$J_{ij}$'s extracted from ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations of
several transition metal oxide materials. We report that, for realistic choices of Hubbard $U$
and Hund's $J$ parameters, LSDA+$U$ and LDA+$U$ calculations result in different values of the
magnetic exchange constants and band gap. The dependence of the band gap on the magnetic configuration
is stronger in LDA+$U$ than in LSDA+$U$ and we argue that this is the main reason why the configuration
dependence of the $J_{ij}$'s is found to be systematically more pronounced in LDA+$U$ than in LSDA+$U$
calculations. We report a very good correspondence between the computed total energies and the
parameterized Heisenberg model for LDA+$U$ calculations, but not for LSDA+$U$, suggesting that
LDA+$U$ is a more appropriate method for estimating exchange interactions.
