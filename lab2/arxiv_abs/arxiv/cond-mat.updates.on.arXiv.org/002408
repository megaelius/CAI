The $d$-$wave$ superconductivity is analyzed within the three-band $d$-$p$ model with the use
of the diagrammatic expansion of the Guztwiller wave function method (DE-GWF). The determined
stability regime of the superconducting state appears in the range of hole doping $\delta\lesssim
0.35$, with the optimal doping close to $\delta\approx 0.19$. The pairing amplitudes between the
$d$-orbitals due to copper and $p_x/p_y$ orbitals due to oxygen are analyzed together with the hybrid
$d$-$p$ pairing. The $d$-$d$ pairing between the nearest neighboring atomic sites leads to the
dominant contribution to the SC phase. Moreover, it is shown that the decrease of both the Coulomb
repulsion on the copper atomic sites ($U_d$) and the charge transfer energy between the oxygen and
copper atomic sites ($\epsilon_{dp}$) increases the pairing strength as it moves the system from
the strong to the intermediate-correlation regime, where the pairing is maximized. Such a result
is consistent with our analysis of the ratio of changes in the hole content at the $d$ and $p$ orbitals
due to doping, which, according to experimental study, increases with the increasing maximal critical
temperature [cf. Nat. Commun. 7, 11413 (2016)]. Furthermore, the results for the three-band model
are compared to those for the effective single-band picture and similarities between the two approaches
are discussed. For the sake of completeness, the normal-state characteristics determined from
the DE-GWF approach are compared with those resulting from the Variational Quantum Monte Carlo
method with inter-site correlations included through the appropriate Jastrow factors.
