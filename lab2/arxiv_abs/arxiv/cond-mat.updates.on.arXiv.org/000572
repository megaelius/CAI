The Fe(1+x)Sb compound has been synthesized close to stoichiometry with x = 0.023(8). The compound
was investigated by 57Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy in the temperature range 4.2 - 300 K. The antiferromagnetic
ordering temperature was found as 232 K i.e. much higher than for the less stoichiometric material.
Regular iron was found to occupy two different positions in proportion 2:1. They differ by the electric
quadrupole coupling constants and both of them exhibit extremely anisotropic electric field gradient
tensor (EFG) with the asymmetry parameter equal one. The negative component of both EFGs is aligned
with the c-axis of the hexagonal unit cell, while the positive component is aligned with the <120>
direction. Hence, a model describing deviation from the NiAs P63/mmc symmetry group within Fe-planes
has been proposed. Spectra in the magnetically ordered state could be explained by introduction
of the incommensurate spin spirals propagating through the iron atoms in the direction of the c-axis
with a complex pattern of the hyperfine magnetic fields distributed within a-b plane. Hyperfine
magnetic field pattern of spirals due to major regular iron is smoothed by the spin polarized itinerant
electrons, while the minor regular iron exhibits hyperfine field pattern characteristic of the
highly covalent bonds to the adjacent antimony atoms. The excess interstitial iron orders magnetically
at the same temperature as the regular iron, and magnetic moments of these atoms are likely to form
two-dimensional spin glass with moments lying in the a-b plane. The upturn of the hyperfine field
for minor regular iron and interstitial iron is observed below 80 K. Magneto-elastic effects are
smaller than for FeAs, however the recoilless fraction increases significantly upon transition
to the magnetically ordered state.
