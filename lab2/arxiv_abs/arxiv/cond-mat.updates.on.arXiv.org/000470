The Boltzmann transport theory with the Drude model is our standard framework for metals described
by Landau's Fermi-liquid theory. However, recently observed anomalous transport phenomena imply
that the Drude model has to be modified even if electron correlations are weak and the concept of electron
quasiparticles is valid near a Fermi surface. A novel ingredient turns out to be that such a Fermi
surface encloses a Weyl point with definite chirality, referred to as a chiral Fermi surface, which
can arise from breaking of either time reversal or inversion symmetry in systems with strong spin-orbit
coupling. This novel metallic state has been realized recently in 3 percent Sb-doped Bi under magnetic
fields, where the Dirac spectrum appears around the critical point between the normal semiconducting
(x < 3 percent) and topological semiconducting phases (x > 3 percent) and the time reversal
symmetry breaking perturbation causes the Dirac point to split into a pair of Weyl points along the
direction of the applied magnetic field for such a strong spin-orbit coupled system. As a result,
this metallic state consists of a pair of chiral Fermi surfaces which encloses each Weyl point, referred
to as Weyl metal, where not only the Berry curvature but also the chiral anomaly between the pair of
chiral Fermi surfaces is responsible for anomalous transport phenomena such as anomalous Hall
effect, chiral magnetic effect, negative longitudinal magneto-electrical resistivity, and
so on beyond the description of the Drude model. In this review article, we discuss how the topological
structure of both the Berry curvature and chiral anomaly gives rise to anomalous transport phenomena
in 3 percent Sb-doped Bi under magnetic fields, modifying the Drude model in the Boltzmann transport
theory.
