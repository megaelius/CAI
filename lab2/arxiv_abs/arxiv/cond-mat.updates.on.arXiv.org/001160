Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers have most widely studied due to their unique
physical properties. Recently, Janus TMD Monolayer MoSSe with sandwiched S-Mo-Se structure has
been synthesized by replacing the top S atomic layer in $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ with Se atoms. In this work,
we systematically investigate the phonon transport and lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$)
of MoSSe monolayer by first-principles calculations and linearized phonon Boltzmann equation
within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). Calculated results show that the
$\kappa_L$ of MoSSe monolayer is very lower than that of $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ monolayer, and higher
than that of $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ monolayer. The corresponding sheet thermal conductance of MoSSe
monolayer is 342.50 $\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ at room temperature. These can be understood by phonon
group velocities and lifetimes. Compared with $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ monolayer, the smaller group
velocities and shorter phonon lifetimes of MoSSe monolayer give rise to lower $\kappa_L$. The larger
group velocities for MoSSe than $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ monolayer is main reason of higher $\kappa_L$.
The elastic properties of $\mathrm{MoS_2}$, MoSSe and $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ monolayers are also
calculated, and the order of Young's modulus is identical with that of $\kappa_L$. Calculated results
show that isotope scattering leads to 5.8\% reduce of $\kappa_L$. The size effects on the $\kappa_L$
are also considered, which is usually used in the device implementation. When the characteristic
length of MoSSe monolayer is about 110 nm, the $\kappa_L$ reduces to half. These results may offer
perspectives on thermal management of MoSSe monolayer for applications of thermoelectrics, thermal
circuits and nanoelectronics, and motivate further theoretical or experimental efforts to investigate
thermal transports of Janus TMD monolayers.
