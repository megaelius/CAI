Using the Matrix Product State framework, we generalize the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT)
construction to one-dimensional spin liquids with global color ${\rm SU}(N)$ symmetry, finite
correlation lengths, and edge states that can belong to any self-conjugate irreducible representation
(irrep) of ${\rm SU}(N)$. In particular, ${\rm SU}(2)$ spin-$1$ AKLT states with edge states of
arbitrary spin $s=1/2,1,3/2,\cdots$ are constructed, and a general formula for their correlation
length is given. Furthermore, we show how to construct local parent Hamiltonians for which these
AKLT states are unique ground states. This enables us to study the stability of the edge states by
interpolating between exact AKLT Hamiltonians. As an example, in the case of spin-$1$ physical
degrees of freedom, it is shown that a quantum phase transition of central charge $c = 1$ separates
the Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) phase with spin-$1/2$ edge states from a topologically
trivial phase with spin-$1$ edge states. We also address some specificities of the generalization
to ${\rm SU}(N)$ with $N>2$, in particular regarding the construction of parent Hamiltonians.
For the AKLT state of the ${\rm SU}(3)$ model with the $3$-box symmetric representation, we prove
that the edge states are in the $8$-dimensional adjoint irrep, and for the ${\rm SU}(3)$ model with
adjoint irrep at each site, we are able to construct two different reflection-symmetric AKLT Hamiltonians,
each with a unique ground state which is either even or odd under reflection symmetry and with edge
states in the adjoint irrep. Finally, examples of two-column and adjoint physical irreps for ${\rm
SU}(N)$ with $N$ even and with edge states living in the antisymmetric irrep with $N/2$ boxes are
given, with a conjecture about the general formula for their correlation lengths.
