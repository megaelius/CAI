Dangerous radioactive waste leftover from the Cold War era nuclear weapons production continues
to contaminate sixteen sites around the United States. Although many challenges and obstacles
exist in decontaminating these sites, two particularly difficult tasks associated with cleanup
of this waste are extracting and separating actinide elements from the remainder of the solution,
containing other actinide elements and non actinide elements. Developing effective methods for
performing these separations is possible by designing new chelating agents that form stable complexes
with actinide elements, and by investigating the interactions between the chelating agents and
the actinide elements. In this work, new chelating agents (or ligands) with potential to facilitate
the separation of radioactive waste are designed for Th, Pa, and U using relativistic Density Functional
Theory (DFT) inconjunction with a high-throughput algorithm. We show that both methodologies
can be combined efficiently to accelerate discovery and design of new ligands for separation of
the radioactive actinides. The main hypothesis that we test with this approach is that the strength
of secondary coordination sphere (SCS) can be tuned to increase the selectivity of binding with
different actinides. More specifically, we show that links that connect two of the catecholamide
ligands via covalent interactions are then added to increase the overall stability of the complex.
The effect of increase in the selectivity is also observed when non-covalent interaction is used
between ligands. We apply this approach for Th, Pa, and U, and discover linkers that can be used with
other ligands.
