We provide a transmission line representation for channels exhibiting spin-momentum locking
(SML) which can be used for both time-dependent and steady-state transport analysis on a wide variety
of materials with spin-orbit coupling such as topological insulators, heavy metals, and narrow
bandgap semiconductors. This model is based on the time-dependent semiclassical equations obtained
from the Boltzmann formalism under linear response approximation using four electrochemical
potentials for four groups of electronic states ($U^+$, $D^+$, $U^-$, and $D^-$) depending on the
sign of the $z$-component of the spin ($U$, $D$) and the sign of the $x$-component of the group velocity
($+,-$). A key parameter in this formalism is the degree of SML described by $p_0=\left(M-N\right)/\left(M+N\right)$,
$M$ and $N$ being number of modes for $\left(U^+,D^-\right)$ and $\left(U^-,D^+\right)$ groups
respectively. For normal metal channels ($p_0=0$), the model decouples into the well known transmission
line model for charge and the time-dependent version of Valet-Fert equation respectively. Our
model show that the charge and spin signals travel with two distinct velocities resulting in well-known
spin-charge separation which is expected to persist even in the presence of SML i.e. $p_0\neq 0$.
Similar arguments have been discussed previously although there exists counter argument that
the spin-orbit coupling may destroy the spin-charge separation. However, our model predicts that
the lower velocity signal is purely spin while the higher velocity signal is largely charge with
an additional spin component proportional to $p_0$, which has not been noted before.
