The recent experiments [Y. Wang {\em et al.}, Science {\bf 366}, 1125 (2019)] on {\em magnon-mediated}
spin-transfer torque (MSTT) have been interpreted in terms of a qualitative picture where magnons
are excited within an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI), by applying nonequilibrium spin density
on its left edge, so that propagating magnons (without any motion of electrons) across AFI eventually
lead to reversal of magnetization of a ferromagnetic metal (FM) attached to the right edge of AFI.
We employ a recently developed time-dependent nonequilibrium Green functions combined with the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (TDNEGF+LLG) formalism to evolve electrons quantum-mechanically
while they interact via self-consistent back-action with localized magnetic moments described
classically by atomistic spin dynamics based on solving a system of LLG equations. Upon injection
of square current pulse as the initial condition, TDNEGF+LLG simulations of localized magnetic
moments switching within FM-analyzer of FM-polarizer/AFI/FM-analyzer junction show that it
is less efficient, in the sense of requiring larger pulse height and its longer duration, than conventional
electron-mediated STT (ESTT)-driven switching in standard FM-polarizer/normal-metal/FM-analyzer
spin valves. Since {\em both} electronic (via spin pumping from AFI) and magnonic (via direct transmission
from AFI) spin currents are injected into the FM-analyzer, its localized magnetic moments will
experience combined MSTT and ESTT. Nevertheless, we demonstrate, by artificially turning off
ESTT, that MSTT {\em dominates} the switching, so that direct exchange coupling between AFI layer
and FM-analyzer is required to obtain complete reversal of localized magnetic moments within the
FM-analyzer.
