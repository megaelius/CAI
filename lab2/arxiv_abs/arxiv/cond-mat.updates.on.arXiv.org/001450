The interplay between Kondo effect, indirect magnetic interaction and geometrical frustration
is studied in the Kondo lattice on the one-dimensional zigzag ladder. Using the density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG), the ground state and various short- and long-range spin- and density-correlation
functions are calculated for the model at half-filling as a function of the antiferromagnetic Kondo
interaction down to $J=0.3t$ where $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping on the zigzag ladder. Geometrical
frustration is shown to lead to at least two critical points: Starting from the strong-$J$ limit,
where almost local Kondo screening dominates and where the system is a nonmagnetic Kondo insulator,
antiferromagnetic correlations between nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor local
spins become stronger and stronger, until at $J^{\rm dim}_{\rm c} \approx 0.89t$ frustration is
alleviated by a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry and a corresponding transition
to a dimerized state. This is characterized by antiferromagnetic correlations along the legs and
by alternating antiferro- and ferromagnetic correlations on the rungs of the ladder. A mechanism
of partial Kondo screening that has been suggested for the Kondo lattice on the two-dimensional
triangular lattice is not realized in the one-dimensional case. Furthermore, within the symmetry-broken
dimerized state, there is a magnetic transition to a $90^{\circ}$ quantum spin spiral with quasi-long-range
order at $J^{\rm mag}_{\rm c} \approx 0.84t$. The quantum-critical point is characterized by a
closure of the spin gap (with decreasing $J$) and a divergence of the spin-correlation length and
of the spin-structure factor $S(q)$ at wave vector $q=\pi/2$. This is opposed to the model on the
one-dimensional bipartite chain, which is known to have a finite spin gap for all $J>0$ at half-filling.
