The low-frequency range of vibrational spectra is sensitive to collective vibrations of the lattice.
In molecular crystals, it can be decisive to identify the structure of different polymorphs, and
in addition, it plays an important role on the magnitude of the temperature-dependent component
of vibrational free energy differences between these crystals. In this work we study the vibrational
Raman spectra and vibrational density of states of different polymorphs of the flexible Aspirin
and Paracetamol crystals based on dispersion-corrected density-functional theory, density-functional
perturbation theory, and $ab\,initio$ molecular dynamics. We examine the effect of quasi-harmonic
lattice expansion and compare the results of harmonic theory and the time correlation formalism
for vibrational spectra. Lattice expansion strongly affects the collective vibrations below
300 cm$^{-1}$, but it is significantly less important at higher frequencies, while thermal nuclear
motion can be important in the full vibrational range. We also observe that the inclusion or neglect
of many-body van der Waals dispersion interactions do not cause large differences in the low-frequency
range of Raman spectra or vibrational density of states, provided the lattice constants are fixed.
We obtain quantitative agreement with experimental room-temperature Raman spectra below 300
cm$^{-1}$ for all polymorphs studied. Examining the two-dimensional correlations between different
vibrations, we find which modes show a larger degree of anharmonic coupling to others, providing
a possible route to assess the accuracy of harmonic free energy evaluations in different cases.
