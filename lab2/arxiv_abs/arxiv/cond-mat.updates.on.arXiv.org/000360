Phonon density of states (PDOS) measurements have been performed on polycrystalline UO2 at 295
and 1200 K using time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering to investigate the impact of anharmonicity
on the vibrational spectra and to benchmark ab initio PDOS simulations performed on this strongly
correlated Mott-insulator. Time-of-flight PDOS measurements include anharmonic linewidth
broadening inherently and the factor of ~ 7 enhancement of the oxygen spectrum relative to the uranium
component by the neutron weighting increases sensitivity to the oxygen-dominated optical phonon
modes. The first-principles simulations of quasi-harmonic PDOS spectra were neutron-weighted
and anharmonicity was introduced in an approximate way by convolution with wavevector-weighted
averages over our previously measured phonon linewidths for UO2 that are provided in numerical
form. Comparisons between the PDOS measurements and the simulations show reasonable agreement
overall, but they also reveal important areas of disagreement for both high and low temperatures.
The discrepancies stem largely from an ~ 10 meV compression in the overall bandwidth (energy range)
of the oxygen-dominated optical phonons in the simulations. A similar linewidth-convoluted comparison
performed with the PDOS spectrum of Dolling et al. obtained by shell-model fitting to their historical
phonon dispersion measurements shows excellent agreement with the time-of-flight PDOS measurements
reported here. In contrast, we show by comparisons of spectra in linewidth-convoluted form that
recent first-principles simulations for UO2 fail to account for the PDOS spectrum determined from
the measurements of Dolling et al. These results demonstrate PDOS measurements to be stringent
tests for ab initio simulations of phonon physics in UO2 and they indicate further the need for advances
in theory to address lattice dynamics of UO2.
