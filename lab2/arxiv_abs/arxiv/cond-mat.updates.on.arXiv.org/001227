We consider a lattice gas in spaces of dimensionality $\mathcal{D}=1,2,3$. The particles are subject
to a hardcore exclusion interaction and an attractive pair interaction that satisfies Gauss' law
as do Newtonian gravity in $\mathcal{D}=3$, a logarithmic potential in $\mathcal{D}=2$, and an
equivalent-neighbor force in $\mathcal{D}=1$. Under mild additional assumptions regarding
symmetry and fluctuations we investigate equilibrium states of self-gravitating material clusters,
in particular radial density profiles for closed and open systems. We present exact analytic results
in several instances and high-precision numerical data in others. The density profile of a cluster
with finite mass is found to exhibit exponential decay in $\mathcal{D}=1$ and power-law decay in
$\mathcal{D}=2$ with temperature-dependent exponents in both cases. In $\mathcal{D}=2$ the
gas evaporates in a continuous transition at a nonzero critical temperature. We describe clusters
of infinite mass in $\mathcal{D}=3$ with a density profile consisting of three layers (core, shell,
halo) and an algebraic large-distance asymptotic decay. In $\mathcal{D}=3$ a cluster of finite
mass can be stabilized at $T>0$ via confinement to a sphere of finite radius. In some parameter regime,
the gas thus enclosed undergoes a discontinuous transition between distinct density profiles.
For the free energy needed to identify the equilibrium state we introduce a construction of gravitational
self-energy that works in all $\mathcal{D}$ for the lattice gas. The decay rate of the density profile
of an open cluster is shown to transform via a stretched exponential for $1<\mathcal{D}<2$ whereas
it crosses over from one power-law at intermediate distances to a different power-law at larger
distances for $2<\mathcal{D}<3$.
