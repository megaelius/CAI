The extended Falicov-Kimball model (EFKM) is analyzed exactly for finite temperatures in the limit
of large dimensions. The onsite, as well as the intersite density-density interactions represented
by the coupling constants $U$ and $V$, respectively, are included in the model. Using the dynamic
mean field theory (DMFT) formalism on the Bethe lattice we find rigorously the temperature dependent
density of states (DOS) at half-filling. At zero temperature ($T=0$) the system is ordered to form
the checkerboard pattern and the DOS has the gap $\Delta(\varepsilon_F) > 0$ at the Fermi level,
if only $U\neq 0$ or $V\neq 0$. With an increase of $T$ the DOS evolves in various ways that depend both
on $U$ and $V$. If $U <0$ or $U > 2V$, two additional subbands develop inside the principal energy gap.
They become wider with increasing $T$ and at a certain $U$- and $V$-dependent temperature $T_{MI}$
they join with each other at $\varepsilon_F$. Since above $T_{MI}$ the DOS is positive at $\varepsilon_F$,
we interpret $T_{MI}$ as the transformation temperature from insulator to metal. Having calculated
the temperature dependent DOS we study thermodynamic properties of the system starting from its
free energy $F$ and then we construct the phase diagrams in the variables $T$ and $U$ for a few values
of $V$. Our calculations give that inclusion of the intersite coupling $V$ causes the finite temperature
phase diagrams become asymmetric with respect to a change of sign of $U$. On these phase diagrams
we detected stability regions of eight different kinds of ordered phases (five of them are insulating
and three are conducting) and three different nonordered phases (two of them are insulating and
one is conducting). Moreover, both continuous and discontinuous transitions between various
phases were found.
