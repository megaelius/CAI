We consider point particle that collides with a periodic array of hard-core elastic scatterers
where the length of the free flights is unbounded (the infinite-horizon Lorentz gas, LG). The Bleher
central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of the particle displacement divided
by $\sqrt{t\ln t}$ is Gaussian in the limit of infinite time $t$. However it was stressed recently
that the slow convergence makes this result unobservable. Using a L\'{e}vy walk model (LW) of the
LG, it was proposed that the use of a rescaled Lambert function instead of $\sqrt{t\ln t}$ provides
a fast convergent, observable CLT, which was confirmed by the LG simulations. We demonstrate here
that this result can simplified to a mixed CLT where the scaling factor combines normal and anomalous
diffusions. For narrow infinite corridors the particle for long time obeys the usual normal diffusion,
which explains the previous numerical observations. In the opposite limit of small scatterers
the Bleher CLT gives a good guiding. In the intermediate cases the mixed CLT applies. The Gaussian
peak determines moments of order smaller than two. In contrast, the CLT gives only half the coordinate
dispersion. The missing half of the dispersion and also moments of order higher than two are described
by the distribution's tail (the infinite density) which we derive here. The tail is supported along
the infinite corridors and formed by anomalously long flights whose duration is comparable with
the whole time of observation. The moments' calculation from the tail is confirmed by direct calculation
of the fourth moment from the statistics of the backward recurrence time defined as time that elapsed
since the last collision. This completes the solution of the LW model allowing full comparison with
the LG.
