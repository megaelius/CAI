The downscaling of silicon-based structures and proto-devices has now reached the single atom
scale, representing an important milestone for the development of a silicon-based quantum computer.
One especially notable platform for atomic scale device fabrication is the so-called SiP delta-layer,
consisting of an ultra dense and sharp layer of dopants within a semiconductor host. Whilst several
alternatives exist, phosphorus dopants in silicon have drawn the most interest, and it is on this
platform that many quantum proto-devices have been successfully demonstrated. Motivated by this,
both calculations and experiments have been dedicated to understanding the electronic structure
of the SiP delta-layer platform. In this work, we use high resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) to reveal the structure of the electronic states which exist because of the
high dopant density of the SiP delta-layer. In contrast to published theoretical work, we resolve
three distinct bands, the most occupied of which shows a large anisotropy and significant deviation
from simple parabolic behaviour. We investigate the possible origins of this fine structure, and
conclude that it is primarily a consequence of the dielectric constant being large (ca. double that
of bulk Si). Incorporating this factor into tight binding calculations leads to a major revision
of band structure; specifically, the existence of a third band, the separation of the bands, and
the departure from purely parabolic behaviour. This new understanding of the bandstructure has
important implications for quantum proto-devices which are built on the SiP delta-layer platform.
