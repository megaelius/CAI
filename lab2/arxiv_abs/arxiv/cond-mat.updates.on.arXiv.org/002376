It is demonstrated that the Landau diamagnetism of the free electron gas and a monovalent metal can
be considered as a Fermi surface effect. Only relatively small number of electron states close to
the Fermi surface are diamagnetically active whereas the majority of the electron states inside
the Fermi surface are diamagnetically inert. This partitioning of the occupied electron states
is driven by the structure of Landau levels, around which one can introduce magnetic tubes in the
reciprocal space. Completely filled magnetic tubes do not change their energy in an applied magnetic
field, and only partially occupied magnetic tubes in the neighborhood of the Fermi surface exhibit
a diamagnetic response. Using this partitioning of the occupied electron states we derive a general
expression for the steady diamagnetic susceptibility, for calculation of which one needs to know
the shape of the Fermi surface and the energy gradient on it. The method is applied to alkali metals,
whose Fermi surfaces and energy gradients have been obtained from ab initio band structure calculations.
It has been found that the Landau diamagnetic susceptibility is anisotropic depending on the direction
of the applied magnetic field in respect to the Fermi surface. This effect is more pronounced for
Li and Cs, whose Fermi surfaces show a noticeable deformation from the spherical shape. The method
opens a new route for ab initio calculations of the Landau diamagnetism of metals or intermetallic
compounds. In the case of free electron gas it is shown that this approach also fully describes the
oscillatory de Haas - van Alphen part of the diamagnetic susceptibility. Small oscillations of
the Fermi energy found in the model are caused by redistribution (inflow or outflow) of electrons
from the equatorial region of the Fermi surface.
