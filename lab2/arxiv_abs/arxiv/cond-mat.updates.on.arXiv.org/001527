In many materials, formation of building blocks and their controlled-angle packings results into
develop various geometric anisotropic shaped particles. These trends are more pronounced in atoms
of many transition elements containing more electrons. Monolayer triangular-shaped tiny particles
are prerequisite as they are the building blocks of such particles. In different referred processes,
developing particles of anisotropic shape appear to deal such tiny particles. In this work, the
basic idea of formation of such building block is discussed. When packets of nano energy shaping
in equilateral triangle are placed over monolayer assembly of certain transition state atoms at
solution surface resulting into their binding in own shape. Simultaneously, atoms of monolayer
tiny particle elongate from the centers along opposite poles under exertion of surface format force,
thus, convert one-dimensional arrays to structure of smooth elements. Each such tiny particle
works as one unit under the maintenance of immersing force resulting into pack at common centre to
develop mono layer of certain developing particle while filling the unfilled regions as per controlling
the force, which is not the case in developing distorted particles. Originally, binding of such
atoms is under the execution of electron-dynamics when in neutral state where their auxiliary ground
point remains below the average-leveled ground surface. A tiny shaped particle once in mono layer
of certain developing particle, it deals localized gravity. One step down mono layer bind to the
following one mono layer where electrons of elongated atoms enable lateral placement under adjusting
contraction-expansion of clamped energy knots. Study further sheds light on elongation of atoms
of one-dimensional array.
