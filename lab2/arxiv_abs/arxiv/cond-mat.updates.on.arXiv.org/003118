Magneto-elastic (straintronic) switching of bistable magnetostrictive nanomagnets is an extremely
energy-efficient switching methodology for (magnetic) binary switches that has recently attracted
widespread attention because of its potential application in ultra-low-power digital computing
hardware. Unfortunately, this modality of switching is also error very prone at room temperature.
Theoretical studies of switching error probability of magneto-elastic switches have predicted
probabilities ranging from 10E-8-10E-3 at room temperature for ideal, defect-free nanomagnets,
but experiments with real nanomagnets show a much higher probability that exceeds 0.1 in some cases.
The obvious spoilers that can cause this large difference are defects and non-idealities. Here,
we have theoretically studied the effect of common defects (that occur during fabrication) on magneto-elastic
switching probability in the presence of room-temperature thermal noise. Surprisingly, we found
that even small defects increase the switching error probabilities by orders of magnitude. There
is usually a critical stress that leads to the lowest error probability and its value increases enormously
in the presence of defects. All this could limit or preclude the application of magneto-elastic
(straintronic) binary switches in either Boolean logic or memory, despite their excellent energy-efficiency,
and restrict them to non-Boolean (e.g. neuromorphic, stochastic) computing applications. We
also studied the difference between magneto-elastic switching with a stress pulse of constant
amplitude and sinusoidal time-varying amplitude (e.g. due to a surface acoustic wave) and found
that the latter method is more reliable and generates lower switching error probabilities in most
cases, provided the time variation is reasonably slow.
