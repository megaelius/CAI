We propose topological Dirac nodal line (DNL) magnonic phase in layered honeycomb collinear antiferromagnets
naturally available in various layered honeycomb materials. We show that they are symmetry-protected
by the combination of space-inversion and time-reversal symmetry as well as magnetic crystal symmetry
and they cannot be gapped out by the spin-orbit Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also show
that they exhibit small dispersive drumhead magnon surface states that connect a pair of surface
projection of the topological DNL magnons. In addition, we show that layered honeycomb collinear
antiferromagnets behave quite differently from strictly two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb collinear
antiferromagnets in that the combination of space-inversion and time-reversal symmetry forces
the Berry curvature to vanish in the entire Brillouin zone. Therefore, the magnon spin Nernst effect
predicted to manifest in the 2D honeycomb collinear antiferromagnets is prohibited in layered
honeycomb collinear antiferromagnets coupled antiferromagnetically. However, upon breaking
the symmetry protection of the topological DNL magnons by an external magnetic field, we show that
non-vanishing Berry curvatures and Chern number protected topological magnon bands are induced
in the non-collinear spin structure. This leads to experimentally accessible magnon thermal Hall
effect in the time-reversal symmetry-broken layered honeycomb collinear antiferromagnets.
Material realizations of the current predicted results include the layered honeycomb antiferromagnets
CaMn$_2$Sb$_2$, BaNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, and Bi$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$(NO$_3$).
