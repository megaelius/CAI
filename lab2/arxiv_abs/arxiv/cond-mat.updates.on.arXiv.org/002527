We introduce a unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz termed $k$-UpCCGSD that is based on a family
of sparse generalized doubles (D) operators which provides an affordable and systematically improvable
unitary coupled-cluster wavefunction suitable for implementation on a near-term quantum computer.
$k$-UpCCGSD employs $k$ products of the exponential of pair coupled-cluster double excitation
operators (pCCD), together with generalized single (S) excitation operators. We compare its performance
in both efficiency of implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing
the full generalized SD excitation operators (UCCGSD), as well as with the standard ansatz employing
only SD excitations (UCCSD). $k$-UpCCGSD is found to show the best scaling for quantum computing
applications, requiring a circuit depth of $\mathcal O(kN)$, compared with $\mathcal O(N^3)$
for UCCGSD and $\mathcal O((N-\eta)^2 \eta)$ for UCCSD where $N$ is the number of spin orbitals and
$\eta$ is the number of electrons. We analyzed the accuracy of these three ans\"atze by making classical
benchmark calculations on the ground state and the first excited state of H$_4$ (STO-3G, 6-31G),
H$_2$O (STO-3G), and N$_2$ (STO-3G), making additional comparisons to conventional coupled cluster
methods. The results for ground states show that $k$-UpCCGSD offers a good tradeoff between accuracy
and cost, achieving chemical accuracy for lower cost of implementation on quantum computers than
both UCCGSD and UCCSD. Excited states are calculated with an orthogonally constrained variational
quantum eigensolver approach. This is seen to generally yield less accurate energies than for the
corresponding ground states. We demonstrate that using a specialized multi-determinantal reference
state constructed from classical linear response calculations allows these excited state energetics
to be improved.
