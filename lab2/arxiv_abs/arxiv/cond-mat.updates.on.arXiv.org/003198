The kagome lattice based on 3d transition metals is a versatile platform for novel topological phases
hosting symmetry-protected electronic excitations and exotic magnetic ground states. However,
the paradigmatic states of the idealized two-dimensional (2D) kagome lattice - Dirac fermions
and topological flat bands - have not been simultaneously observed, partly owing to the complex
stacking structure of the kagome compounds studied to date. Here, we take the approach of examining
FeSn, an antiferromagnetic single-layer kagome metal with spatially-decoupled kagome planes.
Using polarization- and termination-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES), we detect the momentum-space signatures of coexisting flat bands and Dirac fermions in
the vicinity of the Fermi energy. Intriguingly, when complemented with bulk-sensitive de Haas-van
Alphen (dHvA) measurements, our data reveal an even richer electronic structure that exhibits
robust surface Dirac fermions on specific crystalline terminations. Through band structure calculations
and matrix element simulations, we demonstrate that the bulk Dirac bands arise from in-plane localized
Fe-3d orbitals under kagome symmetry, while the surface state realizes a rare example of fully spin-polarized
2D Dirac fermions when combined with spin-layer locking in FeSn. These results highlight FeSn as
a prototypical host for the emergent excitations of the kagome lattice. The prospect to harness
these excitations for novel topological phases and spintronic devices is a frontier of great promise
at the confluence of topology, magnetism, and strongly-correlated electron physics.
