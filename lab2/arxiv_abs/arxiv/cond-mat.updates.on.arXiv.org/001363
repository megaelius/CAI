The electron-phonon interaction contribution to the electronic energies is included in density
functional total energy calculations with ab initio pseudopotentials via the Allen formalism
[Phys. Rev. B 18, 5217 (1978)] to obtain temperature dependent electronic structure of diamond
and silicon. This method allows us to obtain the thermally-averaged ab initio electronic structure
in a straightforward and computationally inexpensive way. Our investigations on the finite temperature
electronic structure of diamond and silicon lead to a new criterion, temperature transferability,
which is required in the ab initio pseudopotentials for temperature dependent studies. The temperature
transferability of the Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials used in this work is strongly dependent
on the cut-off radius and the inclusion of the unbound 3d$^0$ state. The finite temperature indirect
band gaps are highly sensitive to the choice of cut-off radius used in the pseudopotentials. The
finite temperature band structures and density of states show that thermal vibrations affect the
electron energies throughout the valence and conduction band. We compare our results on the band
gap shifts with that due to the Debye-Waller term in the Allen-Heine theory and discuss the observed
differences in the zero point and high temperature band gap shifts. Although, the electron energy
shifts in the highest occupied valence band and lowest unoccupied conduction band enable to obtain
the changes in the indirect and direct band gaps at finite temperatures, the shifts in other electronic
levels with temperature enable investigations into the finite temperature valence charge distribution
in the bonding region. Thus, we demonstrate that the Allen theory provides a simple and theoretically
justified formalism to obtain finite temperature valence electron charge densities that go beyond
the rigid pseudo-atom approximation.
