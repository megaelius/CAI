Odd-frequency superconductivity is an exotic phase of matter in which Cooper pairing between electrons
is entirely dynamical in nature. Majorana zero modes exhibit pure odd-frequency superconducting
correlations due to their specific properties. Thus, by tunnel-coupling an array of Majorana zero
modes to a spin-polarized wire, it is in principle possible to engineer a bulk one-dimensional odd-frequency
spinless $s$-wave superconductor. We here point out that each tunnel coupling element, being dependent
on a large number of material-specific parameters, is generically complex with sample variability
in both its magnitude and phase. Using this, we demonstrate that, upon averaging over phase-disorder,
the induced superconducting, including odd-frequency, correlations in the spin-polarized wire
are significantly suppressed. We perform both a rigorous analytical evaluation of the disorder-averaged
$T$-matrix in the wire, as well as numerical calculations based on a tight-binding model, and find
that the anomalous, i.e. superconducting, part of the $T$-matrix is highly suppressed with phase
disorder. We also demonstrate that this suppression is concurrent with the filling of the single-particle
excitation gap by smearing the near-zero frequency peaks, due to formation of bound states that
satisfy phase-matching conditions between spatially separated Majorana zero modes. Our results
convey important constraints on the parameter control needed in practical realizations of Majorana
zero mode structures and suggest that the achievement of a bulk 1D odd-$\omega$ superconductivity
from MZMs demand full control of the system parameters.
