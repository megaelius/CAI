The critical curves of the q-state Potts model can be determined exactly for regular two-dimensional
lattices G that are of the three-terminal type. Jacobsen and Scullard have defined a graph polynomial
P_B(q,v) that gives access to the critical manifold for general lattices. It depends on a finite
repeating part of the lattice, called the basis B, and its real roots in the temperature variable
v = e^K - 1 provide increasingly accurate approximations to the critical manifolds upon increasing
the size of B. These authors computed P_B(q,v) for large bases (up to 243 edges), obtaining determinations
of the ferromagnetic critical point v_c > 0 for the (4,8^2), kagome, and (3,12^2) lattices to
a precision (of the order 10^{-8}) slightly superior to that of the best available Monte Carlo simulations.
In this paper we describe a more efficient transfer matrix approach to the computation of P_B(q,v)
that relies on a formulation within the periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra. This makes possible computations
for substantially larger bases (up to 882 edges), and the precision on v_c is hence taken to the range
10^{-13}. We further show that a large variety of regular lattices can be cast in a form suitable for
this approach. This includes all Archimedean lattices, their duals and their medials. For all these
lattices we tabulate high-precision estimates of the bond percolation thresholds p_c and Potts
critical points v_c. We also trace and discuss the full Potts critical manifold in the (q,v) plane,
paying special attention to the antiferromagnetic region v < 0. Finally, we adapt the technique
to site percolation as well, and compute the polynomials P_B(p) for certain Archimedean and dual
lattices (those having only cubic and quartic vertices), using very large bases (up to 243 vertices).
This produces the site percolation thresholds p_c to a precision of the order 10^{-9}.
