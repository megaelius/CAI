A one-dimensional semiconductor nanowire proximitized by a nearby superconductor may become
a topological superconductor hosting localized Majorana zero modes at the two wire ends in the presence
of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman spin splitting (arising from an external magnetic field). The
hallmark of the presence of such Majorana zero modes is the appearance of a zero-temperature quantized
zero-bias conductance peak in the tunneling spectroscopy of the Majorana nanowire. We theoretically
study the temperature and the tunnel coupling dependence of the tunneling conductance in such nanowires
to understand possible intrinsic deviations from the predicted conductance quantization. We
find that the full temperature and the tunneling transmission dependence of the tunnel conductance
does not obey any simple scaling relation, and estimating the zero-temperature conductance from
finite-temperature and finite-tunnel-broadening tunneling data is difficult in general. A scaling
relation, however, does hold at the extreme weak-tunneling low-temperature limit where the conductance
depends only on the dimensionless ratio of the temperature and tunnel broadening. We also consider
the tunneling contributions from nontopological Andreev bound states which may produce almost-zero-bias
conductance peaks, which are not easy to distinguish from the Majorana-induced zero-bias peaks,
finding that the nontopological almost-zero-modes associated with Andreev bound states manifest
similar temperature and transmission dependence as the topological Majorana modes. We comment
on the Zeeman splitting dependence of the zero-bias conductance peak for finite temperature and
tunnel coupling.
