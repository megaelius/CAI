We explore the dynamics of the bilayer in liposomes in relationship to the motion of individual lipid
molecules. Monitoring the dynamics at the length-scale of single lipids is important because it
may relate to cellular signaling and regulatory processes. Our experiments prove a very localized
relaxation, which we experimentally confirmed as a trapped motion of the fatty acid tails in a very
crowded environment, by analyzing results from neutron spin echo spectroscopy on fully and partially
deuterated lipids. This motion is visible over several orders of magnitude in time- and length-scale
and a comprehensive scientific study require several neutron spectroscopic techniques. Analyzing
experiments on protonated and partially deuterated lipids indicate the statistical independence
of tail-motion and height-height correlation of the membrane. This permits to deduct a theoretical
model that describes neutron spectroscopy data of liposomes. Our results are best compatible with
lipid tails relaxing in potential with cylindrical symmetry. Our modeling approach satisfactorily
describes the dynamics of different phospholipids, including mixtures of different lipids, and
partially deuterated systems. Despite substantial differences in the chemistry of the fatty acid
tails, the observed motion seems to behave rather universal. The existence of the fast-localized
tail motion and the slow translational diffusion of liposomes limit the time range in which the height-height
correlation function can be monitored and analyzed. Taking into account these time constraints,
we determined bending moduli between 8 kBT (SoyPC) to 22 kBT (DSPC). These values are slightly lesser
than determined in the earlier literature, i.e., without including explicitly lipid tail motion.
Thus, the new analysis shows that these membranes are a bit more elastic than observed before.
