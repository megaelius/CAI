The study of spatial symmetries in solids, or the crystallographic space groups, was accomplished
during the last century, and had greatly improved our understanding of electronic band structures
in solids. Nowadays, the "symmetry data" of any band structure, i.e., the irreducible representations
of all valence bands, can be readily extracted from standard numerical calculations based on first
principles. On the other hand, the topological invariants, the defining quantities of topological
materials, are in general considerably difficult to calculate ab initio. While topological materials
promise robust and exotic physical properties both scientifically intriguing and favorable for
the designs of new quantum devices, their numerical prediction and discovery have been critically
slowed down by the involved calculation of the invariants. To remove the hindrance to a fast and automated
search for topological materials, we provide an explicit and exhaustive mapping from symmetry
data to topological invariants for any gapped band structure in each one of the space groups in the
presence of time-reversal symmetry. The mapping is completed using the theoretical tool of "layer
construction", where topological states in three dimensions jointly protected by time-reversal
and spatial symmetries are assembled from decoupled two-dimensional topological states, in the
same way atomic insulators are assembled from decoupled, point-like atomic orbitals. The simple
structure of layer constructions allows simplified calculation of both the symmetry data and the
topological invariants, so that a matching between the two sets yields the mapping we need. With
these results and symmetry data obtained from standard first principles numerics, finding topological
invariants reduces to a simple search in the "dictionary".
