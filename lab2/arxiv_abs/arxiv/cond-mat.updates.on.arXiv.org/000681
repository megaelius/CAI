Strain-based theory on elastic instabilities is being widely employed for studying onset of plasticity,
phase transition or melting in crystals. And size effects, observed in nano-materials or solids
under dynamic loadings, needs to account for contributions from strain gradient. However, the
strain gradient based higher order elastic theories on the elastic instabilities are not well established
to enable one to predict high order instabilities of solids directly at atom level. In present work,
a general continuum theory for higher order elastic instabilities is established and justified
by developing an equivalent description at atom level. Our results show that mechanical instability
of solids, triggered by either strain or strain gradient, is determined by a simple stability condition
consisting of strain or strain gradient related elastic constants. With the atom-level description
of the higher order elasticity, the strain-gradient elastic constants could be directly obtained
by a molecular statics procedure and then serve as inputs of the stability condition. In this way,
mechanical instabilities of three metals, i.e., copper, aluminum and iron, are predicted. Alternatively,
ramp compression technique by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations is employed
to study the higher order instabilities of the three metals. The predicted critical strains at onset
of instabilities agree well with the results from the NEMD simulations for all the metals. Since
the only inputs for the established higher order elastic theory are the same as atomic simulations,
i.e., atomic potentials and structures of solids, the established theory is completely equivalent
to empirical-potential based atomic simulations methods, at least, for crystals.
