In the present study, water is considered as a dynamic network between molecules at distances not
exceeding 3.2 angstroms. The instantaneous configurations obtained by using the molecular dynamics
method have been sequentially analyzed, the mutual orientation of each molecule with its neighboring
molecules has been studied and the interaction energy of each pair of neighbor molecules has been
calculated. The majority of mutual orientation angles between molecules lie in the interval [10,
30] degrees. It has been shown that more than 85% of the molecular pairs in each instantaneous configuration
form H-bonds and the H-bond network includes all water molecules in the temperature range 233-293
K. The number of H-bonds fluctuates near the mean value and increases with decreasing temperature,
and the energy of the vast majority of such bonds is much higher than the thermal energy. The interaction
energy of 80% of the H-bonding molecular pairs lies in the interval [-7; -4] kcal/mol. The interaction
energy of pairs that do not satisfy the H-bond angle criterion lies in the interval [-5; 4] kcal/mol,
and the number of such bonds does not exceed 15% and decreases with decreasing temperature. For the
first time it was found that in each instantaneous configuration the H-bond network contains built-in
nanometric structural heterogeneities formed by shorter H-bonds. The fraction of molecules involved
in the structural heterogeneities increases from 40% to 60% with a temperature decrease from 293
K to 233 K. These heterogeneities have a finite lifetime, but are constantly present in the water.
The number of large heterogeneities (containing more than 20 molecules) increases with decreasing
temperature, and the number of small structural heterogeneities (less than 20) decreases.
