Magnetic systems with frustration often have a large classical degeneracy. Their low-energy physics
can then be understood in terms of dynamics within the space of classical ground states. We explore
this idea in a family of quantum spin clusters where every pair of spins is connected by an $XY$ antiferromagnetic
bond. The dimer with two spin-$S$ spins provides the simplest example -- it maps to a quantum particle
on a ring ($S^1$). The trimer is more complex, equivalent to a particle that lives on two disjoint
rings ($S^1\otimes \mathbb{Z}_2$). It has an additional subtlety for half-integer $S$ values,
wherein both rings must be threaded by $\pi$-fluxes to obtain a satisfactory mapping. This is a consequence
of the geometric phase incurred by spins. For both the dimer and the trimer, the validity of the effective
theory can be seen from a path-integral-based derivation. This approach cannot be extended to the
quadrumer which has a non-manifold ground state space, consisting of three tori that touch pairwise
along lines. In order to understand dynamics of a particle in this space, we develop a tight-binding
model with this connectivity. Remarkably, this successfully reproduces the low-energy spectrum
of the quadrumer. For half-integer spins, a geometric phase emerges which can be mapped to two $\pi$-flux
tubes that reside in the space between the tori. The non-manifold character of this space leads to
a remarkable effect -- at low energies, the particle is localized around the singular lines of the
ground state space. The low-energy spectrum consists of an extensive number of bound states, formed
around singularities. Physically, this manifests as an order-by-disorder-like preference for
collinear ground states. However, unlike order-by-disorder, this `order by singularity' persists
even in the classical limit. We discuss consequences for field theoretic studies of magnets.
