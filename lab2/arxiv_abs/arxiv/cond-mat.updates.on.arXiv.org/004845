Various multi-spin magnetic exchange interactions (MEI) of chiral nature have been recently unveiled.
Owing to their potential impact on the realisation of twisted spin-textures, their implication
in spintronics or quantum computing is very promising. Here, I address the long-range behavior
of multi-spin MEI on the basis of a multiple-scattering formalism implementable in Green functions
based methods. I consider the impact of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as described in the one- (1D) and
two-dimensional (2D) Rashba model, from which the analytical forms of the four- and six-spin interactions
are extracted and compared to the bilinear isotropic, anisotropic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions (DMI). Similarly to the DMI between two sites $i$ and $j$, there is a four-spin chiral
vector perpendicular to the bond connecting the two sites. The oscillatory behavior of the MEI and
their decay as function of interatomic distances are analysed and quantified for the Rashba surfaces
states characterizing Au surfaces. The interplay of beating effects and strength of SOC gives rise
to a wide parameter space where chiral MEI are more prominent than the isotropic ones. The multi-spin
interactions for a plaquette of $N$ magnetic moments decay like $\{q_F^{N-d} P^{\frac{1}{2}(d-1)}L\}^{-1}$
simplifying to $\{q_F^{N-d} R^{\left[1+\frac{N}{2}(d-1)\right]}N\}^{-1}$ for equidistant
atoms, where $d$ is the dimension of the mediating electrons, $q_F$ the Fermi wave vector, $L$ the
perimeter of the plaquette while $P$ is the product of interatomic distances. This recovers the
behavior of the bilinear MEI, $\{q_F^{2-d} R^{d}\}^{-1}$, and shows that increasing the perimeter
of the plaquette weakens the MEI. More important, the power-law pertaining to the distance-dependent
1D MEI is insensitive to the number of atoms in the plaquette in contrast to the linear dependence
associated with the 2D MEI.
