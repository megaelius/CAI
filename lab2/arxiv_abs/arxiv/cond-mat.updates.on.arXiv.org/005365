Elasticity tetrads are the relevant low-energy fields for the complete topological response of
topological insulators with crystalline symmetries. In the presence of non-trivial conserved
lattice charges, these tetrads comprise three elastic $U(1)$ gauge fields ${\bf E}^{\ a}_i$, which
together with the electromagnetic $U(1)$ gauge field $A_\mu$ enter mixed topological Chern-Simons-like
terms in the action. The associated momentum space invariants form dual pairs along specific lattice
directions with the sum of (co)dimensions equal to the total (reciprocal) space. In three dimensions,
these pairs are, respectively, associated with the lattice volume and points, lines and surfaces.
While the first pair is related to charge conservation and bulk theta term, here we focus on the latter
response pair of such insulators, having the crystalline intrinsic quantum Hall effect and topological
polarization, given respectively as $\int E^{a}\wedge A \wedge dA$ and $\epsilon_{abc}\int E^{b}\wedge
E^{c} \wedge dA$, along lattice directions $a=1,2,3$. The response of the current and polarization
to deformations is, correspondingly, quantized in terms of integer topological quantum numbers,
$N_a$ and $N^a$ which are dual integrals in reciprocal space. For a simple Hamiltonian, the insulators
of the second class have flat bands on their boundaries. These protected modes are connected to the
bulk polarization in the topological insulators of this class. The boundary flat bands are extended
to the whole surface Brillouin zone and thereby have the largest possible density of states available.
Amongst other things, this suggests that the crystalline topological insulators with response
in the second class can have exceptionally high critical temperature to superconductivity, competing
for the race towards room-temperature superconductivity.
