The phenomenon whereby atoms deal with the positive or negative charge by losing or gaining the electron
forms the basis of familiar processes. In the elements where atoms comprise unfilled states, they
are eligible to execute electron dynamics indicating that they do not ionize. At suitable level
of ground surface, atoms of solid and gas both deal with transitional behaviors as per engaged force
under involved energy. Transitional behaviors of such atoms are based on infinitesimal displacements
of electrons. So, electrons remain clamped within their energy knots. In inert gas atoms, a different
mechanism is involved. Under the excessive population of photons, inert behavior atoms split distorting
into the electron (streams). As a result, progressing photons of forcing energy leave distorting
inter-state electron gaps of splitting atoms entering the air medium. Hence, characteristics
of photons under lowered forcing energy become obvious to reveal the glow of light known as plasma.
On splitting inert gas atoms, their electrons carry forcing energy of chasing photons. When forced
energy electrons impinge on underneath elongated atoms of solid at suitable inclination, they
elongate them further. When carrying forced energy electrons do not impinge at suitable inclination,
instead of elongating those atoms further, impinging electrons deform them by enabling non-orientationally
based stretching of energy knots. The splitting of inert gas atoms into electrons, carrying of photons
by electrons to impinge and the phenomenon of light glow reveal that photonic current is a source
of power rather than electric current. As per set feature, a microscopic analysis is due to the resolving
power of working photons. So, a photonic current is due to photonic propagation, where a consistent
inter-state electron gap of structure is...
