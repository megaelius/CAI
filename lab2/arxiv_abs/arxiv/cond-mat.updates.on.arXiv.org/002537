Directed, long-range and self-propelled transport of droplets on solid surfaces, especially
on water repellent surfaces, is crucial for many applications from water harvesting to bio-analytical
devices. One appealing strategy to achieve the preferential transport is to passively control
the surface wetting gradients, topological or chemical, to break the asymmetric contact line and
overcome the resistance force. Despite extensive progress, the directional droplet transport
is limited to small transport velocity and short transport distance due to the fundamental trade-off:
rapid transport of droplet demands a large wetting gradient, whereas long-range transport necessitates
a relatively small wetting gradient. Here, we report a radically new strategy that resolves the
bottleneck through the creation of an unexplored gradient in surface charge density (SCD). By leveraging
on a facile droplet printing on superamphiphobic surfaces as well as the fundamental understanding
of the mechanisms underpinning the creation of the preferential SCD, we demonstrate the self-propulsion
of droplets with a record-high velocity over an ultra-long distance without the need for additional
energy input. Such a Leidenfrost-like droplet transport, manifested at ambient condition, is
also genetic, which can occur on a variety of substrates such as flexible and vertically placed surfaces.
Moreover, distinct from conventional physical and chemical gradients, the new dimension of gradient
in SCD can be programmed in a rewritable fashion. We envision that our work enriches and extends our
capability in the manipulation of droplet transport and would find numerous potential applications
otherwise impossible.
