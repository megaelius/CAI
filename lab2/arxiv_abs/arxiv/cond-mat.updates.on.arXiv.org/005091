Power spectral densities are a common, convenient, and powerful way to analyze signals. So much
so that they are now broadly deployed across the sciences and engineering---from quantum physics
to cosmology, and from crystallography to neuroscience to speech recognition. The features they
reveal not only identify prominent signal-frequencies but also hint at mechanisms that generate
correlation and lead to resonance. Despite their near-centuries-long run of successes in signal
analysis, here we show that flat power spectra can be generated by highly complex processes, effectively
hiding all inherent structure in complex signals. Historically, this circumstance has been widely
misinterpreted, being taken as the renowned signature of "structureless" white noise---the benchmark
of randomness. We argue, in contrast, to the extent that most real-world complex systems exhibit
correlations beyond pairwise statistics their structures evade power spectra and other pairwise
statistical measures. As concrete physical examples, we demonstrate that fraudulent white noise
hides the predictable structure of both entangled quantum systems and chaotic crystals. To make
these words of warning operational, we present constructive results that explore how this situation
comes about and the high toll it takes in understanding complex mechanisms. First, we give the closed-form
solution for the power spectrum of a very broad class of structurally-complex signal generators.
Second, we demonstrate the close relationship between eigen-spectra of evolution operators and
power spectra. Third, we characterize the minimal generative structure implied by any power spectrum.
Fourth, we show how to construct arbitrarily complex processes with flat power spectra. Finally,
leveraging this diagnosis of the problem, we point the way to developing more incisive tools for
discovering structure in complex signals.
