The force distribution of jammed disordered packings has always been considered a central object
in the physics of granular materials. However, many of its features are poorly understood. In particular,
analytic relations to other key macroscopic properties of jammed matter, such as the contact network
and its coordination number, are still lacking. Here we develop a mean-field theory for this problem,
based on the consideration of the contact network as a random graph where the force transmission
becomes a constraint optimization problem. We can thus use the cavity method developed in the last
decades within the statistical physics of spin glasses and hard computer science problems. This
method allows us to compute the force distribution $\text P(f)$ for random packings of hard particles
of any shape, with or without friction. We find a new signature of jamming in the small force behavior
$\text P(f) \sim f^{\theta}$, whose exponent has attracted recent active interest: we find a finite
value for $\text P(f=0)$, along with $\theta=0$. Furthermore, we relate the force distribution
to a lower bound of the average coordination number $\, {\bar z}_{\rm c}^{\rm min}(\mu)$ of jammed
packings of frictional spheres with coefficient $\mu$. This bridges the gap between the two known
isostatic limits $\, {\bar z}_{\rm c}(\mu=0)=2D$ (in dimension $D$) and $\, {\bar z}_{\rm c}(\mu
\to \infty)=D+1$ by extending the naive Maxwell's counting argument to frictional spheres. The
theoretical framework describes different types of systems, such as non-spherical objects in
arbitrary dimensions, providing a common mean-field scenario to investigate force transmission,
contact networks and coordination numbers of jammed disordered packings.
