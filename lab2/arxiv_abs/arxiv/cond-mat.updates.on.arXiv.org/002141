The axion insulator (AXI) has long been recognized as the simplest example of a 3D magnetic topological
insulator (TI). The most familiar AXI results from magnetically gapping the surface states of a
3D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ TI while preserving the bulk gap. Like the 3D TI, it exhibits a quantized magnetoelectric
polarizability of $\theta=\pi$, and can be diagnosed from bulk symmetry eigenvalues when inversion
symmetric. However, whereas a 3D TI is characterized by bulk Wilson loop winding, 2D surface states,
and the pumping of the 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ TI index, we show that an AXI with a large number of bulk
bands displays no Wilson loop winding, exhibits chiral hinge states, and does not pump any previously
identified quantity. Crucially, as the AXI exhibits the topological angle $\theta=\pi$, its occupied
bands cannot be formed into maximally localized symmetric Wannier functions, despite its absence
of Wilson loop winding. In this letter, we revisit the AXI from the perspective of the recently introduced
notion of "fragile" topology, and discover that it in fact can be generically expressed as the cyclic
pumping of a "trivialized" fragile phase: a 2D inversion-symmetric insulator with no Wilson loop
winding which nevertheless carries a nontrivial topological index, the nested Berry phase $\gamma_{2}$.
We numerically show that the nontrivial value $\gamma_{2}=\pi$ indicates the presence of anomalous
0D corner charges in a 2D insulator, and therefore, that the chiral pumping of $\gamma_{2}$ in a 3D
AXI corresponds to the presence of chiral hinge states. We also briefly generalize our results to
time-reversal-symmetric higher-order TIs, and discuss the related appearance of nontrivial
$\gamma_{2}$ protected by $C_{2}\times\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in twisted bilayer graphene, and
its implications for the presence of 0D corner states.
