In this paper, we apply machine learning methods to study phase transitions in certain statistical
mechanical models, whose transitions involve non-local or topological properties,including
site and bond percolations, the XY model and the generalized XY model.We find that using just one-hidden-layer
in a fully-connected neural network, the percolation transition can be learned and the data-collapse
by using the average output layer gives correct estimate of the critical exponent $\nu$. We also
study the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, which involves binding and unbinding
of topological defects---vortices and anti-vortices, in the classical XY model. As pointed out
by M. Beach, A. Golubeva and R. Melko [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 97}, 045207 (2018)], using spin orientations
(i.e. angles) rather than vortex configuration gives better results in learning the transition,
we thus try alternatively the spin components as the input information in a convolutional neural
network and verify that this indeed works for learning the transition in the XY model on both the square
and honeycomb lattices. To go beyond the XY model, we apply also the machine learning methods to the
generalized XY model, which consists of a nematic phase, in addition to the paramagnetic and the
quasi-long-range ferromagnetic phase. We find that the use of spin configurations (either angles
or spin components) works and, additionally, using the histograms of the spin orientations also
works for both the XY model and the generalized XY model in learning the transition. We use such a feature
engineering approach to train the network to learn the three phases in the generalized XY model.
We obtain a consistent phase diagram from the network trained with only data along the temperature
axis at two particular parameter values, i.e. $\Delta=0$ and $\Delta=1$.
