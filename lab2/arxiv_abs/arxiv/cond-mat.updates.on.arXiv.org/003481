The emergence of flat electronic bands and of the recently discovered strongly correlated and superconducting
phases in twisted bilayer graphene crucially depends on the interlayer twist angle upon approaching
the magic angle $\theta_M \approx 1.1\deg$. Although advanced fabrication methods allow alignment
of graphene layers with global twist angle control of about 0.1$\deg$, little information is currently
available on the distribution of the local twist angles in actual magic angle twisted bilayer graphene
(MATBG) transport devices. Here we map the local $\theta$ variations in hBN encapsulated devices
with relative precision better than 0.002$\deg$ and spatial resolution of a few moir$\'e$ periods.
Utilizing a scanning nanoSQUID-on-tip, we attain tomographic imaging of the Landau levels in the
quantum Hall state in MATBG, which provides a highly sensitive probe of the charge disorder and of
the local band structure determined by the local $\theta$. We find that even state-of-the-art devices,
exhibiting high-quality global MATBG features including superconductivity, display significant
variations in the local $\theta$ with a span close to 0.1$\deg$. Devices may even have substantial
areas where no local MATBG behavior is detected, yet still display global MATBG characteristics
in transport, highlighting the importance of percolation physics. The derived $\theta$ maps reveal
substantial gradients and a network of jumps. We show that the twist angle gradients generate large
unscreened electric fields that drastically change the quantum Hall state by forming edge states
in the bulk of the sample, and may also significantly affect the phase diagram of correlated and superconducting
states. The findings call for exploration of band structure engineering utilizing twist-angle
gradients and gate-tunable built-in planar electric fields for novel correlated phenomena and
applications.
