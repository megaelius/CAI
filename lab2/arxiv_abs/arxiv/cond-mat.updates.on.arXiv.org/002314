Molecular adsorption on surfaces plays a central role in catalysis, corrosion, desalination,
and many other processes of relevance to industry and the natural world. Few adsorption systems
are more ubiquitous or of more widespread importance than those involving water and carbon, and
for a molecular level understanding of such interfaces water monomer adsorption on graphene is
a fundamental and representative system. This system is particularly interesting as it calls for
an accurate treatment of electron correlation effects, as well as posing a practical challenge
to experiments. Here, we employ many-body electronic structure methodologies that can be rigorously
converged and thus provide faithful references for the molecule-surface interaction. In particular,
we use diffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC), coupled cluster (CCSD(T)), as well as the random phase approximation
(RPA) to calculate the strength of the interaction between water and an extended graphene surface.
We establish excellent, sub-chemical, agreement between the complementary high-level methodologies,
and an adsorption energy estimate in the most stable configuration of approximately -100\,meV
is obtained. We also find that the adsorption energy is rather insensitive to the orientation of
the water molecule on the surface, despite different binding motifs involving qualitatively different
interfacial charge reorganisation. In producing the first demonstrably accurate adsorption
energies for water on graphene this work also resolves discrepancies amongst previously reported
values for this widely studied system. It also paves the way for more accurate and reliable studies
of liquid water at carbon interfaces with cheaper computational methods, such as density functional
theory and classical potentials.
