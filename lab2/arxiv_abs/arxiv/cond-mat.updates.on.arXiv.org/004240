Artificial Spin Ice (ASI), consisting of a two dimensional array of nanoscale magnetic elements,
provides a fascinating opportunity to observe the physics of out of equilibrium systems. Initial
studies concentrated on the static, frozen state, whilst more recent studies have accessed the
out-of-equilibrium dynamic, fluctuating state. This opens up exciting possibilities such as
the observation of systems exploring their energy landscape through monopole quasiparticle creation,
potentially leading to ASI magnetricity, and to directly observe unconventional phase transitions.
In this work we have measured and analysed the magnetic relaxation of thermally active ASI systems
by means of SQUID magnetometry. We have investigated the effect of the interaction strength on the
magnetization dynamics at different temperatures in the range where the nanomagnets are thermally
active and have observed that they follow an Arrhenius-type N\'eel-Brown behaviour. An unexpected
negative correlation of the average blocking temperature with the interaction strength is also
observed, which is supported by Monte Carlo simulations. The magnetization relaxation measurements
show faster relaxation for more strongly coupled nanoelements with similar dimensions. The analysis
of the stretching exponents obtained from the measurements suggest 1-D chain-like magnetization
dynamics. This indicates that the nature of the interactions between nanoelements lowers the dimensionality
of the ASI from 2-D to 1-D. Finally, we present a way to quantify the effective interaction energy
of a square ASI system, and compare it to the interaction energy calculated from a simple dipole model
and also to the magnetostatic energy computed with micromagnetic simulations.
