Materials with ring-shaped electronic bands are promising thermoelectric candidates, since
their unusual dispersion shape is predicted to give large power factors. While previous calculations
of these materials have relied on the assumption of a constant mean-free-path or relaxation time,
recent first-principles modeling of electron-phonon scattering suggests that the scattering
rates may be better approximated by the electron density-of-states (so-called DOS scattering
model). In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate single and double quintuple-layer
Bi$_2$Te$_3$, Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, with a focus on understanding how the three aforementioned
scattering approximations impact thermoelectric performance -- emphasis is placed on the DOS
scattering model. The single quintuple-layer materials possess two ring-shaped valence band
maxima that provide an abrupt increase in conducting channels, which benefits the power factor.
Additionally, below the band edge a ring-shaped minimum, located between the two maxima, is found
to further enhance the thermoelectric performance but only with the DOS scattering model. This
comes from a sharp drop in the DOS, and thus scattering, just below the ring-shaped minimum. An analytic
octic dispersion model is introduced and shown to qualitatively capture the observed features.
The double quintuple-layer materials display notably worse thermoelectric properties, since
their dispersions are significantly modified compared to the single quintuple-layer case. The
benefits of ring-shaped bands are sensitive to the alignment of the two ring maxima and to the degree
of ring anisotropy. Overall, single quintuple-layer Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ are most promising,
with the DOS scattering model giving the highest power factors.
