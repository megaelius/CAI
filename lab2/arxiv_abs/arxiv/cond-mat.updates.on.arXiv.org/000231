The review begins with a consideration of 3 forms of quantum information entropy associated with
Shannon and Jaynes. For model two-electron spin compensated systems, some analytic progress is
first reported. The Jaynes entropy is clearly related to correlation kinetic energy. A way of testing
the usefulness of a known uncertainty principle inequality is proposed for a whole class of model
two-electron atoms with harmonic confinement but variable electron-electron interaction. Emerging
properties are then studied by reference to bcc Na at ambient pressure and its modeling by `jellium'.
Jellium itself has collective behaviour with changes of the density, especially noteworthy being
the discontinuity of the momentum distribution at the Fermi surface. This has almost reduced to
zero at $r_s = 100$ a.u., the neighbourhood in which the quantal Wigner electron solid transition
is known to occur. However, various workers have studied crystalline Na under pressure and their
results are compared and contrasted. Work by DFT on K, Rb, and Cs is discussed, but now with reduced
density from the ambient pressure value. The crystalline results for the cohesive energy of these
metals as a function of lattice parameters and local coordination number are shown to be closely
reproduced by means of ground and excited states for dimer potential energy curves. Then, pair potentials
for liquid Na and Be are reviewed, and compared with the results of computer simulations from the
experimental structure factor for Na. Finally, magnetic field effects are discussed. First a phenomenological
model of the metal-to-insulator transition is presented with an order parameter which is the discontinuity
in the Fermi momentum distribution. Lastly, experiments on a two-dimensional electron assembly
in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction in a perpendicular magnetic field are briefly reviewed and then
interpreted.
