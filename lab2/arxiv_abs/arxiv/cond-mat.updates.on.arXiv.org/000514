The combination of density functional theory and single-site dynamical mean-field theory, using
both Hartree and full continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solvers, is used to study the
metal-insulator phase diagram of perovskite transition-metal oxides of the form $AB$O$_3$ with
a rare-earth ion $A$=Sr, La, Y and transition metal $B$=Ti, V, Cr. The correlated subspace is constructed
from atomiclike $d$ orbitals defined using maximally localized Wannier functions derived from
the full $p$-$d$ manifold; for comparison, results obtained using a projector method are also given.
Paramagnetic DFT+DMFT computations using full charge self-consistency along with the standard
"fully localized limit" (FLL) double counting are shown to incorrectly predict that LaTiO$_3$,
YTiO$_3$, LaVO$_3$ and SrMnO$_3$ are metals. A more general examination of the dependence of physical
properties on the mean $p$-$d$ energy splitting, the occupancy of the correlated $d$ states, the
double-counting correction, and the lattice structure demonstrates the importance of charge-transfer
physics even in the early transition-metal oxides and elucidates the factors underlying the failure
of the standard approximations. If the double counting is chosen to produce a $p$-$d$ splitting
consistent with experimental spectra, single-site dynamical mean-field theory provides a reasonable
account of the materials properties. The relation of the results to those obtained from "$d$-only"
models in which the correlation problem is based on the frontier orbital $p$-$d$ antibonding bands
is determined. It is found that if an effective interaction $U$ is properly chosen the $d$-only model
provides a good account of the physics of the $d^1$ and $d^2$ materials.
