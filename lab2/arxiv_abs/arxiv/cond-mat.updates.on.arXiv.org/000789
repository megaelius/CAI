We investigate effective two- and three-body interactions between non-active colloidal inclusions
in an active bath of chiral or non-chiral self-propelled particles. We use Brownian Dynamics simulations
within a standard model of nearly hard, disk-shaped inclusions and active particles in two spatial
dimensions. We first revisit the problem of effective two-body forces between inclusions in a non-chiral
active bath and show that the ensuing repulsive force profiles exhibit finer details than previously
reported, including a primary maximum and a secondary hump (or plateau-like region) at larger separations
between the inclusions. We then show that these features result directly from the formation of circular
layers (or 'rings') of active particles around the inclusions. These rings extend to radial distances
of a few particle radii from the inclusion surface, giving the hard-core inclusions a soft repulsive
'shoulder'. The sequential overlaps of these rings are established as the root cause for the non-monotonic
behavior of the effective force profiles as the inclusions are brought to small separations. The
thick soft shoulders around the inclusions can also exhibit multiple overlaps and potentially
large (non-pairwise) many-body interactions, for which we provide direct evidence by showing
that significant three-body forces emerge in both non-chiral and chiral active baths. The resulting
three-body forces can even exceed the two-body forces in magnitude, displaying also distinct repulsive
and attractive regimes at intermediate to large self-propulsion strengths. We show that particle
chirality gives rise to significant particle depletion from the vicinity of the inclusions (with
depletion zone thicknesses comparable to the inclusion size or several active-particle radii)
and, hence, to a relatively long-range, active, chirality-induced, depletion-type attraction
between the inclusions.
