Strong correlations, multiple lattice degrees of freedom, and the ease of doping make complex oxides
a source of great research interest. Complex oxide heterointerfaces break inversion symmetry
and can host a two dimensional carrier gas, which can display a variety of coexisting and competing
phenomena. In the case of heterointerfaces based on SrTiO$_3$, many of these phenomena can be effectively
tuned by using an electric gate, due to the large dielectric constant of SrTiO$_3$. Most studies
so far have focused on (001) oriented heterostructures; however, (111) oriented heterostructures
have recently gained attention due to the possibility of finding exotic physics in these systems
due their hexagonal surface crystal symmetry. In this work, we use magnetoresistance to study the
evolution of spin-orbit interaction and magnetism in a new system, (111) oriented (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)/SrTiO$_3$.
At more positive values of the gate voltage, which correspond to high carrier densities, we find
that transport is multiband, and dominated by high mobility carriers with a tendency towards weak
localization. At more negative gate voltages, the carrier density is reduced, the high mobility
bands are depopulated, and weak antilocalization effects begin to dominate, indicating that spin-orbit
interaction becomes stronger. At millikelvin temperatures, and gate voltages corresponding
to the strong spin-orbit regime, we observe hysteresis in magnetoresistance, indicative of ferromagnetism
in the system. Our results suggest that in the (111) (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)/SrTiO$_3$
system, low mobility carriers which experience strong spin-orbit interactions participate in
creating magnetic order in the system.
