Superconductivity is caused by the interaction between electrons by the exchange of collective
bosonic excitations, however, this bosonic glue forming electron pairs is manifested itself by
the coupling strength of the electrons to collective bosonic excitations. Here the doping and momentum
dependence of the coupling strength of the electrons to spin excitations in cuprate superconductors
is studied within the framework of the kinetic-energy-driven superconducting mechanism. The
normal self-energy in the particle-hole channel and pairing self-energy in the particle-pariticle
channel generated by the interaction between electrons by the exchange of spin excitation are employed
to extract the coupling strengths of the electrons to spin excitations in the particle-hole and
particle-particle channels, respectively. It is shown that below the superconducting transition
temperature, both the coupling strengths in the particle-hole and particle-particle channels
around the antinodes consist of two peaks, with a sharp low-energy peak located at around 5 meV in
the optimally doped regime, and a broad band with a weak peak centered at around 40 meV. In particular,
this two-peak structure in the coupling strength in the particle-hole channel can persist into
the normal-state, while as a consequence of the d-wave type symmetry of the superconducting gap,
the coupling strength in the particle-particle channel vanishes at the nodes. However, the positions
of the peaks in the coupling strengths in the underdoped regime shift towards to higher energies
with the increase of doping. More specifically, although the positions of the peaks in the coupling
strengths move to lower energies from the antinode to the hot spot on the electron Fermi surface,
the weights of the peaks decrease smoothly with the move of the momentum from the antinode to the hot
spot, and fade away at the hot spots.
