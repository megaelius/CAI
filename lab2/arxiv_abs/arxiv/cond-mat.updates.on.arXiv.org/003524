We investigate configuration dynamics of a flexible polymer chain in a bath of active particles
with dynamic chirality, i.e., particles rotate with a deterministic angular velocity $\omega$
besides self-propulsion,by Langevin dynamics simulations in two dimensional space. Particular
attentions are paid to how the gyration radius $R_{g}$ changes with the propulsion velocity $v_{0}$,angular
velocity $\omega$ and chain length. We find that in a chiral bath with a typical nonzero $\omega$,
the chain first collapses into a small compact cluster and swells again with increasing $v_{0}$,
in quite contrast to the case for a normal achiral bath $(\omega=0)$ wherein a flexible chain swells
with increasing $v_{0}$. More interestingly, the polymer can even form a closed ring if the chain
length is large enough,which may oscillate with the cluster if $v_{0}$ is large. Consequently,
the gyration radius $R_{g}$ shows nontrivial non-monotonic dependences on $v_{0}$, i.e., it undergoes
a minimum for relatively short chains, and two minima with a maximum in between for longer chains.
Our analysis shows that such interesting phenomena are mainly due to the competition between two
roles played by the chiral active bath: while the persistence motion due to particle activity tends
to stretch the chain, the circular motion of the particle may lead to an effective osmotic pressure
that tends to collapse the chain. In addition, the size of the circular motion $R_{0}=v_{0}/\omega$
shows an important role in that the compact clusters and closed-rings are both observed at nearly
the same values of $R_{0}$ for different $\omega$.
