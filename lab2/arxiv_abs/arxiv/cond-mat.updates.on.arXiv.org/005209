Two-dimensional (2D) post-transition metal chalcogenides (PTMC) have attracted attention due
to their suitable band gaps and lower exciton binding energies, making them more appropriate for
electronic, optical and water-splitting devices than graphene and monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs). Of the predicted 2D PTMCs, GaSe has been reliably synthesized and experimentally
characterized. Despite this fact, quantities such as lattice parameters and band character vary
significantly depending on which density functional theory (DFT) functional is used. Although
many-body perturbation theory (GW approximation) has been used to correct the electronic structure
and obtain the excited state properties of 2D GaSe, and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE)
has been used to find the optical gap, we find that the results depend strongly on the starting wavefunction.
In attempt to correct these discrepancies, we employed the many-body Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
method to calculate the ground and excited state properties of GaSe because DMC has a weaker dependence
on the trial wavefunction. We benchmark these results with available experimental data, DFT (PBE,
SCAN, HSE06) and GW-BSE (using PBE and SCAN wavefunctions) results. Our findings confirm monolayer
GaSe is an indirect gap semiconductor (Gamma-M) with a quasiparticle electronic gap in close agreement
with experiment and low exciton binding energy. We also benchmark the optimal lattice parameter,
cohesive energy and ground state charge density with DMC and various DFT methods. We aim to present
a terminal theoretical benchmark for pristine monolayer GaSe, which will aide in the further study
of 2D PTMCs using DMC methods.
