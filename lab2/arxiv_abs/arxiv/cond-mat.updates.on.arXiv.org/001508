Regulation of material softness has both theoretical and practical significances due to irreplaceable
applications of soft matter in rather diverse areas. This article is dedicated to draft a theoretical
category on interpreting the mechanisms lying behind all soft matters, which can be termed as Softening
Theory. A technical strategy with generalized purpose was proposed for softening desired matter,
i.e. the melting point of matter can be significantly reduced through tuning its interior boundaries
in atomic level. This theory accords well with the classical nuclear droplet model that treats the
nucleus as a droplet which had successfully explained many phenomena. It also explained the experimental
fact that, the material's melting point is drastically reduced as the particles become smaller
enough, in which situations effects of the atomic borders become much weaker. Along this direction,
many phenomena existing in nature can be well understood. For example, if keeping in mind the fact
that an atom consisting of nucleus and electronics can be regarded as fluid, all the matter consisted
of atoms should maintain fluidic state in their macroscopic scale, according to the consistency
between macro and micro worlds. However, many substances just cannot remain their original atomic
fluidic behavior due to breaking of the consistency between macro and micro states. Based on the
current softening theory, it is now easy to understand that the breaking of such consistency is just
caused due to generated forces from the atomic interactions. To resolve such intrinsic confinement,
a group of potential technical approaches can be developed to tune the atomic borders of the matter
and thus make desired soft materials. This work provides a theoretical foundation to partially
address the nature of the material which will aid to make future soft matters in the coming time.
