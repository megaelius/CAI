Photocatalytic reactions on TiO2 have recently gained an enormous resurgence because of various
new strategies and findings that promise to drastically increase efficiency and specificity of
such reactions by modifications of the titania scaffold and chemistry. In view of geometry, in particular,
anodic TiO2 nanotubes have attracted wide interest, as they allow a high degree of control over the
separation of photogenerated charge carriers not only in photocatalytic reactions but also in
photoelectrochemical reactions. A key advantage of ordered nanotube arrays is that nanotube modifications
can be embedded site specifically into the tube wall; that is, cocatalysts, doping species, or junctions
can be placed at highly defined desired locations (or with a desired regular geometry or pattern)
along the tube wall. This allows an unprecedented level of engineering of energetics of reaction
sites for catalytic and photocatalytic reactions, which target not only higher efficiencies but
also the selectivity of reactions. Many recent tube alterations are of a morphologic nature (mesoporous
structures, designed faceted crystallites, hybrids, or 1D structures), but a number of color-coded
(namely, black, blue, red, green, gray) modifications have attracted wide interest because of
the extension of the light absorption spectrum of titania in the visible range and because unique
catalytic activity can be induced. The present Perspective gives an overview of TiO2 nanotubes
in photocatalysis with an emphasis on the most recent advances in the use of nanotube arrays and discusses
the underlying concepts in tailoring their photocatalytic reactivity.
