Alloying is widely used as a means to fine-tune the properties of thermoelectric materials by reducing
the lattice thermal conductivity. However, the effects of compositional variation on the lattice
dynamics of alloy systems are not well understood, due in part to the difficulty of building realistic
first-principles models of structurally-complex solid solutions. This work builds on our previous
study of Sn$_{n}$(S$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$)$_{m}$ solid solutions [Gunn $\textit{et al.}$, $\textit{Chem.
Mater.}$ $\textbf{31}$, $\textit{10}$, 3672, $\textbf{2019}$] to explore the lattice dynamics
of the $\textit{Pnma}$ Sn(S$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$) system, which has been widely studied for potential
thermoelectric applications. We find that the vibrational internal energy and entropy have a large
quantitative impact on the mixing free energy and are likely to be particularly important in alloy
systems with competing phases. The thermodynamically-averaged phonon dispersions and density
of states curves show that alloying preserves the structure of the low-frequency bands of modes
associated with the Sn sublattice but broadens the high-frequency chalcogen bands into a near-continuous
spectrum at the 50/50 mixed composition. This results in a general reduction in the phonon mode group
velocities and an increase in the number of energy-conserving scattering channels for heat-carrying
low-frequency modes, which is consistent with the decrease in thermal conductivity observed in
experimental measurements. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of our first-principles
modelling approach and propose methods to address these in future studies.
