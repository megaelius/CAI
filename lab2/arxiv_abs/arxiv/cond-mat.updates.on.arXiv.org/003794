Entanglement generation at a macroscopic scale offers an exciting avenue to develop new quantum
technologies and study fundamental physics on a tabletop. Cavity quantum optomechanics provides
an ideal platform to generate and exploit such phenomena owing to the precision of quantum optics
combined with recent experimental advances in optomechanical devices. In this work, we propose
schemes operating outside the resolved-sideband regime, to prepare and verify both optical-mechanical
and mechanical-mechanical entanglement. Our schemes employ pulsed interactions with a duration
much less than the mechanical period and, together with homodyne measurements, can both generate
and characterize these types of entanglement. To improve the performance of our schemes, a precooling
stage comprising prior pulses can be utilized to increase the amount of entanglement prepared,
and local optical squeezers may be used to provide resilience against open-system dynamics. The
entanglement generated by our schemes is quantified using the logarithmic negativity and is analysed
with respect to the strength of the pulsed optomechanical interactions for realistic experimental
scenarios including mechanical decoherence and optical loss. Two separate schemes for mechanical
entanglement generation are introduced and compared: one scheme based on an optical interferometric
design, and the other comprising sequential optomechanical interactions. The pulsed nature of
our protocols provides more direct access to these quantum correlations in the time domain, with
applications including quantum metrology and tests of quantum decoherence. By considering a parameter
set based on recent experiments, the feasibility to generate significant entanglement with our
schemes, even with large optical losses, is demonstrated.
