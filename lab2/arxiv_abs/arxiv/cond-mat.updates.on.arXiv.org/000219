We report the anomalous Dyakonov-Perel' spin relaxation in ultracold spin-orbit coupled $^{40}$K
gas when the coupling between $|9/2,9/2\ >$ and $|9/2,7/2\ >$ states (atcing as the effective
Zeeman magnetic field) is much stronger than the spin-orbit coupled field. Both the transverse
and longitudinal spin relaxations are investigated with small and large spin polarizations. It
is found that with small spin polarization, the transverse (longitudinal) spin relaxation is divided
into four (two) regimes: the normal weak scattering regime, the anomalous Dyakonov-Perel'-like
regime, the anomalous Elliott-Yafet-like regime and the normal strong scattering regime (the
anomalous Elliott-Yafet-like regime and the normal strong scattering regime), with only the normal
weak scattering regime being in the weak scattering limit. This is very different from the conventional
situation under the weak magnetic field, which is divided into the weak and strong scattering regimes
according to the weak/strong scattering limit. With large spin polarization, we find that the Hartree-Fock
self-energy, which acts as an effective magnetic field, can markedly suppress the transverse spin
relaxation in both weak and strong scattering limits. Moreover, by noting that as both the momentum
relaxation time and the Hartree-Fock effective magnetic field vary with the scattering length
in cold atoms, the anomalous Dyakonov-Perel'-like regime is suppressed and the transverse spin
relaxation is hence divided into three regimes in the scattering length dependence: the normal
weak scattering regime, the anomalous Elliott-Yafet-like regime and the strong scattering regime.
On the other hand, the longitudinal spin relaxation is again divided into the anomalous EY-like
and normal strong scattering regimes. ...
