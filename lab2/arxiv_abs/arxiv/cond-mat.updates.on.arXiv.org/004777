A three terminal nanoscale refrigeration concept based on a vibron coupled quantum dot hybrid system
is proposed and analyzed in detail. In the regime of electrical driving, our investigation delves
into the non-trivial role of electron-phonon interactions on the refrigeration performance.
It is shown that, although such interactions are well known to be detrimental from a general refrigeration
perspective, surprisingly, they can be engineered to favorably improve the trade-off between
the cooling power and the coefficient of performance under practical operating conditions. Furthermore,
our investigation manifests that an additional improvement in the trade-off can be facilitated
by an electronic thermal bias along with the electron-phonon coupling. Next, we explore a number
of viable design strategies such as tuning the on-site Coulomb repulsion and optimizing the coupling
strength with the reservoirs to overcome the challenges posed by the electron-phonon interaction.
Crucially, it is demonstrated from the principle of heat balance that, in a multi-terminal geometry,
any change in the non-equilibrium phonon heat current at a fixed applied voltage, is counter-balanced
by the heat currents flowing through the other terminals. Elucidating the physics of coupled charge
and heat transport under non-equilibrium conditions, we demonstrate that a strong coupling with
the thermal bath and the cold contact results in a substantial improvement in the peak cooling power
and the coefficient of performance. Combining all these aspects, we believe that this study could
offer important guidelines and paves the way for a possible experimental realization of molecular
and quantum dot thermoelectric refrigeration.
