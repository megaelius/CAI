The tetragonal compound Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn with the $D_{2d}$ symmetry recently attracted attention
as the first known material that hosts magnetic antiskyrmions, which differ from the so far known
skyrmions by their internal structure. The latter have been found in a number of magnets with the
chiral crystal structure. In previous works, the existence of antiskyrmions in Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn
was unambiguously demonstrated in real space by means of Lorentz transmission electron microscopy
on thin-plate samples ($\sim$100~nm thick). In the present study, we used small-angle neutron
scattering and magnetic force microscopy to perform reciprocal- and real-space imaging of the
magnetic texture of bulk Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn single-crystals at different temperatures and in applied
magnetic field. We found that the magnetic texture in the bulk differs significantly from that of
thin-plate samples. Instead of spin helices or an antiskyrmion lattice, we observe an anisotropic
fractal magnetic pattern of closure domains in zero field above the spin-reorientation transition
temperature, which transforms into a set of bubble domains in high field. Below the spin-reorientation
transition temperature the strong in-plane anisotropy as well as the fractal self-affinity in
zero field is gradually lost, while the formation of bubble domains in high field remains robust.
The results of our study highlight the importance of dipole-dipole interactions in thin-plate
samples for the stabilization of antiskyrmions and identify criteria which should guide the search
for potential (anti)skyrmion host materials. Moreover, they provide consistent interpretations
of the previously reported magnetotransport anomalies of the bulk crystals.
