Two classes of topological superconductors and Majorana modes in condensed matter systems are
known to date: one, in which disorder induced by impurities strongly suppresses topological superconducting
gap and is detrimental to Majorana modes, and the other, where Majorana fermions are protected by
disorder-robust topological superconductor gap. In this work we predict a third class of topological
superconductivity and Majorana modes, in which topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions
appear exclusively in the presence of impurity disorder. Observation and control of Majorana fermions
and other non-Abelions often requires a symmetry of an underlying system leading to a gap in a single-particle
or quasiparticle spectra. Disorder introduces states into the gap and enables conductance and
proximity-induced superconductivity via the in-gap states. We show that disorder-enabled topological
superconductivity can be realized in a quantum Hall ferromagnet, when helical domain walls are
coupled to an s-wave superconductor. Solving a general quantum mechanical problem of disorder-induced
bound states in a system of spin-orbit coupled Landau levels, we demonstrate that disorder-induced
Majorana modes emerge at phase boundaries in a specific case of a quantum Hall ferromagnetic transition
in CdMnTe quantum wells at a filling factor $\nu=2$ . We show that electrostatic control of a quantum
Hall ferromagnet allows manipulation of Majorana modes. Similar physics can possibly emerge for
ferromagnetic transitions in the fractional quantum Hall regime leading to the formation of higher
order non-Abelian excitations.
