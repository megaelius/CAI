We present thermoelectric properties of Be$_2$C monolayer based on density functional theory
combined with semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. First principles calculations show
the material is direct band gap semiconductor with band gap of 2.0 eV obtained with Gaussian-attenuating
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (Gau-PBE) hybrid functionals. Kohn-Sham eigen-states obtained with
Gau-PBE are fed into Boltzmann transport equation which is solved under constant relaxation time
approximation resulting into thermoelectric (TE) coefficient in terms of the relaxation time
($\tau$). In this work, we have explicitly determined the relaxation time by studying the electron-phonon
interactions from first principles using Wannier functions to obtain the absolute TE coefficients
for the Be$_2$C monolayer along the armchair and zigzag directions. Our results show that the Be$_2$C
monolayer has high TE coefficients like Seebeck coefficient ($\alpha$) and electrical conductivity
($\sigma$) leading to high power factor ($\alpha^2\sigma$ $\sim$ 3.44 mW/mK$^2$) along the zigzag
direction with p-type doping which is of the similar order observed for the commercial TE materials
like doped-Bi$_2$Te$_3$ (J. Appl. Phys. 2003 (93) 368-374; J. Appl. Phys. 2008 (104) 053713-1-053713-5).
Further, third-order anharmonic theory yields the slightly high lattice thermal conductivity
($\sim$ 66 W/mK) at 300 K giving rise to moderate figure of merit (ZT $\sim$ 0.1) optimized with p-type
doping along the zigzag direction. Our results suggest that Be$_2$C monolayer is promising material
for thermoelectric applications as far as high power factor is concerned. Additionally, the dynamical
stability of the Be$_2$C monolayer up to 14 \% bi-axial strain shows that phonon tranport in the Be$_2$C
monolayer can be further improved through strain engineering.
