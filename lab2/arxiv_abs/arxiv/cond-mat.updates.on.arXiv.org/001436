Wrinkles are often observed on the surfaces of compressed soft materials in nature. In the past few
decades, the fascinating surface patterns have been studied extensively by using the linear bifurcation
analysis under plane strain. The bifurcation concerns the non-uniqueness solutions, however,
it delivers little information about the surface instability before and after the threshold. In
this paper, we study surface wrinkling of a finite elastic block of general elastic materials subject
to biaxial loading by an energy method. The first and second variations of the strain energy functional
are systematically studied, and an eigenvalue problem is proposed whether the second variation
is positive definite. We illustrate our analysis by using neo-Hookean materials as an example.
Accordingly, we show that the initially flat state has the lowest energy and is stable before the
stretches reach the threshold at which the surface wrinkling occurs. We also find that the threshold
is independent of the size of the block and coincides with that of the surface instability of an elastic
half-space studied by Biot (1963) with the linear bifurcation analysis. However, the stability
region cannot be obtained by using the linear stability analysis. In contrast to the size-independent
threshold, the wavelength of surface wrinkling depends on the size of the block. We first show that
a two-dimensional rather than a three-dimensional perturbation has lower energy and is more likely
to trigger the surface wrinkling in the instability region. The same stretch threshold of a finite
block and a half-space could shed light on the relation of surface instabilities between finite
and infinite bodies.
