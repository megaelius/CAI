Techniques to model the interior of planets are varied. We introduce a new approach to a century old
assumption which enhances not only planetary interior calculations but also solar models and high
pressure material physics. Our methodology uses the polytrope assumption which was used to model
main sequence and white dwarf stars by Eddington. A polytrope is a simple structural assumption
between a material's pressure and volume, $PV^n = C$, where $C$ is a constant and $n$ is the polytrope
index. We derive that the polytropic index is the derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure.
We then augment the theory by including a variable polytrope index which produces a high quality
universal equation of state, within the confines of the Lane-Emden differential equation, making
it a robust tool with the potential for excellent predictive power. Unlike most previous equations
of state, which have pressure as the dependent variable, the theoretical foundation of our equation
of state is the same elastic observable which we found equivalent to the polytrope index. We calculate
the density-pressure of six common materials up to $10^{18}$ Pa, mass-radius relationships for
the same materials, and produce plausible density-radius models for Mars, Jupiter, and Uranus.
An examination of the diversity exhibited by universal equations of state follows, specifically
how they functionally negotiate the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus. We analyze the potential
of our model using planet Earth, our best static laboratory, ascertaining the ability of our model
to include temperature. We end by constraining the material surface observables for the inner core,
outer core, and mantle of planet Earth.
