New emergent states of matter in quantum systems may be created under non-equilibrium conditions
if - through many body interactions - its constituents order on a timescale which is shorter than
the time required for the system to reach thermal equilibrium. Conventionally non-equilibrium
ordering is discussed in terms of symmetry breaking, nonthermal order-disorder, and more recently
quenched topological transitions. Here we report a fundamentally new and unusual metastable form
of amorphous correlation-localized fermionic matter, which is formed in a new type of quantum transition
at low temperature either by short pulse photoexcitation or by electrical charge injection in the
transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) reveals a pseudo-amorphous
packing of localized electrons within the crystal lattice that is significantly denser than its
hexagonally ordered low-temperature ground state, or any other ordered states of the system. Remarkably,
the arrangement is not random, but displays a hyperuniform spatial density distribution commonly
encountered in classical jammed systems, showing no signs of aggregation or phase separation.
Unexpectedly for a localized electron system, tunnelling spectroscopy and multi- STM-tip surface
resistance measurements reveal that the overall state is gapless and conducting, which implies
that localized and itinerant carriers are resonantly entangled. The amorphous localized electron
subsystem can be understood theoretically to arise from strong correlations between polarons
sparsely dispersed on a 2D hexagonal atomic lattice, while itinerant carriers act as a resonantly
coupled reservoir distinct in momentum space.
