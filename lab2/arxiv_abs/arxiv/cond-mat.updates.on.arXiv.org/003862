We present theoretical arguments, based on linear elasticity and thermodynamics, to show that
interfacial tangential stresses in sliding adhesive contacts does not affet at all the adhesive
behavior of the system, which then follows the classical JKR solution. Our finding explains the
experimental observation of Vorvolakos and Chaudhury in 2003 (Ref. <cite>Vorvolakos2003</cite>),
who found that the contact area of a PDMS sphere remains constant during sliding and is in agreement
with the JKR solution, at least up to velocity of 1mm/s, and of Carpick et al. in Ref. <cite>Carpick</cite>,
who observed that the friction force between a platinum-coated atomic force microscope (AFM) tip
and the surface of mica in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) varies with load in proportion to the contact area
predicted by the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR). We show that a reduction of the contact area, experimentlly
observed at higher sliding speeds, can be caused by a reduction of the density of adhesive bonds as
the velocity is increased, or caused by the repulsive energy term associated with the stress spatial
fluctuation at the interface. This may explain why adhesion is completely masked at relatively
large sliding velocities. This version of the paper follows the publication of the Corrigendum:
