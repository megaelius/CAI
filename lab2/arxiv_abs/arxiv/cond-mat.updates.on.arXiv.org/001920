In this review, we provide an introduction and overview to some more recent advances in real-time
dynamics of quantum impurity models and their realizations in quantum devices. We focus on the Ohmic
spin-boson and related models, which describes a single spin-1/2 coupled to an infinite collection
of harmonic oscillators. The topics are largely drawn from our efforts over the past years, but we
also present a few novel results. In the first part of this review, we begin with a pedagogical introduction
to the real-time dynamics of a dissipative spin at both high and low temperatures. We then focus on
the driven dynamics in the quantum regime beyond the limit of weak spin-bath coupling. In these situations,
the non-perturbative stochastic Schroedinger equation method is ideally suited to numerically
obtain the spin dynamics as it can incorporate bias fields $h_z(t)$ of arbitrary time-dependence
in the Hamiltonian. We present different recent applications of this method: (i) how topological
properties of the spin such as the Berry curvature and the Chern number can be measured dynamically,
and how dissipation affects the topology and the measurement protocol, (ii) how quantum spin chains
can experience synchronization dynamics via coupling to a common bath. In the second part of this
review, we discuss quantum engineering of spin-boson and related models in circuit quantum electrodynamics
(cQED), quantum electrical circuits and cold-atoms architectures. In different realizations,
the Ohmic environment can be represented by a long (microwave) transmission line, a Luttinger liquid,
a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, a chain of superconducting Josephson junctions.
We show that the quantum impurity can be used as a quantum sensor to detect properties of a bath at minimal
coupling, and how dissipative spin dynamics can lead to new insight in the Mott-Superfluid transition.
