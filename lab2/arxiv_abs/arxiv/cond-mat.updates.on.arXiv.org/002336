Controlling the anchoring of liquid crystal molecules at an interface with a water solution influences
the entire organization of the underlying liquid crystal phase, which is crucial for many applications.
The simplest way to stabilize such interfaces is by fabricating single emulsions of liquid crystal
in water; however, a greater sensitivity to interfacial effects can be achieved using double emulsions,
i.e. liquid crystal shells. Anchoring transitions on those systems are traditionally triggered
by the adsorption of surfactant molecules onto the interface, which is neither an instantaneous
nor a reversible process. In this study, we report the ability to change the anchoring of 5CB, one
of the most widely used liquid crystals, at the interface with dilute water solutions of PVA, a polymer
surfactant commonly used for stabilizing liquid crystal shells, simply by controlling the temperature
in the close vicinity of the liquid crystal clearing point. A quasi-static increase in temperature
triggers an instantaneous change in the film's boundary conditions from parallel to perpendicular,
owing to the disordering effect of PVA, prior to the phase transition of the bulk 5CB. We study this
anchoring transition on both flat suspended films and spherical shells of liquid crystals. Switching
anchoring entails a series of structural transformations involving the formation of transient
structures in which topological defects are stabilized. The type of defect structure depends on
the topology of the film. This method has the unique ability to influence both interfaces of the film
nearly at the same time, and can be applied to transform an initially polydisperse group of nematic
shells into a monodisperse population of bivalent shells.
