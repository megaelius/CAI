A density functional study is presented of the interstitial Zn$_i$, Ge$_i$, and N$_i$ in ZnGeN$_2$.
The Zn and Ge interstitials are both found to strongly prefer the larger octahedral site compared
to the two types of tetrahedral sites. The Zn interstitial is found to be a shallow double donor but
has higher energy than previously studied antisite defects. It has a resonance in the conduction
band which is Zn-$s$ like. The Ge interstitial is an even higher energy of formation defect and also
behaves as a shallow double donor but has a lower lying 3+/2+ transition level at about 0.1 eV above
the VBM. The lower level corresponds to a Ge-$s$ orbital character while the Ge-$p$ forms a resonance
in the conduction band. The nitrogen interstitial forms a split-interstitial configuration,
as also occurs in GaN. Its electronic levels can be related to that of a N$_2$ molecule. The defect
levels in the gap correspond to the $\pi_g$-like lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of
the molecule, which here becomes filled with 3 electrons in the defect's neutral charge state. The
corresponding transition levels are obtained and show that this is an amphoteric trap level occurringin
+1, 0 and $-1$ charge states. The two possible sites for this split interstitial, on top of Zn or on
top of Ge differ slightly in N$_2$ bond-length. While the N$_i$ defects have the lowest formation
energy among the interstitials, it is still higher than that of the antisites.Hence they are not
expected to occur in sufficient concentration to affect the intrinsic Fermi level position. In
particular, they do not contribute to the unintentional n-type background doping.
