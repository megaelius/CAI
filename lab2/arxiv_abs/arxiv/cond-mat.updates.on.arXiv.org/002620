Semiclassical quantization rules compactly describe the energy dispersion of Landau levels,
and are predictive of quantum oscillations in transport and thermodynamic quantities. Such rules
-- as formulated by Onsager, Lifshitz and Roth -- apply when the spin-orbit interaction dominates
over the Zeeman interaction (or vice versa), but does not generally apply when the two interactions
are comparable in strength. In this work, we present a generalized quantization rule which treats
the spin-orbit and Zeeman interactions on equal footing, and therefore has wider applicability
to spin-orbit-coupled materials lacking a spatial inversion center, or having magnetic order.
More generally, our rule describes the Landau quantization of any number of nearly degenerate energy
bands -- in any symmetry class. The resultant Landau-level spectrum is generically non-equidistant
but may contain spin (or pseudospin) degeneracies. To tune to such degeneracies in the absence of
crystalline point-group symmetries, three real parameters are needed. We have exhaustively identified
all symmetry classes of cyclotron orbits for which this number is reduced from three, thus establishing
symmetry-enforced 'non-crossing rules' for Landau levels. In particular, only one parameter
is needed in the presence of spatial rotation or inversion; this single parameter may be the magnitude
or orientation of the field. Signatures of single-parameter tunability include (i) a smooth crossover
between period-doubled and -undoubled quantum oscillations in the low-temperature Shubnikov-de
Haas effect, as well as (ii) 'magic-angle' magnetoresistance oscillations. We demonstrate the
utility of our quantization rule, as well as the tunability of Landau-level degeneracies, for the
Rashba-Dresselhaus two-dimensional electron gas -- subject to an arbitrarily oriented magnetic
field.
