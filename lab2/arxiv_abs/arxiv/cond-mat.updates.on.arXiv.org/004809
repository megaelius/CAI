Many questions are still open regarding the physical mechanisms behind the magnetic switching
in GdFeCo alloys by single optical pulses. Phenomenological models suggest a femtosecond scale
exchange relaxation between sublattice magnetization as the driving mechanism for switching.
The recent observation of thermally induced switching in GdFeCo by using both several picosecond
optical laser pulse as well as electric current pulses has questioned this previous understanding.
This has raised the question of whether or not the same switching mechanics are acting at the femo-
and picosecond scales. In this work, we aim at filling this gap in the understanding of the switching
mechanisms behind thermal single-pulse switching. To that end, we have studied experimentally
thermal single-pulse switching in GdFeCo alloys, for a wide range of system parameters, such as
composition, laser power and pulse duration. We provide a quantitative description of the switching
dynamics using atomistic spin dynamics methods with excellent agreement between the model and
our experiments across a wide range of parameters and timescales, ranging from femtoseconds to
picoseconds. Furthermore, we find distinct element-specific damping parameters as a key ingredient
for switching with long picosecond pulses and argue, that switching with pulse durations as long
as 15 picoseconds is possible due to a low damping constant of Gd. Our findings can be easily extended
to speed up dynamics in other contexts where ferrimagnetic GdFeCo alloys have been already demonstrated
to show fast and energy-efficient processes, e.g. domain-wall motion in a track and spin-orbit
torque switching in spintronics devices.
