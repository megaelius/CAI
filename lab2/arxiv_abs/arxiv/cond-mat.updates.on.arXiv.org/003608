The de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line is the phase boundary in the temperature--magnetic field plane
of an Ising spin glass at which a continuous (i.e. second-order) transition from a paramagnet to
a replica-symmetry-breaking (RSB) phase occurs, according to mean-field theory. Here, using
field-theoretic perturbative renormalization group methods on the Bray-Roberts reduced Landau-Ginzburg-type
theory for a short-range Ising spin glass in space of dimension $d$, we show that at nonzero magnetic
field the nature of the corresponding transition is modified as follows: a) for $d-6$ small and positive,
with increasing field on the AT line first, the ordered phase just below the transition becomes the
so-called one-step RSB, instead of the full RSB that occurs in mean-field theory; the transition
on the AT line remains continuous with a diverging correlation length. Then at a higher field, a tricritical
point separates the latter transition from a quasi-first-order one, that is one at which the correlation
length does not diverge, and there is a jump in part of the order parameter, but no latent heat. The
location of the tricritical point tends to zero as $d\to6^+$; b) for $d\leq 6$, we argue that the quasi-first-order
transition persists down to arbitrarily small nonzero fields, with a transition to full RSB still
expected at lower temperature. Whenever the quasi-first-order transition occurs, it is at a higher
temperature than the AT transition would be for the same field, preempting it as the temperature
is lowered. These results may explain the reported absence of a diverging correlation length in
the presence of a magnetic field in low-dimensional spin glasses in simulations and high-temperature
series expansions.
