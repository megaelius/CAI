Electron transmission through different gated and gapped graphene superlattices (GSLs) is studied.
Linear, Gaussian, Lorentzian and P\"oschl-Teller superlattice potential profiles have been
assessed. A relativistic description of electrons in graphene as well as the transfer matrix method
have been used to obtain the transmission properties. We find that is not possible to have perfect
or nearly perfect pass bands in gated GSLs. Regardless of the potential profile and the number of
barriers there are remanent oscillations in the transmission bands. On the contrary, nearly perfect
pass bands are obtained for gapped GSLs. The Gaussian profile is the best option when the number of
barriers is reduced, and there is practically no difference among the profiles for large number
of barriers. We also find that both gated and gapped GSLs can work as omnidirectional band-pass filters.
In the case of gated Gaussian GSLs the omnidirectional range goes from -$50^{\circ}$ to $50^{\circ}$
with an energy bandwidth of 55 meV, while for gapped Gaussian GSLs the range goes from -$80^{\circ}$
to $80^{\circ}$ with a bandwidth of 40 meV. Here, it is important that the energy range does not include
remanent oscillations. On the light of these results, the hole states inside the barriers of gated
GSLs are not beneficial for band-pass filtering. So, the flatness of the pass bands is determined
by the superlattice potential profile and the chiral nature of the charge carriers in graphene.
Moreover, the width and the number of electron pass bands can be modulated through the superlattice
structural parameters. We consider that our findings can be useful to design electron filters based
on non-conventional GSLs.
