In order to derive an expression for current-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (CIDMI)
we first consider its inverse, i.e., the current pumped by a time-dependent gradient of magnetization.
When magnetic textures vary as a function of time, electric currents are driven by various mechanisms,
which can be distinguished according to their different dependence on the time-derivative of magnetization,
$\partial M(r,t)/\partial t$, and on the spatial derivative $\partial M(r,t)/\partial r$: One
group of effects is proportional to $\partial M(r,t)/\partial t$, a second group of effects is proportional
to the product $\partial M(r,t)/\partial t \,\,\, \partial M(r,t)/\partial r$, and a third group
is proportional to the second derivative $\partial^2 M(r,t)/\partial r\partial t$. We show that
the response of the electric current to the time-dependent magnetization gradient $\partial^2
M(r,t)/\partial r\partial t$ contais the inverse of CIDMI. Not only currents but also torques can
be driven by time-dependent gradients of magnetization. The inverse effect consists in the modification
of DMI by magnetization dynamics, which we call dynamical DMI (DDMI). In noncollinear magnets CIDMI
and DDMI depend on the local magnetization direction. The resulting spatial gradients correspond
to torques that need to be included into the theories of Gilbert damping, gyromagnetism, and current-induced
torques (CITs) in order to satisfy the Onsager reciprocity relations. Additionally, we show that
CIDMI is related to the modification of orbital magnetism induced by magnetization dynamics, which
we call dynamical orbital magnetism (DOM), and that spatial gradients of DOM contribute to charge
pumping.
