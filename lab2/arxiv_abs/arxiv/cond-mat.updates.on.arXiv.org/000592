The existence of intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) luminescence is reported. It is shown that
the so called anomalous luminescence of Ce-doped elpasolite Cs2LiLuCl6, which is characterized
mainly by a very large Stokes shift and a very large band width, corresponds to an IVCT emission in
Ce3+-Ce4+ pairs, from the 5deg orbital of Ce3+ to 4f orbitals of Ce4+. Its Stokes shift is the sum of
the large reorganization energies of the Ce4+ and Ce3+ centers formed after the fixed-nuclei electron
transfer and it is equal to the energy of the IVCT absorption commonly found in mixed-valence compounds,
which is predicted to exist in this material and to be slightly larger than 10000 cm-1. The large band
width is the consequence of the large offset between the minima of the Ce3+-Ce4+ and Ce4+-Ce3+ pairs
along the electron transfer reaction coordinate. This offset is approximately 2*sqrt(3) times
the difference of Ce-Cl equilibrium distances in the Ce3+ and Ce4+ centers. It is shown that the energies
of the peaks and the widths of IVCT absorption and emission bands can be calculated ab initio with
reasonable accuracy from diabatic energy surfaces of the ground and excited states and that these
can be obtained, in turn, from independent calculations on the donor and acceptor active centers.
We obtained the energies of the Ce3+ and Ce4+ active centers of Ce-doped Cs2LiLuCl6 by means of state-of-the-art
wave-function-theory spin-orbit coupling relativistic calculations on the donor cluster (CeCl6Li6Cs8)11+
and the acceptor cluster (CeCl6Li6Cs8)12+ embedded in a quantum mechanical embedding potential
of the host. The calculations provide interpretations of unexplained experimental observations
as due to higher energy IVCT absorptions, and allow reinterpreting others. The existence of another
IVCT emission of lower energy, at around 14000-16000 cm-1 less than the 5dt2g emission, is also predicted.
