We study stochastic thermodynamics for a quantum system of interest whose dynamics are described
by a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map as a result of its interaction with a thermal
bath. We define CPTP maps with equilibrium as CPTP maps with an invariant state such that the entropy
production due to the action of the map on the invariant state vanishes. Thermal maps are a subgroup
of CPTP maps with equilibrium. In general, for CPTP maps, the thermodynamic quantities, such as
the entropy production or work performed on the system, depend on the combined state of the system
plus its environment. We show that these quantities can be written in terms of system properties
for maps with equilibrium. The relations that we obtain are valid for arbitrary coupling strengths
between the system and the thermal bath. The fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities are considered
in the framework of a two-point measurement scheme. We derive the entropy production fluctuation
theorem for general maps and a fluctuation relation for the stochastic work on a system that starts
in the Gibbs state. Some simplifications for the probability distributions in the case of maps with
equilibrium are presented. We illustrate our results by considering spin 1/2 systems under thermal
maps, non-thermal maps with equilibrium, maps with non-equilibrium steady states and concatenations
of them. Finally, we consider a particular limit in which the concatenation of maps generates a continuous
time evolution in Lindblad form for the system of interest, and we show that the concept of maps with
and without equilibrium translates into Lindblad equations with and without quantum detailed
balance, respectively. The consequences for the thermodynamic quantities in this limit are discussed.
