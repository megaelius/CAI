The optimal design of nanoparticle synthesis protocols is often achieved via one-at-a-time experimental
designs. Aside from covering a limited space for the possible input conditions, these methods neglect
possible interaction between different combinations of input factors. This is where mechanistic
models embracing various possibilities find importance. By performing global uncertainty/sensitivity
analysis (UA/SA), one can map out the various outcomes of the process vs. different combinations
of operating conditions. Moreover, UA/SA allows for the assessment of the model behavior, an inevitable
step in the theoretical understanding of a process. Recently, we developed a coupled thermodynamic-kinetic
framework in the form of population balance modelling in order to describe the precipitation of
calcium-silicate-hydrate. Besides its relevance in the construction industry, this inorganic
nanomaterial offers potential applications in biomedicine, environmental remediation, and
catalysis most notably due to ample specific surface area that can be achieved by carefully tuning
the synthesis conditions. Here, we apply a global UA/SA to an improved version of our computational
model in order to understand the effect of variations in the model parameters and experimental conditions
(induced by either uncertainty or tunability) on the properties of the product. With the specific
surface area of particles as an example, we show that UA/SA identifies the factors whose control
would allow a fine-tuning of the desired properties. This way, we can rationalize the proper synthesis
protocol before any further attempt to optimize the experimental procedure. This approach is general
and can be transferred to other nanoparticle synthesis schemes as well.
