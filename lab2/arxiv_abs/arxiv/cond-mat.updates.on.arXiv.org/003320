Conformal field theory has recently been applied to derive few-body Hamiltonians whose ground
states are lattice versions of fractional quantum Hall states. The exact lattice models involve
interactions over long distances, which is difficult to realize in experiments. It seems, however,
that such long-range interactions should not be necessary, as the correlations decay exponentially
in the bulk. This poses the question, whether the Hamiltonians can be truncated to contain only local
interactions without changing the physics of the ground state. Previous studies have in a couple
of cases with particularly much symmetry obtained such local Hamiltonians by keeping only a few
local terms and numerically optimizing the coefficients. Here, we investigate a different strategy
to construct truncated Hamiltonians, which does not rely on optimization, and which can be applied
independent of the choice of lattice. We test the approach on two models with bosonic Laughlin-like
ground states with filling factor $1/2$ and $1/4$, respectively. We first investigate how the coupling
strengths in the exact Hamiltonians depend on distance, and then we study the truncated models.
For the case of $1/2$ filling, we find that the truncated model with truncation radius $\sqrt{2}$
lattice constants on the square lattice and $1$ lattice constant on the triangular lattice has an
approximate twofold ground state degeneracy on the torus, and the overlap per site between these
states and the states constructed from conformal field theory is higher than $0.99$ for the lattices
considered. For the model at $1/4$ filling, our results give some hints that a truncation radius
of $\sqrt{5}$ on the square lattice and $\sqrt{7}$ on the triangular lattice might be enough, but
the finite size effects are too large to judge whether the topology is, indeed, present in the thermodynamic
limit.
