The details of phase separation of a Ni-6.5Al-9.9Mo aged at 978 K for aging times ranging from 0.125
to 1024 h are investigated by atom-probe tomography and lattice-kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC) simulations.
On the basis of the temporal evolution of the nanostructure, three experimental regimes are identified:
(1) concomitant precipitate nucleation and growth (t less than 0.25 h); (2) concurrent coagulation
and coalescence (t 0.25 to 16 h); and (3) quasi-stationary coarsening of gamma prime(L12)- precipitates
(t 16 to 1024 h). The temporal dependencies of the mean precipitate radius and precipitate number
density, Nv(t), are determined experimentally, 0.344 (0.012) and -0.95(0.02), respectively,
following the predictions of quasi-stationary coarsening models. In this alloy aged at 978 K, Al
partitions strongly to the gamma prime(L12)-phase with a partitioning coefficient 4.06(0.04),
whereas Mo and Ni partition to the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix with values of 0.61(0.01) and 0.90(0.01),
respectively. In the quasi-stationary regime(t larger than 16h), the temporal exponents of the
Al, Mo, and Ni supersaturations in both the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix and gamma prime(L12)-precipitates
are in reasonable agreement with a multi-component coarsening model's prediction of -0.33. Quantitative
analyses of the edge-to-edge inter-precipitate distances demonstrate that coagulation and coalescence
are consequences of the overlap of the diffusion fields surrounding the gamma prime(L12)-precipitates.
Both 3-D APT and LKMC results demonstrate that the interfacial compositional width decrease with
increasing values. And the interfacial compositional width at infinite ageing time are estimated
to be 1.89(0.22) nm, 2.09(0.12) nm and 2.64(0.03) nm for Ni, Al and Mo, respectively.
