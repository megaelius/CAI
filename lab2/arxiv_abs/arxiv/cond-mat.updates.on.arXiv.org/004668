The synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been a primary focus for 2D nanomaterial
research over the last 10 years, however, only a small fraction of this research has been concentrated
on transition metal ditellurides. In particular, nanoscale platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) has
rarely been investigated, despite its potential applications in catalysis, photonics and spintronics.
Of the reports published, the majority examine mechanically-exfoliated flakes from chemical
vapor transport (CVT) grown crystals. While this production method is ideal for fundamental studies,
it is very resource intensive therefore rendering this process unsuitable for large scale applications.
In this report, the synthesis of thin films of PtTe2 through the reaction of solid-phase precursor
films is described. This offers a production method for large-area, thickness-controlled PtTe2,
suitable for a range of applications. These polycrystalline PtTe2 films were grown at temperatures
as low as 450 degC, significantly below the typical temperatures used in the CVT synthesis methods.
To investigate their potential applicability, these films were examined as electrocatalysts
for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The films showed
promising catalytic behavior, however, the PtTe2 was found to undergo chemical transformation
to a substoichiometric chalcogenide compound under ORR conditions. This study shows while PtTe2
is stable and highly useful for HER, this property does not apply to ORR, which undergoes a fundamentally
different mechanism. This study broadens our knowledge of the electrocatalysis of TMDs.
