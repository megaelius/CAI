Icosahedral quasicrystals spontaneously form from the melt in simulations of Al--Cu--Fe alloys.
We model the interatomic interactions using oscillating pair potentials tuned to the specific
alloy system based on a database of density functional theory (DFT)-derived energies and forces.
Favored interatomic separations align with the geometry of icosahedral motifs that overlap to
create face-centered icosahedral order on a hierarchy of length scales. Molecular dynamics simulations,
supplemented with Monte Carlo steps to swap chemical species, efficiently sample the configuration
space of our models, which reach up to 9846 atoms. Exchanging temperatures of independent trajectories
(replica exchange) allows us to achieve thermal equilibrium at low temperatures. By optimizing
structure and composition we create structures whose DFT energies reach to within $\sim$2 meV/atom
of the energies of competing crystal phases. Free energies obtained by adding contributions due
to harmonic and anharmonic vibrations, chemical substitution disorder, phasons, and electronic
excitations, show that the quasicrystal becomes stable against competing phases at temperatures
above 600K. The average structure can be described succinctly as a cut through atomic surfaces in
six-dimensional space that reveal specific patterns of preferred chemical occupancy. Atomic
surface regions of mixed chemical occupation demonstrate the proliferation of phason fluctuations,
which can be observed in real space through the formation, dissolution and reformation of large
scale icosahedral motifs -- a picture that is hidden from diffraction refinements due to averaging
over the disorder and consequent loss of information concerning occupancy correlations.
