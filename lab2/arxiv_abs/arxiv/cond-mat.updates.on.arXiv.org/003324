Single photon emitters (SPEs) in solids have emerged as promising candidates for quantum photonic
sensing, communications, and computing. Defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) exhibit high-brightness,
room-temperature quantum emission, but their large spectral variability and unknown local structure
significantly challenge their technological utility. Here, we directly correlate hBN quantum
emission with the material's local strain using a combination of photoluminescence (PL), cathodoluminescence
(CL) and nano-beam electron diffraction. Across 40 emitters and 15 samples, we observe zero phonon
lines(ZPLs) in PL and CL ranging from 540-720 nm. CL mapping reveals that multiple defects and distinct
defect species located within an optically-diffraction-limited region can each contribute to
the observed PL spectra. Local strain maps indicate that strain is not required to activate the emitters
and is not solely responsible for the observed ZPL spectral range. Instead, four distinct defect
classes are responsible for the observed emission range. One defect class has ZPLs near 615 nm with
predominantly matched CL-PL responses; it is not a strain-tuned version of another defect class
with ZPL emission centered at 580 nm. A third defect class at 650 nm has low visible-frequency CL emission;
and a fourth defect species centered at 705 nm has a small, ~10 nm shift between its CL and PL peaks.
All studied defects are stable upon both electron and optical irradiation. Our results provide
an important foundation for atomic-scale optical characterization of color centers, as well as
a foundation for engineering defects with precise emission properties.
