Novel materials, which often exhibit surprising or even revolutionary physical properties, are
necessary for critical advances in technologies. Simultaneous control of structural and physical
properties via a small electrical current is of great significance both fundamentally and technologically.
Recent studies demonstrate that a combination of strong spin-orbit interactions and a distorted
crystal structure in magnetic Mott insulators is sufficient to attain this long-desired goal.
In this Topical Review, we highlight underlying properties of this class of materials and present
two representative antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, namely, 4d-electron based Ca2RuO4 and
5d-electron based Sr2IrO4, as model systems. In essence, a small, applied electrical current engages
with the lattice, critically reducing structural distortions, which in turn readily suppresses
the antiferromagnetic and insulating state and subsequently results in emergent new states. While
details may vary in different materials, at the heart of these phenomena are current-reduced lattice
distortions, which, via spin-orbit interactions, dictate physical properties. Electrical current,
which joins magnetic field, electric field, pressure, light, etc. as a new external stimulus, provides
a new, key dimension for materials research, and also pose a series of intriguing questions that
may provide the impetus for advancing our understanding of spin-orbit-coupled matter. This Topical
Review provides a brief introduction, a few hopefully informative examples and some general remarks.
It is by no means an exhaustive report of the current state of studies on this topic.
