Ice nucleation plays a significant role in a large number of natural and technological processes,
but it is challenging to investigate experimentally because of the small time (ns) and short length
scales (nm) involved. On the other hand, conventional molecular simulations struggle to cope with
the relatively long timescale required for critical ice nuclei to form. One way to tackle this issue
is to take advantage of free energy or path sampling techniques. Unfortunately, these are computationally
costly. Seeded molecular dynamics is a much less demanding alternative that has been successfully
applied already to study the homogeneous freezing of water. However, in the case of heterogeneous
ice nucleation, nature's favourite route to form ice, an array of suitable interfaces between the
ice seeds and the substrate of interest has to be built - and this is no trivial task. In this paper,
we present a Heterogeneous SEEDing approach (HSEED) which harnesses a random structure search
framework to tackle the ice-substrate challenge, thus enabling seeded molecular dynamics simulations
of heterogeneous ice nucleation on crystalline surfaces. We validate the HSEED framework by investigating
the nucleation of ice on: (i) model crystalline surfaces, using the coarse-grained mW model; and
(ii) cholesterol crystals, employing the fully atomistic TIP4P/Ice water model. We show that the
HSEED technique yields results in excellent agreement with both metadynamics and forward flux
sampling simulations. Because of its computational efficiency, the HSEED method allows one to
rapidly assess the ice nucleation ability of whole libraries of crystalline substrates - a long-awaited
computational development in e.g. atmospheric science.
