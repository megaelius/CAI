The ability to manipulate electric and magnetic components of light at the nanoscale delivered
by dielectric and semiconductor components is paving the way towards novel types of sources and
nanoantennae with exceptional electromagnetic signatures, flexible and tunable metasurface
architectures, enhanced light harvesting structures, etc. Recently, the anapoles states arising
from the destructive interference of basic multipoles and their toroidal counterparts have been
widely exploited to cancel radiation from an individual scattering channel of isolated nanoresonators,
while displaying nontrivial near fields. As such, anapole states have been claimed to correspond
to non-radiating sources. Nevertheless, these states are commonly found together with high order
multipole moments featuring non-zero overall far-field. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally
demonstrate a fully non-scattering state governed by a novel 4-fold hybrid anapole with all the
dominant multipoles suppressed by their corresponding toroidal (retarded) terms, i.e. a dark
analogue of the superscattering effect. This invisibility state, however, allows for non-trivial
near-field maps enabled by the unique interplay of the resonant Mie-like and Fabry-Perot modes
as demonstrated by the quasi-normal modal expansion. Moreover, the hybrid anapole state is shown
to be protected; the spectral position of the non-scattering point remains unperturbed in the presence
of a substrate with significantly high refractive index. We experimentally verify our novel effect
by means of dark field measurements of the scattering response of individual nanocylinders. The
results are of high demand for efficient sensing and Raman scattering setups with enhanced signal-to-noise
ratio, highly transmissive metasurfaces for phase manipulation, holograms, and a large span of
linear and non-linear applications in dielectric nanophotonics.
