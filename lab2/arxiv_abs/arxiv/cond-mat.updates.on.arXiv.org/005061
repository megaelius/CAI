Spin splitting of energy bands can be induced by relativistic spin-orbit interactions in materials
without inversion symmetry. Whereas polar space group symmetries permit Rashba (R-1) spin splitting
with helical spin textures in momentum space, which could be reversed upon switching a ferroelectric
polarization via applied electric fields, the ordinary Dresselhaus effect (D-1A) is ac-tive only
in materials exhibiting nonpolar noncentrosymmetric crystal classes with atoms occupy-ing exclusively
non-polar lattice sites. Consequently, the spin-momentum locking induced by D-1A is not electric
field-switchable. An alternative type of Dresselhaus symmetry, referred to as D-1B, exhibits
crystal class constraints similar to D-1A (all dipoles add up to zero), but unlike D-1A, at least
one polar site is occupied. We find that this behavior exists in a class of ferri-chiral crys-tals,
which in principle could be reversed upon a change in chirality. Focusing on alkali metal chalcogenides,
we identify NaCu5S3 in the nonentiamorphic ferri-chiral structure, which exhibits CuS3 chiral
units differing in the magnitude of their Cu displacements. We then synthesize NaCu5S3 (space group
P6322) and confirm its ferri-chiral structure with power x-ray diffraction. Our electronic structure
calculations demonstrate it exhibits D-1B spin splitting as well as a ferri-chiral phase transition,
revealing spin splitting interdependent on chirality. Our electronic struc-ture calculations
show that a few percent biaxial tensile strain can reduce (or nearly quench) the switching barrier
separating the monodomain ferri-chiral P6322 states. We discuss what type of external stimuli
might switch the chirality so as to reverse the (non-helical) Dresselhaus D-1B spin texture, offering
an alternative to the traditional reversal of the (helical) Rashba spin texture.
