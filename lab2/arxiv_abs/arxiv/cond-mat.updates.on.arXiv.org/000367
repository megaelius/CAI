Carbon nanotubes are a versatile material in which many aspects of condensed matter physics come
together. Recent discoveries, enabled by sophisticated fabrication, have uncovered new phenomena
that completely change our understanding of transport in these devices, especially the role of
the spin and valley degrees of freedom. This review describes the modern understanding of transport
through nanotube devices. Unlike conventional semiconductors, electrons in nanotubes have two
angular momentum quantum numbers, arising from spin and from valley freedom. We focus on the interplay
between the two. In single quantum dots defined in short lengths of nanotube, the energy levels associated
with each degree of freedom, and the spin-orbit coupling between them, are revealed by Coulomb blockade
spectroscopy. In double quantum dots, the combination of quantum numbers modifies the selection
rules of Pauli blockade. This can be exploited to read out spin and valley qubits, and to measure the
decay of these states through coupling to nuclear spins and phonons. A second unique property of
carbon nanotubes is that the combination of valley freedom and electron-electron interactions
in one dimension strongly modifies their transport behaviour. Interaction between electrons
inside and outside a quantum dot is manifested in SU(4) Kondo behavior and level renormalization.
Interaction within a dot leads to Wigner molecules and more complex correlated states. This review
takes an experimental perspective informed by recent advances in theory. As well as the well-understood
overall picture, we also state clearly open questions for the field. These advances position nanotubes
as a leading system for the study of spin and valley physics in one dimension where electronic disorder
and hyperfine interaction can both be reduced to a very low level.
