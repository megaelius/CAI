The Mott metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard model is studied by constructing a dynamical
slave-boson mean-field theory in the limit of large lattice coordination number $z$ that incorporates
the binding between doubly occupied (doublon) and empty (holon) sites. On the Mott insulating side
where all doublons and holons bond in real space into excitonic pairs leading to the charge gap, the
theory simplifies considerably to leading order in $1/\sqrt{z}$, and becomes exact on the infinite-$z$
Bethe lattice. An asymptotic solution is obtained for a continuous Mott transition associated
with the closing of the charge gap at a critical value of the Hubbard $U_c$ and the corresponding doublon
density $n_d^c$, hopping $\chi_d^c$ and doublon-holon pairing $\Delta_d^c$ amplitudes. We find
$U_c=U_{\rm BR} [1 -2n_d^c -\sqrt{z} (\chi_d^c +\Delta_d^c))] \simeq0.8U_{\rm BR}$, where $U_{\rm
BR}$ is the critical value for the Brinkman-Rice transition in the Gutzwiller approximation captured
in the static mean-field solution of the slave-boson formulation of Kotliar and Ruckenstein. Thus,
the Mott transition can be viewed as the quantum correction to the Brinkman-Rice transition due
to doublon-holon binding. Quantitative comparisons are made to the results of the dynamical mean-field
theory, showing good agreement. In the absence of magnetic order, the Mott insulator is a $U(1)$
quantum spin liquid with nonzero intersite spinon hopping that survives the large-$z$ limit and
lifts the $2^N$-fold degeneracy of the local moments. We show that the spinons are coupled to the
doublons/holons by a dissipative compact $U(1)$ gauge field in the deconfined phase, realizing
the spin-charge separated gapless spin liquid Mott insulator.
