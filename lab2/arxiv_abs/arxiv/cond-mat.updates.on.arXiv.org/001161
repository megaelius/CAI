Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to generate hydrogen is one of the most studied methods
for converting solar energy into clean fuel because of its simplicity and potentially low cost.
However, despite over 40 years of intensive research, PEC water splitting remains in its early stages
with stable efficiencies far less than 10%, a benchmark for commercial applications. Currently,
massive efforts have been made to identify the best semiconductor photocatalysts with both a high
STH conversion efficiency and long-term resistance to photocorrosion for solar PEC water splitting.
Here, we examined the photocorrosion stabilities of 202 semiconductors under PEC water-splitting
conditions; these semiconductors are known to either catalyze overall water splitting or reduce
or oxidize water in the presence of an external sacrificial redox agent. We reveal that the desired
photocorrosion stability sets a limit of 2.48 eV (relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE))
for the highest possible potential of the valence band (VB) edge of a photocorrosion-resistant
semiconducting photocatalyst. This limit is also supported by a derived correlation between the
Gibbs free energy and the VB potential of a semiconductor. The disparity between the stability-limited
VB potential at 2.48 V and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential at 1.23 V vs NHE reduces the
maximum STH conversion efficiency to approximately 8% for long-term stable single-bandgap PEC
water splitting cells. Based on this understanding, we suggest that the most promising strategy
to overcome this 8% efficiency limit is to decouple the requirements of efficient light harvesting
and chemical stability by protecting the active semiconductor photocatalyst surface with a photocorrosion-resistant
oxide coating layer.
