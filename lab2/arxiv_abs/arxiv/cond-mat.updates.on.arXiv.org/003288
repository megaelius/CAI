Electronic transport properties for single-molecule junctions have been widely measured by several
techniques, including mechanically controllable break junctions, electromigration break junctions
or by means of scanning tunneling microscopes. In parallel, many theoretical tools have been developed
and refined for describing such transport properties and for obtaining numerical predictions.
Most prominent among these theoretical tools are those based upon density functional theory. In
this review, theory and experiment are critically compared and this confrontation leads to several
important conclusions. The theoretically predicted trends nowadays reproduce the experimental
findings quite well for series of molecules with a single well-defined control parameter, such
as the length of the molecules. The quantitative agreement between theory and experiment usually
is less convincing, however. Many reasons for quantitative discrepancies can be identified, from
which one may decide that qualitative agreement is the best one may expect with present modeling
tools. For further progress, benchmark systems are required that are sufficiently well-defined
by experiment to allow quantitative testing of the approximation schemes underlying the theoretical
modeling. Several key experiments can be identified suggesting that the present description may
even be qualitatively incomplete in some cases. Such key experimental observations and their current
models are also discussed here, leading to several suggestions for extensions of the models towards
including dynamic image charges, electron correlations, and polaron formation.
