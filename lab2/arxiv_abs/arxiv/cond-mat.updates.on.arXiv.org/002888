To study the impact of oxygen vacancies on spin-polarized transport, we have computed the electronic
and transport properties of single (F centers) and paired (M centers) oxygen vacancies using density
functional theory. These point defects can generate barrier heights as low as 0.4V for FeCo electrodes
irrespective of the defect's spatial position within the barrier, and of the orientation of the
M center. These defects promote a strong decrease in the conductance of the spin up channel in the
magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ)'s parallel (P) magnetic state that mainly accounts for an order-of-magnitude
drop in TMR, from about 10000$\%$ in the ideal case toward values more in line with experiment. When
placed in the middle layer of the MgO barrier, the F center introduces additional P $\uparrow$ transmission
away from the $\Gamma$ point. This scattering lowers TMR to 145$\%$. In contrast, the M center merely
broadens this transmission around $\Gamma$, thereby boosting TMR to 315$\%$. Rotating a M center
so as to partly point along the transmission direction sharpens transmission around $\Gamma$,
further increasing TMR to 1423$\%$. When these defects are placed at the MTJ interface, the transmission
and ensuing TMR, which reaches $\approx$ 4000$\%$, suggest that such junctions behave as would
an ideal MTJ, only with a much lower barrier height. Our results thus theoretically reconcile the
concurrent observations of high TMR and low barrier heights, such as post-deposition oxidation
of metallic Mg, which can generate oxygen vacancies at the lower MTJ interface, and annealing which
can promote M centers over F centers.
