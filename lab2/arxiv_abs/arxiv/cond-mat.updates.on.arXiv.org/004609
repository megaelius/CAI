This paper presents the concepts behind the BrainScales (BSS) accelerated analog neuromorphic
computing architecture. It describes the second-generation BrainScales-2 (BSS-2) version and
its most recent in-silico realization, the HICANN-X Application Specific Integrated Circuit
(ASIC), as it has been developed as part of the neuromorphic computing activities within the European
Human Brain Project (HBP). While the first generation is implemented in an 180nm process, the second
generation uses 65nm technology. This allows the integration of a digital plasticity processing
unit, a highly-parallel micro processor specially built for the computational needs of learning
in an accelerated analog neuromorphic systems. The presented architecture is based upon a continuous-time,
analog, physical model implementation of neurons and synapses, resembling an analog neuromorphic
accelerator attached to build-in digital compute cores. While the analog part emulates the spike-based
dynamics of the neural network in continuous-time, the latter simulates biological processes
happening on a slower time-scale, like structural and parameter changes. Compared to biological
time-scales, the emulation is highly accelerated, i.e. all time-constants are several orders
of magnitude smaller than in biology. Programmable ion channel emulation and inter-compartmental
conductances allow the modeling of nonlinear dendrites, back-propagating action-potentials
as well as NMDA and Calcium plateau potentials. To extend the usability of the analog accelerator,
it also supports vector-matrix multiplication. Thereby, BSS-2 supports inference of deep convolutional
networks as well as local-learning with complex ensembles of spiking neurons within the same substrate.
