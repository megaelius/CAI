Unconventional superconductivity has been intensively studied for decades, yet the origin and
nature of the pairing is often obscure. This is particularly the case in $\ce{Sr2RuO4}$: there is
no consensus on the driving forces for the superconducting gap, its symmetries and dimensionality
after a quarter of a century of detailed study. Multiple low-energy scales in spin, charge and orbital
degrees of freedom are present, which make it difficult to ascertain the validity of model approaches
which make assumptions that exclude or single out particular mechanisms. Here we develop an alternative
approach, a detailed \emph{ab initio} theory that can adequately treat both local and non-local
spin and charge correlations, and multi-particle vertex functions in all relevant degrees of freedom,
that allow calculation of spin, charge, and pairing susceptibilities. Recent advances that combine
the quasiparticle self-consistent \emph{GW} approximation, a perturbation theory that accurately
captures long range charge correlations with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which includes
local spin fluctuations, make this possible. We find that $\ce{Sr2RuO4}$ has a superconducting
gap structure with nodal lines along all three crystalline directions. Spin fluctuations, dominated
by the highly incommensurate vector, tries to stabilize a singlet pairing state but the Ru-t$_{2g}$
manifold drive strong inter- and intra-orbital charge fluctuations in triplet channel. When subject
to stress, the otherwise competing spin and charge channels are found to co-operate and drive an
even-parity pairing, which causes T$_{c}$ to increase. This occurs up to a critical stress, beyond
which spin fluctuations become less coherent in singlet channel and T$_{c}$ begins to fall.
