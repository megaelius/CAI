Targeted drug delivery relies on two physical processes: the selective binding of a therapeutic
particle to receptors on a specific cell membrane, followed by transport of the particle across
the membrane. In this article, we address some of the challenges in controlling the thermodynamics
and dynamics of these processes by combining a simple experimental system with a statistical mechanical
model. Specifically, we characterize and model ligand-receptor binding between colloidal particles
and fluid lipid bilayers, as well as the surface mobility of membrane-bound particles. We show that
the mobility of the receptors within the fluid membrane is key to both the thermodynamics and dynamics
of binding. First, we find that the particle-membrane binding free energy---or avidity---is a
strongly nonlinear function of the ligand-receptor affinity. We attribute the nonlinearity to
a combination of multivalency and recruitment of fluid receptors to the binding site. Our results
also suggest that partial wrapping of the bound particles by the membrane enhances avidity further.
Second, we demonstrate that the lateral mobility of membrane-bound particles is also strongly
influenced by the recruitment of receptors. Specifically, we find that the lateral diffusion coefficient
of a membrane-bound particle is dominated by the hydrodynamic drag against the aggregate of receptors
within the membrane. Therefore, while it is tempting to focus on the design of ligands that target
specific receptors, our results highlight that the properties of the membrane itself---its fluidity
and elasticity---are equally important in determining the binding and transport of small particles
on membranes.
