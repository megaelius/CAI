We study the dependence of mechanical conformations of graphene sheets located on flat substrates
on the density of unilateral (one-side) attachment of hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine atoms to them.
It is shown that chemically modified graphene sheet can take four main forms on a flat substrate:
the form of a flat sheet located parallel to the surface of the substrate, the form of convex sheet
partially detached from the substrate with bent edges adjacent to the substrate, and the forms of
single and double rolls on the substrate. On the surface of crystalline graphite, the flat form of
the sheet is lowest in energy for hydrogenation density p <0.21, fluorination density p<0.20 and
chlorination density p<0.16. The surface of crystalline nickel has higher adsorption energy for
graphene monolayer and the flat form of chemically modified sheet on such substrate is lowest in
energy for hydrogenation density p<0.47, fluorination density p<0.30 and chlorination density
p<0.21. The flat shape of the graphene sheet remains basic on a substrate also when molecular groups
CH3, CH2-CH3 or rings C6H5 are one-side attached to its outer surface. At the attachment density
p=1/6 (one group per 6 sheet atoms) the sheet becomes the nanocarpet the basis of which is formed by
a sheet of graphene and the pile of which is formed by the attached molecular groups forming a tightly
packed regular lattice. The addition of hydroxyl groups OH with attachment density p=1/4 leads
to the formation of hexagonal lattices of hydroxyl groups on the outer surface of graphene sheet
on a substrate. In this lattice, the groups can form various configurations of hydrogen bonds, which
turns the chemically modified sheet into a multistable system.
