Quaternary CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 glasses are important constituents of the Earth's lower crust
and mantle, and they also have important industrial applications such as in metallurgical processes,
concrete production and emerging low-CO2 cement technologies. In particular, these applications
rely heavily on the composition-structure-reactivity relationships for CMAS glasses, which
are not yet well established. In this study, we developed a robust method that combines force-field
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations with X-ray/neutron
scattering experiments to resolve the atomic structure of a CMAS glass. The final structural representation
generated using this method is not only thermodynamically favorable (according to DFT calculations)
but also agrees with experiments (including X-ray/neutron scattering data as well as literature
data). Detailed analysis of the final structure (including partial pair distribution functions,
coordination number, oxygen environment) enabled existing discrepancies in the literature to
be reconciled and has revealed new structural information on the CMAS glass, specifically, (i)
the unambiguous assignment of medium-range atomic ordering, (ii) the preferential role of Ca atoms
as charge compensators and Mg atoms as network modifiers, (iii) the proximity of Mg atoms to free
oxygen sites, and (iv) clustering of Mg atoms. Overall, this new structural information will enhance
our mechanistic understanding on CMAS glass dissolution behavior, including dissolution-related
mechanisms occurring during the formation of low-CO2 cements.
