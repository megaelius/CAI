Microstructural geometry plays a critical role in the response of heterogeneous materials. Consequently,
methods for generating microstructural samples are increasingly crucial to advanced numerical
analyses. We extend Sonon et al.'s unified framework, developed originally for generating particulate
and foam-like microstructural geometries of Periodic Unit Cells, to non-periodic microstructural
representations based on the formalism of Wang tiles. This formalism has been recently proposed
in order to generalize the Periodic Unit Cell approach, enabling a fast synthesis of arbitrarily
large, stochastic microstructural samples from a handful of domains with predefined compatibility
constraints. However, a robust procedure capable of designing complex, three-dimensional, foam-like
and cellular morphologies of Wang tiles has not yet been proposed. This contribution fills the gap
by significantly broadening the applicability of the tiling concept. Since the original Sonon
et al.'s framework builds on a random sequential addition of particles enhanced with an implicit
representation of particle boundaries by the level-set field, we first devise an analysis based
on a connectivity graph of a tile set, resolving the question where a particle should be copied when
it intersects a tile boundary. Next, we introduce several modifications to the original algorithm
that are necessary to ensure microstructural compatibility in the generalized periodicity setting
of Wang tiles. Having established a universal procedure for generating tile morphologies, we compare
strictly aperiodic and stochastic sets with the same cardinality in terms of reducing the artificial
periodicity in reconstructed microstructural samples. We demonstrate the superiority of the
vertex-defined tile sets for two-dimensional problems and illustrate the capabilities of the
algorithm with two- and three-dimensional examples.
