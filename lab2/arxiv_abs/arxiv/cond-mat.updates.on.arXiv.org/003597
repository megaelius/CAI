The single-crystal growth, stoichiometry, and structure of Rb1-xFe2-ySe2-zSz crystals with
substitution of Se by S are reported. The variation of the magnetic and thermodynamic parameters
of samples was studied by differential-scanning calorimetry, magnetic susceptibility, conductivity,
and specific heat. The experimental results are discussed within a T-z phase diagram, which includes
vacancy-ordered and vacancy-disordered antiferromagnetic (AFM), superconducting (SC), and
non-superconducting phases. The structural study revealed change in the local environment of
the Fe tetrahedrons depending on substitution: a reduction of the Fe-Fe and Fe-Ch(chalcogen) bond
lengths and a tendency for the six out of eight bond angles to approach values for a regular tetrahedron
suggesting a reduction of structural distortions with substitution. With increasing substitution,
a lowering of the superconducting transition temperature Tc was observed; the percolation threshold
for the SC state is located at the substitution z = 1.2. The SC state was found to coexist with the AFM
state that persists in all samples independent of substitution. The temperature of the transition
into the AFM state TN shows a monotonous decrease indicating a weakening of the AFM interactions
with increasing substitution. The AFM phase exhibits an iron-vacancy-ordered structure below
the structural transition at Ts. The temperature Ts shows a non-monotonous variation: a decrease
with increasing z up to 1.3, followed by an increase for further increasing z. The suppression of
the superconductivity with substitution is accompanied by a significant reduction of the density
of states at the Fermi energy and a weakening of the electronic correlations in the studied system.
