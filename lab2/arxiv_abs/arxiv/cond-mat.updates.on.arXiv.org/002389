We develop theory models for both ballistic and disordered superconducting monolayer black phosphorus
devices in the presence of magnetic exchange field and strain. The ballistic case is studied through
a microscopic Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism while for the disordered case we formulate a quasiclassical
model. Utilizing the two models, we theoretically study the response of supercurrent to an externally
applied magnetic field in two-dimensional black phosphorus Josephson junctions. Our results
demonstrate that the response of the supercurrent to a perpendicular magnetic field in ballistic
samples can deviate from the standard Fraunhofer interference pattern when the Fermi level and
mechanical strain are varied. This finding suggests the combination of chemical potential and
strain is an efficient external knob to control the current response in highly sensitive strain-effect
transistors and superconducting quantum interference devices. We also study the supercurrent
in a superconductor-ferromagnet-ferromagnet-superconductor junction where the magnetizations
of the two adjacent magnetized regions are uniform with misaligned orientations. We show that the
magnetization misalignment can control the excitation of harmonics higher than the first harmonic
sin(phi) (in which phi is the phase difference between the superconductors) in supercurrent and
constitutes a full spin switching current element. Finally, we discuss possible experimental
implementations of our findings. We foresee our models and discussions could provide guidelines
to experimentalists in designing devices and future investigations.
