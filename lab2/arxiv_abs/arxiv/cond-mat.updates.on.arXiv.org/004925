The Perdew-Zunger (PZ) method provides a way to remove the self-interaction (SI) error from density
functional approximations on an orbital by orbital basis. The PZ method provides significant improvements
for the properties such as barrier heights or dissociation energies but results in over-correcting
the properties well described by SI-uncorrected semi-local functional. One cure to rectify the
over-correcting tendency is to scale down the magnitude of SI-correction of each orbital in the
many electron region. We have implemented the orbitalwise scaled down SI-correction (OSIC) scheme
of Vydrov et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 124, 094108 (2006)] using the Fermi-L\"owdin SI-correction method.
After validating the OSIC implementation with previously reported OSIC-LSDA results, we examine
its performance with the most successful non-empirical SCAN meta-GGA functional. Using different
forms of scaling factors to identify one-electron regions, we assess the performance of OSIC-SCAN
for a wide range of properties: total energies, ionization potentials and electron affinities
for atoms, atomization energies, dissociation and reaction energies, and reaction barrier heights
of molecules. Our results show that OSIC-SCAN provides superior results than the previously reported
OSIC-LSDA, -PBE, and -TPSS results. Furthermore, we propose selective scaling of OSIC (SOSIC)
to remove its major shortcoming that destroys the $-1/r$ asymptotic behavior of the potentials.
The SOSIC method gives the highest occupied orbital eigenvalues practically identical to those
in PZSIC and unlike OSIC provides bound atomic anions even with larger powers of scaling factors.
SOSIC compared to PZSIC or OSIC provides more balanced description of total energies and barrier
heights.
