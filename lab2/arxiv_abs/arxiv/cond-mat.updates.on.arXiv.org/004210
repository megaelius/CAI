In high temperature cuprate superconductors, the interlayer coupling between the CuO$_2$ planes
plays an important role in dictating superconductivity, as indicated by the sensitive dependence
of the critical temperature (T$_C$) on the number of CuO$_2$ planes in one structural unit. In Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$
superconductor with two CuO$_2$ planes in one structural unit, the interaction between the two
CuO$_2$ planes gives rise to band splitting into two Fermi surface sheets (bilayer splitting) that
have distinct superconducting gap. The iron based superconductors are composed of stacking of
the FeAs/FeSe layers; whether the interlayer coupling can cause similar band splitting and its
effect on superconductivity remain unclear. Here we report high resolution laser-based angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on a newly discovered iron based superconductor,
KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ (T$_C$=33.5\,K) which consists of stacking FeAs blocks with two FeAs
layers separated by insulating Ca$_2$F$_2$ blocks. Bilayer splitting effect is observed for the
first time that gives rise to totally five hole-like Fermi surface sheets around the Brilliouin
zone center. Band structure calculations reproduce the observed bilayer splitting by identifying
interlayer interorbital interaction between the two FeAs layers within one FeAs block. All the
hole-like pockets around the zone center exhibit Fermi surface-dependent and nodeless superconducting
gap. The gap functions with short-range antiferromagetic fluctuations are proposed and the gap
symmetry can be well understood when the interlayer pairing is considered. The particularly strong
interlayer pairing is observed for one of the bands. Our observations provide key information on
the interlayer coupling and interlayer pairing in understanding superconductivity in iron based
superconductors.
