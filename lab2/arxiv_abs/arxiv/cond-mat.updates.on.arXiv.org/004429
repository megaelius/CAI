The paper presents a cooperative consideration of Raman spectra of sp2 amorphous carbons as well
as the nature and type of their amorphicity. The latter was attributed to the amorphization of a new
type named as enforced fragmentation. The fragments are stable graphenous molecules, which are
the basic structural units (BSUs) of the solids, determining them as amorphics with molecular structure.
Due to weak intermolecular interaction, BSUs, once aggregated, are the main defendants for IR absorption
and Raman scattering of the solids, just justifying the consideration of them at molecular level.
The standard G-D-2D pattern of Raman spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, sp2 amorphous
carbons, graphene and/or graphite crystal is attributed to extended honeycomb composition of
carbon atoms and are suggested as manifestation of molecule-crystal dualism of graphenous materials.
The molecular approximation, applied to the analysis of one-phonon spectra of the studied sp2 ACs,
makes it possible to trace a direct connection of the G-D spectra image as well as their broadband
structure with a considerable dispersion of the C=C bond lengths within BSUs honeycomb structure,
caused by the influence of chemical action, deformation, etc. This approximation, applied to the
interpretation of two-phonon spectrum of graphenous molecules for the first time, reveals a particular
role of electrical anharmonicity in the spectra formation and attributes this effect to a high degree
of the electron density delocalization. A size-stimulated transition from molecular to quasi-particle
phonon consideration of Raman spectra was experimentally traced, which allowed evaluation of
a free path of optical phonons in graphene crystal.
