A remarkable recent experiment has observed Mott insulator and proximate superconductor phases
in twisted bilayer graphene when electrons partly fill a nearly flat mini-band that arises a `magic'
twist angle. However, the nature of the Mott insulator, origin of superconductivity and an effective
low energy model remain to be determined. We propose a Mott insulator with intervalley coherence
that spontaneously breaks U(1) valley symmetry, and describe a mechanism that selects this order
over the competing magnetically ordered states favored by the Hunds coupling. We also identify
symmetry related features of the nearly flat band that are key to understanding the strong correlation
physics and constrain any tight binding description. First, although the charge density is concentrated
on the triangular lattice sites of the moir$\text{\'e }$ pattern, the Wannier states of the tight-binding
model must be centered on different sites which form a honeycomb lattice. Next, spatially localizing
electrons derived from the nearly flat band necessarily breaks valley and other symmetries within
any mean-field treatment, which is suggestive of a valley-ordered Mott state, and also dictates
that additional symmetry breaking is present to remove symmetry-enforced band contacts. Tight-binding
models describing the nearly flat mini-band are derived, which highlight the importance of further
neighbor hopping and interactions. We discuss consequences of this picture for superconducting
states obtained on doping the valley ordered Mott insulator. We show how important features of the
experimental phenomenology may be explained and suggest a number of further experiments for the
future. We also describe a model for correlated states in trilayer graphene heterostructures and
contrast it with the bilayer case.
