Understanding the nature and behaviour of excitations in quantum spin liquids, and in topological
phases of matter in general, is of fundamental importance, and has proven crucial for experimental
detection and characterisation of candidate materials. Current theoretical and numerical techniques,
however, have limited capabilities, especially when it comes to studying gapped excitations.
In this paper, we propose a semiclassical numerical method, based on large-$S$ path integral approach,
to study systems whose spin liquid behaviour is underpinned by perturbative ring-exchange Hamiltonians.
Our method can readily access both thermodynamic and spectral properties. We focus in particular
on quantum spin ice and its photon and vison excitations. After benchmarking the method against
existing results on photons, we use it to characterise visons and their thermodynamic behaviour,
which remained hitherto largely unexplored. We find that visons form a weak electrolyte - in contrast
to spinons in classical spin ice. That is, vison pairs are the dominant population at low temperatures.
This is reflected in the behaviour of thermodynamic quantities, such as pinch point motifs in the
relevant spin correlators. Visons also appear to strongly hybridise with the photon background,
a phenomenon that gravely affects the way these quasiparticles may show up in inelastic response
measurements. Our results demonstrate that the method, and generalisations thereof, can substantially
help our understanding of quasiparticles and their interplay in quantum spin ice and other quantum
spin liquids, quantum dimer models, and lattice gauge theories in general.
