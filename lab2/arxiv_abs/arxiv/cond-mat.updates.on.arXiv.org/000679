We analyze a random walk strategy on undirected regular networks involving power matrix functions
of the type $L^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ where $L$ indicates a `simple' Laplacian matrix. We refer such
walks to as `Fractional Random Walks' with admissible interval $0<\alpha \leq 2$. We deduce for
the Fractional Random Walk probability generating functions (network Green's functions). From
these analytical results we establish a generalization of Polya's recurrence theorem for Fractional
Random Walks on $d$-dimensional infinite lattices: The Fractional Random Walk is transient for
dimensions $d > \alpha$ (recurrent for $d\leq\alpha$) of the lattice. As a consequence for $0<\alpha<
1$ the Fractional Random Walk is transient for all lattice dimensions $d=1,2,..$ and in the range
$1\leq\alpha < 2$ for dimensions $d\geq 2$. Finally, for $\alpha=2$ Polya's classical recurrence
theorem is recovered, namely the walk is transient only for lattice dimensions $d\geq 3$. The generalization
of Polya's recurrence theorem remains valid for the class of random walks with L\'evy flight asymptotics
for long-range steps. We also analyze for the Fractional Random Walk mean first passage probabilities,
mean first passage times, and global mean first passage times (Kemeny constant). For the infinite
1D lattice (infinite ring) we obtain for the transient regime $0<\alpha<1$ closed form expressions
for the fractional lattice Green's function matrix containing the escape and ever passage probabilities.
The ever passage probabilities fulfill Riesz potential power law decay asymptotic behavior for
nodes far from the departure node. The non-locality of the Fractional Random Walk is generated by
the non-diagonality of the fractional Laplacian matrix with L\'evy type heavy tailed inverse power
law decay for the probability of long-range moves.
