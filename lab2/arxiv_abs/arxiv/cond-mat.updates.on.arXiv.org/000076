The mass flux of a low-density granular binary mixture obtained previously by solving the Boltzmann
equation by means of the Chapman-Enskog method is considered further. As in the elastic case, the
associated transport coefficients $D$, $D_p$ and $D'$ are given in terms of the solutions of a set
of coupled linear integral equations which are approximately solved by considering the first and
second Sonine approximations. The diffusion coefficients are explicitly obtained as functions
of the coefficients of restitution and the parameters of the mixture (masses, diameters and concentration)
and their expressions hold for an arbitrary number of dimensions. In order to check the accuracy
of the second Sonine correction for highly inelastic collisions, the Boltzmann equation is also
numerically solved by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to determine the
mutual diffusion coefficient $D$ in some special situations (self-diffusion problem and tracer
limit). The comparison with DSMC results reveals that the second Sonine approximation to $D$ improves
the predictions made from the first Sonine approximation. We also study the granular segregation
driven by a uni-directional thermal gradient. The segregation criterion is obtained from the so-called
thermal diffusion factor $\Lambda$, which measures the amount of segregation parallel to the temperature
gradient. The factor $\Lambda$ is determined here by considering the second-order Sonine forms
of the diffusion coefficients and its dependence on the coefficients of restitution is widely analyzed
across the parameter space of the system. The results obtained in this paper extend previous works
carried out in the tracer limit (vanishing mole fraction of one of the species) by some of the authors
of the present paper.
