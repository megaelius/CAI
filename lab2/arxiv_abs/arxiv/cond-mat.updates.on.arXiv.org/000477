We numerically study the interplay between superconductivity and disorder on the graphene honeycomb
lattice with on-site Hubbard attractive interactions U using a spatially inhomogeneous self-consistent
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) approach. In the absence of disorder there are two phases at charge neutrality.
Below a critical value Uc for attractive interactions there is a Dirac semimetal phase and above
it there is a superconducting phase. We add scalar potential disorder to the system, while remaining
at charge neutrality on average. Numerical solution of the BdG equations suggests that while in
the strong attraction regime (U > Uc) disorder has the usual effect of suppressing superconductivity,
in the weak attraction regime (U < Uc) weak disorder enhances superconductivity. In the weak
attraction regime, disorder that is too strong eventually suppresses superconductivity, i.e.,
there is an optimal disorder strength that maximizes the critical temperature Tc. Our numerical
results also suggest that in the weakly disordered regime, mesoscopic inhomogeneities enhance
superconductivity significantly more than what is predicted by a spatially uniform mean-field
theory a` la Abrikosov-Gorkov. In this regime, superconductivity consists of rare phase-coherent
superconducting islands. We also study the enhancement of the superconducting proximity effect
by disorder and mesoscopic inhomogeneities, and obtain typical spatial plots of the tunneling
density of states and the superfluid susceptibility that can be directly compared to scanning tunneling
miscroscopy (STM) experiments on proximity-induced superconductivity in graphene.
