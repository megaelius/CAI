The paper addresses a common assumption of elastoplastic modeling: that the recoverable, elastic
strain increment is unaffected by alterations of the elastic moduli that accompany loading. This
assumption is found to be false for a granular material, and discrete element (DEM) simulations
demonstrate that granular materials are coupled materials at both micro- and macro-scales. Elasto-plastic
coupling at the macro-scale is placed in the context of thermomechanics framework of Tomasz Hueckel
and Hans Ziegler, in which the elastic moduli are altered by irreversible processes during loading.
This complex behavior is explored for multi-directional loading probes that follow an initial
monotonic loading. An advanced DEM model is used in the study, with non-convex non-spherical particles
and two different contact models: a conventional linear-frictional model and an exact implementation
of the Hertz-like Cattaneo-Mindlin model. Rectilinear true-triaxial probes were used in the study
(i.e., no direct shear strain), with tiny strain increments of $2\times 10^{-6}$. At the micro-scale,
contact movements were monitored during small increments of loading and load-reversal, and results
show that these movements are not reversed by a reversal of strain direction, and some contacts that
were sliding during a loading increment continue to slide during reversal. The probes show that
the coupled part of a strain increment, the difference between the recoverable (elastic) increment
and its reversible part, must be considered when partitioning strain increments into elastic and
plastic parts. Small increments of irreversible (and plastic) strain and contact slipping and
frictional dissipation occur for all directions of loading, and an elastic domain, if it exists
at all, is smaller than the strain increment used in the simulations.
