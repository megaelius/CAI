High $T_c$ cuprate superconductors are characterized by two robust features: their strong electronic
correlations and their intrinsic dynamical local lattice instabilities. Focusing on exclusively
that latter, we picture their parent state in form of a quantum vacuum representing an electronic
magma in which bound diamagnetic spin-singlet pairs pop in and out of existence in a Fermi sea of itinerant
electrons. The mechanism behind that resides in the structural incompatibility of two stereo-chemical
configurations Cu$^{\rm II}$O$_4$ and Cu$^{\rm III}$O$_4$ which compose the CuO$_2$ planes.
It leads to spontaneously fluctuating Cu - O - Cu valence bonds which establish a local Feshbach resonance
exchange coupling between bound and unbound electron pairs. The coupling, being the only free parameter
in this scenario, the hole doping of the parent state is monitored by varying the total number of unpaired
and paired electrons, in chemical equilibrium with each other. Upon lowering the temperature to
below a certain $T^*$, bound and unbound electron pairs lock together in a local quantum superposition,
generating transient localized bound electron pairs and a concomitant opening of a pseudo-gap
in the single-particle density of states. At low temperature, this pseudo-gap state transits via
a first order hole doping induced phase transition into a superconducting state in which the localized
transient bound electron pairs get spatially phase correlated. The mechanism driving that transition
is a phase separation between two phases having different relative densities of bound and unbound
electron pairs, which is reminiscent of the physics of $^4$He - $^3$He mixtures.
