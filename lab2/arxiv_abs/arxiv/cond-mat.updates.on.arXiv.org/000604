We analyze the strongly correlated regime of a two-component trapped ultracold fermionic gas in
a synthetic non-Abelian U(2) gauge potential, that consists of both a magnetic field and a homogeneous
spin-orbit coupling. This gauge potential deforms the Landau levels (LLs) with respect to the Abelian
case and exchanges their ordering as a function of the spin-orbit coupling. In view of experimental
realizations, we show that a harmonic potential combined with a Zeeman term, gives rise to an angular
momentum term, which can be used to test the stability of the correlated states obtained through
interactions. We derive the Haldane pseudopotentials (HPs) describing the interspecies contact
interaction within a lowest LL approximation. Unlike ordinary fractional quantum Hall systems
and ultracold bosons with short-range interactions in the same gauge potential, the HPs for sufficiently
strong non-Abelian fields show an unconventional non-monotonic behaviour in the relative angular
momentum. Exploiting this property, we study the occurrence of new incompressible ground states
as a function of the total angular momentum. In the first deformed Landau level (DLL) we obtain Laughlin
and Jain states. Instead, in the second DLL three classes of stabilized states appear: Laughlin
states, a series of intermediate strongly correlated states and finally vortices of the integer
quantum Hall state. Remarkably, in the intermediate regime, the non-monotonic HPs of the second
DLL induce two-particle correlations which are reminiscent of paired states such as the Haffnian
state. Via exact diagonalization in the disk geometry, we compute experimentally relevant observables
like density profiles and correlations, and we study the entanglement spectra as a further tool
to characterize the obtained strongly correlated states.
