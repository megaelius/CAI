An articulation point (AP) in a network is a node whose deletion would split the network component
on which it resides into two or more components. APs are vulnerable spots that play an important role
in network collapse processes, which may result from node failures, attacks or epidemics. Therefore,
the abundance and properties of APs affect the resilience of the network to these collapse scenarios.
We present analytical results for the statistical properties of APs in configuration model networks.
In order to quantify their abundance, we calculate the probability $P(i \in {\rm AP})$, that a random
node, i, in a configuration model network with P(K=k), is an AP. We also obtain the conditional probability
$P(i \in {\rm AP}|k)$ that a random node of degree k is an AP, and find that high degree nodes are more
likely to be APs than low degree nodes. Using Bayes' theorem, we obtain the conditional degree distribution,
$P(K=k|{\rm AP})$, over the set of APs and compare it to P(K=k). We propose a new centrality measure
based on APs: each node can be characterized by its articulation rank, r, which is the number of components
that would be added to the network upon deletion of that node. For nodes which are not APs the articulation
rank is $r=0$, while for APs $r \ge 1$. We obtain a closed form expression for the distribution of articulation
ranks, P(R=r). Configuration model networks often exhibit a coexistence between a giant component
and finite components. To examine the distinct properties of APs on the giant and on the finite components,
we calculate the probabilities presented above separately for the giant and the finite components.
We apply these results to ensembles of configuration model networks with a Poisson, exponential
and power-law degree distributions. The implications of these results are discussed in the context
of common attack scenarios and network dismantling processes.
