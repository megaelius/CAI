Photo-luminescence intermittency (blinking) in semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), a phenomenon
ubiquitous to single-emitters, is generally considered to be temporally random intensity fluctuations
between bright (On) and dark (Off) states. However, individual quantum-dots (QDs) rarely exhibit
such telegraphic signal, and yet, the vast majority of single-NC blinking data are analyzed using
a single fixed threshold, which generates binary trajectories. Further, blinking dynamics can
vary dramatically over NCs in the ensemble, and it is unclear whether the exponents (m) of single-particle
On-/Off-time distributions (P(t)-On/Off), which are used to validate mechanistic models of blinking,
are narrowly distributed or not. Here, we sub-classify an ensemble based on the emissivity of QDs,
and subsequently compare the (sub)ensemble behaviors. To achieve this, we analyzed a large number
(>1000) of intensity trajectories for a model system, Mn+2 doped ZnCdS QDs, which exhibits diverse
blinking dynamics. An intensity histogram dependent thresholding method allowed us to construct
distributions of relevant blinking parameters (such as m). Interestingly, we find that single
QD P(t)-On/Off s follow either truncated power law or power law, and their relative proportion vary
over sub-populations. Our results reveal a remarkable variation in m(On/Off) amongst as well as
within sub-ensembles, which implies multiple blinking mechanisms being operational among various
QDs. We further show that the m(On/Off) obtained via cumulative single-particle P(t)-On/Off is
clearly distinct from the weighted mean value of all single-particle m(On/Off), an evidence for
the lack of ergodicity. Thus, investigation and analyses of a large number of QDs, albeit for a limited
time-span of few decades, is crucial to characterize possible blinking mechanisms and heterogeneity
