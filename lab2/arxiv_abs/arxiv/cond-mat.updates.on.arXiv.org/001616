We present a general methodology to systematically characterize crystalline topological insulating
phases with time reversal symmetry (TRS). In particular, we study windings of Wilson loop spectra
over cuts in the Brillouin zone that are dictated by the underlying lattice symmetries. Our approach
finds a prominent use in elucidating and quantifying the recently proposed "topological quantum
chemistry" (TQC) concept. Namely, it evaluates whether a split of an elementary band representation
(EBR) must lead to a topological phase. After lifting the exhaustive classification of two-band
spinless phases into four-band spinful phases, we additionally extend the classification beyond
the topological sectors adiabatically connected to the inversion symmetric phases. In particular,
we show that in addition to the Fu-Kane-Mele $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, there is an obstructed
$\mathbb{Z}$-type classification protected by crystalline symmetries that accounts for all
nontrivial Wilson loop windings of split EBRs. Then, by systematically embedding all combinatorial
four-band phases into six-band phases, we reveal a generic fragility of higher Wilson loop windings
so that the topology of split EBRs can be trivialized under the addition of extra trivial bands. We
hence conclude that the premises of TQC are unstable under the inclusion of extra bands. More generally,
our work sets the basis of a systematic classification of topological crystalline phases with TRS
by rigorously positioning fragile topological phases as the bridge in crystalline systems between
unstable topology pertaining to few-band models (as captured by e.g. homotopy theory), and stable
topology, i.e. unaffected by the addition of an arbitrary number of bands (as described by e.g. K-theories).
We constructively illustrate all these results for the honeycomb lattice.
