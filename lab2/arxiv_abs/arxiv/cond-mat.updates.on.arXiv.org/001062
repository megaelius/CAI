The influence of the physical mechanisms activated during deformation and annealing on the microstructure
and texture evolution as well as on the mechanical properties in the equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy
alloy (HEA) were investigated. A combination of cold rolling and annealing was used to investigate
the HEA in the deformed, recovered, partially recrystallized, and fully recrystallized states.
Detailed microstructure and texture analysis was performed by electron backscatter diffraction,
transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The mechanical properties were evaluated
using uniaxial tensile testing. A specific focus of this investigation was put on studying the influence
of deformation and annealing twinning on the material behavior. It was substantiated that during
cold rolling deformation, twinning facilitates the transition from the Cu-type to the Brass-type
texture, whereas annealing-twinning leads to a strong modification of the texture formed during
recrystallization. The formation of specific twin orientations and the randomization of the recrystallization
texture were proven by experiments as well as by cellular automaton simulations. During tension
of the cold-rolled and annealed material high work-hardenability was observed. We attribute this
behavior primarily to the dominance of planar dislocation slip and reduced tendency for dynamic
recovery, since deformation twinning was observed to activate only in the non-recrystallized
grains and thus, contributed minimally to the overall plasticity. The correlation between deformation/annealing
twinning and the material behavior was discussed in detail.
