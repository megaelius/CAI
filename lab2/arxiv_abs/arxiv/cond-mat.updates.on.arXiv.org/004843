Universality is a cornerstone of theories of critical phenomena. It is well understood in most systems
especially in the thermodynamic limit. Finite-size systems present additional challenges. Even
in low dimensions, universality of the edge and corner contributions to free energies and response
functions is less well understood. The question arises of how universality is maintained in correction-to-scaling
in systems of the same universality class but with very different corner geometries. 2D geometries
deliver the simplest such examples that can be constructed with and without corners. To investigate
how the presence and absence of corners manifest universality, we analyze the spanning tree generating
function on two finite systems, namely the cobweb and fan networks. We address how universality
can be delivered given that the finite-size cobweb has no corners while the fan has four. To answer,
we appeal to the Ivashkevich-Izmailian-Hu approach which unifies the generating functions of
distinct networks in terms of a single partition function with twisted boundary conditions. This
unified approach shows that the contributions to the individual corner free energies of the fan
network sum to zero so that it precisely matches that of the web. Correspondence in each case with
results established by alternative means for both networks verifies the soundness of the algorithm.
Its range of usefulness is demonstrated by its application to hitherto unsolved problems-namely
the exact asymptotic expansions of the logarithms of the generating functions and the conformal
partition functions for fan and cobweb geometries. Thus, the resolution of a universality puzzle
demonstrates the power of the algorithm and opens up new applications in the future.
