Graphene p-n junctions provide an ideal platform for investigating novel behavior at the boundary
between electronics and optics that arise from massless Dirac fermions, such as whispering gallery
modes and Veselago lensing. Bilayer graphene also hosts Dirac fermions, but they differ from single-layer
graphene charge carriers because they are massive, can be gapped by an applied perpendicular electric
field, and have very different pseudospin selection rules across a p-n junction. Novel phenomena
predicted for these massive Dirac fermions at p-n junctions include anti-Klein tunneling, oscillatory
Zener tunneling, and electron cloaked states. Despite these predictions there has been little
experimental focus on the microscopic spatial behavior of massive Dirac fermions in the presence
of p-n junctions. Here we report the experimental manipulation and characterization of massive
Dirac fermions within bilayer graphene quantum dots defined by circular p-n junctions through
the use of scanning tunneling microscopy-based (STM) methods. Our p-n junctions are created via
a flexible technique that enables realization of exposed quantum dots in bilayer graphene/hBN
heterostructures. These quantum dots exhibit sharp spectroscopic resonances that disperse in
energy as a function of applied gate voltage. Spatial maps of these features show prominent concentric
rings with diameters that can be tuned by an electrostatic gate. This behavior is explained by single-electron
charging of localized states that arise from the quantum confinement of massive Dirac fermions
within our exposed bilayer graphene quantum dots.
