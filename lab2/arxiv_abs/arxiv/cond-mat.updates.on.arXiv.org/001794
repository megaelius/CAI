$\textit{A priori}$ prediction of phase stability of materials is a challenging practice, requiring
knowledge of all energetically-competing structures at formation conditions. Large materials
repositories $\unicode{x2014}$ housing properties of both experimental and hypothetical compounds
$\unicode{x2014}$ offer a path to prediction through the construction of informatics-based,
$\textit{ab-initio}$ phase diagrams. However, limited access to relevant data and software infrastructure
has rendered thermodynamic characterizations largely peripheral, despite their continued success
in dictating synthesizability. Herein, a new module is presented for autonomous thermodynamic
stability analysis implemented within the open-source, $\textit{ab-initio}$ framework AFLOW.
Powered by the AFLUX Search-API, AFLOW-CHULL leverages data of more than 1.8 million compounds
currently characterized in the AFLOW.org repository and can be employed locally from any UNIX-like
computer. The module integrates a range of functionality: the identification of stable phases
and equivalent structures, phase coexistence, measures for robust stability, and determination
of decomposition reactions. As a proof-of-concept, thorough thermodynamic characterizations
have been performed for more than 1,300 binary and ternary systems, enabling the identification
of several candidate phases for synthesis based on their relative stability criterion $\unicode{x2014}$
including 18 promising $C15_{b}$-type structures and two half-Heuslers. In addition to a full
report included herein, an interactive, online web application has been developed showcasing
the results of the analysis, and is located at aflow.org/aflow-chull.
