We report the investigation of full-counting statistics (FCS) of transferred charge and spin in
the transient regime where the connection between central scattering region (quantum dot) and
leads are turned on at $t=0$. A general theoretical formulation for the generating function (GF)
is presented using a nonequilibrium Green's function approach for the quantum dot system. In particular,
we give a detailed derivation on how to use the method of path integral together with nonequilibrium
Green's function technique to obtain the GF of FCS in electron transport systems based on the two-time
quantum measurement scheme. The correct long-time limit of the formalism, the Levitov-Lesovik's
formula, is obtained. This formalism can be generalized to account for spin transport for the system
with noncollinear spin as well as spin-orbit interaction. As an example, we have calculated the
GF of spin-polarized transferred charge, transferred spin, as well as the spin transferred torque
for a magnetic tunneling junction in the transient regime. The GF is compactly expressed by a functional
determinant represented by Green's function and self-energy in the time domain. With this formalism,
FCS in spintronics in the transient regime can be studied. We also extend this formalism to the quantum
point contact system. For numerical results, we calculate the GF and various cumulants of a double
quantum dot system connected by two leads in transient regime. The signature of universal oscillation
of FCS is identified. On top of the global oscillation, local oscillations are found in various cumulants
as a result of the Rabi oscillation. Finally, the influence of the temperature is also examined.
