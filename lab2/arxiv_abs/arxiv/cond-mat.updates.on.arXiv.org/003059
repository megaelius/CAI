The effect of ferroelectric fluctuations on the temperature dependent dielectric constant of
SrTiO$_3$ has been long studied. Those fluctuations have been shown in recent years to be quantum
critical and STO demonstrated to form the archetypal quantum critical paraelectric. The effect
of those same fluctuations on the pressure and temperature dependence of the ferroelectric soft
phonon mode as the system is tuned away from criticality are reported for the first time in this paper.
We show that the mean field approximation is confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, using a self-consistent
model of the quantum critical excitations including coupling to the volume strain and without adjustable
parameters, we determine logarithmic corrections that would be observable only very close to the
quantum critical point. Thus, the mean-field character of the pressure dependence is much more
robust to the fluctuations than is the temperature dependence. We predict stronger corrections
for lower dimensionalities however. The same calculation confirms that the Lydanne-Sachs-Teller
relation is valid over the whole pressure and temperature range considered. Therefore, the measured
dielectric constant can be used to extract the frequency of the soft mode down to 1.5 K and up to 20 kbar
of applied pressure. The soft mode is observed to stiffen further, raising the low-temperature
energy gap and returning towards the expected shallow temperature dependence of an optical mode.
This behavior is consistent with the existence of a quantum critical point on the pressure-temperature
phase diagram of STO, which applied pressure tunes the system away from. This work represents the
first experimental measurement of the stiffening of a soft phonon mode as a system is tuned away from
criticality, a potentially universal phenomenon across a variety of phase transitions and systems
in condensed matter physics.
