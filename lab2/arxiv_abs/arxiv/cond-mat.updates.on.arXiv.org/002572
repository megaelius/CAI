The switching behavior of fast ion conducting AgI-Ag2O-MoO3 glasses has been investigated thoroughly,
over a wide range of compositions within the glass forming region, proportioning a balance between
glass matrix former (MoO3) and glass matrix expander (AgI), in order to understand the switching
mechanism of bulk samples with inert electrode. The ion transport, the agility to reach the threshold
voltage (Vth), Vth-composition (x) profile and thickness dependence of Vth have been explained
in the light of Mott-Gurney model for electric field driven thermally activated ion hopping. A feature
of alteration in memory behavior from reversible to irreversible, due to a change in electrode type
from active to passive has been observed and discussed. Being a decoupled system, the Vth-x profile
exhibits a seemingly scattered nature while the glass transition temperature (Tg)-x profile increases
monotonically, indicating a growing network connectivity. These two profiles together narrow
down the composition region where the most thermally stable, fast switching performing samples,
with a minimum power loss lie. During switching, a metallic filament forms between the two electrodes.
Raman and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies find no traces of molybdenum, oxygen and
electrode material in the filament. Scanning electron microscopic images show a bubble formation
in the vicinity of anode-electrolyte interface which is analogous to oxidation reaction; however,
no evidence of an anionic transport has been found. This in turns helps us to understand the corrosion
mechanism in the glass matrix due to the electrochemical process. Overall, the present work aims
to understand some crucial issues regarding the memory behavior of AgI-Ag2O-MoO3 glasses to enable
us to exploit the material for non-volatile memory applications.
