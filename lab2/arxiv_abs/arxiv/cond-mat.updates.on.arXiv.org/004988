In this paper, we introduce the notion of an algebraic higher symmetry, which is beyond higher group.
We show that an algebraic higher symmetry in a bosonic system in $n$-dimensional space is characterized
and classified by a local fusion $n$-category. We also show that a bosonic system with an algebraic
higher symmetry can be viewed as a boundary of a bosonic topological order in one-higher dimension.
This implies that the system actually has a bigger symmetry, called the categorical symmetry, which
is defined by the categorical description of the one-higher dimensional bulk. This provides a holographic
and entanglement view of symmetries. A categorical symmetry is characterized by a non-degenerate
braided fusion $n$-category (describing excitations in an anomaly-free bosonic topological
order in one-higher dimension). For a system with a categorical symmetry, its gapped state must
spontaneously break part (not all) of the symmetry, and the state with the full symmetry must be gapless.
The holographic point of view leads to (1) the gauging of the algebraic higher symmetry; (2) the classification
of anomalies for an algebraic higher symmetry; (3) the duality relations between systems with different
(potentially anomalous) algebraic higher symmetries, or between systems with different sets
of low energy excitations; (4) the classification of gapped liquid phases for bosonic systems with
a categorical symmetry, as gapped boundaries of a topological order in one higher dimension that
characterizes the categorical symmetry. This classification includes symmetry protected trivial
(SPT) orders and symmetry enriched topological orders (SET) with an algebraic higher symmetry.
