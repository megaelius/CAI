In this PhD thesis we investigate some properties of one-dimensional quantum systems, focusing
on two important aspects of integrable models: Their entanglement properties at equilibrium and
their dynamical correlators after a quantum quench. The first part of the thesis will therefore
be devoted to the study of the entanglement entropy in one-dimensional integrable systems, with
a special focus on the XYZ spin-1/2 chain, which, in addition to being integrable, is also an interacting
theory with non perturbative solutions. We derive its bipartite Renyi entropies in the thermodynamic
limit and its behaviour in different phases and for different values of the mass-gap is analysed,
both analytically and numerically. In particular it is worth mentioning that the numerical analysis
of the entropies of the XYZ model presented in this dissertation has never been published in literature.
In the second part of the thesis we study the dynamics of correlators after a quantum quench, preparing
the system in a squeezed coherent initial state. The emphasis will be on the Transverse Field Ising
Chain and the O(3) non-linear sigma model, the latter studied by means of the semi-classical theory,
the former by a form-factor approach. Moreover in the last chapter we outline a general result about
the dynamics of correlation functions of local observables after a quantum quench. In particular
we show that if there are not long-range interactions in the final Hamiltonian, then the dynamics
of the model at long times (non equal- time correlations) is described by the same statistical ensemble
that describes its statical properties (equal-time correlations). For the Transverse Field Ising
Chain this result means that its dynamics is described by a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble.
