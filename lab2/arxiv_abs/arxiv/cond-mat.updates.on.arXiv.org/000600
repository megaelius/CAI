We study spreading processes of initially localized excitations in one-dimensional disordered
granular crystals. We thereby investigate localization phenomena in strongly nonlinear systems,
which we demonstrate to be fundamentally different from localization in linear and weakly nonlinear
systems. We conduct a thorough comparison of wave dynamics in chains with three different types
of disorder: an uncorrelated (Anderson-like) disorder and two types of correlated disorders (which
are produced by random dimer arrangements). For all three types of disorder, the long-time asymptotic
behavior of the second moment $\tilde{m}_2$ and the inverse participation ratio $P^{-1}$ satisfy
the following scaling relations: $\tilde{m}_2\sim t^{\gamma}$ and $P^{-1}\sim t^{-\eta}$.
For the Anderson-like uncorrelated disorder, we find a transition from subdiffusive ($\gamma<1$)
to superdiffusive ($\gamma>1$) dynamics that depends on the amount of precompression in the
chain. By contrast, for the correlated disorders, we find that the dynamics is superdiffusive for
all precompression levels that we consider. Additionally, for strong precompression, the inverse
participation ratio decreases slowly (with $\eta<0.1$) for all three types of disorder, and
the dynamics leads to a partial localization around the leading edge of the wave. This localization
phenomenon does not occur in the sonic-vacuum regime, which yields the surprising result that the
energy is no longer contained in strongly nonlinear waves but instead is spread across many sites.
In this regime, the exponents are very similar (roughly $\gamma\approx 1.7$ and $\eta\approx 1$)
for all three types of disorder.
