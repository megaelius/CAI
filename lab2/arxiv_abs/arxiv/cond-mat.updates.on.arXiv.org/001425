We present a general theory of thermal motion in disordered fluids, introducing a new type of random
walk model with a sojourn time distribution dependent on hidden variables. This model encompasses
Montroll and Weiss's continuous-time random walk (CTRW) model and the more recent, Chubinsky and
Slater's stochastic diffusivity (SD) model. In the hydrodynamic limit, our model yields a new transport
equation, which provides a unified, quantitative explanation of the anomalous transport dynamics
commonly observed in various disordered fluids, including supercooled water, dense hard-disc
fluids, and polymer fluids. We find that the long-time limit value of the product between the mean-square
displacement (MSD) and the non-Gaussian parameter (NGP) serves as a useful measure of disorder.
This measure is decomposable into extrinsic disorder, originating from environment-induced
fluctuation in transport dynamics, and intrinsic disorder, originating from non-Fickian mean
transport dynamics. Intrinsic disorder causes the MSD of disordered fluids to deviate from the
prediction of the simple diffusion model or the SD model. Meanwhile, extrinsic disorder causes
the NGP of disordered fluids to deviate from the CTRW model's prediction. By analyzing the MSD and
NGP of supercooled water and dense hard-disc fluids, we find that extrinsic disorder is far more
sensitive to temperature and density than intrinsic disorder. We also find that the NGP alone can
serve as an ergodicity metric of transport systems; it vanishes for ergodic systems at long times,
universally following inverse-time relaxation, but remains finite for non-ergodic systems.
This work sets a new foundation for quantitative understanding of transport and transport-coupled
processes in complex disordered media.
