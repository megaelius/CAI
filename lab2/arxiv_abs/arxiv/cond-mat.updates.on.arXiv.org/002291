In the resonant tunneling regime sequential processes dominate single electron transport through
quantum dots or molecules that are weakly coupled to macroscopic electrodes. In the Coulomb blockade
regime, however, cotunneling processes dominate. Cotunneling is an inherently quantum phenomenon
and thus gives rise to interesting observations, such as an increase in the current shot noise. Since
cotunneling processes are inherently fast compared to the sequential processes, it is of interest
to examine the short time behaviour of systems where cotunneling plays a role, and whether these
systems display nonrenewal statistics. We consider three questions in this paper. Given that an
electron has tunneled from the source to the drain via a cotunneling or sequential process, what
is the waiting time until another electron cotunnels from the source to the drain? What are the statistical
properties of these waiting time intervals? How does cotunneling affect the statistical properties
of a system with strong inelastic electron-electron interactions? In answering these questions,
we extend the existing formalism for waiting time distributions in single electron transport to
include cotunneling processes via an $n$-resolved Markovian master equation. We demonstrate
that for a single resonant level the analytic waiting time distribution including cotunneling
processes yields information on individual tunneling amplitudes. For both a SRL and an Anderson
impurity deep in the Coulomb blockade there is a nonzero probability for two electrons to cotunnel
to the drain with zero waiting time inbetween. Furthermore, we show that at high voltages cotunneling
processes slightly modify the nonrenewal behaviour of an Anderson impurity with a strong inelastic
electron-electron interaction.
