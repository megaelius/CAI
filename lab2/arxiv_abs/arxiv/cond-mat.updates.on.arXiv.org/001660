Improving the figure of merit $zT$ of thermoelectric materials requires simultaneously a high
power factor and low thermal conductivity. An effective approach for increasing the power factor
is to align the band extremum and achieve high band degeneracy ($\geq$ 12) near the Fermi level as
realized in PbTe [\textcolor{blue}{Pei et. al. \textit{Nature} 473, 66 (2010)}], which usually
relies on band structure engineering, e.g., chemical doping and strain. However, very few materials
could achieve such a high band degeneracy without heavy doping or suffering impractical strain.
By employing state-of-the-art first-principles methods with direct computation of phonon and
carrier lifetime, we demonstrate that two new full-Heusler compounds Li$_2$TlBi and Li$_2$InBi,
possessing a PbTe-like electronic structure, show exceptionally high power factors ($\sim$ 20
mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ at 300 K) and low lattice thermal conductivities (2.36 and 1.55 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$)
at room temperature. The Tl$^{+}$Bi$^{3-}$ (In$^{+}$Bi$^{3-}$) sublattice forms a rock-salt
structure, and the additional two valence electrons from Li atoms essentially make these compounds
isovalent with Pb$^{2+}$Te$^{2-}$. The larger rock-salt sublattice of TlBi (InBi) shifts the
valence band maximum from L point to the middle of the $\Sigma$ line, increasing the band degeneracy
from fourfold to twelvefold. On the other hand, resonance bond in the PbTe-like sublattice and soft
Tl-Bi (In-Bi) bonding interaction is responsible for intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivities.
Our results present a novel strategy of designing high-performance thermoelectric materials.
