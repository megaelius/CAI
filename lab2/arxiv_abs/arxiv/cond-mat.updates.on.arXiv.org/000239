The symmetry of the wave function describing the Cooper pairs is one of the most fundamental quantities
in a superconductor but its measurement in the iron-based superconductors has proved to be very
difficult. The complex multi-band nature of these materials makes the interplay of superconductivity
with spin and orbital dynamics very intriguing, leading to very material dependent magnetic excitations,
and pairing symmetries. Here we use first-principles many-body method, including ab initio determined
two-particle vertex function, to study the spin dynamics and superconducting pairing symmetry
in a large number of iron-based superconductors. In iron compounds with high transition temperature,
we find both the dispersive high-energy spin excitations, and very strong low energy commensurate
or nearly commensurate spin response, suggesting that these low energy spin excitations play the
dominate role in cooper pairing. We find three closely competing types of pairing symmetries, which
take a very simple form in the space of active iron $3d$ orbitals, and differ only in the relative quantum
mechanical phase of the $xz$, $yz$ and $xy$ orbital contributions. The extensively discussed s$^{+-}$
symmetry appears when contributions from all orbitals have equal sign, while the opposite sign
in $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals leads to the $d$ wave symmetry. A novel orbital antiphase $s^{+-}$ symmetry
emerges when $xy$ orbital has opposite sign to $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals. We propose that this orbital-antiphase
pairing symmetry explains the puzzling variation of the experimentally observed superconducting
gaps on all the Fermi surfaces of LiFeAs. This novel symmetry of the order parameter may be realized
in other iron superconductors.
