A region of two-dimensional space has been filled randomly with large number of growing circular
discs allowing only a `slight' overlapping among them just before their growth stop. More specifically,
each disc grows from a nucleation center that is selected at a random location within the uncovered
region. The growth rate $\delta$ is a continuously tunable parameter of the problem which assumes
a specific value while a particular pattern of discs is generated. When a growing disc overlaps for
the first time with at least another disc, it's growth is stopped and is said to be `frozen'. In this
paper we study the percolation properties of the set of frozen discs. Using numerical simulations
we present evidence for the following: (i) The Order Parameter appears to jump discontinuously
at a certain critical value of the area coverage; (ii) the width of the window of the area coverage
needed to observe a macroscopic jump in the Order Parameter tends to vanish as $\delta \to 0$ and on
the contrary (iii) the cluster size distribution has a power law decaying functional form. While
the first two results are the signatures of a discontinuous transition, the third result is indicative
of a continuous transition. Therefore we refer this transition as a sharp but continuous transition
similar to what has been observed in the recently introduced Achlioptas process of Explosive Percolation.
It is also observed that in the limit of $\delta \to 0$, the critical area coverage at the transition
point tends to unity, implying the limiting pattern is space-filling. In this limit, the fractal
dimension of the pore space at the percolation point has been estimated to be $1.42(10)$ and the contact
network of the disc assembly is found to be a scale-free network.
