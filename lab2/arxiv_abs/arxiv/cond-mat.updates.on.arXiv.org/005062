We investigate propagation of a local impact in the one-dimensional $XY$ model with the anisotropy
$\gamma$ in a magnetic field $h$. Applying a local and instantaneous unitary operation to the ground
state, we numerically observe a light-cone-like propagation of the magnetization in the $z$ direction.
In particular, we focus on the parameter region $0\leq\gamma\leq1$ and $0\leq h \leq2$ of the model.
The dynamics in the light-cone region varies depending on the parameters. By combining numerical
calculation with an asymptotic analysis, we find the following: (i) for $h\geq1-\gamma^{2}$ except
for the case on the line $h=1$ with $0<\gamma<\sqrt{3}/2$, a wave front propagates with the maximum
group velocity of quasiparticles, except for the case $\gamma=1$ and $0<h<1$, in which there is
no clear wave front; (ii) for $h<1-\gamma ^{2}$ as well as on the line $h=1$ with $0<\gamma<\sqrt{3}/2$,
a second wave front appears owing to multiple inflection points of the dispersion relation of quasiparticles.
The propagation velocity of this second wave front is given by the amplitude of the group velocity
at the second local extrema; (iii) for $h=1-\gamma^{2}$, the velocity of the second wave front vanishes,
and as a result, the magnetization change forms a ridge at the impacted site. We find that the height
of the wave front decays in a power law in time $t$ with various exponents depending on the model parameters,
by an asymptotic analysis. We find a power-law decay $t^{-2/3}$ on the wave front except for the line
$h=1$, on which the decay can be given by either $\sim t^{-3/5}$ or $\sim t^{-1}$. For $h=1-\gamma^{2}$,
the magnetization at the impacted site relaxes in a power law $t^{-1/2}$ in time $t$ as opposed to
the relaxation according to the power law $t^{-1}$ in other cases.
