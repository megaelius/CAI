Ferromagnetism and superconductivity typically compete with each other since the internal magnetic
field generated in a magnet suppresses the formation of spin-singlet Cooper pairs in conventional
superconductors. Only a handful of ferromagnetic superconductors are known in heavy fermion systems,
where many-body electron interactions promoted by the narrow energy bands play a key role in stabilizing
these emergent states. Recently, interaction-driven superconductivity and ferromagnetism
have been demonstrated as separate phenomena in different density regimes of flat bands enabled
by graphene moire superlattices. Combining superconductivity and magnetism in a single ground
state may lead to more exotic quantum phases. Here, employing van der Waals heterostructures of
twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG), we realize a flat electron band that is tunable by perpendicular
electric fields. Similar to the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene, TDBG exhibits energy gaps
at the half and quarter filled flat bands, indicating the emergence of correlated insulating states.
We find that the gaps of these insulating states increase with in-plane magnetic field, suggesting
a ferromagnetic order. Upon doping the ferromagnetic half-filled insulator, superconductivity
emerges with a critical temperature controlled by both density and electric fields. We observe
that the in-plane magnetic field enhances the superconductivity in the low field regime, suggesting
spin-polarized electron pairing. Spin-polarized superconducting states discovered in TDBG
provide a new route to engineering interaction-driven topological superconductivity.
