Topological quantum matter is characterized by non-trivial global invariants of the bulk which
induce gapless electronic states at its boundaries. A case in point are two-dimensional topological
insulators (2D-TI) which host one-dimensional (1D) conducting helical edge states protected
by time-reversal symmetry (TRS) against single-particle backscattering (SPB). However, as two-particle
scattering is not forbidden by TRS [1], the existence of electronic interactions at the edge and
their notoriously strong impact on 1D states may lead to an intriguing interplay between topology
and electronic correlations. In particular, it is directly relevant to the question in which parameter
regime the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) expected for 2D-TIs becomes obscured by these correlation
effects that prevail at low temperatures [2]. Here we study the problem on bismuthene on SiC(0001)
which has recently been synthesized and proposed to be a candidate material for a room-temperature
QSHE [3]. By utilizing the accessibility of this monolayer-substrate system on atomic length scales
by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) we observe metallic edge channels which
display 1D electronic correlation effects. Specifically, we prove the correspondence with a Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquid (TLL), and, based on the observed universal scaling of the differential tunneling conductivity
(dI/dV), we derive a TLL parameter K reflecting intermediate electronic interaction strength
in the edge states of bismuthene. This establishes the first spectroscopic identification of 1D
electronic correlation effects in the topological edge states of a 2D-TI.
