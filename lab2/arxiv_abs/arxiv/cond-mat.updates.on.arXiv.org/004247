We consider the electronic spectrum near $M=(\pi,\pi)$ in the nematic phase of FeSe ($T<T_{{\rm
nem}}$) and make a detailed comparison with recent ARPES and STM experiments. Our main focus is the
unexpected temperature dependence of the excitations at the $M$ point. These have been identified
as having $xz$ and $yz$ orbital character well below $T_{{\rm nem}}$, but remain split at $T>T_{{\rm
nem}}$, in apparent contradiction to the fact that in the tetragonal phase the $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals
are degenerate. Here we present two scenarios which can describe the data. In both scenarios, hybridization
terms present in the tetragonal phase leads to an orbital transmutation, a change in the dominant
orbital character of some of the bands, between $T > T_{\rm nem}$ and $T \ll T_{\rm nem}$. The first
scenario relies on the spin-orbit coupling at the $M$ point. We show that a finite spin-orbit coupling
gives rise to orbital transmutation, in which one of the modes, identified as $xz$ ($yz)$ at $T \ll
T_{{\rm nem}}$, becomes predominantly $xy$ at $T > T_{{\rm nem}}$ and hence does not merge with the
predominantly $yz$ ($xz$) mode. The second scenario, complementary to the first, takes into consideration
the fact that both ARPES and STM are surface probes. In the bulk, a direct hybridization between the
$xz$ and $yz$ orbitals is not allowed at the $M$ point, however, it is permitted on the surface. In
the presence of a direct $xz/yz$ hybridization, the orbital character of the $xz/yz$ modes changes
from pure $xz$ and pure $yz$ at $T \ll T_{{\rm nem}}$ to $xz \pm yz$ at $T > T_{{\rm nem}}$, i.e., the
two modes again have mono-orbital character at low $T$, but do not merge at $T_{{\rm nem}}$. We discuss
how these scenarios can be distinguished in polarized ARPES experiments.
