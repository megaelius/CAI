For disordered Heisenberg systems with small single ion anisotropy, two spin glass transitions
below the long range ordered phase transition temperature has been predicted theoretically for
compositions close to the percolation threshold. Experimental verification of these predictions
is still controversial for conventional spin glasses. We show that multiferroic spin glass systems
can provide a unique platform for verifying these theoretical predictions via a study of change
in magnetoelastic and magnetoelectric couplings, obtained from an analysis of diffraction data,
at the spin glass transition temperatures. Results of macroscopic and microscopic (x-ray and neutron
scattering) measurements are presented on disordered BiFeO3, a canonical Heisenberg system with
small single ion anisotropy, which reveal appearance of two spin glass phases SG1 and SG2 in coexistence
with the LRO phase below the A-T and G-T lines. It is shown that the temperature dependence of the integrated
intensity of the antiferromagnetic peak shows dips with respect to the Brillouin function behaviour
around the SG1 and SG2 transition temperatures. The ferroelectric polarisation changes significantly
at the two spin glass transition temperatures. These results, obtained using microscopic techniques,
clearly demonstrate that the SG1 and SG2 transitions occur on the same magnetic sublattice and are
intrinsic to the system. We also construct a phase diagram showing all the magnetic phases in BF-xBT
system. While our results on the two spin glass transitions support the theoretical predictions,
it also raises several open questions which need to be addressed by revisiting the existing theories
of spin glass transitions by taking into account the effect of magnetoelastic and magnetoelectric
couplings as well as electromagnons.
