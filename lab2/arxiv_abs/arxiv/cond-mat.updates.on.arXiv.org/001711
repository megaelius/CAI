We discuss the $SU(3)/[U(1)\times U(1)]$ nonlinear sigma model in 1+1D and, more broadly, its linearized
counterparts. Such theories can be expressed as $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories and therefore
allow for two topological $\theta$-angles. These models provide a field theoretic description
of the $SU(3)$ chains. We show that, for particular values of $\theta$-angles, a global symmetry
group of such systems has a 't Hooft anomaly, which manifests itself as an inability to gauge the global
symmetry group. By applying anomaly matching, the ground-state properties can be severely constrained.
The anomaly matching is an avatar of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem for the spin chain from
which the field theory descends, and it forbids a trivially gapped ground state for particular $\theta$-angles.
We generalize the statement of the LSM theorem and show that 't Hooft anomalies persist even under
perturbations which break the spin-symmetry down to the discrete subgroup $\mathbb Z_3\times\mathbb
Z_3\subset SU(3)/\mathbb Z_3$. In addition the model can further be constrained by applying global
inconsistency matching, which indicates the presence of a phase transition between different
regions of $\theta$-angles. We use these constraints to give possible scenarios of the phase diagram.
We also argue that at the special points of the phase diagram the anomalies are matched by the $SU(3)$
Wess-Zumino-Witten model. We generalize the discussion to the $SU(N)/U(1)^{N-1}$ nonlinear
sigma models as well as the 't Hooft anomaly of the $SU(N)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model, and show that
they match. Finally the $(2+1)$-dimensional extension is considered briefly, and we show that
it has various 't Hooft anomalies leading to nontrivial consequences.
