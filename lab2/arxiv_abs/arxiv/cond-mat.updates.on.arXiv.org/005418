We consider a massive particle driven with a constant force in a periodic potential and subjected
to a dissipative friction. As a function of the drive and damping, the phase diagram of this paradigmatic
model is well known to present a pinned, a sliding, and a bistable regime separated by three distinct
bifurcation lines. In physical terms, the average velocity $v$ of the particle is nonzero only if
either (i) the driving force is large enough to remove any stable point, forcing the particle to slide,
or (ii) there are local minima but the damping is small enough, below a critical damping, for the inertia
to allow the particle to cross barriers and follow a limit cycle; this regime is bistable and whether
$v > 0$ or $v = 0$ depends on the initial state. In this paper, we focus on the asymptotes of the critical
line separating the bistable and the pinned regimes. First, we study its behavior near the "triple
point" where the pinned, the bistable, and the sliding dynamical regimes meet. Just below the critical
damping we uncover a critical regime, where the line approaches the triple point following a power-law
behavior. We show that its exponent is controlled by the normal form of the tilted potential close
to its critical force. Second, in the opposite regime of very low damping, we revisit existing results
by providing a simple method to determine analytically the exact behavior of the line in the case
of a generic potential. The analytical estimates, accurately confirmed numerically, are obtained
by exploiting exact soliton solutions describing the orbit in a modified tilted potential which
can be mapped to the original tilted washboard potential. Our methods and results are particularly
useful for an accurate description of underdamped nonuniform oscillators driven near their triple
point.
