The $q$-voter model with independence is investigated on multiplex networks with fully overlapping
layers in the form of various complex networks corresponding to different levels of social influence.
Detailed studies are performed for the model on multiplex networks with two layers with identical
degree distributions, obeying the LOCAL&AND and GLOBAL&AND spin update rules differing by the
way in which the $q$-lobbies of neighbors within different layers exert their joint influence on
the opinion of a given agent. Homogeneous pair approximation is derived for a general case of a two-state
spin model on a multiplex network and its predictions are compared with results of Monte Carlo simulations
of the above-mentioned $q$-voter model with independence for a broad range of parameters. As the
parameter controlling the level of agents' independence is changed ferromagnetic phase transition
occurs which can be first- or second-order, depending on the size of the lobby $q$. Details of this
transition, e.g., position of the critical points, depend on the topology and other features, e.g.,
the mean degree of nodes of the layers. If the mean degree of nodes in the layers is substantially larger
than the size of the $q$-lobby good agreement is obtained between numerical results and theoretical
predictions based on the homogeneous pair approximation concerning the order and details of the
ferromagnetic transition. In the case of the model on multiplex networks with layers in the form
of homogeneous Erdo\"s-R\'enyi and random regular graphs as well as weakly heterogeneous scale-free
networks this agreement is quantitative, while in the case of layers in the form of strongly heterogeneous
scale-free networks it is only qualitative. If the mean degree of nodes is small and comparable with
$q$ predictions of the homogeneous PA are in general even qualitatively wrong.
