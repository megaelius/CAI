Atomistic spin models have found enormous success in addressing the properties of magnetic materials,
grounded on the identification of the relevant underlying magnetic interactions. The huge development
in the field of magnetic skyrmions and other noncollinear magnetic structures is largely due to
our understanding of the chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Recently, various works
have proposed new types of chiral interactions, with seemingly different forms, but the big picture
is still missing. Here, we present a systematic construction of a generalized spin model containing
isotropic and chiral multi-site interactions. These are motivated by a microscopic model that
incorporates local spin moments and the spin-orbit interaction, and their symmetry properties
are established. We show that the chiral interactions arise solely from the spin-orbit interaction
and that the multi-site interactions do not have to follow Moriya's rules, unlike the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
and chiral biquadratic interactions. The chiral multi-site interactions do not vanish due to inversion
symmetry, and comply with a generalized Moriya rule: If all sites connected by the interaction lie
in the same mirror plane, the chiral interaction vector must be perpendicular to this plane. We then
illustrate our theoretical considerations with density functional theory calculations for prototypical
magnetic systems. These are triangular trimers built out of Cr, Mn, Fe and Co adatoms on the Re(0001),
Pt(111) and Au(111) surfaces, for which $C_\mathrm{3v}$ symmetry applies, and Cr and Fe square
tetramers on Pt(001) with $C_\mathrm{4v}$ symmetry. The multi-site interactions are substantial
in magnitude and cannot be neglected when comparing the energy of different magnetic structures.
Finally, we discuss the recent literature in light of our findings, and clarify several unclear
or confusing points.
