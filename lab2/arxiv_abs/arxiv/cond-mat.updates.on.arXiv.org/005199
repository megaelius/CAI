The introduction of graphene-related materials (GRMs) in carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRP)
has been proved to enhance their mechanical and electrical properties. However, methodologies
to produce the 3-phase materials (multiscale composites) at an industrial scale and in an efficient
manner are still lacking. In this paper, multiscale CFRP composites containing different GRMs
have been manufactured following standard procedures currently used in the aerospace industry
with the aim to evaluate its potential application. Graphite nanoplateletelets (GNPs), in situ
exfoliated graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been dispersed into an epoxy
resin to subsequently impregnate aeronautical grade carbon fibre tape. The resulting prepregs
have been used for manufacturing laminates by hand lay-up and autoclave curing at 180 {\deg}C. Abroad
characterization campaign has been carried out to understand the behaviour of the different multiscale
laminates manufactured. The degree of cure, glass transition temperature and degradation temperature
have been evaluated by thermal evolution techniques. Similarly, their mechanical properties
(tensile, flexural, in-plane shear, interlaminar shear and mode I interlaminar fracture toughness)
have been analysed together with their electrical conductivity. The manufacturing process resulted
appropriated for producing three-phase laminates and their quality was as good as in conventional
CFRPs. The addition ofGOand rGO resulted in an enhancement of the in-plane shear properties and
delamination resistance while the addition ofGNPimproved the electrical conductivity.
