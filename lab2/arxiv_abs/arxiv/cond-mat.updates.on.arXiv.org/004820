Birds are known for their extremely acute sense of vision. The very peculiar structural distribution
of five different types of cones in the retina underlies this exquisite ability to sample light.
It was recently found that each cone population as well as their total population display a disordered
pattern in which long wave-length density fluctuations vanish. This property, known as hyperuniformity
is also present in perfect crystals. In situations like the avian retina in which both the global
structure and that of each component display hyperuniformity, the system is said to be multi-hyperuniform.
In this work, we aim at devising a minimal statistical-mechanical model that can reproduce the main
features of the spatial distribution of photoreceptors in avian retina, namely the presence of
disorder, multi-hyperuniformity and local hetero-coordination. This last feature is key to avoid
local clustering of the same type of photoreceptors, an undesirable feature for the efficient sampling
of light. For this purpose we formulate a simple model that definitively exhibits the required structural
properties, namely an equimolar three-component mixture (one component to sample each primary
color, red, green, and blue) of non-additive hard disks to which a long-range logarithmic repulsion
is added between like particles. A Voronoi analysis of our idealized system of photoreceptors shows
that the space-filling Voronoi polygons interestingly display a rather uniform area distribution,
symmetrically centered around that of a regular lattice, a structural property also found in human
retina. Disordered multi-hyperuniformity offers an alternative to generate photoreceptor patterns
with minimal long-range concentration and density fluctuations. This is the key to overcome the
difficulties in devising an efficient visual system in which crystal-like order is absent.
