Coalescence of tiny-sized particles into a large-sized particle has been an overlooked phenomenon
since long. Present study discloses developing tiny-sized particles and their coalescence into
large-sized particles under varying concentration of gold precursor in locally built setup namely,
pulse-based electronphoton-solution interface process. Under the fixed ratio of pulse OFF to
ON time, tiny-sized particles in different sizes develop depending on the amount of gold precursor.
Packets of nano shape energy bind gold atoms into tiny-sized particles depending on the scheme of
monolayer assembly at solution surface. Between precursor concentration 0.07 mM to 0.90 mM, many
tiny-sized particles are developed in joint triangular-shape, they are in the large number at 0.30
mM and at 0.60 mM. On separation of joint triangular-shaped tiny particles into two under the exerting
force along perturbed axis, each has the shape of an equilateral triangular-shape. Their atoms
of one-dimensional arrays elongate under the exerting force of opposite poles converting into
structures of smooth elements. Such tiny-sized particles pack to assemble structures of smooth
elements where they terminate the exerting forces of surface format at central point of light glow
resulting into develop geometric anisotropic particles. At 0.05 mM and 1.20 mM, to a large extent,
tiny-sized particles do not develop in a triangular-shape where packings deal mixed behavior of
exerting forces for them resulting into develop distorted particles. Photons reflected at the
surface of geometric anisotropic particles validate the order of structural regularity, which
is not the case of distorted particles. Under different argon flow rate, morphology and structure
of particles alter to some extent. This study clarifies under what concentration of gold, a certain
sized and shaped particle is developed.
