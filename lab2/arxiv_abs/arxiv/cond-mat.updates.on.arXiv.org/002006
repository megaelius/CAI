In this paper, we report the synthesis of reduced Graphene Oxide-Tin Oxide nanocomposite and the
effectiveness of this composite in decolorizing and degrading Methylene Blue (MB). Tin Oxide was
prepared by liquid phase co-precipitation method and reduced Graphene Oxide-Tin Oxide (rGO-SnO2)
nanocomposite was prepared by solution mixing method. Tin Oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have been
ardently investigated as photocatalyst for water purification and environment decontamination
but the photon generated electron and hole pair (EHP) recombination is one of the limiting factors.
Reduced Graphene Oxide-Tin Oxide (rGO-SnO2) nanocomposite is very efficient to overcome this
limitation for photocatalytic application. The as-synthesized GO, SnO2, GO-SnO2, rGO and rGO-SnO2
nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy
Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. The XRD data confirms
the sharp peak at 2Theta=10.44 degree corresponding to (002) reflection of GO with interlayer d
spacing of 8.46 Angstrom indication of successful preparation of GO by oxidation of graphite. Moreover,
the diffraction peak shifts from 2Theta=10.44 degree to 2Theta=23.31 degree confirm successful
synthesis of rGO as well. SEM image shows the morphology of all the photocatalysts. EDX studies are
carried out to investigate the elemental composition and purity of the sample by giving all the elements
present in the nanomaterials. The presence of functional groups was identified by FTIR. The rGO-SnO2
(1:10) nanocomposite shows an efficient photodegradation efficiency of ~94% and ~95% under natural
sunlight and UV light irradiation respectively for Methylene Blue (MB) within 15 minutes. Furthermore,
the degradation kinetics of MB is also studied in this paper as well.
