We report experimental studies of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of resistivity
and dc magnetic susceptibility and the temperature dependence of zero field heat capacity in a Ti$_{0.6}$V$_{0.4}$
alloy. The temperature dependence of the normal state dc magnetic susceptibility in this Ti$_{0.6}$V$_{0.4}$
alloy shows T$^2$lnT behavior. The temperature dependence of resistivity follows a T$^2$ behaviour
in the range 20-50 K. On the other hand, a term $T^3$ lnT is needed in the expression containing the
electronic and lattice heat capacities to explain the temperature dependence of heat capacity
at temperatures where $T^2$ dependence of resistivity is observed. Such temperature dependence
of dc magnetic susceptibility, resistivity and heat capacity are indications of the presence of
spin-fluctuations in the system. Further experimental evidence for the spin fluctuations is obtained
in the form of a negative value of T$^5$ term in the temperature dependence of resistivity. The influence
of spin-fluctuations on the superconducting properties of Ti$_{0.6}$V$_{0.4}$ is discussed
in detail. We show from our analysis of resistivity and the susceptibility in normal and superconducting
states that the spin fluctuations present in Ti$_{0.6}$V$_{0.4}$ alloy are itinerant in nature.
There is some evidence of the existence of preformed Cooper-pairs in the temperature range well
above the superconducting transition temperature. Our study indicates that the interesting correlations
between spin-fluctuations and superconductivity may actually be quite widespread amongst the
superconducting materials, and not necessarily be confined only to certain classes of exotic compounds.
