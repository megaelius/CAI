It is commonly believed that the significant energy saving advantages are belonged to the logic
circuits which operate at low temperature as less enegy is needed for cooling them to the treshold
temperature after operation. Also, nanoscale thermal management, efficient energy usage in nanoscale
and especially thermal optimization are the most challenging issues, while dealing with the new
generation of transistors as the miniaturizing unlimitedly the silicon channels of the transistors
has resulted in an increase in the energy consumption of computers and the leakage currents. In this
paper, the non-Fourier thermal attitudes of well-known two-dimensional crystalline materials
of graphene, blue phosphorene, germanene, silicene and MoS$_2$ as the silicon channels replacements
are studied by using the phonon Monte-Carlo method. We show that graphene and blue phosphorene have
the least maximum temperature, representer of the reliability of the transistors, among the all
five investigated nano-channels during the Monte-Cralo simulation. The established hotspots
of these two materials are always cooler, not reaching the temperature threshold level, and they
lose the heat much faster as the heat generation zone is switched off. The obtained results considered
along with the electrical disadvantages of the graphene layer, suggests the blue phosphorene as
the more thermally appropriate and optimal choice for the silicon channel replacement in new designed
field effect transistors. That is to say that the limit of the energy and economic cost of the producing
the advanced blue phosphorene chips meets the value of the product for the computing enterprise.
