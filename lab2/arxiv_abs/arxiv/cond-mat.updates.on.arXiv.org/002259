By the adoption of a quaternion orientational order parameter to describe solidification, the
topological origins of the thermal transport properties of crystalline and non-crystalline solid
states are considered herein. Global orientational order, achieved by spontaneous symmetry breaking,
is prevented at finite temperatures for systems that exist in restricted dimensions (Mermin-Wagner
theorem). Just as complex ordered systems exist in restricted dimensions in 2D and 1D, owing to the
dimensionality of the order parameter, quaternion ordered systems in 4D and 3D exist in restricted
dimensions. Just below the melting temperature, misorientational fluctuations in the form of
spontaneously generated topological defects prevent the development of the solid state. Such
solidifying systems are well-described using O(4) quantum rotor models, and a defect-driven Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) transition is anticipated to separate an undercooled fluid from a crystalline solid state.
In restricted dimensions, in addition to orientationally-ordered ground states, orientationally-disordered
ground states may be realized by tuning a non-thermal parameter in the relevant O(n) quantum rotor
model Hamiltonian; thus, glassy solid states are anticipated to exist as distinct ground states
of O(4) quantum rotor models. Within this topological framework for solidification, the finite
Kauzmann temperature marks a first-order transition between crystalline and glassy solid states
at a "self-dual critical point" that belongs to O(4) quantum rotor models. This transition is a higher-dimensional
analogue to the quantum phase transition that belongs to O(2) Josephson junction arrays (JJAs).
Thermal transport properties of crystalline and glassy solid states, above approximately 50 K,
are considered alongside electrical transport properties of JJAs across the superconductor-to-superinsulator
transition.
