Dipolar (or spatially indirect) excitons (IXs) in semiconductor double quantum well (DQW) subjected
to an electric field are neutral species with a dipole moment oriented perpendicular to the DQW plane.
Here, we theoretically study interactions between IXs in stacked DQW bilayers, where the dipolar
coupling can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the relative positions of the particles.
By using microscopic band structure calculations to determine the electronic states forming the
excitons, we show that the attractive dipolar interaction between stacked IXs deforms their electronic
wave function, thereby increasing the inter-DQW interaction energy and making the IX electrically
polarizable. Many-particle effects interaction are addressed by considering the coupling between
a single IX in one of the DQWs to a cloud of IXs in the other DQW, which is modeled either as a closed-packed
lattice or as a continuum IX fluid. We find that the lattice model yields IX interlayer binding energies
decreasing with increasing lattice density. This behavior is due to the dominating role of the intra-DQW
dipolar repulsion, which prevents more than one exciton from entering the attractive region of
the inter-DQW coupling. Finally, both models shows that the single IX distorts the distribution
of IXs in the adjacent DQW, thus inducing the formation of an IX polaron. While the interlayer binding
energy reduces with IX density for lattice polarons, the continuous polaron model predicts a non-monotonous
dependence on density in semi-quantitative agreement with a recent experimental study [cf. Hubert
