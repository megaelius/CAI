A structure evolution in original format of exerting force at electron level in atoms of gas, semi-solid
and solid behaviors does not obey the conventional insights falling under the Bravais crystal systems.
This study deals with structure evolutions in atoms of those elements executing confined inter-state
dynamics of their electrons. A structure gets evolved on amalgamation of atoms due to significantly
attained dynamics. Structures evolve in different formats of exerting forces as per mechanism
of electron dynamics in their atoms. In the neutral state, atoms transform heat energy into binding
energy having shapes like tick, integral or Gaussian distribution symbol. The shape of binding
energy depends on the inter-state gap of filled to unfilled state, which is related to outer ring
in an atom. The evolving structure of atoms having identical ground points deals with forced exertions
to suitable electrons at the same level, too. In atoms of space format, the structure evolves above
the suitable level of ground surface. In atoms of grounded format, the structure evolves below the
suitable level of ground surface. Dimensions of evolving structure depend on the number of electrons
in the outer ring (of an atom) executing dynamics. When the execution of inter-state dynamics is
only for one electron, one-dimensional structure is evolved. When the execution of inter-state
dynamics is for two electrons, two-dimensional structure is evolved. In the atoms of those elements
where three electrons of their outer rings simultaneously execute dynamics, a bit complex mechanism
of structure evolution in those atoms is observed. An atom binds to the targeted atom at the points
of their generated energy. In the structure evolution of space format and grounded format, amalgamating
atoms bind to...
