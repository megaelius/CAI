Recent progress in observing and manipulating mechanical oscillators at quantum regime provides
new opportunities of studying fundamental physics, for example, to search for low energy signatures
of quantum gravity. For example, it was recently proposed that such devices can be used to test quantum
gravity effects, by detecting the change in the [x,p] commutation relation that could result from
quantum gravity corrections. We show that such a correction results in a dependence of a resonant
frequency of a mechanical oscillator on its amplitude, which is known as amplitude-frequency effect.
By implementing this new method we measure amplitude-frequency effect for 0.3 kg ultra high-Q sapphire
split-bar mechanical resonator and for 10 mg quartz bulk acoustic wave resonator. Our experiments
with sapphire resonator have established the upper limit on quantum gravity correction constant
for $\beta_0<5 \times10^6$ which is a factor of 6 better than previously detected. The reasonable
estimates of $\beta_0$ from experiments with quartz resonators yield an even more stringent limit
of $4\times10^4$. The data sets of 1936 measurement of physical pendulum period by Atkinson results
in significantly stronger limitations on $\beta_0 \ll 1$. Yet, due to the lack of proper pendulum
frequency stability measurement in these experiments, the exact upper bound on $\beta_0$ can not
be reliably established. Moreover, pendulum based systems only allow testing a specific form of
the modified commutator that depends on the mean value of momentum. The electro-mechanical oscillators
to the contrary enable testing of any form of generalized uncertainty principle directly due to
much higher stability and a higher degree of control.
