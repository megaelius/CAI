We outline how the coupled cluster method of microscopic quantum many-body theory can be utilized
in practice to give highly accurate results for the ground-state properties of a wide variety of
highly frustrated and strongly correlated spin-lattice models of interest in quantum magnetism,
including their quantum phase transitions. The method itself is described, and it is shown how it
may be implemented in practice to high orders in a systematically improvable hierarchy of (so-called
LSUB$m$) approximations, by the use of computer-algebraic techniques. The method works from the
outset in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite lattice at all levels of approximation, and it is
shown both how the "raw" LSUB$m$ results are themselves generally excellent in the sense that they
converge rapidly, and how they may accurately be extrapolated to the exact limit, $m \rightarrow
\infty$, of the truncation index $m$, which denotes the {\it only} approximation made. All of this
is illustrated via a specific application to a two-dimensional, frustrated, spin-half $J^{XXZ}_{1}$--$J^{XXZ}_{2}$
model on a honeycomb lattice with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions with
exchange couplings $J_{1}>0$ and $J_{2} \equiv \kappa J_{1} > 0$, respectively, where both
interactions are of the same anisotropic $XXZ$ type. We show how the method can be used to determine
the entire zero-temperature ground-state phase diagram of the model in the range $0 \leq \kappa
\leq 1$ of the frustration parameter and $0 \leq \Delta \leq 1$ of the spin-space anisotropy parameter.
In particular, we identify a candidate quantum spin-liquid region in the phase space.
