Optimization is finding the best solution, which mathematically amounts to locating the global
minimum of some cost function usually possessing several local minima. The best optimization techniques
currently available, simulated annealing and quantum annealing, utilize different principles
to overcome the potential barrier, namely, climbing over the barrier thanks to random forces and
quantum tunnelling through the barrier, respectively, and none guarantees an optimal solution.
Here, in an attack on optimization problem, we conceive and explore a conceptually different principle
behind overcoming the barrier, which is based on bifurcations in nonlinear systems caused by time
delay. Namely, we modify the conventional "gradient descent" setting by delaying the right-hand
side of the respective differential equation by the same amount of time. In the ideal scenario, starting
from arbitrary initial conditions at zero delay, one would slowly increase and then decrease the
delay, causing the system to end up in the global minimum. The increase of the delay from zero induces
a cascade of homoclinic bifurcations destroying all attractors around the local minima, which
effectively removes the barriers between them and makes the system spontaneously wander around
all minima. The subsequent slow decrease of the delay automatically leads the system to a certain
minimum, which could be the global minimum sought under certain conditions. We explore the possibility
of this scenario and formulate some of these conditions. The limitations of this technique seem
comparable with those of other approaches available, but the advantages are extreme technical
simplicity and complete determinism.
