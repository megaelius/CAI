Using large scale molecular dynamics simulations we study the orientational dynamics of a heated
Janus particle which exhibits self-propulsion. The asymmetry in the microscopic interaction
of the colloid with the solvent is implemented by choosing different wetting parameters for the
two halves of the sphere. Consequently a gradient in temperature is created across the poles of the
sphere due to different interfacial resistance across the solid-fluid boundary in the two hemispheres.
It is this self-created temperature gradient which leads to a self-propulsion along the direction
of the symmetry axis. In this article, we look at the orientational dynamics of such a system, as well
as the subsequent enhancement of the translational diffusivity at late times. The orientational
correlation of the symmetry axis is measured from the simulation and provides a direct access to
the rotational diffusion constant. The heating leads to an increase in the rotational diffusivity
of the colloid. We quantify this increase in rotational diffusion against the temperature difference
across the poles of the Janus sphere as well as the average surface temperature difference from the
ambient fluid.We show that later quantification is better and results in a data collapse for different
choices of the microscopic interaction. The average propulsion velocity is also measured for different
choices of the wetting parameter. The directionality of self-propulsion changes depending on
the microscopic interaction. We show that whenever the attractive interaction of the colloid with
the solvent is switched off, the phoretic mobility changes sign. Further, the propulsion velocity
is zero for heating below a certain threshold value. Finally, we combine the measured propulsion
velocity and the rotational diffusion time to estimate the enhancement in the long time diffusion
coefficient of the particle.
