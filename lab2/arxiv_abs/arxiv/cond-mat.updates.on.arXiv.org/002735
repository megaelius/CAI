The simulation of charge transport in ultra-scaled electronic devices requires the knowledge
of the atomic configuration and the associated potential. Such "atomistic" device simulation
is most commonly handled using a tight-binding approach based on a basis-set of localized orbitals.
Here, in contrast to this widely used tight-binding approach, we formulate the problem using a highly
accurate plane-wave representation of the atomic (pseudo)-potentials. We develop a new approach
that separately deals with the intrinsic Hamiltonian, containing the potential due to the atomic
configuration, and the extrinsic Hamiltonian, related to the external potential. We realize efficient
performance by implementing a finite-element like partition-of-unity approach combining linear
shape functions with Bloch-wave enhancement functions. We match the performance of previous tight-binding
approaches, while retaining the benefits of a plane wave based model. We present the details of our
model and its implementation in a full-fledged self-consistent ballistic quantum transport solver.
We demonstrate our implementation by simulating the electronic transport and device characteristics
of a graphene nanoribbon transistor containing more than 2000 atoms. We analyze the accuracy, numerical
efficiency and scalability of our approach. We are able to speed up calculations by a factor of 100
compared to previous methods based on plane waves and envelope functions. Furthermore, our reduced
basis-set results in a significant reduction of the required memory budget, which enables devices
with thousands of atoms to be simulated on a personal computer.
