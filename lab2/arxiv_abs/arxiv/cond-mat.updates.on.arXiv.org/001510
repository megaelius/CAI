A microstructure-based model that accounts for the effect of grain size has been developed to study
the effect of grain size on the fatigue life of Inconel 718 alloys. The fatigue behavior of two alloys
with different grain size was determined by means of uniaxial cyclic deformation tests under fully-reversed
deformation ($R_\varepsilon$ = -1) at 400$^\circ$C in the low cycle fatigue regime. The model was
based in the determination of the fatigue indicator parameter (based on the local crystallographic
strain energy dissipated per cycle) by means of computational homogenization of a representative
volume element of the microstructure. The mechanical response of the single crystal within the
polycrystal was modelled through a phenomenological crystal plasticity model which was modified
to account for the effect of grain size on the monotonic and cyclic hardening/softening mechanisms.
The microstructure-based crack initiation model parameters were calibrated from the experimental
tests of the material with fine grain size. The results of the fatigue simulations were in good agreement
with the experimental results in terms of the cyclic stress-strain curves and of the number of cycles
for fatigue crack initiation. The model did not show any grain size effect on the fatigue life for
the largest cyclic strain ranges while the predicted fatigue life predicted was considerably longer
in the case of the microstructure with fine grain size for the lowest strain ranges, in quantitative
agreement with experimental data. These differences were attributed to changes in the deformation
modes between homogeneous plastic deformation at large cyclic strain ranges and localized plasticity
in a few grains at low cyclic strain ranges.
