The field of disordered systems in statistical physics provides many simple models in which the
competing influences of thermal and non-thermal disorder lead to new phases and non-trivial thermal
behavior of order parameters. In this work, we add a new model to the subject by considering a disordered
system where the state space consists of various orderings of a list. As in spin glasses, the disorder
of such "permutation glasses" arises from a parameter in the Hamiltonian being drawn from a distribution
of possible values, thus allowing nominally "incorrect orderings" to have lower energies than
"correct orderings" in the space of permutations. We analyze a Gaussian, uniform, and symmetric
Bernoulli distribution of energy costs, and, by employing Jensen's inequality, derive a simple
condition requiring the permutation glass to always transition to the correctly ordered state
at a temperature lower than that of the non-disordered system, provided that this correctly ordered
state is accessible. We in turn find that in order for the correctly ordered state to be accessible,
the probability that an incorrectly-ordered component is energetically favored must be less than
the inverse of the number of components in the system. We show that all of these results are consistent
with a replica symmetric ansatz of the system. We conclude by arguing that there is no distinct permutation
glass phase for the simplest model considered here and by discussing how to extend the analysis to
more complex Hamiltonians capable of novel phase behavior and replica symmetry breaking. Finally,
we outline an apparent correspondence between the presented system and a discrete-energy level
fermion gas. In all, the investigation introduces a new class of exactly soluble models into statistical
mechanics and provides a fertile ground to investigate statistical models of disorder.
