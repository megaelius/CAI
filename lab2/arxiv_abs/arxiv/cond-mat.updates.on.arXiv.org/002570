In this work, we use a combination of a phenomenological effective cosolute-hydrogel interaction
potential and Dynamic Density Functional Theory to investigate the full non-equilibrium encapsulation
kinetics of charged and dipolar cosolutes by an isolated charged hollow hydrogel immersed in a 1:1
electrolyte aqueous solution. Our analysis covers a broad spectrum of cosolute valences z_c and
electric dipole moments mu_c, as well as hydrogel swelling states and hydrogel charge densities.
Our calculations show that, close to the collapsed state, the polar cosolutes are predominantly
precluded and the encapsulation process is strongly hindered by the excluded-volume interaction
exerted by the polymer network. Different equilibrium and kinetic sorption regimes (interface
versus interior) are found depending on the value and sign of z_c and the value of mu_c. For cosolutes
of the same sign of charge as the gel, the superposition of steric and electrostatic repulsion leads
to an "interaction-controlled" encapsulation process, in which the characteristic time to fill
the empty core of the hydrogel grows exponentially with z_c. On the other hand, for cosolutes oppositely
charged to the gel, we find a "diffusion-controlled" kinetic regime, where cosolutes tend to rapidly
absorb into the hydrogel membrane and the encapsulation rate only depends on the cosolute diffusion
time across the membrane. Finally, we find that increasing mu_c promotes the appearance of metastable
and stable surface adsorption states. For large enough mu_c, the kinetics enters a "adsorption-hindered
diffusion", where the enhanced surface adsorption imposes a barrier and slows down the uptake.
