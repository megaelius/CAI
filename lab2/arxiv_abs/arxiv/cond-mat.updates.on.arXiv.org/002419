Mechanical properties of steels are significantly enhanced by retained austenite. Particularly,
it has been shown that a recently developed heat-treatment technique called Quenching and Partitioning
(Q\&P) stabilises austenite effectively. In the present work, the phase-field approach is adopted
to simulate the phase transformation and carbon diffusion, which respectively accompanies the
quenching and partitioning process of the polycrystalline Fe-C system. By incorporating the chemical
driving-force from the CALPHAD database, the elastic phase-field model, which recovers the sharp-interface
solutions, simulates the martensite (alpha') transformation at three different quenching temperatures.
The resulting martensite volume-fractions are in complete agreement with the analytical predictions.
For the first time, in this study, the constrained carbon equilibrium (CCE) condition is introduced
in the polycrystalline set-up to yield the predicted partitioning endpoints. Under the CCE condition,
the carbon partitioning in two alloys of varying composition is analysed through the phase-field
model which employs chemical potential as the dynamic variable. The volume fraction and distribution
of retained austenite is determined from the carbon distribution and its temporal evolution during
the partitioning is investigated. It is identified that in the initial stages of partitioning carbon
gets accumulated in the austenite ($\gamma$) along the $\gamma\alpha'$-interface, owing to the
substantial difference in the diffusivities and CCE endpoints. This accumulation stabilises
the austenite adjacent to the interface. However, depending on the martensite volume-fraction
and the alloy composition, the evolution of the stabilised austenite varies. Furthermore, the
influence of the phase distribution on the kinetics of the temporal evolution of retained austenite
is elucidated.
