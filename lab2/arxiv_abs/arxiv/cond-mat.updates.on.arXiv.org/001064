We use numerical techniques to study dynamical properties at finite temperature ($T$) of the Heisenberg
spin chain with random exchange couplings, which realizes the random singlet (RS) fixed point in
the low-energy limit. Specifically, we study the dynamic spin structure factor $S(q,\omega)$,
which can be probed directly by inelastic neutron scattering experiments and, in the limit of small
$\omega$, in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments through the spin-lattice relaxation
rate $1/T_1$. Our work combines three complementary methods: exact diagonalization, matrix-product-state
algorithms, and stochastic analytic continuation of quantum Monte Carlo results in imaginary
time. Unlike the uniform system, whose low-energy excitations at low $T$ are restricted to $q$ close
to $0$ and $\pi$, our study reveals a continuous narrow band of low-energy excitations in $S(q,\omega)$,
extending throughout the Brillouin zone. Close to $q=\pi$, the scaling properties of these excitations
are well captured by the RS theory, but we also see disagreements with some aspects of the predicted
$q$-dependence further away from $q=\pi$. Furthermore we find spin diffusion effects close to
$q=0$ that are not contained within the RS theory but give non-negligible contributions to the mean
$1/T_1$. To compare with NMR experiments, we consider the distribution of the local $1/T_1$ values,
which is broad, approximately described by a stretched exponential. The mean value first decreases
with $T$, but starts to increase and diverge below a crossover temperature. Although a similar divergent
behavior has been found for the static uniform susceptibility, this divergent behavior of $1/T_1$
has never been seen in experiments. Our results show that the divergence of the mean $1/T_1$ is due
to rare events in the disordered chains and is concealed in experiments, where the typical $1/T_1$
value is accessed.
