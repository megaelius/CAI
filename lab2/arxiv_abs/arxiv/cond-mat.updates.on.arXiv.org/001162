Nodal line in parameter space, at which the energy gap closes up, can either be the boundary separating
two topological quantum phases or two conventional phases. We study the topological feature of
nodal line in parameter space via a dimerized Kitaev spin chain with staggered transverse field,
which can be mapped onto the system of dimerized spinless fermions with p-wave superconductivity.
The quantum phase boundaries are straight crossing degeneracy lines in 3D parameter space. We show
that the nodal line acts as a vortex filament associated with a vector field, which is generated from
the Zak phase of Bogoliubov-de Gennes band. We also investigate the topological invariant in Majorana
fermion representation for open chain. The Majorana edge modes are not zero mode, but is still protected
by energy gap. The exact mid-gap states of the Majorana lattice allows to obtain the corresponding
Majorana probability distribution for whole 3D parameter space, which can establish a scalar field
to identify the topological feature of the nodal lines. Furthermore, when we switch on a weak tunneling
between two ends of the Majorana lattice, the topological invariants of the nodal lines can be obtained
by the pumped Majorana probability from an adiabatic passage encircling the lines. Numerical simulations
of quasi-adiabatic time evolution is performed in small system. We compute the current to monitor
the transport of Majorana fermion, which exhibits evident character of topological pumping. Our
results link the bulk topological invariant to the dynamical behavior of Majorana edge mode, extending
the concept of bulk-edge correspondence.
