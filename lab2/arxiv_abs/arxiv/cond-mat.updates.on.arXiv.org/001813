A dynamical quantum phase transition can occur in time evolution of sudden quenched quantum systems
across phase transition. It corresponds to nonanalytic behavior at a critical time for rate function
of quantum state return amplitude, analogous to nonanalyticity of the free energy density at the
critical temperature in macroscopic systems. A variety of many-body systems can be represented
in momentum space as a spin-1/2 state evolving in Bloch sphere, where each momentum mode is decoupled
and thus can be simulated independently by a single qubit. Here, we report the observation of dynamical
quantum phase transition by a superconducting qubit simulation of the quantum quench dynamics
of many-body systems. We take the Ising model with transverse field as an example. In experiment,
the spin state initially polarized longitudinally evolves based on Hamiltonian with adjustable
parameters depending on momentum and strength of the transverse magnetic field. The time evolved
quantum state will be readout by state tomography. Evidences of dynamical quantum phase transition
such as paths of time evolution state on Bloch sphere, the non-analytic behavior in dynamical free
energy and the emergence of Skyrmion lattice in momentum-time space are provided. The experiment
data agrees well with theoretical and numerical calculations. The experiment demonstrates for
the first time explicitly the topological invariant, both topological trivial and non-trivial,
for dynamical quantum phase transition. Our experiment results show that the quantum phase transition
of many-body systems can be successfully simulated by a single qubit by varying control parameter
over the range of momentum.
