Artificial neural network (ANN) potentials enable the efficient large-scale atomistic modeling
of complex materials with near first-principles accuracy. For molecular dynamics simulations,
accurate energies and interatomic forces are a prerequisite, but training ANN potentials simultaneously
on energies and forces from electronic structure calculations is computationally demanding.
Here, we introduce an efficient alternative method for the training of ANN potentials on energy
and force information based on an extrapolation of the total energy via a Taylor expansion. By translating
the force information to approximate energies, the quadratic scaling with the number of atoms exhibited
by conventional force-training methods can be avoided, which enables the training on reference
data sets containing complex atomic structures. We demonstrate for different materials systems,
clusters of water molecules, bulk liquid water, and a lithium transition-metal oxide, that the
proposed force-training approach provides substantial improvements over schemes that train
on energies only. Including force information for training reduces the size of the reference data
sets required for ANN potential construction, increases the transferability of the potential,
and generally improves the force prediction accuracy. For a set of water clusters, the Taylor-expansion
approach achieves around 50% of the force error improvement compared to the explicit training on
all force components, at a much smaller computational cost. The alternative force training approach
thus simplifies the construction of general ANN potentials for the prediction of accurate energies
and interatomic forces for diverse types of materials, as demonstrated here for water and a transition-metal
oxide.
