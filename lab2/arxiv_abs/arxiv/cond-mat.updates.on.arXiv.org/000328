We analytically calculate the correlation potential of a test ion near a \emph{strongly} charged
plate inside a dilute $m:-n$ electrolyte. We do this by calculating the electrostatic Green's function
in the presence of a nonlinear background potential, the latter having been obtained using the nonlinear
Poisson-Boltzmann theory. We consider the general case where the dielectric constants of the plate
and the electrolyte are distinct. The following generic results emerge from our analyses: (1) If
the distance to the plate $\Delta z$ is much larger than a Gouy-Chapman length, the plate surface
would behave effectively as an infinitely charged surface, and the dielectric constant of the plate
effectively plays no role. (2) If $\Delta z$ is larger than a Gouy-Chapman length but shorter than
a Debye length, the correlation potential can be interpreted in terms of an image charge that is three
times larger than the source charge. This behavior is independent of the valences of ions. (3) The
Green's function vanishes inside the plate if the surface charge density is infinitely large, hence
the electrostatic potential is constant there. In this respect, a strongly charged plate behaves
like a conductor plate. (4) If $\Delta z$ is smaller than a Gouy-Chapman length, the correlation
potential is dominated by the conventional image charge due to the dielectric discontinuity at
the interface. (5) If $\Delta z$ is larger than a Debye length, the leading order behavior of the correlation
potential would depend on the valences of ions in the electrolyte. Furthermore, inside an \emph{asymmetric}
electrolyte, the correlation potential is \emph{singly} screened, i.e., it undergoes exponential
decay with a decay width equal to the Debye length.
