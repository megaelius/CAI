The integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with functional non-2D materials such as metal
oxides is of key importance for many applications, but underlying mechanisms for such non-2D/2D
interfacing remain largely elusive at the atomic scale. To address this, we here investigate the
nucleation stage in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of the important metal oxide HfO2 on chemical
vapor deposited graphene using atomically resolved and element specific scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM). To avoid any deleterious influence of polymer residues from pre-ALD
graphene transfers we employ a substrate-assisted ALD process directly on the as grown graphene
still remaining on its Cu growth catalyst support. Thereby we resolve at the atomic scale key factors
governing the integration of non-2D metal oxides with 2D materials by ALD: Particular to our substrate-assisted
ALD process we find a graphene-layer-dependent catalytic participation of the supporting Cu catalyst
in the ALD process. We further confirm at high resolution the role of surface irregularities such
as steps between graphene layers on oxide nucleation. Employing the energy transfer from the scanning
electron beam to in situ crystallize the initially amorphous ALD HfO2 on graphene, we observe HfO2
crystallization to non-equilibrium HfO2 polymorphs (cubic/tetragonal). Finally our data indicates
a critical role of the graphene's atmospheric adventitious carbon contamination on the ALD process
whereby this contamination acts as an unintentional seeding layer for metal oxide ALD nucleation
on graphene under our conditions. As atmospheric adventitious carbon contamination is hard to
avoid in any scalable 2D materials processing, this is a critical factor in ALD recipe development
for 2D materials coating. Combined our work highlights several key mechanisms underlying scalable
ALD oxide growth on 2D materials.
