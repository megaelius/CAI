While all media can exhibit first-order conductivity describing current linearly proportional
to electric field, $E$, the second-order conductivity, $\sigma^{(2)}$ , relating current to $E^2$,
is nonzero only when inversion symmetry is broken. Second order nonlinear optical responses are
powerful tools in basic research, as probes of symmetry breaking, and in optical technology as the
basis for generating currents from far-infrared to X-ray wavelengths. The recent surge of interest
in Weyl semimetals with acentric crystal structures has led to the discovery of a host of $\sigma^{(2)}$
-related phenomena in this class of materials, such as polarization-selective conversion of light
to dc current (photogalvanic effects) and the observation of giant second-harmonic generation
(SHG) efficiency in TaAs at photon energy 1.5 eV. Here, we present measurements of the SHG spectrum
of TaAs revealing that the response at 1.5 eV corresponds to the high-energy tail of a resonance at
0.7 eV, at which point the second harmonic conductivity is approximately 200 times larger than seen
in the standard candle nonlinear crystal, GaAs. This remarkably large SHG response provokes the
question of ultimate limits on $\sigma^{(2)}$ , which we address by a new theorem relating frequency-integrated
nonlinear response functions to the third cumulant (or "skewness") of the polarization distribution
function in the ground state. This theorem provides considerable insight into the factors that
lead to the largest possible second-order nonlinear response, specifically showing that the spectral
weight is unbounded and potentially divergent when the possibility of next-neighbor hopping is
included.
