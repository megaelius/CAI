A heterogeneous quasi-brittle granular material can withstand certain levels of internal damage
before global failure. This robustness depends not just on the bond strengths but also on the topology
and redundancy of the bonded contact network, through which forces and damage propagate. Despite
extensive studies on quasi-brittle failure, there still lacks a unified framework that can quantify
the interdependent evolution of robustness, damage and force transmission. Here we develop a framework
to do so. It is data-driven, multiscale and relies solely on the contact strengths and topology of
the contact network for material properties. Using data derived from discrete element simulations
of concrete specimens under uniaxial tension, we uncover evidence of an optimized force transmission,
characterized by two novel transmission patterns that predict and explain damage propagation
from the microstructural to the macroscopic level. The first comprises the optimized flow routes:
shortest possible paths that can transmit the global transmission capacity. These paths reliably
predict tensile force chains. The second are the force bottlenecks. These provide an early and accurate
prediction of the ultimate pattern, location and interaction of macrocracks. A two-pronged cooperative
mechanism among bottlenecks, enabled by redundancies in transmission pathways, underlies robustness
in the pre-failure regime. Bottlenecks take turns in accommodating damage, while member contacts
spread the forces to confine damage to low capacity contacts which leave behind a web of strong contacts
to support and curtail the failure of tensile force chains in the region. This cooperative behavior,
while serving to minimize the inevitable reduction in global transmission capacity, progressively
heightens the interdependency among these contacts and elicits the opposite effect.
