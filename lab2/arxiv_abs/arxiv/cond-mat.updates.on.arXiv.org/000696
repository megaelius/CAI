In multicellular systems, including microbial communities and developing organs, cells often
communicate to coordinate their gene expressions and generate ordered spatial patterns or structures.
'Secrete-and-sense cells' simultaneously secrete and sense the same molecule. Their ubiquity
in spatial order-forming systems and studies of specific secrete-and-sense cells suggest that
they are ideal for spatially coordinating gene expressions. But whether secrete-and-sense cells
from different organisms use shared principles to do so and how, in general, secrete-and-sense
cells with initially uncorrelated gene expressions can dynamically establish spatially correlated
gene expressions remain unclear. To address these questions, we developed a statistical mechanics-type
framework for a simple class of secrete-and-sense cells. We consider slowly responding, bistable
secrete-and-sense cells that turn on and off each other's 'output gene' expression and signal-secretions.
We map an ensemble of cellular lattices with the same 'macrostate' variables - spatial order parameter
and average output-gene expression - onto a particle that drifts and diffuses down a pseudo-energy
landscape in a phase space defined by the macrostate variables. Decreasing pseudo-energy increases
cells' spatial order. Competing domains of on- and off-cells drive the particle's drift. A Hamiltonian
for cellular communication - analogous to that of magnetic spins with long-range interactions
- determines the pseudo-energy landscape. Particles can be trapped outside their pseudo-energy's
minima, yielding metastable spatial patterns. Noise in secretion and sensing can liberate the
trapped particles and further increase cells' spatial order. We generalize our framework to multiple
types of cells and signals. Our approach may be extended to understand more complex forms of cell-cell
communications.
