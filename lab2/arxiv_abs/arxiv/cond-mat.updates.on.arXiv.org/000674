Topic of the thesis is a theoretical description of the ultracold atomic gases in one- and two-dimensional
optical lattices in the presence of the disorder leading to the Anderson localization. The disorder
is created by interaction of the main fraction of atoms with the second immobilized fraction distributed
randomly over the lattice. In low-dimensional systems there is no transition from the Anderson
localized to the conducting phase, although in the presence of correlations a discrete set of extended
states can exist. The first part of the thesis is devoted to properties of such states. In the finite
size lattices, the presence of those states results in the appearance of `windows of transport'
-- energy ranges, in which the localization length is longer than the system size.The analytical
method of determining the extended states energies for correlations of generalized $N$-mers type
is presented, along with a proof that indeed those states are extended in the infinite system. Subsequently,
the way of experimental creation of this type of correlations is proposed, as well as the technique
of generation of the disorder in the tunneling amplitudes, which significantly enhances tunability
of the proposed energy filters. The second part of the thesis describes the method which allows to
simulate a specific type of the disorder: random magnetic field. Systems of such a class, created
in a two dimensional lattice using simultaneous fast periodic modulation of the lattice height
and interactions with immobilized species, may allow in future to investigate the range of topics
from the condensed matter physics, for example fractional quantum Hall effect at half-filling.
In the thesis, the most interesting features observed upon investigation of such systems are presented.
Especially, the anomalously low localization length for correlated disorder is explained.
