A comparative study between PbTiO$_3$, PbZrO$_3$, and the solid solution PbZr$_{0.5}$Ti$_{0.5}$O$_3$
is performed on the soft mode lattice dynamics within the first Brillouin Zone. We consider the six
unique B-site orderings for PbZr$_{0.5}$Ti$_{0.5}$O$_3$ representable within the 2$\times$2$\times$2
primitive perovskite supercell as well as the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) to extract the
phonon dispersion relations of a high-symmetry cubic-constrained form using density functional
perturbation theory. We find that the most unstable modes in the rock-salt ordered structure and
the VCA, like pure PbZrO$_3$, are antiferrodistortive (AFD) whilst lower symmetry arrangements
are dominated by $\Gamma$-point ferroelectric (FE) instabilities like pure PbTiO$_3$. Despite
similarities in the phonon dispersion relations between the rock-salt ordered supercell and the
VCA, the character of modes at high symmetry points are found to be different. In particular, the
a$^{0}$a$^{0}$c$^{-}$ & a$^{0}$a$^{0}$c$^{+}$ AFD instabilities of the rock-salt ordering
are replaced with a$^{-}$b$^{-}$c$^{-}$ & a$^{+}$b$^{+}$c$^{+}$ instabilities within the VCA.
Such a rotation pattern is not seen in any of the supercell-based calculations thus serving as a quantitative
example of the inability of the method to represent accurately local structural distortions. Single
modes are found exhibiting dual order parameters. At the zone centre, some arrangements show mixed
FE & antipolar soft modes (due to Pb motion tansverse to the polar axis) and at long wavelengths all
arrangements have soft modes of a mixed antipolar & AFD character. These are described with direct
analysis of the eigendisplacements.
