The main focus of this thesis is the theoretical study of strongly interacting quantum mixtures
confined in one dimension and subjected to a harmonic external potential. Such strongly correlated
systems can be realized and tested in ultracold atoms experiments. Their non-trivial permutational
symmetry properties are investigated, as well as their interplay with correlations. Exploiting
an exact solution at strong interactions, we extract general correlation properties encoded in
the one-body density matrix and in the associated momentum distributions, in fermionic and Bose-Fermi
mixtures. In particular, we obtain substantial results about the short-range behavior, and therefore
the high-momentum tails, which display typical $k^{-4}$ laws. The weights of these tails, denoted
as Tan's contacts, are related to numerous thermodynamic properties of the systems such as the two-body
correlations, the derivative of the energy with respect to the one-dimensional scattering length,
or the static structure factor. We show that these universal Tan's contacts also allow to characterize
the spatial symmetry of the systems, and therefore is a deep connection between correlations and
symmetries. Besides, the exchange symmetry is extracted using a group theory method, namely the
class-sum method, which comes originally from nuclear physics. Moreover, we show that these systems
follow a generalized version of the famous Lieb-Mattis theorem. Wishing to make our results as experimentally
relevant as possible, we derive scaling laws for Tan's contact as a function of the interaction,
temperature and transverse confinement. These laws display interesting effects related to strong
correlations and dimensionality.
