Future information technology demands ultimately fast, low-loss quantum control. Intense light
fields have facilitated important milestones, such as inducing novel states of matter, accelerating
electrons ballistically, or coherently flipping the valley pseudospin. These dynamics leave
unique signatures, such as characteristic bandgaps or high-order harmonic radiation. The fastest
and least dissipative way of switching the technologically most important quantum attribute -
the spin - between two states separated by a potential barrier is to trigger an all-coherent precession.
Pioneering experiments and theory with picosecond electric and magnetic fields have suggested
this possibility, yet observing the actual dynamics has remained out of reach. Here, we show that
terahertz (1 THz = 10$^{12}$ Hz) electromagnetic pulses allow coherent navigation of spins over
a potential barrier and we reveal the corresponding temporal and spectral fingerprints. This goal
is achieved by coupling spins in antiferromagnetic TmFeO$_{3}$ with the locally enhanced THz electric
field of custom-tailored antennas. Within their duration of 1 ps, the intense THz pulses abruptly
change the magnetic anisotropy and trigger a large-amplitude ballistic spin motion. A characteristic
phase flip, an asymmetric splitting of the magnon resonance, and a long-lived offset of the Faraday
signal are hallmarks of coherent spin switching into adjacent potential minima, in agreement with
a numerical simulation. The switchable spin states can be selected by an external magnetic bias.
The low dissipation and the antenna's sub-wavelength spatial definition could facilitate scalable
spin devices operating at THz rates.
