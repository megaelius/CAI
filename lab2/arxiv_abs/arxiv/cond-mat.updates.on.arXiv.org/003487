We study the electronic structure and transport properties of a network of topological domain walls
composed of domains with opposite valley Chern numbers. Although each domain is insulating inside
its energy gap, we find gapless Bloch bands exhibiting linear Dirac dispersion near the charge neutrality
point. The corresponding Bloch states are distributed around the domain walls that can host electric
current. For a unit cell of the network that is composed of three intersecting domain walls, we study
the current partition rules, and find that more current injected from one domain wall is partitioned
into its neighboring ones and the forward propagating current is less but nonzero. For a network
of domain walls, we investigate the edge-dependent electronic transport properties, e.g., in
a ribbon with sawtooth domain wall edges, we find that the edge states propagate along the system
boundaries for Fermi energies near the charge neutrality point, which contributes to the quantized
conductance that is robust against weak disorders. Such a conductance quantization agrees with
the recent experiments [Nat. Mater. \textbf{18}, 453 (2019)]; For the Fermi energies deviating
from the charge neutrality point, all domain walls can contribute to host the electrical current.
In a ribbon with trident domain wall edges, however, a weak energy gap opens near the charge neutrality
point due to the finite size effect. Such a network can be realized in mori\'e pattern systems (e.g.,
twisted bilayer graphene under a perpendicular electric field). Our results provide a comprehensive
depiction of the electronic transport properties of a topological domain wall network and have
far-reaching implications in designing electron-beam splitters and low-power-consuming topological
quantum devices.
