Synchronization is an important collective phenomenon in interacting oscillatory agents. Many
functional features of the brain are related to synchronization of neurons. The type of synchronization
transition that may occur (explosive vs. continuous) has been the focus of intense attention in
recent years, mostly in the context of phase oscillator models for which collective behavior is
independent of the mean-value of natural frequency. However, synchronization properties of biologically-motivated
neural models depend on the firing frequencies. In this study we report a systematic study of gamma-band
synchronization in spiking Hodgkin-Huxley neurons which interact via electrical or chemical
synapses. We use various network models in order to define the connectivity matrix. We find that
the underlying mechanisms and types of synchronization transitions in gamma-band differs from
beta-band. In gamma-band, network regularity suppresses transition while randomness promotes
a continuous transition. Heterogeneity in the underlying topology does not lead to any change in
the order of transition, however, correlation between number of synapses and frequency of a neuron
will lead to explosive synchronization in heterogenous networks with electrical synapses. Furthermore,
small-world networks modeling a fine balance between clustering and randomness (as in the cortex),
lead to explosive synchronization with electrical synapses, but a smooth transition in the case
of chemical synapses. We also find that hierarchical modular networks, such as the connectome,
lead to frustrated transitions. We explain our results based on various properties of the network,
paying particular attention to the competition between clustering and long-range synapses.
