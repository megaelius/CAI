Modern spectroscopic techniques for the investigation of magnetization dynamics in micro- and
nano- structures or thin films use typically microwave antennas which are directly fabricated
on top of the sample by means of electron-beam-lithography (EBL). Following this approach, every
magnetic structure on the sample needs its own antenna, resulting in additional EBL steps and layer
deposition processes. We demonstrate a new approach for magnetization excitation that is suitable
for optical and non-optical spectroscopy techniques. By patterning the antenna on a separated
flexible glass cantilever and insulating it electrically, we solved the before mentioned issues.
Since we use flexible transparent glass as a substrate, optical spectroscopy techniques like Brillouin-light-scattering
microscopy ({\mu}BLS), time resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements (TRMOKE) or optical
detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements can be carried out at visible laser wavelengths.
As the antenna is detached from the sample it can be freely positioned in all three dimensions to adress
only the desired magnetic sample structures and to achieve effective excitation. We demonstrate
the functionality of these antennas using {\mu}BLS and compare coherently and thermally excited
magnon spectra to show the enhancement of the signal by a factor of about 400 due to the excitation
by the antenna. Moreover, we succeed to characterize yttrium iron garnet thin films with spatial
resolution using optical ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) experiments. We analyse the spatial excitation
profile of the antenna by measuring the magnetization dynamics in two dimensions. The technique
is furthermore applied to investigate injection-locking of spin Hall nano-oscillators.
