Although the paradigm of criticality is centred around spatial correlations and their anomalous
scaling, not many studies of Self-Organised Criticality (SOC) focus on spatial correlations.
Often, integrated observables, such as avalanche size and duration, are used, not least as to avoid
complications due to the unavoidable lack of translational invariance. The present work is a survey
of spatio-temporal correlation functions in the Manna Model of SOC, measured numerically in detail
in d=1,3 and 5 dimensions and compared to theoretical results, in particular relating them to "integrated"
observables such as avalanche size and duration scaling, that measure them indirectly. Contrary
to the notion held by some of SOC models organising into a critical state by re-arranging their spatial
structure avalanche by avalanche, which may be expected to result in large, non-trivial, system-spanning
spatial correlations in the quiescent state (between avalanches), correlations of inactive particles
in the quiescent state have a small amplitude that does not increase with the system size, although
they display (noisy) power law scaling over a range linear in the system size. Self-organisation,
however, does take place as the (one-point) density of inactive particles organises into a particular
profile that is asymptotically independent of the driving location, also demonstrated analytically
in one dimension. Activity and its correlations, on the other hand, display non-trivial long-ranged
spatio-temporal scaling with exponents that can be related to established results, in particular
avalanche size and duration exponents. The correlation length and amplitude are set by the system
size (confirmed analytically for some observables), as expected in systems displaying finite
size scaling. In one dimension, we find some surprising inconsistencies of the dynamical exponent.
