In this study the metal-insulator transition in the square-lattice Hubbard model at half-filling
is revisited in relation to the DOS and spectral functions by means of the ladder dual fermion approximation
(LDFA). For this purpose, a new expression of the two-body Green's function in the form of resolvents
is proposed, which provides tractable and efficient means to calculate the local vertex function
with the Lanczos exact diagonalization (ED) method. This makes it possible to use the Lanczos ED
method as a solver of the effective impurity Anderson model for LDFA, opening up the way to access
low temperatures and obtain accurate DOS and spectral functions on the real frequency axis for these
perturbative extensions of the dynamical mean field theory. It is found that for $U\le 3.5t$, as
temperature decreases, the pseudogap formation due to antiferromagnetic correlations in the
quasiparticle peak of the spectral function occurs at the X point $[k=(\pi,0)]$, spreads through
the Fermi surface and ends at the M$_2$ point $[k=(\pi/2,\pi/2)]$. The almost simultaneous creation
of the pseudogap and the loss of the Fermi liquid feature is consistent with that expected in the Slater
regime. Although the pseudogap still appears in the quasiparticle-like single peak for $U\ge 4.0t$,
the Fermi-liquid feature is partially lost on the Fermi surface already at higher temperatures
as expected in the Mott-Heisenberg regime, in which local spins are preformed at high temperatures.
A sharp crossover from a pseudogap phase to a Mott insulator at finite $U^{*} \approx 4.7t$ is found
to occur below the temperature of the pseudogap formation similar to a previous study with the non-linear
$\sigma$ model approach.
