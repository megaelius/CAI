We consider the dynamics of a separable Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) when the random walker
is biased by a velocity field in a uniformly growing domain. Concrete examples for such domains include
growing biological cells or lipid vesicles, biofilms and tissues, but also macroscopic systems
such as expanding aquifers during rainy periods, or the expanding universe. The considered CTRW
can be subdiffusive, normal diffusive or superdiffusive, including the particular case of a L\'evy
flight. We first consider the case of zero velocity field. In the subdiffusive case, we reveal an
interesting time dependence of the kurtosis of the particle probability density function. In particular,
for a suitable parameter choice, we find that the propagator, which is fat tailed at short times,
may cross over to a Gaussian-like propagator. We subsequently incorporate the effect of the velocity
field and derive a bi-fractional diffusion-advection equation encoding the time evolution of
the particle distribution. We apply this equation to study the mixing kinetics of two diffusing
pulses, whose peaks move towards each other under the action of velocity fields acting in opposite
directions. This deterministic motion of the peaks, together with the diffusive spreading of each
pulse, tends to increase particle mixing, thereby counteracting the peak separation induced by
the domain growth. As a result of this competition, different regimes of mixing arise. In the case
of L\'evy flights, apart from the non-mixing regime, one has two different mixing regimes in the
long-time limit, depending on the exact parameter choice: In one of these regimes, mixing is mainly
driven by diffusive spreading, while in the other mixing is controlled by the velocity fields acting
on each pulse. Possible implications for encounter-controlled reactions in real systems are discussed.
