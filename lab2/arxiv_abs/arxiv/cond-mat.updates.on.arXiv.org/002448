Tiny-sized particles under the scheme of monolayer assembly, comprising gold atoms, developed
at a different processing time in a pulse-based process. For a different processing time, atoms
bind into different tiny particles under the placing packets of nanoshape energy where they elongate
as per arrangement and when in one-dimensional arrays, they convert into structures of smooth elements.
For different processing time and where tiny particles possess triangular-shape, they pack to
develop extended shapes where development rate of an anisotropic particle is not more than millisecond
time. Increasing the processing time of solution upto certain duration increases the number of
developing tiny particles in a triangular-shape, so, their extended shapes also. Uniformly adjacent-orientation
of electrons in atoms of tiny-shaped particle is because of exerting uniform surface force along
their opposite poles as per gained potential energy where stretching of their clamped energy knots
is remained orientational-based. At a different processing time, inter-spacing distance of spotted
intensity spots in selective area photons reflection patterns of particles is remained the same
as for the case of their structures of smooth elements visualized through transmission microscope
high-resolution images. When the forceful coinciding of two parallel structures of smooth elements
is occurred, they bind into single element structure of smooth element by a bit overlying inner sides,
thus, giving its double width where certain filled state electrons and unfilled energy knots belonging
to sides of elongated atoms of parallel structures of smooth elements coordinate to adhere. This
study discusses the formation of tiny particles following by their extended shapes at different
processing time of gold solution while employing a pulse-based electron-photon solution-interface
process where they become the origin
