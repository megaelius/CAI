We consider a simplified model for gene regulation, where gene expression is regulated by transcription
factors (TFs), which are single proteins or protein complexes. Proteins are in turn synthesised
from expressed genes, creating a feedback loop of regulation. This leads to a directed bipartite
network in which a link from a gene to a TF exists if the gene codes for a protein contributing to the
TF, and a link from a TF to a gene exists if the TF regulates the expression of the gene. Both genes and
TFs are modelled as binary variables, which indicate, respectively, whether a gene is expressed
or not, and a TF is synthesised or not. We consider the scenario where for a TF to be synthesised, all
of its contributing genes must be expressed. This results in an "AND" gate logic for the dynamics
of TFs. By adapting percolation theory to directed bipartite graphs, evolving according to the
AND logic dynamics, we are able to determine the region, in the network parameter space, where bipartite
networks can support extensive gene expression, as required in stable cell types. In particular,
the analysis reveals the possibility of a bi-stability region, where extensive gene expression
can be either sustained or not sustained, depending on the initial network state, which is remarkably
different from the transition observed in standard percolation theory. Finally, we investigate
the resilience of global gene expression against node elimination protocols which mimic gene knockout
experiments. Results reveal that gene regulatory networks inferred from gene knockout experiments
may substantially differ from the network of effective gene-gene interactions extracted from
the underlying bipartite graph.
