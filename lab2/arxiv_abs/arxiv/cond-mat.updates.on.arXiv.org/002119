Conspectus: The ability to navigate in chemical gradients, called chemotaxis, is crucial for the
survival of microorganisms. It allows them to find food and to escape from toxins. Many microorganisms
can produce the chemicals to which they respond themselves and use chemotaxis for signalling which
can be seen as a basic form of communication. Remarkably, the past decade has let to the development
of synthetic microswimmers like e.g. autophoretic Janus colloids, which can self-propel through
a solvent, analogously to bacteria and other microorganims. The mechanism underlying their self-propulsion
involves the production of certain chemicals. The same chemicals involved in the self-propulsion
mechanism also act on other microswimmers and bias their swimming direction towards (or away from)
the producing microswimmer. Synthetic microswimmers therefore provide a synthetic analogue
to chemotactic motile microorganisms. When these interactions are attractive, they commonly
lead to clusters, even at low particle density. These clusters may either proceed towards macrophase
separation, resembling Dictyostelium aggregation, or, as shown very recently, lead to dynamic
clusters of self-limited size (dynamic clustering) as seen in experiments in autophoretic Janus
colloids. Besides the classical case where chemical interactions are attractive, this Account
discusses, as its main focus, repulsive chemical interactions, which can create a new and less known
avenue to pattern formation in active systems leading to a variety of pattern, including clusters
which are surrounded by shells of chemicals, travelling waves and more complex continously reshaping
patterns. In all these cases `synthetic signalling' can crucially determine the collective behavior
of synthetic microswimmer ensembles and can be used as a design principle to create patterns in motile
active particles.
