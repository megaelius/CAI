We study experimentally the motion and deformation of individual capsules transported by a constant
volume-flux flow of low Reynolds number, through the T-junction of a channel with rectangular cross-section.
We use millimetric ovalbumin-alginate capsules which we manufacture and characterise independently
of the flow experiment. Centred capsules travel at constant velocity down the straight channel
leading to the T-junction where they decelerate and expand in the spanwise direction before turning
into one of the two identical daughter channels. There, non-inertial lift forces act to re-centre
them and relax their shape until they reach a steady state of propagation. We find that the dynamics
of fixed-size capsules within our channel geometry are governed by a capillary number Ca defined
as the ratio of viscous shear forces to elastic restoring forces. We quantify the elastic forces
by statically compressing the capsule to 50% of its initial diameter between parallel plates rather
than by the Young's modulus of the encapsulating membrane, in order to account for different membrane
thickness, pre-inflation and non-linear elastic deformation. We show that the maximum extension
in the T-junction of capsules of different stiffness collapses onto a master curve in Ca. Thus, it
provides a sensitive measure of the relative stiffness of capsules at constant flow rate, particularly
for softer capsules. We also find that the T-junction can sort fixed-size capsules according to
their stiffness because the position in the T-junction from which capsules are entrained into the
daughter channel depends uniquely on Ca. We demonstrate that a T-junction can be used as a sorting
device by enhancing this initial capsule separation through a diffuser.
