Body-centered cubic (bcc) refractory multicomponent alloys are of great interest due to their
remarkable strength at high temperatures. Meanwhile, further optimizing the chemical compositions
of these alloys to achieve a combination of high strength and room-temperature ductility remains
challenging, which would require systematic predictions of the correlated alloy properties across
a vast compositional space. In the present work, we performed first-principles calculations with
the special quasi-random structure (SQS) method to predict the unstable stacking fault energy
($\gamma_{usf}$) of the $(1\bar10)[111]$ slip system and the $(1\bar10)$-plane surface energy
($\gamma_{surf}$) for 106 individual binary, ternary and quaternary bcc solid-solution alloys
with constituent elements among Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Re and Ru. Moreover, with the first-principles
data and a set of physics-informed descriptors, we developed surrogate models based on statistical
regression to accurately and efficiently predict $\gamma_{usf}$ and $\gamma_{surf}$ for refractory
multicomponent alloys in the 10-element compositional space. Building upon binary and ternary
data, the surrogate models show outstanding predictive ability in the high-order multicomponent
systems. The ratio between $\gamma_{surf}$ and $\gamma_{usf}$ is a parameter to reflect the potency
of intrinsic ductility of an alloy based on the Rice model of crack-tip deformation. Therefore,
using the surrogate models, we performed a systematic screening of $\gamma_{usf}$, $\gamma_{surf}$
and their ratio over 112,378 alloy compositions to search for alloy candidates that may have enhanced
strength-ductile synergies. Search results were also confirmed by additional first-principles
calculations.
