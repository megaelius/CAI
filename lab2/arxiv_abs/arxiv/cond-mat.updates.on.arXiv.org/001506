Due to potential applications in nano- and opto-electronics, two-dimensional (2D) materials
have attracted tremendous interest. Their thermal transport properties are closely related to
the performance of 2D materials-based devices. Here, the phonon transports of monolayer GeC with
a perfect planar hexagonal honeycomb structure are investigated by solving the linearized phonon
Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). Without inclusion
of Born effective charges ($Z^*$) and dielectric constants ($\varepsilon$), the lattice thermal
conductivity ($\kappa_L$) almost decreases linearly above 350 K, deviating from the usual $\kappa_L$$\sim$$1/T$
law. The underlying mechanism is because the contribution to $\kappa_L$ from high-frequency optical
phonon modes increases with increasing temperature, and the contribution exceeds one from acoustic
branches at high temperature. These can be understood by huge phonon band gap caused by large difference
in atom mass between Ge and C atoms, which produces important effects on scattering process involving
high-frequency optical phonon. When considering $Z^*$ and $\varepsilon$, the phonon group velocities
and phonon lifetimes of high-frequency optical phonon modes are obviously reduced with respect
to ones without $Z^*$ and $\varepsilon$. The reduced group velocities and phonon lifetimes give
rise to small contribution to $\kappa_L$ from high-frequency optical phonon modes, which produces
the the traditional $\kappa_L$$\sim$$1/T$ relation in monolayer GeC. Calculated results show
that the isotope scattering can also reduce anomalous temperature dependence of $\kappa_L$ in
monolayer GeC. Our works highlight the importance of $Z^*$ and $\varepsilon$ to investigate phonon
transports of monolayer GeC.
