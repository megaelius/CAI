There are several FeSe based superconductors, including the bulk FeSe, monolayer FeSe thin film,
intercalated KxFe2-ySe2 and Li1-xFexOHFeSe, etc. Their normal states all show metallic behavior.
The key player here is the FeSe layer which exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature
in the form of monolayer thin film. Recently a new FeSe based compound, CsFe4-xSe4 with the space
group of Bmmm was found. Interestingly the system shows a strong insulator-like behavior although
it shares the same FeSe planes as other relatives. Density functional theory calculations indicate
that it should be a metal, in sharp contrast with the experimental observations. Here we report the
emergence of unconventional superconductivity by applying pressure to suppress this insulator-like
behavior. At ambient pressure, the insulator-like behavior cannot be modeled as a band insulator,
but can be described by the variable-range-hopping model for correlated systems. Furthermore,
the specific heat down to 400 mK has been measured and a significant residual coefficient gamma_0=C/T|T->0
is observed, which contrasts the insulator-like state and suggests some quantum freedom of spin
dynamics. By applying pressure the insulator-like behavior is gradually suppressed and the system
becomes a metal, finally superconductivity is achieved at about 5.1 K. The superconducting transition
strongly depends on magnetic field and applied current, indicating a fragile superfluid density.
Our results suggest that the superconductivity is established by diluted Cooper pairs on top of
a strong correlation background in CsFe4-xSe4.
