We perform a comprehensive theoretical study of the pressure-induced evolution of the electronic
structure, magnetic state, and phase stability of the late transition metal monoxides MnO, FeO,
CoO, and NiO using a fully charge self-consistent DFT+dynamical mean-field theory method. Our
results reveal that the pressure-induced Mott insulator-to-metal phase transition in MnO-NiO
is accompanied by a simultaneous collapse of local magnetic moments and lattice volume, implying
a complex interplay between chemical bonding and electronic correlations. We compute the pressure-induced
evolution of relative weights of the different valence states and spin-state configurations.
Employing the concept of fluctuating valence in a correlated solid, we demonstrate that in MnO,
FeO, and CoO a Mott insulator-metal transition and collapse of the local moments is accompanied
by a sharp crossover of the spin-state and valence configurations. Our microscopic explanation
of the magnetic collapse differs from the accepted picture and points out a remarkable dynamical
coexistence (frustration) of the high-, intermediate-, and low-spin states. In particular, in
MnO, the magnetic collapse is found to be driven by the appearance of the intermediate-spin state
(IS), competing with the low-spin (LS) state; in FeO, we observe a conventional high-spin to low-spin
(HS-LS) crossover. Most interestingly, in CoO, we obtain a remarkable (dynamical) coexistence
of the HS and LS states, i.e., a HS-LS frustration, up to high pressure. Our results demonstrate the
importance of quantum fluctuations of the valence and spin states for the understanding of quantum
criticality of the Mott transitions.
