Epitaxial La1.85Sr0.15CuO4/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 superlattices on (001)-oriented LaSrAlO4 substrates
have been grown with pulsed laser deposition technique. Their structural, magnetic and superconducting
properties have been determined with in-situ reflection high energy electron diffraction, x-ray
diffraction, specular neutron reflectometry, scanning transmission electron microscopy, electric
transport, and magnetization measurements. We find that despite the large mismatch between the
in-plane lattice parameters of LSCO and LCMO these superlattices can be grown epitaxially and with
a high crystalline quality. While the first LSCO layer remains clamped to the LSAO substrate, a sizeable
strain relaxation occurs already in the first LCMO layer. The following LSCO and LCMO layers adopt
a nearly balanced state in which the tensile and compressive strain effects yield alternating in-plane
lattice parameters with an almost constant average value. No major defects are observed in the LSCO
layers, while a significant number of vertical antiphase boundaries are found in the LCMO layers.
The LSCO layers remain superconducting with a relatively high superconducting onset temperature
of about 36 K. The macroscopic superconducting response is also evident in the magnetization data
due to a weak diamagnetic signal below 10 K for H || ab and a sizeable paramagnetic shift for H || c that
can be explained in terms of a vortex-pinning-induced flux compression. The LCMO layers maintain
a strongly ferromagnetic state with a Curie temperature of about 190 K and a large low-temperature
saturation moment of about 3.5(1) muB. These results suggest that the LSCO/LCMO superlattices
can be used to study the interaction between the antagonistic ferromagnetic and superconducting
orders and, in combination with previous studies on YBCO/LCMO superlattices, may allow one to identify
the relevant mechanisms.
