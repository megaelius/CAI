Two formidable bottlenecks to the applicability of QMC include: (1) the sign problem and (2) algorithmic
update inefficiencies. In this thesis, I overcome both these difficulties for a class of problems
by extending the fermion bag approach to the Hamiltonian formalism and demonstrating progress
using the example of a specific quantum system known as the $t$-$V$ model, which exhibits a transition
from a semimetal to an insulator phase for a single flavor of four-component Dirac fermions. The
success of this extension is demonstrated in two ways: first, through solutions to sign problems,
and second, through the development of new efficient QMC algorithms. In addressing the first point,
I present a solution to the sign problem for the aforementioned $t$-$V$ model, which is then extended
to many other Hamiltonian models within a class that involves fermions interacting with quantum
spins. Some of these models contain an interesting quantum phase transition between a massless/semimetal
phase to a massive/insulator phase in the Gross-Neveu universality class. The second point is addressed
through the construction of a Hamiltonian fermion bag algorithm, which is then used to compute critical
exponents for the second-order phase transition in the $t$-$V$ model and is described in detail
here. The largest lattice sizes of $64^2$ at a comparably low temperature are reachable due to efficiency
gains from this Hamiltonian fermion bag algorithm. The two independent critical exponents I find,
which completely characterize the phase transition, are $\eta=.51(3)$ and $\nu=.89(1)$. The
finite size scaling fit is excellent with a $\chi^2/DOF=.90$, showing strong evidence for a second-order
critical phase transition, and hence a non-perturbative QFT can be defined at the critical point.
