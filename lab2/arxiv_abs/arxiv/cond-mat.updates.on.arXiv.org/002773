Dynamic structuring of water is a key player in a large class of processes underlying biochemical
and technological developments today, the latter often involving electric fields. However, the
anisotropic coupling between the water structure and the field has not been understood on a molecular
level so far. Here we perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations to explore the influence
of an externally imposed electric field on liquid water under ambient conditions. Using self-developed
analysis tools and rigorous statistical analysis, we unambiguously show that water hydration
shells break into subcompartments, which were hitherto not observed due to radial averaging. The
shape of subcompartments is sensitive to the field magnitude, and affects excitations of the hydrogen
bond network including the femtosecond stretching and the sub-picosecond restructuring of hydrogen
bonds. Furthermore, by analysing the reorientational dynamics of water molecules, we ascertain
the existence of cooperative excitations of small water clusters. Enabled by the interplay between
hydrogen bonding, and the coupling of water dipoles to the field, these coordinated motions, occurring
on the picosecond time scale, are associated with fluctuations between torque-free states of water
dipoles. We show that unlike the coupling between translation and reorientation of water molecules,
which takes place on even longer time scales, these coordinated motions are the key for understanding
the emergent anisotropy of diffusion and viscosity of water. Particular effort is invested to provide
an analysis that allows for future experimental validation.
