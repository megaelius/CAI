Small-scale plasticity problems are often characterised by different patterning behaviours
ranging from macroscopic down to the atomistic scale. In successful models of such complex behaviour,
its origin lies within non-convexity of the governing free energy functional. A common approach
to solve such non-convex problems numerically is by regularisation through a viscous formulation.
This, however, may require the system to be overdamped and hence potentially has a strong impact
on the obtained results. To avoid this side-effect, this paper addresses the treatment of the full
non-convexity by an appropriate numerical solution algorithm -- the truncated Newton method.
The presented method is a double iterative approach which successively generates quadratic approximations
of the energy landscape and minimises these by an inner iterative scheme, based on the conjugate
gradient method. The inner iterations are terminated when either a sufficient energy decrease
is achieved or, to incorporate the treatment of non-convexity, a direction of negative curvature
is encountered. If the latter never happens, the method reduces to Newton--Raphson iterations,
solved by the conjugate gradient method, with a subsequent line search. However, in the case of a
non-convex energy it avoids convergence to a saddle point and adds robustness. The stability of
the truncated Newton method is demonstrated for the, highly non-convex, Peierls-Nabarro model,
solved within a Finite Element framework. A potential drop in efficiency due to an occasional near
singular Hessian is remedied by a trust region like extension, which is physically based on the Peierls-Nabarro
disregistry profile. The result is an efficient numerical scheme with a high stability that is independent
of any regularisation.
