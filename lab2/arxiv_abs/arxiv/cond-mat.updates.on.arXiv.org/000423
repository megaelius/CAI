Numerical models for computing the effective critical current of devices made of HTS tapes require
the knowledge of the Jc(B,theta) dependence, i.e. of the way the critical current density Jc depends
on the magnetic flux density B and its orientation theta with respect to the tape. In this paper we
present a numerical model based on the critical state with angular field dependence of Jc to extract
the Jc(B,theta) relation from experimental data. The model takes into account the self-field created
by the tape, which gives an important contribution when the field applied in the experiments is low.
The same model can also be used to compute the effective critical current of devices composed of electromagnetically
interacting tapes. Three examples are considered here: two differently current rated Roebel cables
composed of REBCO coated conductors and a power cable prototype composed of Bi-2223 tapes. The critical
currents computed with the numerical model show good agreement with the measured ones. The simulations
reveal also that several parameter sets in the Jc(B,theta) give an equally good representation
of the experimental characterization of the tapes and that the measured Ic values of cables are subjected
to the influence of experimental conditions, such as Ic degradation due to the manufacturing and
assembling process and non-uniformity of the tape properties. These two aspects make the determination
of a very precise Jc(B,theta) expression probably unnecessary, as long as that expression is able
to reproduce the main features of the angular dependence. The easiness of use of this model, which
can be straightforwardly implemented in finite-element programs able to solve static electromagnetic
problems, is very attractive both for researchers and devices manufactures who want to characterize
superconducting tapes and calculate the effective critical current of superconducting devices.
