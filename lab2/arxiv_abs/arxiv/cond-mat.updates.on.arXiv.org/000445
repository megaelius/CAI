Even though the phenomenon of evaporation is omnipresent and has immense scientific and technological
importance, the research effort to unveil its fundamentals remains inadequately low. As one particular
consequence, the textbooks and educational courses are lacking detailed explanation of evaporation
and its effects. In order to advance fundamental theory of evaporation and increase accuracy of
evaporation simulation a novel evaporation theory is presented. This integrated Atomistic(Molecular)-Kinetics-Gasdynamics
theoretical model that combines statistical mechanics, gas dynamics and thermodynamics approaches
opens a path to detailed description of nonstationary, nonequilibrium evaporation of condensed
matter. The main innovation of the proposed approach is that, unlike all previous and current models
of evaporation that are based on the assumption of evaporation as emission of the particles that
are not bound within the condense phase, the described new model treats evaporation of condensed
phase as escape of the particles of sufficient kinetic energy out of potential well located at the
boundary of condensed and gaseous phases. Correspondingly, the re-condensation of the vapor onto
the surface is treated as entrapment of the vapor particles with kietic energy lower than the depth
of the potential well. The described novel research will open new opportunities to substantially
advance our knowledge and provide needed contributions to chemical, combustion, environmental,
climate and other sciences that utilize evaporation theory. Additionally, it will provide invaluable
new material for the undergraduate and graduate educational courses in Physics, Chemistry, Engineering,
and Material Sciences.
