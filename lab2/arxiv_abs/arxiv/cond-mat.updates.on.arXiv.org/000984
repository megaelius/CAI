We report the results of experimental studies related to implantation of thorium ions into thin
silicon dioxide by pulsed plasma fluxes expansion. Thorium ions were generated by laser ablation
from a metal target, and the ionic component of the laser plasma was accelerated in an electric field
created by the potential difference (5, 10 and 15 kV) between the ablated target and SiO2/Si(001)
sample. Laser ablation system installed inside the vacuum chamber of the electron spectrometer
was equipped with YAG:Nd3+ laser having the pulse energy of 100 mJ and time duration of 15 ns in the
Q-switched regime. Depth profile of thorium atoms implanted into the 10 nm thick subsurface areas
together with their chemical state as well as the band gap of the modified silicon oxide at different
conditions of implantation processes were studied by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and Reflected Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (REELS) methods. Analysis of chemical composition
showed that the modified silicon oxide film contains complex thorium silicates. Depending on local
concentration of thorium atoms, the experimentally established band gaps were located in the range
of 6.0 - 9.0 eV. Theoretical studies of optical properties of the SiO2 and ThO2 crystalline systems
have been performed by ab initio calculations within hybrid functional. Optical properties of
the SiO2/ThO2 composite were interpreted on the basis of Bruggeman effective medium approximation.
A quantitative assessment of the yield of isomeric nuclei in "hot" laser plasma at the early stages
of expansion has been performed. The estimates made with experimental results demonstrated that
the laser implantation of thorium ions into the SiO2 matrix can be useful for further research of
low-lying isomeric transitions in 229Th isotope with energy of 7.8(0.5) eV.
