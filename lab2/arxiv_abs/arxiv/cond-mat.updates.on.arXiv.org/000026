We present a detailed theoretical study of transverse exciton-polariton patterns in semiconductor
quantum-well microcavities. These patterns are initiated by directional instabilities in the
uniform pump-generated polariton field and are measured as optical patterns in a transverse plane
in the far field. Based on a microscopic many-particle theory, we investigate the spatio-temporal
dynamics of the formation, selection, and optical control of these patterns. An emphasis is placed
on a previously proposed low-intensity, all-optical switching scheme designed to exploit these
instability-driven patterns. Simulations and detailed analyses of simplified and more physically
transparent models are used. Two aspects are studied in detail. First we study the dependencies
of the stability behaviors of various patterns, as well as transition time scales, on parameters
relevant to the switching action(the degree of built-in azimuthal anisotropy in the system and
the switching beam intensity). It is found that if the parameters are varied, the pattern system
undergoes abrupt transitions at threshold parameter values which are accompanied by multiple-stability
and hysteresis behaviors. Moreover, during a real-time switching action, the transient dynamics
of the system may depend significantly on the proximity of unstable patterns. The second aspect
is a classification and detailed analysis of the polariton scattering processes contributing
to the pattern dynamics, giving us an understanding of the selection and control of patterns as results
of these processes' intricate interplay. The crucial role played by the relative phases of the polariton
field in determining the gains or losses of polariton densities in various momentum modes is highlighted,
and interpretation of the actions of the various processes in terms of concepts commonly used in
classical pattern-forming systems is given.
