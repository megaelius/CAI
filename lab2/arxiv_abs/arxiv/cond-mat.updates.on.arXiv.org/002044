The antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays a decisive role for the stabilization
and control of chirality of skyrmion textures in various magnetic systems exhibiting a noncentrosymmetric
crystal structure. A less studied aspect of the DMI is that this interaction is believed to be operative
in the vicinity of lattice imperfections in crystalline magnetic materials, due to the local structural
inversion symmetry breaking. If this scenario leads to an effect of sizable magnitude, it implies
that the DMI introduces chirality into a very large class of magnetic materials---defect-rich
systems such as polycrystalline magnets. Here, we show experimentally that the microstructural-defect-induced
DMI gives rise to a polarization-dependent asymmetric term in the small-angle neutron scattering
(SANS) cross section of polycrystalline ferromagnets with a centrosymmetric crystal structure.
The results are supported by theoretical predictions using the continuum theory of micromagnetics.
This effect, conjectured already by Arrott in 1963, is demonstrated for nanocrystalline terbium
and holmium (with a large grain-boundary density), and for mechanically-deformed microcrystalline
cobalt (with a large dislocation density). Analysis of the scattering asymmetry allows one to determine
the defect-induced DMI constant, $D = 0.45 \pm 0.07 \, \mathrm{mJ/m^2}$ for Tb at $100 \, \mathrm{K}$.
Our study proves the generic relevance of the DMI for the magnetic microstructure of defect-rich
ferromagnets with vanishing intrinsic DMI. Polarized SANS is decisive for disclosing the signature
of the defect-induced DMI, which is related to the unique dependence of the polarized SANS cross
section on the chiral interactions. The findings open up the way to study defect-induced skyrmionic
magnetization textures in disordered materials.
