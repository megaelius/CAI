We study the dynamics of snap-through when viscoelastic effects are present. To gain analytical
insight we analyse a modified form of the Mises truss, a single-degree-of-freedom structure, which
features an `inverted' shape that snaps to a `natural' shape. Motivated by the anomalously slow
snap-through shown by spherical elastic caps, we consider a thought experiment in which the truss
is first indented to an inverted state and allowed to relax while a specified displacement is maintained;
the constraint of an imposed displacement is then removed. Focussing on the dynamics for the limit
in which the timescale of viscous relaxation is much larger than the characteristic elastic timescale,
we show that two types of snap-through are possible: the truss either immediately snaps back over
the elastic timescale or it displays `pseudo-bistability', in which it undergoes a slow creeping
motion before rapidly accelerating. In particular, we demonstrate that accurately determining
when pseudo-bistability occurs requires the consideration of inertial effects immediately after
the indentation force is removed. Our analysis also explains many basic features of pseudo-bistability
that have been observed in experiments and numerical simulations; for example, we show that pseudo-bistability
occurs in a narrow parameter range at the bifurcation between bistability and monostability, so
that the dynamics is naturally susceptible to critical slowing down. We then study an analogous
thought experiment performed on a continuous arch, showing that the qualitative features of the
snap-through dynamics are well captured by the truss model. In addition, we analyse experimental
and numerical data of viscoelastic snap-through times reported previously in the literature.
Combining these approaches suggests that our conclusions may also extend to more complex viscoelastic
structures used in morphing applications.
