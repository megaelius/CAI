The phases of A$_2$Mn$_8$O$_{16}$ hollandite group oxides emerge from the competition between
ionic interactions, Jahn-Teller effects, charge ordering, and magnetic interactions. Their
balanced treatment with feasible computational approaches can be challenging for commonly used
approximations in Density Functional Theory. Three examples (A = Ag, Li and K) are studied with a
sequence of different approximate exchange-correlation functionals. Starting from a generalized
gradient approximation (GGA), an extension to include van der Waals interactions and a recently
proposed meta-GGA are considered. Then local Coulomb interactions for the Mn $3d$ electrons are
more explicitly considered with the DFT+$U$ approach. Finally selected results from a hybrid functional
approach provide a reference. Results for the binding energy of the A species in the parent oxide
highlight the role of van der Waals interactions. Relatively accurate results for insertion energies
can be achieved with a low $U$ and a high $U$ approach. In the low $U$ case, the materials are described
as band metals with a high symmetry, tetragonal crystal structure. In the high $U$ case, the electrons
donated by A result in formation of local Mn$^{3+}$ centers and corresponding Jahn-Teller distortions
characterized by a local order parameter. The resulting degree of monoclinic distortion depends
on charge ordering and magnetic interactions in the phase formed. The reference hybrid functional
results show charge localization and ordering. Comparison to low temperature experiments of related
compounds suggests that charge localization is the physically correct result for the hollandite
group oxides studied here. . . .
