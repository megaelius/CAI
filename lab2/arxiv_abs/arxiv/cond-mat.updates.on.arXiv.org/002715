Crystallographic shear phases of niobium oxide form an interesting family of compounds that have
received attention both for their unusual electronic and magnetic properties, as well as their
performance as intercalation electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Here, we present
a first-principles density-functional theory study of the electronic structure and magnetism
of H-Nb$_2$O$_5$, Nb$_{25}$O$_{62}$, Nb$_{47}$O$_{116}$, Nb$_{22}$O$_{54}$, and Nb$_{12}$O$_{29}$.
These compounds feature blocks of niobium-oxygen octahedra as structural units, and we show that
this block structure leads to a coexistence of flat and dispersive energy bands, corresponding
to localised and delocalised electronic states. Electrons localise in orbitals spanning multiple
niobium sites in the plane of the blocks. Localised and delocalised electronic states are both effectively
one-dimensional and are partitioned between different types of niobium sites. Flat bands associated
with localised electrons are present even at the GGA level, but a correct description of the localisation
requires the use of GGA+U or hybrid functionals. We discuss the experimentally observed electrical
and magnetic properties of niobium suboxides in light of our results, and argue that their behaviour
is similar to that of $n$-doped semiconductors, but with a limited capacity for localised electrons.
When a threshold of one electron per block is exceeded, metallic electrons are added to existing
localised electrons. We propose that this behaviour of shear phases is general for any type of $n$-doping,
and should transfer to doping by alkali metal (lithium) ions during operation of niobium oxide-based
battery electrodes. Future directions for theory and experiment on mixed-metal shear phases are
suggested.
