We investigate fluid mediated effective interactions in a confined film geometry, between two
rigid, no-slip plates, where one of the plates is mobile and subjected to a random external forcing
with zero average. The fluid is assumed to be compressible and viscous, and the external surface
forcing to be of small amplitude, thus enabling a linear hydrodynamic analysis. While the transverse
and longitudinal hydrodynamic stresses (forces per unit area) acting on either of the plates vanish
on average, they exhibit significant fluctuations that can be quantified through their equal-time,
two-point correlators. For transverse (shear) stresses, the same-plate correlators on both the
fixed and the mobile plates, and also the cross-plate correlator, exhibit decaying power-law behaviors
as functions of the inter-plate separation with universal exponents: At small separations, the
exponents are given by -1 in all cases, while at large separations the exponents are found to be larger,
differing in magnitude, viz., -2 (for the same-plate correlator on the fixed plate), -4 (for the
excess same-plate correlator on the mobile plate) and -3 (for the cross-plate correlator). For
longitudinal (compressional) stresses, we find much weaker power-law decays with exponents -3/2
(for the excess same-plate correlator on the mobile plate) and -1 (for the cross-plate correlator)
in the large inter-plate separation regime. The same-plate stress correlator on the fixed plate
increases and saturates on increase of the inter-plate separation, reflecting the non-decaying
nature of the longitudinal forces acting on the fixed plate. The qualitative differences between
the transverse and longitudinal stress correlators stem from the distinct nature of the shear and
compression modes as, for instance, the latter exhibit acoustic propagation and, hence, relatively
large fluctuations across the fluid film.
