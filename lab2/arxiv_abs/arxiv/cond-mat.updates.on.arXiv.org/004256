Quasi-1D nanowires of topological insulators are emerging candidate structures in superconductor
hybrid architectures for the realization of Majorana fermion based quantum computation schemes.
It is however technically difficult to both fabricate as well as identify the 1D limit of topological
insulator nanowires. Here, we investigated selectively-grown Bi$_2$Te$_3$ topological insulator
nanoribbons and nano Hall bars at cryogenic temperatures for their topological properties. The
Hall bars are defined in deep-etched Si$_3$N$_4$/SiO$_2$ nano-trenches on a silicon (111) substrate
followed by a selective area growth process via molecular beam epitaxy. The selective area growth
is beneficial to the device quality, as no subsequent fabrication needs to be performed to shape
the nanoribbons. Transmission line measurements are performed to evaluate contact resistances
of Ti/Au contacts applied as well as the specific resistance of the Bi$_2$Te$_3$ binary topological
insulator. In the diffusive transport regime of these unintentionally $n$-doped Bi$_2$Te$_3$
topological insulator nano Hall bars, we identify distinguishable electron trajectories by analyzing
angle-dependent universal conductance fluctuation spectra. When the sample is tilted from a perpendicular
to a parallel magnetic field orientation, these high frequent universal conductance fluctuations
merge with low frequent Aharonov-Bohm type oscillations originating from the topologically protected
surface states encircling the nanoribbon cross section. For 500 nm wide Hall bars we also identify
low frequent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the perpendicular field orientation, that reveal
a topological high-mobility 2D transport channel, partially decoupled from the bulk of the material.
