We study the electronic transport properties of topological zero-line modes network in twisted
bilayer graphene. The intersection of three topological zero-lines is the elementary current
partition node that arises in twisted bilayer graphene due to moire patterns of six alternating
gapped AB/BA stacking regions. Unlike the partition laws of two intersecting zero-lines, we find
that (i) the incoming current can be partitioned into both left-right adjacent topological channels
and that (ii) the forward-propagating current is nonzero. By tuning the Fermi energy from the charge-neutrality
point to a band edge, the currents partitioned into the three outgoing channels become nearly equal.
Moreover, upon applying a perpendicular electric field, we observe electronic transport through
the network formed by such partition nodes is direction-dependent. We find that when the direction
from the incoming current terminal to outgoing current terminal parallel to one of the zero-lines,
the conductance of the network is quantized and robust against the backscattering. But when the
direction from incoming current terminal to outgoing current terminal perpendicular to one of
the zero-lines, the network is an insulator. Importantly, we find that the incoming current can
transport only near the network boundaries by keeping Fermi energy near the charge neutrality points,
which makes the topological network device even more robust. Our results provide a comprehensive
depiction of the electronic transport properties of a topological zero-line network and have far-reaching
implications in the design of electron-beam splitters and low-power-consuming topological quantum
devices.
