Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have become an important class of semiconductors
for solar cells and other optoelectronic applications. Electron-phonon coupling plays a critical
role in all optoelectronic devices, and although the lattice dynamics and phonon frequencies of
HOIPs have been well studied, little attention has been given to phonon lifetimes. We report the
first high-precision measurements of acoustic phonon lifetimes in the hybrid perovskite methylammonium
lead iodide (MAPI), using inelastic neutron spectroscopy to provide high energy resolution and
fully deuterated single crystals to reduce incoherent scattering from hydrogen. Our measurements
reveal extremely short lifetimes on the order of picoseconds, corresponding to nanometer mean
free paths and demonstrating that acoustic phonons are unable to dissipate heat efficiently. Lattice-dynamics
calculations using ab-initio third-order perturbation theory indicate that the short lifetimes
stem from strong three-phonon interactions and a high density of low-energy optical phonon modes
related to the degrees of freedom of the organic cation. Such short lifetimes have significant implications
for electron-phonon coupling in MAPI and other HOIPs, with direct impacts on optoelectronic devices
both in the cooling of hot carriers and in the transport and recombination of band edge carriers.
These findings illustrate a fundamental difference between HOIPs and conventional photovoltaic
semiconductors and demonstrate the importance of understanding lattice dynamics in the effort
to develop metal halide perovskite optoelectronic devices.
