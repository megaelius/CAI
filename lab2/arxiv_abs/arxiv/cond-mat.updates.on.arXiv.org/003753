An outstanding feature of topological quantum materials is the current-induced spin polarization
due to the unique spin-momentum locking (SML) characteristics of topological states. However,
electrical creation and detection of spin polarization of Dirac surface states in topological
insulators by reliable non-local methods as well as the spin injection functionality into non-magnetic
materials are so far limited to cryogenic temperatures due to the parallel bulk band conduction
issues. Here, we report current-induced spin polarization, i.e. the Edelstein effect (EE) and
its inverse phenomenon (IEE) in type-II Weyl semimetal WTe2 up to room temperature. Contrary to
the conventional spin Hall and 2D Rashba-Edelstein effects, our measurements show an out-of-plane
electrical field-induced spin polarization in WTe2 due to SML of the spin-polarized bulk Fermi
states. Such perpendicular spin-current channel is possible in WTe2 due to its lower crystal symmetry,
large Berry curvature and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) with a novel spin-texture of the bulk bands.
We demonstrate the robust electrical creation and detection of spin polarization by EE and IEE,
respectively, and utilized such spin polarization to efficiently induce a non-equilibrium spin
accumulation in the adjacent graphene channel up to room temperature. These findings open opportunities
for utilizing topological Weyl materials as non-magnetic spin sources in all-electrical van der
Waals spintronic circuits and understanding their novel spin functionalities at ambient temperature
by design of crystal symmetry, SOI, Berry curvature and their spin textures.
