Fish, birds, insects and robots frequently swim or fly in groups. During their 3 dimensional collective
motion, these agents do not stop, they avoid collisions by strong short-range repulsion, and achieve
group cohesion by weak long-range attraction. In a minimal model that is isotropic, and continuous
in both space and time, we demonstrate that (i) adjusting speed to a preferred value, combined with
(ii) radial repulsion and an (iii) effective long-range attraction are sufficient for the stable
ordering of autonomously moving agents in space. Our results imply that beyond these three rules
ordering in space requires no further rules, for example, explicit velocity alignment, anisotropy
of the interactions or the frequent reversal of the direction of motion, friction, elastic interactions,
sticky surfaces, a viscous medium, or vertical separation that prefers interactions within horizontal
layers. Noise and delays are inherent to the communication and decisions of all moving agents. Thus,
next we investigate their effects on ordering in the model. First, we find that the amount of noise
necessary for preventing the ordering of agents is not sufficient for destroying order. In other
words, for realistic noise amplitudes the transition between order and disorder is rapid. Second,
we demonstrate that ordering is more sensitive to displacements caused by delayed interactions
than to uncorrelated noise (random errors). Third, we find that with changing interaction delays
the ordered state disappears at roughly the same rate, whereas it emerges with different rates.
In summary, we find that the model discussed here is simple enough to allow a fair understanding of
the modeled phenomena, yet sufficiently detailed for the description and management of large flocks
with noisy and delayed interactions. Our code is available at this http URL
