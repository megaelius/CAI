We expand on the investigation of the universal scaling properties in the early time behaviour of
fast but smooth quantum quenches in a general $d$-dimensional conformal field theory deformed
by a relevant operator of dimension $\Delta$ with a time-dependent coupling. The quench consists
of changing the coupling from an initial constant value $\lambda_1$ by an amount of the order of $\delta
\lambda$ to some other final value $\lambda_2$, over a time scale $\delta t$. In the fast quench limit
where $\delta t$ is smaller than all other length scales in the problem, $ \delta t \ll \lambda_1^{1/(\Delta-d)},
\lambda_2^{1/(\Delta-d)}, \delta \lambda^{1/(\Delta-d)}$, the energy (density) injected
into the system scales as $\delta{\cal E} \sim (\delta \lambda)^2 (\delta t)^{d-2\Delta}$. Similarly,
the change in the expectation value of the quenched operator at times earlier than the endpoint of
the quench scales as $<{\cal O}_\Delta> \sim \delta \lambda (\delta t)^{d-2\Delta}$, with further
logarithmic enhancements in certain cases. While these results were first found in holographic
studies, we recently demonstrated that precisely the same scaling appears in fast mass quenches
of free scalar and free fermionic field theories. As we describe in detail, the universal scaling
refers to renormalized quantities, in which the UV divergent pieces are consistently renormalized
away by subtracting counterterms derived with an adiabatic expansion. We argue that this scaling
law is a property of the conformal field theory at the UV fixed point, valid for arbitrary relevant
deformations and insensitive to the details of the quench protocol. Our results highlight the difference
between smooth fast quenches and instantaneous quenches where the Hamiltonian abruptly changes
at some time.
