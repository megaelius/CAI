Non-collinear antiferromagnets, with either an L1$_{2}$ cubic crystal lattice (e.g. Mn$_{3}$Ir
and Mn$_{3}$Pt) or a D0$_{19}$ hexagonal structure (e.g. Mn$_{3}$Sn and Mn$_{3}$Ge), exhibit
a number of novel phenomena of interest to topological spintronics. Amongst the cubic systems,
for example, tetragonally distorted Mn$_{3}$Pt exhibits an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE).
However, Mn$_{3}$Pt only enters a non-collinear magnetic phase close to the stoichiometric composition
and at suitably large thicknesses. Therefore, we turn our attention to Mn$_{3}$Ir, the material
of choice for use in exchange bias heterostructures. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic
and electrical transport properties of epitaxially grown, face-centered-cubic $\gamma$-Mn$_{3}$Ir
thin films with (111) crystal orientation. Relaxed films of 10 nm thickness exhibit an ordinary
Hall effect, with a hole-type carrier concentration of (2.24 $\pm$ 0.08) $\times$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-3}$.
On the other hand, TEM characterization demonstrates that ultrathin 3 nm films grow with significant
in-plane tensile strain. This may explain a small remanent moment, observed at low temperatures,
shown by XMCD spectroscopy to arise from uncompensated Mn spins. Of the order 0.02 $\mu_{B}$ / atom,
this dominates electrical transport behavior, leading to a small AHE and negative magnetoresistance.
These results are discussed in terms of crystal microstructure and chiral domain behavior, with
spatially resolved XML(C)D-PEEM supporting the conclusion that small antiferromagnetic domains,
< 20 nm in size, of differing chirality account for the absence of observed Berry curvature driven
magnetotransport effects.
