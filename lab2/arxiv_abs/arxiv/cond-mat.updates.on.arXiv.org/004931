Nodal lines inside the momentum space of three-dimensional crystalline solids are topologically
stabilized by a $\pi$-flux of Berry phase. Nodal-line rings in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems
with negligible spin-orbit coupling (here described as "nodal class AI") can carry an additional
"monopole charge", which further enhances their stability. Here, we relate two recent theoretical
advancements in the study of band topology in nodal class AI. On the one hand, cohomology classes
of real vector bundles were used to relate the monopole charge of nodal-line rings to their linking
with nodal lines formed among the occupied and among the unoccupied bands. On the other hand, homotopy
studies revealed that the generalization of the Berry-phase quantization to the case of multiple
band gaps defines a non-Abelian topological charge, which governs the possible deformations of
the nodal lines. The present work has three aims. First, we present how to efficiently wield the recently
discovered non-Abelian topological charge. Second, we apply these methods to present an independent
proof of the relation between the monopole charge and the linking structure, including all the fragile-topology
exceptions. Finally, we show that the monopole charge flips sign when braided along a path with a
non-trivial Berry phase. This facilitates a new type non-Abelian "braiding" of nodal-line rings
inside the momentum space, that has not been previously reported. The work begins with a brief review
of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric band topology, and the geometric arguments employed in our theoretical
analysis are supplemented in the appendices with formal mathematical derivations.
