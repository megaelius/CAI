Operator split forcing schemes exploiting a symmetrization principle, i.e. Strang splitting,
for cascaded lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods in two- and three-dimensions for fluid flows with impressed
local forces are presented. Analogous scheme for the passive scalar transport represented by a
convection-diffusion equation with a source term in a novel cascaded LB formulation is also derived.
They are based on symmetric applications of the split solutions of the changes on the scalar field/fluid
momentum due to the sources/forces over half time steps before and after the collision step. The
latter step is effectively represented in terms of the post-collision change of moments at zeroth
and first orders, respectively, to represent the effect of the sources on the scalar transport and
forces on the fluid flow. Such symmetrized operator split cascaded LB schemes are consistent with
the second-order Strang splitting and naturally avoid any discrete effects due to forces/sources
by appropriately projecting their effects for higher order moments. All the force/source implementation
steps are performed only in the moment space and they do not require formulations as extra terms and
their additional transformations to the velocity space. These result in particularly simpler
and efficient schemes to incorporate forces/sources in the cascaded LB methods unlike those considered
previously. Numerical study for various benchmark problems in 2D and 3D for fluid flow problems
with body forces and scalar transport with sources demonstrate the validity and accuracy, as well
as the second-order convergence rate of the symmetrized operator split forcing/source schemes
for the cascaded LB methods.
