\textsc{Quantum Package} is an open-source programming environment for quantum chemistry specially
designed for wave function methods. Its main goal is the development of determinant-driven selected
configuration interaction (sCI) methods and multi-reference second-order perturbation theory
(PT2). The determinant-driven framework allows the programmer to include any arbitrary set of
determinants in the reference space, hence providing greater methodological freedoms. The sCI
method implemented in \textsc{Quantum Package} is based on the CIPSI (Configuration Interaction
using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively) algorithm which complements the variational
sCI energy with a PT2 correction. Additional external plugins have been recently added to perform
calculations with multireference coupled cluster theory and range-separated density-functional
theory. All the programs are developed with the IRPF90 code generator, which simplifies collaborative
work and the development of new features. \textsc{Quantum Package} strives to allow easy implementation
and experimentation of new methods, while making parallel computation as simple and efficient
as possible on modern supercomputer architectures. Currently, the code enables, routinely, to
realize runs on roughly 2\,000 CPU cores, with tens of millions of determinants in the reference
space. Moreover, we have been able to push up to 12\,288 cores in order to test its parallel efficiency.
In the present manuscript, we also introduce some key new developments: i) a renormalized second-order
perturbative correction for efficient extrapolation to the full CI limit, and ii) a stochastic
version of the CIPSI selection performed simultaneously to the PT2 calculation at no extra cost.
