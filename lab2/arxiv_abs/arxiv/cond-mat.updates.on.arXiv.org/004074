A pertinent question in cavity optomechanics is whether reaching the regime of large single-photon
cooperativity, where the single-photon coupling rate exceeds the geometric mean of the cavity
and mechanical decay rates, can enable any new phenomena. We show that in some multimode optomechanical
systems, the single-photon cooperativity can indeed be a figure of merit. We first study a system
with one cavity mode and two mechanical oscillators which combines the concepts of levitated optomechanics
and coherent scattering with standard dispersive optomechanics. Later, we study a more complicated
setup comprising three cavity modes which does not rely on levitated optomechanics and only features
dispersive optomechanical interactions with direct cavity driving. These systems can effectively
realize the degenerate or the nondegenerate parametric oscillator models known from quantum optics,
but in the unusual finite-size regime for the fundamental mode(s) when the single-photon cooperativity
is large. We show that the response of these systems to a coherent optical probe can be highly nonlinear
in probe power even for average photon occupation numbers below unity. The nonlinear optomechanical
interaction has the peculiar consequence that the probe drive will effectively amplitude-squeeze
itself. For large single-photon cooperativity, this occurs for small occupation numbers, which
enables observation of nonclassical antibunching of the transmitted probe photons due to a destructive
interference effect. Finally, we show that as the probe power is increased even further, the system
enters a critical regime characterized by intrinsically nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian
states.
