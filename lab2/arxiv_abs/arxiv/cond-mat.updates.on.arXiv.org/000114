Several single-molecule studies aim to reliably extract parameters characterizing molecular
confinement or transient kinetic trapping from experimental observations. Pioneering works
from single particle tracking in membrane diffusion studies [Kusumi et al., Biophysical J., 1993]
appealed to Mean Square Displacement tools for extracting diffusivity and other parameters quantifying
the degree of confinement. More recently, the practical utility of systematically treating multiple
noise sources (including noise induced by random photon counts) through likelihood techniques
have been more broadly realized in the SPT community. However, bias induced by finite time series
sample sizes has not received great attention. Mitigating parameter bias induced by finite sampling
is important to any scientific endeavor aiming for high accuracy, but correcting for bias is a also
an important step in the construction of optimal parameter estimates. In this article, it is demonstrated
how a popular model of confinement can be corrected for finite sample bias in situations where the
underlying data exhibits Brownian diffusion and observations are measured with non-negligible
experimental noise (e.g., noise induced by finite photon counts). The work of Tang and Chen [J. Econometrics,
2009] is extended to correct for bias in the estimated corral radius (a parameter commonly used to
quantify confinement in SPT studies) in the presence of measurement noise. It is shown that the approach
presented is capable of reliably extracting the corral radius using only hundreds of discretely
sampled observations in situations where other methods (including MSD and Bayesian techniques)
would encounter serious difficulties. The ability to accurately statistically characterize
transient confinement suggests new techniques for quantifying confined and/or hop diffusion
in complex environments.
