Time-domain Brillouin scattering is an all-optical experimental technique based on ultrafast
lasers applied for generation and detection of coherent acoustic pulses on time durations of picoseconds
and length scales of nanometers. In transparent materials scattering of the probe laser beam by
the coherent phonons permits imaging of sample inhomogeneity. The transient optical reflectivity
of the sample recorded by the probe beam as the acoustic nanopulse propagates in space contains information
on the acoustical, optical, and acousto-optical parameters of the material under study. The experimental
method is based on a heterodyning where weak light pulses scattered by the coherent acoustic phonons
interfere at the photodetector with probe light pulses of significantly higher amplitude reflected
from various interfaces of the sample. The time-domain Brillouin scattering imaging is based on
Brillouin scattering and has the potential to provide all the information that researchers in material
science, physics, chemistry, biology etc., get with classic frequency-domain Brillouin scattering
of light. It can be viewed as a replacement for Brillouin scattering and Brillouin microscopy in
all investigations where nanoscale spatial resolution is either required or advantageous. Here
we review applications of time-domain Brillouin scattering for imaging of nanoporous films, ion-implanted
semiconductors and dielectrics, texture in polycrystalline materials and inside vegetable and
animal cells, and for monitoring the transformation of nanosound caused by nonlinearity and focusing.
We also discuss the perspectives and the challenges for the future.
