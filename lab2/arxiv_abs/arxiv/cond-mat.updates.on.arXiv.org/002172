A key interest in geomorphology is to predict how the shear stress $\tau$ exerted by a turbulent flow
of air or liquid onto an erodible sediment bed affects the transport load $M\tilde g$ (i.e., the submerged
weight of transported nonsuspended sediment per unit area) and its average velocity when exceeding
the sediment transport threshold $\tau_t$. Most transport rate predictions in the literature
are based on the scaling $M\tilde g\propto\tau-\tau_t$, the physical origin of which, however,
has remained controversial. Here we test the universality and study the origin of this scaling law
using particle-scale simulations of nonsuspended sediment transport driven by a large range of
Newtonian fluids. We find that the scaling coefficient is a universal approximate constant and
can be understood as an inverse granular friction coefficient (i.e., the ratio between granular
shear stress and normal-bed pressure) evaluated at the base of the transport layer (i.e., the effective
elevation of energetic particle-bed rebounds). Usually, the granular flow at this base is gaslike
and rapidly turns into the solidlike granular bed underneath: a liquidlike regime does not necessarily
exist, which is accentuated by a nonlocal granular flow rheology in both the transport layer and
bed. Hence, this transition fundamentally differs from the solid-liquid transition (i.e., yielding)
in dense granular flows even though both transitions are described by a friction law. Combining
this result with recent insights into the nature of $\tau_t$, we conclude that the transport load
scaling is a signature of a steady rebound state and unrelated to entrainment of bed sediment.
