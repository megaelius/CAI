The study of human mobility is both of fundamental importance and of great potential value. For example,
it can be leveraged to facilitate efficient city planning and improve prevention strategies when
faced with epidemics. The newfound wealth of rich sources of data---including banknote flows,
mobile phone records, and transportation data---has led to an explosion of attempts to characterize
modern human mobility. Unfortunately, the dearth of comparable historical data makes it much more
difficult to study human mobility patterns from the past. In this paper, we present an analysis of
long-term human migration, which is important for processes such as urbanization and the spread
of ideas. We demonstrate that the data record from Korean family books (called "jokbo") can be used
to estimate migration patterns via marriages from the past 750 years. We apply two generative models
of long-term human mobility to quantify the relevance of geographical information to human marriage
records in the data, and we find that the wide variety in the geographical distributions of the clans
poses interesting challenges for the direct application of these models. Using the different geographical
distributions of clans, we quantify the "ergodicity" of clans in terms of how widely and uniformly
they have spread across Korea, and we compare these results to those obtained using surname data
from the Czech Republic. To examine population flow in more detail, we also construct and examine
a population-flow network between regions. Based on the correlation between ergodicity and migration
in Korea, we identify two different types of migration patterns: diffusive and convective. We expect
the analysis of diffusive versus convective effects in population flows to be widely applicable
to the study of mobility and migration patterns across different cultures.
