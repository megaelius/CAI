We study a two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding model of a topological crystalline insulator (TCI)
protected by rotation symmetry. The model is built by stacking two Chern insulators with opposite
Chern numbers which transform under conjugate representations of the rotation group, e.g. $p_\pm$
orbitals. Despite its apparent similarity to the Kane-Mele model, it does not host stable gapless
surface states. Nevertheless the model exhibits topological responses including the appearance
of quantized fractional charge bound to rotational defects (disclinations) and the pumping of
angular momentum in response to threading an elementary magnetic flux, which are described by a
mutual Chern-Simons coupling between the electromagnetic gauge field and an effective gauge field
corresponding to the rotation symmetry. In addition, we show that although the filled bands of the
model do not admit a symmetric Wannier representation, this obstruction is removed upon the addition
of appropriate atomic orbitals, which implies `fragile' topology. As a result, the response of
the model can be derived by representing it as a superposition of atomic orbitals with positive and
negative integer coefficients. Following the analysis of the model, which serves as a prototypical
example of 2D TCIs protected by rotation, we show that all TCIs protected by point group symmetries
which do not have protected surface states are either atomic insulators or fragile phases. Remarkably,
this implies that gapless surface states exist in free electron systems if and only if there is a stable
Wannier obstruction. We then use dimensional reduction to map the problem of classifying 2D TCIs
protected by rotation to a zero-dimensional (0D) problem which is then used to obtain the complete
non-interacting classification of such TCIs as well as the reduction of this classification in
the presence of interactions.
