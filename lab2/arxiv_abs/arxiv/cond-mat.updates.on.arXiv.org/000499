An applied tension force changes the equilibrium conformations of a polymer chain tethered to a
planar substrate and thus affects the adsorption transition as well as the coil-globule and crystallization
transitions. Conversely, solvent quality and surface attraction are reflected in equilibrium
force-extension curves that can be measured in experiments. To investigate these effects theoretically,
we study tethered chains under tension with Wang-Landau simulations of a bond-fluctuation lattice
model. Applying our model to pulling experiments on biological molecules we obtain a good description
of experimental data in the intermediate force range, where universal features dominate and finite
size effects are small. For tethered chains in poor solvent, we observe the predicted two-phase
coexistence at transitions from the globule to stretched conformations and also discover direct
transitions from crystalline to stretched conformations. A phase portrait for finite chains constructed
by evaluating the density of states for a broad range of solvent conditions and tensions shows how
increasing tension leads to a disappearance of the globular phase. For chains in good solvents tethered
to hard and attractive surfaces we find the predicted scaling with the chain length in the low-force
regime and show that our results are well described by an analytical, independent-bond approximation
for the bond-fluctuation model for the highest tensions. Finally, for a hard or slightly attractive
surface the stretching of a tethered chain is a conformational change that does not correspond to
a phase transition. However, when the surface attraction is sufficient to adsorb a chain it will
undergo a desorption transition at a critical value of the applied force. Our results for force-induced
desorption show the transition to be discontinuous with partially desorbed conformations in the
coexistence region.
