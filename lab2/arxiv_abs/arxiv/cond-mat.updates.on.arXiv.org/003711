Low barrier nanomagnets have attracted a lot of research interest for their use as sources of high
quality true random number generation. More recently, low barrier nanomagnets with tunable output
have been shown to be a natural hardware platform for unconventional computing paradigms such as
probabilistic spin logic. Efficient generation and tunability of high quality random bits is critical
for these novel applications. However, current spintronic random number generators are based
on superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (SMTJs) with tunability obtained through spin transfer
torque (STT), which unavoidably leads to challenges in designing concatenated networks using
these two terminal devices. The more recent development of utilizing spin orbit torque (SOT) allows
for a three terminal device design, but can only tune in-plane magnetization freely, which is not
very energy efficient due to the needs of overcoming a large demagnetization field. In this work,
we experimentally demonstrate for the first time, a stochastic device with perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (PMA) that is completely tunable by SOT without the aid of any external magnetic field.
Our measurements lead us to hypothesize that a tilted anisotropy might be responsible for the observed
tunability. We carry out stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (sLLG) simulations to confirm our
experimental observation. Finally, we build an electrically coupled network of two such stochastic
nanomagnet based devices and demonstrate that finite correlation or anti-correlation can be established
between their output fluctuations by a weak interconnection, despite having a large difference
in their natural fluctuation time scale. Simulations based on a newly developed dynamical model
for autonomous circuits composed of low barrier nanomagnets show close agreement with the experimental
results.
