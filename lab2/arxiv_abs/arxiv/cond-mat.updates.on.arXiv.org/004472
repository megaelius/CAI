We review low and high field magnetotransport in 80 nm-thick strained HgTe, a material that belongs
to the class of strong three-dimensional topological insulators. Utilizing a top gate, the Fermi
level can be tuned from the valence band via the Dirac surface states into the conduction band and
allows studying Landau quantization in situations where different species of charge carriers
contribute to magnetotransport. Landau fan charts, mapping the conductivity $ \sigma_{xx}(V_g,
B) $ in the whole magnetic field - gate voltage range, can be divided into six areas, depending on the
state of the participating carrier species. Key findings are: (i) the interplay of bulk holes (spin-degenerate)
and Dirac surface electrons (non-degenerate), coexisting for $ E_F $ in the valence band, leads
to a periodic switching between odd and even filling factors and thus odd and even quantized Hall
voltage values. (ii) A similar though less pronounced behavior we found for coexisting Dirac surface
and conduction band electrons. (iii) In the bulk gap, quantized Dirac electrons on the top-surface
coexist at lower B with non-quantized ones on the bottom side, giving rise to quantum Hall plateau
values depending - for a given filling factor - on the magnetic field strength. In stronger $ B $ fields,
Landau level separation increases, charge transfer between different carrier species becomes
energetically favorable and leads to the formation of a global (i.e. involving top and bottom surface)
quantum Hall state. Simulations using the simplest possible theoretical approach are in line with
the basic experimental findings, describing correctly the central features of the transitions
from classical to quantum transport in the respective areas of our multicomponent charge carrier
system.
