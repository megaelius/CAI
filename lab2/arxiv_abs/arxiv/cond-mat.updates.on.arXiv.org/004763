In cell extrusion, a cell embedded in an epithelial monolayer loses its apical or basal surface and
is subsequently squeezed out of the monolayer by neighboring cells. Cell extrusions occur during
apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, or pre-cancerous cell invasion. They play important
roles in embryogenesis, homeostasis, carcinogenesis, and many other biological processes. Although
many of the molecular factors involved in cell extrusion are known, little is known about the mechanical
basis of cell extrusion. We used a three-dimensional (3D) vertex model to investigate the mechanical
stability of cells arranged in a monolayer with 3D foam geometry. We found that when the cells composing
the monolayer have homogeneous mechanical properties, cells are extruded from the monolayer when
the symmetry of the 3D geometry is broken due to an increase in cell density or a decrease in the number
of topological neighbors around single cells. Those results suggest that mechanical instability
inherent in the 3D foam geometry of epithelial monolayers is sufficient to drive epithelial cell
extrusion. In the situation where cells in the monolayer actively generate contractile or adhesive
forces under the control of intrinsic genetic programs, the forces act to break the symmetry of the
monolayer, leading to cell extrusion that is directed to the apical or basal side of the monolayer
by the balance of contractile and adhesive forces on the apical and basal sides. Although our analyses
are based on a simple mechanical model, our results are in accordance with observations of epithelial
monolayers {\it in vivo} and consistently explain cell extrusions under a wide range of physiological
and pathophysiological conditions. Our results illustrate the importance of a mechanical understanding
of cell extrusion and provide a basis by which to link molecular regulation to physical processes.
