We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the adiabatic evolution of degenerate open quantum
systems, where the dynamics is induced by time-dependent fluctuating loop paths in control parameter
space. For weak system-bath coupling, the fluctuations around a deterministic base path obey Gaussian
statistics, where we assume that the quantum adiabatic theorem is also satisfied for fluctuating
paths. We show that universal non-Abelian geometric dephasing (NAGD) contributions are contained
in the fluctuation-averaged evolution operator. This operator plays a key role in all experimental
protocols proposed in this work for the detection of NAGD. In particular, we formulate interference
measurements providing full access to NAGD. Apart from a factor due to the dynamic phase and its fluctuations,
the averaged evolution operator contains the averaged Berry matrix. A polar decomposition of this
non-unitary matrix into the product of a unitary, $V$, and a positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix,
$R$, reveals the physics of the NAGD contributions. Unlike the conventional dynamic dephasing
rate, the NAGD eigenrates encoded by $R$ depend on the loop orientation sense and, in particular,
change sign under a reversal of the direction. A negative rate then implies amplification of coherences
as compared to the ones when only dynamic dephasing is present. The non-Abelian character of geometric
dephasing is rooted in the non-commutativity of $V$ and $R$ and causes smoking-gun signatures in
interference experiments. We also clarify why systems subject to topological protection do not
show geometric dephasing. Without full protection, however, geometric dephasing can arise and
has to be taken into account. As concrete application, we propose spin-echo NAGD detection protocols
for modified Majorana braiding setups.
