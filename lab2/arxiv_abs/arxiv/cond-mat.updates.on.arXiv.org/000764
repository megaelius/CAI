Multidimensional coherent optical spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools for investigating
complex quantum mechanical systems. While it was conceived decades ago in magnetic resonance spectroscopy
using micro- and radio-waves, it has recently been extended into the visible and UV spectral range.
However, resolving MHz energy splittings with ultrashort laser pulses has still remained a challenge.
Here, we analyze two-dimensional Fourier spectra for resonant optical excitation of resident
electrons to localized trions or donor-bound excitons in semiconductor nanostructures subject
to a transverse magnetic field. Particular attention is devoted to Raman coherence spectra which
allow one to accurately evaluate tiny splittings of the electron ground state and to determine the
relaxation times in the electron spin ensemble. A stimulated step-like Raman process induced by
a sequence of two laser pulses creates a coherent superposition of the ground state doublet which
can be retrieved only optically due to selective excitation of the same sub-ensemble with a third
pulse. This provides the unique opportunity to distinguish between different complexes that are
closely spaced in energy in an ensemble. The related experimental demonstration is based on photon
echo measurements in an n-type CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum well structure detected by a heterodyne
technique. The difference in the sub-$\mu$eV range between the Zeeman splittings of donor-bound
electrons and electrons localized at potential fluctuations can be resolved even though the homogeneous
linewidth of the optical transitions is larger by two orders of magnitude.
