We have studied potassium-intercalated bulk HfS$_2$ and HfSe$_2$ by combining transmission electron
energy loss spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional
theory calculations. Calculations of the formation energies and the evolution of the energies
of the charge carrier plasmons as a function of the potassium content show that certain, low potassium
concentrations $x$ are thermodynamically unstable. This leads to the coexistence of undoped and
doped domains if the provided amount of the alkali metal is insufficient to saturate the whole crystal
with the minimum thermodynamically stable potassium stoichiometry. Beyond this threshold concentration
the domains disappear, while the alkali metal and charge carrier concentrations increase continuously
upon further addition of potassium. At low intercalation levels, electron diffraction patterns
indicate a significant degree of disorder in the crystal structure. The initial order in the out-of-plane
direction is restored at high $x$ while the crystal layer thicknesses expand by 33-36%. Superstructures
emerge parallel to the planes which we attribute to the distribution of the alkali metal rather than
structural changes of the host materials. The in-plane lattice parameters change by not more than
1%. The introduction of potassium causes the formation of charge carrier plasmons. The observation
of this semiconductor-to-metal transition is supported by calculations of the density of states
(DOS) and band structures as well as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The calculated
DOS hint at the presence of an almost ideal two-dimensional electron gas at the Fermi level for $x<0.6$.
The plasmons exhibit quadratic momentum dispersions which is in agreement with the behavior expected
for an ideal electron gas.
