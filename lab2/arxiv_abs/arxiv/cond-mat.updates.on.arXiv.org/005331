Material representations that are compatible with machine learning models play a key role in developing
models that exhibit high accuracy for property prediction. Atomic orbital interactions are one
of the important factors that govern the properties of crystalline materials, from which the local
chemical environments of atoms is inferred. Therefore, to develop robust machine learningmodels
for material properties prediction, it is imperative to include features representing such chemical
attributes. Here, we propose the Orbital Graph Convolutional Neural Network (OGCNN), a crystal
graph convolutional neural network framework that includes atomic orbital interaction features
that learns material properties in a robust way. In addition, we embedded an encoder-decoder network
into the OGCNN enabling it to learn important features among basic atomic (elemental features),
orbital-orbital interactions, and topological features. We examined the performance of this
model on a broad range of crystalline material data to predict different properties. We benchmarked
the performance of the OGCNN model with that of: 1) the crystal graph convolutional neural network
(CGCNN), 2) other state-of-the-art descriptors for material representations including Many-body
Tensor Representation (MBTR) and the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), and 3) other conventional
regression machine learning algorithms where different crystal featurization methods have been
used. We find that OGCNN significantly outperforms them. The OGCNN model with high predictive accuracy
can be used to discover new materials among the immense phase and compound spaces of materials
