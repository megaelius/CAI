The most abundant terrestrial lavas, mid-ocean ridge and ocean island basalt (MORB and OIB), are
commonly considered to be derived from a depleted MORB-mantle component and more specific, variably
enriched mantle plume sources. However, findings of oceanic lavas and mafic cumulates issued from
melts, enriched in chlorine and having a radiogenic Sr ratio, can be attributed to an interaction
between the asthenosphere-derived melts and lithospheric peridotite variably hydrated due to
penetration of hydrothermal water down to and below Moho level. To constrain mechanisms and rates
responsible for the interaction, we report results of experiments of reaction between serpentinite
and tholeiitic basaltic melt. Results show that the reaction proceeds via a multi-stage mechanism:
(i) transformation of serpentinite into Cr-rich spinel-bearing harzburgite containing pore
fluid, (ii) partial melting and dissolution of the harzburgite assemblage with formation of interstitial
hydrous melts, and (iii) final assimilation of the Cr-rich spinel-bearing harzburgite/dunite
and formation of hybrid basaltic melts with high MgO and elevated Cr and Ni contents. Assimilation
of serpentinite by basaltic melt may occur under elevated melt/rock ratios and may lead to chromitite
formation. Our experiments provide evidence that MORB and high-Mg-Cr orthopyroxene-rich cumulates
depleted in incompatible elements can be produced from common mid-ocean ridge basaltic melts modified
by reaction with hydrated lithospheric peridotite. We established that the rate of assimilation
of serpentinized peridotite is controlled by silica diffusion in the reacting hydrous basaltic
melt.
