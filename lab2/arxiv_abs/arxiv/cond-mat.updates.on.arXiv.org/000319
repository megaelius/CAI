We propose a class of variational wavefunctions, namely the correlated resonating valence bond
(CRVB) states, for the frustrated Hamiltonians in the paramagnetic phase. This class of wavefunctions
allow negative amplitude and the same sublattice pairing when a bipartite lattice is considered,
however it suffers from the sign problem if handled via variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. Fortunately,
this class of wavefunction can be approximated written in the language of projected entangled pair
states (PEPSs), thus the sign problem can be lifted. We apply this wavefunction to the $J_1-J_2$
Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice in the coupling region $J_2\in [0.45:0.56]$.
Two approaches have been taken to determine the nature of the intermediate phase: first, we make
extensive VMC simulation to optimize the variational parameters on a relatively small systems
up to $8\times 8$; second, we approximate the optimized wavefunction with a PEPS and calculate the
correlation functions on a $32\times 32$ torus. We find that the paramagnetic phase is a gapless
spin liquid in the entire range of $J_2\in [0.45:0.56]$ with a gapless singlet excitation and a gaped
triplet excitation. We then perform several steps (up to three) of ground state projection to these
wavefunctions at the optimized parameters, the energies before projection are competitive with
the slave fermion projective BCS wavefunction without Lanczos optimization, and the energies
after projection are consistent with the state of arts density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
results and the projective BCS wavefunction after Lanczos optimization.
