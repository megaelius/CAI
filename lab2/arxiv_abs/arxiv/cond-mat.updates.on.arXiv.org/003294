Methods derived from the generalized quantum master equation (GQME) framework have provided the
basis for elucidating energy and charge transfer in systems ranging from molecular solids to photosynthetic
complexes. Recently, the non-perturbative combination of the GQME with quantum-classical methods
has resulted in approaches whose accuracy and efficiency exceed those of the original quantum-classical
schemes while offering significant accuracy improvements over perturbative expansions of the
GQME. Here we show that, while the non-Markovian memory kernel required to propagate the GQME scales
quartically with the number of subsystem states, the number of trajectories required scales at
most quadratically when using quantum-classical methods to construct the kernel. We then present
an algorithm that allows further acceleration of the quantum-classical GQME by providing a way
to selectively sample the kernel matrix elements that are most important to the process of interest.
We demonstrate the utility of these advances by applying the combination of Ehrenfest mean field
theory with the GQME (MF-GQME) to models of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex and the light
harvesting complex II (LHCII), with 7 and 14 states, respectively. This allows us to show that MF-GQME
is able to accurately capture all the relevant dynamical time-scales in LHCII: the initial nonequilibrium
population transfer on the femtosecond time-scale, the steady state-type trapping on the picosecond
time-scale, and the long time population relaxation. Remarkably, all of these physical effects
spanning tens of picoseconds can be encoded in a memory kernel that decays after only $\sim$65 fs.
