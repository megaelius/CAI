Gaussian deformation in graphene structures exhibits an interesting effect in which flower-shaped
confinement states are observed in the deformed region [Carrillo-Bastos et al., Phys. Rev. B 90
041411 (2014)]. To exploit such a deformation for various applications, tunable electronic features
including a bandgap opening for semi-metallic structures are expected. Besides, the effects of
disorders and external excitations also need to be considered. In this work, we present a systematic
study on quantum transport of graphene ribbons with Gaussian deformation. Different levels of
deformation are explored to find a universal behavior of the electron transmission. Using a tight-binding
model in combination with Non-Equilibrium Green Functions formalism, we show that Gaussian deformation
influences strongly the electronic properties of ribbons in which the electron transmission decreases
remarkably in high energy regions even if small deformations are considered. Interestingly, it
unveils that the first plateau of the transmission of semi-metallic armchair ribbons is just weakly
affected in the case of small deformations. However, significant large Gaussian bumps can induce
a strong drop of this plateau and a transport gap is formed. The transmission at the zero energy is
found to decrease exponentially with increasing the size of the Gaussian bump. Moreover, the gap
of semi-conducting ribbons is enlarged with large deformations. The opening or the widening of
the transport gap in large deformed armchair structures is interpreted by a formation of a three-zone
behavior along the transport direction of the hopping profile. On the other hand, a transport gap
is not observed in zigzag ribbons regardless of the size of Gaussian bumps. This behavior is due to
the strong localization of edge states at the energy point E = 0...
