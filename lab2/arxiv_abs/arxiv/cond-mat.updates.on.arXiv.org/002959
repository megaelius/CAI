This work demonstrates the use of imidazolium-based poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) as efficient dispersants
of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). With these polymeric dispersants, highly stable fine
dispersions of MWCNTs (inks) can be easily prepared in aqueous media and applied for rather simple
but efficient surface modification of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs). Such a modification
of SPEs remarkably increases the electroactive surface area and accelerates the electron transfer
rate due to synergistic combination of specific features of MWCNTs such as strong adsorptive property
and high specific surface with the advantages of PILs like ion conductivity and dispersability.
We further show that the PIL/MWCNT-modified SPEs can be beneficially utilized for direct electrochemical
analysis of double stranded DNA (dsDNA). Specifically, it is exemplified by the direct electrooxidation
of guanine and adenine bases in salmon testes dsDNA chosen as a model system. The linear ranges for
the determination of dsDNA correspond to 5-500 microg per mL for the oxidative peak of guanine and
0.5-50 microg per mL for the oxidative peak of adenine. This makes direct electrochemical dsDNA
detection with the use of the easy-preparable PIL/MWCNT-modified SPEs strongly competing to currently
applied spectral and fluorescent techniques. Furthermore, we show that the developed constructs
are capable of sensing a single point mutation in the 12-bases single-stranded DNA fragments. Such
detection is of high clinical significance in choosing an adequate anticancer treatment, where
the electrochemical identification of the point mutation could offer time and cost benefits.
