The study of the phase ordering kinetics of the ferromagnetic one-dimensional Ising model dates
back to 1963 for non conserved order parameter (NCOP) and to 1991 for conserved order parameter (COP).
The case of long range interactions $J(r)$ has been widely studied at equilibrium but their effect
on relaxation is a much less investigated field. Here we make a detailed numerical and analytical
study of both cases, NCOP and COP. Many results are valid for any positive, decreasing coupling $J(r)$,
but we focus specifically on the exponential case, $J_{exp}(r)=e^{-r/R}$ with varying $R>0$,
and on the integrable power law case, $J_{pow}(r) =1/r^{1+\sigma}$ with $\sigma > 0$. We find that
the {\it asymptotic} growth law $L(t)$ is the usual algebraic one, $L(t)\sim t^{1/z}$, of the corresponding
model with nearest neighborg interaction ($z_{NCOP}=2$ and $z_{COP}=3$) for all models except
$J_{pow}$ for small $\sigma$: in the non conserved case when $\sigma\le 1$ ($z_{NCOP}=\sigma+1$)
and in the conserved case when $\sigma\to 0^+$ ($z_{COP}=4\beta+3$, where $\beta=1/T$ is the inverse
of the absolute temperature). The models with space decaying interactions also differ markedly
from the ones with nearest neighbors due to the presence of many long-lasting preasymptotic regimes,
such as an exponential mean-field behavior with $L(t)\sim e^{t}$, a ballistic one with $L(t)\sim
t$, a slow (logarithmic) behavior $L(t)\sim \ln t$ and one with $L(t)\sim t^{1/\sigma+1}$. All
these regimes and their validity ranges have been found analytically and verified in numerical
simulations. Our results show that the main effect of the conservation law is a strong slowdown of
COP dynamics if interactions have an extended range. Finally, we compare the Ising model at hand
with continuum approaches based on a Ginzburg-Landau free energy.
