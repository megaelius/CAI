In this this paper we introduce the hydrodynamic model of graphene considering for the hydrodynamic
electronic mass graphene's Drude mass $m_{g}=\hbar k_{F}/v_{F}$, where $k_{F}$ and $v_{F}$ are
the Fermi wavenumber and Fermi speed, respectively. Using the hydrodynamic model in the electrostatic
approximation, we describe the formation of graphene surface plasmons when a charge is in motion
either perpendicular or parallel to a graphene sheet. In the first case, the electron-energy loss
(EEL) spectrum of the electron is computed, showing that the resonances in the spectrum are linked
to the frequency of the graphene surface plasmons. In the second case, we discuss the formation of
plasmonic ship wakes due to the dragging of the surface plasmons induced by the motion of the charge.
This effect is similar to Coulomb drag between two electron gases at a distance from each other. We
derive simple expressions for the electrostatic potential induced by the moving charge on graphene.
We find an analytical expression for the angle of the ship wake valid at high speeds of the moving charge.
We show that there is a transition from a Mach-type wake at high speeds to a Kelvin-type wake at low
ones and identify the Froude number for plasmonic wakes. We show that the Froude number can be controlled
externally tunning both the Fermi energy in graphene and the dielectric function of the environment,
a situation with no parallel in ship wakes. Using EEL we propose a source of graphene plasmons, based
on a graphene drum built in a metallic waveguide and activated by an electron beam created by the tip
of an electronic microscope. We also introduce the notion of a plasmonic billiard.
