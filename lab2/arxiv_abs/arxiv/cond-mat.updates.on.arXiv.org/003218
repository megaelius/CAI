Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases form a family of compounds that have attracted attention
due to their excellent performance as lithium-ion battery electrodes. The complex crystallographic
structure of these materials poses a challenge for first-principles computational modelling
and hinders the understanding of their properties. In this article, we study three different niobium-tungsten
oxide crystallographic shear phases (Nb$_{12}$WO$_{33}$, Nb$_{14}$W$_{3}$O$_{44}$, Nb$_{16}$W$_{5}$O$_{55}$)
using an enumeration-based approach and first-principles density-functional theory calculations.
We report common principles governing the cation disorder, lithium insertion mechanism, and electronic
structure of these materials. Tungsten preferentially occupies tetrahedral and block-central
sites within the block-type crystal structures, and the local structure of the materials varies
with the cation configuration. The lithium insertion proceeds via a three-step mechanism, associated
with an anisotropic evolution of the host lattice. Our calculations reveal an important connection
between long-range and local structural changes; in the second step of the mechanism, the removal
of local structural distortions leads to the contraction of the lattice along specific crystallographic
directions, buffering the volume expansion of the material. Electronically, the niobium-tungsten
shear structures host small amounts of localised electrons during initial lithium insertion,
but quickly become metallic upon further lithiation. The combination of local, long-range, and
electronic structural evolution over the course of lithiation is beneficial to to the performance
of these materials as battery electrodes. The mechanistic principles we establish arise from the
compound-independent crystallographic shear structure, and are therefore likely to apply to
niobium-titanium oxide shear phases as well.
