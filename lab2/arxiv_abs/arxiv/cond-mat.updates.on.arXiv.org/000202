Small-angle scattering (SAS) intensities observed experimentally, are very often characterized
by the presence of successive power-law regimes with various scattering exponents whose values
varies from -4 to -1. This usually indicates multiple fractal structures of the sample characterized
by different size scales. The existing models explaining the crossover positions (that is, the
points where the power-law scattering exponent changes) involve only one contrast parameter and,
hence, it depends solely on the ratio of the fractal sizes. Here, we develop a model which describe
SAS from multi-phase system with a few contrast parameters and show that the crossover position
depends on the scattering length density of each phase. We generalize the Stuhrmann contrast variation
method and show how it can be applied to experimental curves in the vicinity of the crossover point
beyond the Guinier region. The contrast variation is applied not to the intensity itself but to the
model parameters, which can be found by fitting the experimental data with the suggested interpolation
formula. The developed analysis allows us to answer the qualitative question whether one fractal
"absorbs" another one or they are both immersed in a surrounding homogeneous medium like a solvent
or solid matrix. The models can be applied to experimental SAS data where the absolute value of the
scattering exponent of the first power-law regime is higher than that of the subsequent second power-law
regime, that is, the scattering curve is "convex" near the crossover point. As is shown, the crossover
position can be very sensitive to contrast variation, which influences significantly the length
of the fractal range.
