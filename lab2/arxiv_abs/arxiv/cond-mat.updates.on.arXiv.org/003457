While lateral interaction models for reactions at surfaces have steadily gained popularity and
grown in terms of complexity, their use in chemical kinetics has been impeded by the low performance
of current KMC algorithms. The origins of the additional computational cost in KMC simulations
with lateral interactions are traced back to the more elaborate Cluster Expansion Hamiltonian,
the more extensive rate updating, and to the impracticality of rate-catalog-based algorithms
for interacting adsorbate systems. Favoring instead site-based algorithms, we propose three
ways to reduce the cost of KMC simulations: 1. Represent the lattice energy by a smaller Supercluster
Hamiltonian without loss of accuracy, 2. employing Subtraction Schemes for updating key quantities
in the simulation that undergo only small, local changes during a reaction event, and 3. applying
efficient search algorithms from a set of established methods (Supersite Approach). The resulting
algorithm is fixed-cost with respect to the number of lattice sites for practical lattice sizes
and scales with the square of the range of lateral interactions. The overall added cost of including
a complex lateral interaction model amounts to less than a factor 3. Practical issues in implementation
due to finite numerical accuracy are discussed in detail, and further suggestions for treating
long-range lateral interactions are made. We conclude that, while KMC simulations with complex
lateral interaction models are challenging, these challenges can be overcome by modifying the
established Variable Step Size Method by employing the Supercluster, Subtraction and Supersite
algorithms (SSS-VSSM).
