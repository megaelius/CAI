The recent discovery of correlated insulator states and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted
bilayer graphene has paved the way to the experimental investigation of electronic correlations
in tunable flat band systems realized in twisted van der Waals heterostructures. This novel twist
angle degree of freedom and control should be generalizable to other 2D systems, which may exhibit
similar correlated physics behavior while at the same time enabling new techniques to tune and control
the strength of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report on a new highly tunable correlated
system based on small-angle twisted bilayer-bilayer graphene (TBBG), consisting of two rotated
sheets of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. We find that TBBG exhibits a rich phase diagram, with
tunable correlated insulators states that are highly sensitive to both twist angle and to the application
of an electric displacement field, the latter reflecting the inherent polarizability of Bernal-stacked
bilayer graphene. We find correlated insulator states that can be switched on and off by the displacement
field at all integer electron fillings of the moir\'{e} unit cell. The response of these correlated
states to magnetic fields points towards evidence of electrically switchable magnetism. Moreover,
the strong dependence of the resistance at low temperature and near the correlated insulator states
indicates possible proximity to a superconducting phase. Furthermore, in the regime of lower twist
angles, TBBG shows multiple sets of flat bands near charge neutrality, resulting in numerous correlated
states corresponding to half-filling of each of these flat bands. Our results pave the way to the
exploration of novel twist-angle and electric-field controlled correlated phases of matter in
novel multi-flat band twisted superlattices.
