Research on the use of information geometry (IG), the application of differential geometric techniques
to probability calculus, in modern physics has witnessed significant advances recently. In this
review article, we report on the employment of IG methods to characterize the concepts of complexity
in both classical and, whenever available, quantum physical settings. A paradigmatic example
of a major change in complexity is given by the phase transition (PT). Hence we review both global
and local aspects of PTs described in terms of the scalar curvature of the parameter manifold and
the components of the metric tensor, respectively. We also report on the behavior of geodesic paths
on the parameter manifold used to gain insight into dynamics of PTs. Going further on we survey measures
of complexity arising in the geometric framework. Actually we quantify complexity of networks
in terms of the Riemannian volume of parameter space of a statistical manifold associated with a
given network. We deal with complexity measures that accounts for the interactions of a given number
of parts of a system that cannot be described in terms of a smaller number of parts of the system itself
and complexity measures of entropic motion on curved statistical manifolds that arise from a probabilistic
description of physical systems in the presence of limited information. The Kullback-Leibler
divergence, the distance to an exponential family and volumes of curved parameter manifolds, are
examples of essential IG notions exploited in our discussion on complexity. We conclude discussing
strengths, limits, and possible future applications of IG methods to the physics of complexity.
