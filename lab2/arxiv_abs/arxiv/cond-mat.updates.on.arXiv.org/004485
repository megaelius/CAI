We present experimental evidence of charge exchange between laser-cooled potassium $^{39}$K
atoms and calcium $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions in a hybrid atom-ion trap and give quantitative theoretical
explanations for the observations. The $^{39}$K atoms and $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions are held in a magneto-optical
(MOT) and a linear Paul trap, respectively. Fluorescence detection and high resolution time of
flight mass spectra for both species are used to determine the remaining number of $^{40}$Ca$^+$
ions, the increasing number of $^{39}$K$^+$ ions, and $^{39}$K number density as functions of time.
Simultaneous trap operation is guaranteed by alternating periods of MOT and $^{40}$Ca$^+$ cooling
lights, thus avoiding direct ionization of $^{39}$K by the $^{40}$Ca$^+$ cooling light. We show
that the K-Ca$^+$ charge-exchange rate coefficient increases linearly from zero with $^{39}$K
number density and, surprisingly, the fraction of $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions in the 4p\,$^2$P$_{1/2}$
electronically-excited state. Combined with our theoretical analysis, we conclude that these
data can only be explained by a process that starts with a potassium atom in its electronic ground
state and a calcium ion in its excited 4p\,$^2$P$_{1/2}$ state producing ground-state $^{39}$K$^+$
ions and metastable, neutral Ca\,(3d4p$^3$P$_1$) atoms, releasing only 150 cm$^{-1}$ equivalent
relative kinetic energy. Charge-exchange between either ground- or excited-state $^{39}$K and
ground-state $^{40}$Ca$^+$ is negligibly small as no energetically-favorable product states
are available. Our experimental and theoretical rate coefficients of $9\times10^{-10}$ cm$^3$/s
are in agreement given the uncertainty budgets.
