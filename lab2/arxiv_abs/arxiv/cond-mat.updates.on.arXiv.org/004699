Studying the strong correlation effects in interacting Dirac fermion systems is one of the most
challenging problems in modern condensed matter physics. The long-range Coulomb interaction
and the fermion-phonon interaction can play an important role in such systems, and in some cases
may lead to a variety of intriguing properties, including non-Fermi liquid behavior and phase-transition
instabilities. In the strong-coupling regimes, the method of weak-coupling expansion breaks
down. Here, we investigate the interaction between massless Dirac fermions and a generic scalar
bosonic mode, and develop an efficient non-perturbative approach to access the strong-coupling
regime. This approach is universal and applicable to both (1+2) and (1+3) dimensions. We first derive
a number of coupled Ward-Takahashi identities based on symmetry analysis, and then use these identities
to express the fermion-boson vertex function as a linear combination of fully renormalized fermion
propagators. Based on these results, we rigorously prove that the fully renormalized fermion propagator
satisfies an exact and self-closed Dyson-Schwinger integral equation, which can be directly solved
by numerical skills. Our approach provides a unified framework for the self-consistent investigation
of the interaction-induced effects, including Landau damping, fermion velocity renormalization,
and formation of charge density wave. All such effects are extracted from the solutions of integral
equations, thus there is no need to perform perturbative expansion and all the results are reliable
no matter how strong the interaction is. Our approach can be used to treat the strong long-range Coulomb
interaction and the strong fermion-phonon interaction. See main paper for full Abstract.
