We investigated the transient relaxation of a Discontinuous Shear Thickening suspension of cornstarch
in water. We performed 2 types of relaxation experiments starting from a steady shear in a parallel
plate rheometer, followed by either stopping the top plate rotation and measuring the transient
torque relaxation, or removing the torque on the plate and measuring the transient tool rotation.
We found that at low weight fraction $\phi_{eff}<58.8\pm0.4\%$, the suspensions exhibited a relaxation
behavior consistent with a generalized Newtonian fluid. However, for larger weight fraction $58.8\%
< \phi_{eff} < 61.0\%$, near the liquid-solid transition $\phi_c=61.0\pm0.7\%$, we found relaxation
behaviors different from the generalized Newtonian model. The relaxation time in this range scales
with the inverse of the critical shear rate at the onset of shear thickening. In this range the relaxation
time was the same in both stress and rate controlled experiments, rather than the viscosity calculated
from the relaxation time which is expected to be intrinsic material parameter in the generalized
Newtonian model. The discrepancy between the measured relaxation times and the generalized Newtonian
prediction was found to be up to $10^4$, and extrapolations diverge in the limit of $\phi_c$ as the
generalized Newtonian prediction approaches 0. At the highest weight fractions, the relaxation
time scales were measured to be on the order of $\sim 1$ s. The fact that this timescale is resolvable
by the naked eye may be important to understanding some of the dynamic phenomenon commonly observed
in these systems. We also showed that using the critical shear rate $\dot\gamma_c$ at the onset of
shear thickening to characterize the effective weight fraction can more precisely characterize
material properties near the critical point $\phi_c$, allowing us to resolve this transition so
close to $\phi_c$.
