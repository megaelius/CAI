In the present study we have demonstrated epitaxial stabilization of the metastable magnetically-hard
\eps{} phase on top of a thin MgO(111) buffer layer grown onto the GaN (0001) surface. The primary
purpose to introduce a 4\,nm-thick buffer layer of MgO in between Fe$_2$O$_3$ and GaN was to stop
thermal migration of Ga into the iron oxide layer. Though such migration and successive formation
of the orthorhombic GaFeO$_3$ was supposed earlier to be a potential trigger of the nucleation of
the isostructural \eps{}, the present work demonstrates that the growth of single crystalline
uniform films of epsilon ferrite by pulsed laser deposition is possible even on the MgO capped GaN.
The structural properties of the 60\,nm thick Fe$_2$O$_3$ layer on MgO / GaN were probed by electron
and x-ray diffraction, both suggesting that the growth of \eps{} is preceded by formation of a thin
layer of \gam{}. The presence of the magnetically hard epsilon ferrite was independently confirmed
by temperature dependent magnetometry measurements. The depth-resolved x-ray and polarized
neutron reflectometry reveal that the 10\,nm iron oxide layer at the interface has a lower density
and a higher magnetization than the main volume of the \eps{} film. The density and magnetic moment
depth profiles derived from fitting the reflectometry data are in a good agreement with the presence
of the magnetically degraded \gam{} transition layer between MgO and \eps{}. The natural occurrence
of the interface between magnetoelectric $\varepsilon$- and spin caloritronic $\gamma$- iron
oxide phases can enable further opportunities to design novel all-oxide-on-semiconductor devices.
