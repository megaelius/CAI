We discuss the adsorption of semiflexible polymers to a planar attractive wall and focus on the questions
of the adsorption threshold for polymers of {\it finite} length and their loop and tail distributions
using both Monte-Carlo simulations and analytical arguments. For the adsorption threshold, we
find three regimes: (i) a flexible or Gaussian regime if the persistence length is smaller than the
adsorption potential range, (ii) a semiflexible regime if the persistence length is larger than
the potential range, and (iii) for finite polymers, a novel crossover to a rigid rod regime if the
deflection length exceeds the contour length. In the flexible and semiflexible regime, finite
size corrections arise because the correlation length exceeds the contour length. In the rigid
rod regime, however, it is essential how the global orientational or translational degrees of freedom
are restricted by grafting or confinement. We discuss finite size corrections for polymers grafted
to the adsorbing surface and for polymers confined by a second (parallel) hard wall. Based on these
results we obtain a method to analyze adsorption data for finite semiflexible polymers such as filamentous
actin. For the loop and tail distributions, we find power laws with an exponential decay on length
scales exceeding the correlation length. We derive and confirm the loop and tail power law exponents
for flexible and semiflexible polymers. This allows us to explain that, close to the transition,
semiflexible polymers have significantly smaller loops and both flexible and semiflexible polymers
desorb by expanding their tail length. The tail distribution allows us to extract the free energy
per length of adsorption for actin filaments from experimental data [D. Welch et al., Soft Matter
11, 7507 (2015)].
