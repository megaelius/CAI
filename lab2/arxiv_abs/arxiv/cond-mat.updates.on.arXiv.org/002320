We study periodically driven insulating noncollinear stacked kagome antiferromagnets with a
conventional symmetry-protected three-dimensional (3D) in-plane $120^\circ$ spin structure.
At equilibrium the system possesses a coexistence of nodal line magnons and triply-degenerate
nodal magnon points. We show that in the presence of linearly- or circularly-polarized electric
field propagating along the $x$ direction perpendicular to the $y-z$ plane, the symmetry protection
of the conventional 3D in-plane $120^\circ$ spin structure is broken. Consequently, topological
Floquet Weyl magnon nodes with opposite chirality are photoinduced along the $k_x$ momentum direction.
They manifest as the monopoles of the photoinduced Berry curvature and exhibit interesting Floquet
magnon arc surface states. The non-equilibrium topological Floquet Weyl magnons in the periodically
driven noncollinear stacked kagome antiferromagnets originate from a photoinduced canted 3D
in-plane $120^\circ$ spin structure, which is similar to the intrinsic equilibrium canted in-plane
$120^\circ$ spin structure recently observed in the electronic antiferromagnetic materials
Mn$_3$Sn\slash Ge. Therefore, their origin is different from that of equilibrium Weyl magnons
induced by noncoplanar spin structure with finite scalar spin chirality. We show that the Floquet
magnon thermal transports for circularly-polarized light is topologically nontrivial, whereas
those for linearly-polarized light is topologically trivial. Our result not only paves the way
towards the experimental realization of Weyl magnons, but also provides a powerful mechanism for
manipulating the intrinsic properties of 3D topological antiferromagnets.
