Suspensions of elongated micelles under shear display complex non-linear behaviour including
shear banding, spatio-temporal oscillatory patterns and chaotic response. Based on a suitable
rheological model [S. M. Fielding and P. D. Olmsted, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 084502 (2004)], we here
explore possibilities to manipulate the dynamical behaviour via closed-loop (feedback) control
involving a time delay $\tau$. The model considered relates the viscoelastic stress of the system
to a structural variable, that is, the length of the micelles, yielding two time- and space-dependent
dynamical variables $\xi_1$, $\xi_2$. As a starting point we perform a systematic linear stability
analysis of the uncontrolled system for (i) an externally imposed average shear rate and (ii) an
imposed total stress, and compare the results to those from extensive numerical simulations. We
then apply the so-called Pyragas feedback scheme where the evolution equations for one or both variables
are supplemented by a control term of the form $K\left(\xi_i(t)-\xi_i(t-\tau)\right)$. Focusing
on parameters close to a Hopf bifurcation, where the uncontrolled systems display oscillatory
or chaotic states, we demonstrate that the Pyragas control can stabilize homogeneous steady states
for both types of control. We explore in detail the regimes of successful stabilization in the $K$-$\tau$-plane
by a linear stability analysis and by simulations. It turns out that the results from the (simpler)
diagonal Pyragas scheme, which acts on both variables, are quite close to those from the physically
more meaningful non-diagonal scheme acting on the stress alone.
