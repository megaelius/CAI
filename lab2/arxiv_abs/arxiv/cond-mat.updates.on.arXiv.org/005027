Thermal transport properties bear a pivotal role in influencing the performance of phase change
memory (PCM) devices, in which the PCM operation involves fast and reversible phase change between
amorphous and crystalline phases. In this paper, we present a systematic experimental and theoretical
study on the thermal conductivity of GeTe at high temperatures involving fast change from amorphous
to crystalline phase upon heating. Modulated photothermal radiometry (MPTR) is used to experimentally
determine thermal conductivity of GeTe at high temperatures in both amorphous and crystalline
phases. Thermal boundary resistances are accurately taken into account for experimental consideration.
To develop a concrete understanding of the underlying physical mechanism, rigorous and in-depth
theoretical exercises are carried out. For this, first-principles density functional methods
and linearized Boltzmann transport equations (LBTE) are employed using both direct and relaxation
time based approach (RTA) and compared with that of the phenomenological Slack model. The amorphous
phase experimental data has been described using the minimal thermal conductivity model with sufficient
precision. The theoretical estimation involving direct solution and RTA method are found to retrieve
well the trend of the experimental thermal conductivity for crystalline GeTe at high temperatures
despite being slightly overestimated and underestimated, respectively, compared to the experimental
data. A rough estimate of vacancy contribution has been found to modify the direct solution in such
a way that it agrees excellently with the experiment. Umklapp scattering has been determined as
the significant phonon-phonon scattering process. Umklapp scattering parameter has been identified
for GeTe for the whole temperature range which can uniquely determine and compare Umklapp scattering
processes for different materials
