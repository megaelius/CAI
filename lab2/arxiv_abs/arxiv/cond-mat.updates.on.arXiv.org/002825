We present a joint experiment-theory study on the role of fluorine adatoms in spin and momentum scattering
of charge carriers in dilute fluorinated graphene and bilayer graphene. The experimental spin-flip
and momentum scattering rates and their dependence on the density of fluorine and carrier doping
are obtained through weak localization and conductivity measurements, respectively, and suggest
the role of fluorine as resonant magnetic impurities. For the estimated fluorine concentration
of a few 100 ppm, the observed spin lifetimes are in the range of 1-10\,ps. Theoretically, we established
tight-binding electronic structures of fluorinated graphene and bilayer graphene by fitting
to density functional supercell calculations and performed a comprehensive analysis of the spin-flip
and momentum scattering rates within the same devices, aiming to develop a consistent description
of both scattering channels. We find that resonant scattering in graphene is very sensitive to the
precise position of the resonance level, as well as to the magnitude of the exchange coupling between
itinerant carriers and localized spins. The experimental data point to the presence of weak spin-flip
scatterers that, at the same time, relax the electron momentum strongly, nearly preserving the
electron-hole symmetry. Such scatterers would exhibit resonance energies much closer to the neutrality
point than what density functional theory predicts in the dilute limit. The inclusion of a magnetic
moment on fluorine adatoms allowed us to qualitatively capture the carrier density dependence
of the experimental rates but predicts a greater (weaker) spin (momentum) relaxation rate than
the measurements. We discuss possible scenarios that may be responsible for the discrepancies.
Our systematic study exposes the complexities involved in accurately capturing the behavior of
adatoms on graphene.
