In many materials, orientation-controlled assembling of building blocks results into develop
different geometric anisotropic shaped particles. These trends are pronounced for atoms of metallic
nature. Monolayer triangular-shaped tiny particles are vital to develop such particles as they
are building blocks. In different referred processes, developing particles of anisotropic shape,
they appear to deal such tiny-shaped particles. Here, the basic idea of developing such building
blocks is discussed. When packets of nano shape energy shaping in equilateral triangular shape
are placed over the compact monolayer assembly of certain transitional atoms, they result into
bind those atoms into their own. On isolation, atoms of monolayer tiny-shaped particle elongate
from their centers along the opposite poles under exerting of locally existing force of surface
format where structure of one-dimensional arrays convert into structure of smooth elements. Each
such tiny-shaped particle works as a one-unit under the maintenance of immersing force resulting
into assemble at a common centre to the other tiny-sized particles having the similar nature to develop
a mono-layer of a certain shape developing particle where unfilled regions are filled by the afterward
arriving ones, which is not the case when a distorted particle is developing. Originally, binding
of those atoms is under the execution of electron-dynamics when electrons of outer ring deal neutral
state but where their ground points remain below the average-leveled ground surface. Tiny-shaped
particles assemble under controlled orientation to develop a mono-layer of a certain shape developing
particle where it experiences the localized gravity. One step down mono-layer bind to the following
one mono-layer where certain electrons of elongated atoms deal double clamping of energy knots
in lateral manner.
