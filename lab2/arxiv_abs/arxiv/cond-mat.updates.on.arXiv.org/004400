The composite cosmological objects -- Kibble-Lazarides-Shafi (KLS) walls bounded by strings
and cosmic strings terminated by Nambu monopoles -- could be produced during the phase transitions
in the early Universe. Recent experiments in superfluid $^3$He reproduced the formation of the
KLS domain walls, which opened the new arena for the detailed study of those objects in human controlled
system with different characteristic lengths. These composite defects are formed by two successive
symmetry breaking phase transitions. In the first transition the strings are formed, then in the
second transition the string becomes the termination line of the KLS wall. In the same manner, in
the first transition monopoles are formed, and then in the second transition these monopoles become
the termination points of strings. Here we show that in the vicinity of the second transition the
composite defects can be described by relative homotopy groups. This is because there are two well
separated length scales involved, which give rise to two different classes of the degenerate vacuum
states, $R_1$ and $R_2$, and the composite objects correspond to the nontrivial elements of the
group $\pi_n(R_1,R_2)$. We discuss this on example of the so-called polar distorted B phase, which
is formed in the two-step phase transition in liquid $^3$He distorted by aerogel. In this system
the string monopoles terminate spin vortices with even winding number, while KLS string walls terminate
on half quantum vortices. In the presence of magnetic field, vortex-skyrmions are formed, and the
string monopole transforms to the nexus. We also discuss the integer-valued topological invariants
of those objects. Our consideration can be applied to the composite defects in other condensed matter
and cosmological systems.
