A range of high quality Ga1-xMnxN layers have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy with manganese
concentration 0.2 < x < 10%, having the x value tuned by changing the growth temperature (Tg) between
700 and 590 {\deg}C, respectively. We present a systematic structural and microstructure characterization
by atomic force microscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy,
powder-like and high resolution X-ray diffraction, which do not reveal any crystallographic phase
separation, clusters or nanocrystals, even at the lowest Tg. Our synchrotron based X-ray absorption
near-edge spectroscopy supported by density functional theory modelling and superconducting
quantum interference device magnetometry results point to the predominantly +3 configuration
of Mn in GaN and thus the ferromagnetic phase has been observed in layers with x > 5% at 3 < T < 10 K. The
main detrimental effect of Tg reduced to 590 {\deg}C is formation of flat hillocks, which increase
the surface root-mean-square roughness, but only to mere 3.3 nm. Fine substrates surface temperature
mapping has shown that the magnitudes of both x and Curie temperature (Tc) correlate with local Tg.
It has been found that a typical 10 {\deg}C variation of Tg across 1 inch substrate can lead to 40% dispersion
of Tc. The established here strong sensitivity of Tc on Tg turns magnetic measurements into a very
efficient tool providing additional information on local Tg, an indispensable piece of information
for growth mastering of ternary compounds in which metal species differ in almost every aspect of
their growth related parameters determining the kinetics of the growth. We also show that the precise
determination of Tc by two different methods, each sensitive to different moments of Tc distribution,
may serve as a tool for quantification of spin homogeneity within the material.
