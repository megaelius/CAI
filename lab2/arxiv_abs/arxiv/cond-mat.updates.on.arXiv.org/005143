The ability to produce nanowires through vapor- and solution-based processes has propelled nanowire
material systems toward a wide range of technological applications. Conventional, vapor-based
nanowire syntheses have enabled precise control over nanowire composition and phase. However,
vapor-based nanowire growth employs batch processes with specialized pressure management systems
designed to operate at high temperatures, limiting throughput. More recently developed solution-based
nanowire growth processes have improved scalability but can require even more extensive pressure
and temperature management systems. Here, we demonstrate a continuous-flow, solution-based
nanowire growth process that utilizes the large Young-Laplace interfacial surface pressures
and collective heating effects of colloidal metal nanocrystals under irradiation to drive semiconductor
nanowire growth photothermally without the need for high-pressure or high-temperature equipment.
In this process, a laser irradiates a solution containing metal nanocrystals and semiconductor
precursors. Upon light absorption, the metal nanocrystals heat rapidly, inducing semiconductor
precursor decomposition and nanowire growth. This process is performed on a benchtop in simple
glassware under standard conditions. To demonstrate the generality of this technique, we synthesized
three distinct semiconductor nanowire material systems: bismuth-seeded germanium nanowires,
bismuth-seeded cadmium selenide nanowires, and indium-seeded germanium nanowires. The simplicity
and versatility of this process opens the door to a range of experiments and technologies including
in-line combinatorial identification of optimized reaction parameters, in situ spectroscopic
measurements to study solution-based nanowire growth, and the potential production of nanowires
with complex compositions or rationally incorporated dopants.
