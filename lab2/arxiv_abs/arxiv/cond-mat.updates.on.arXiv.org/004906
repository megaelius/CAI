Recent years have witnessed significant progresses in realizing skyrmions in chiral magnets1-4
and asymmetric magnetic multilayers5-13, as well as their electrical manipulation2,7,8,10.
Equally important, thermal generation, manipulation and detection of skyrmions can be exploited
for prototypical new architecture with integrated computation14 and energy harvesting15. It
has yet to verify if skyrmions can be purely generated by heating16,17, and if their resultant direction
of motion driven by temperature gradients follows the diffusion or, oppositely, the magnonic spin
torque17-21. Here, we address these important issues in microstructured devices made of multilayers:
(Ta_CoFeB_MgO)15, (Pt_CoFeB_MgO_Ta)15 and (Pt_Co_Ta)15 integrated with on-chip heaters, by
using a full-field soft X-ray microscopy. The thermal generation of densely packed skyrmions is
attributed to the low energy barrier at the device edge, together with the thermally induced morphological
transition from stripe domains to skyrmions. The unidirectional diffusion of skyrmions from the
hot region towards the cold region is experimentally observed. It can be theoretically explained
by the combined contribution from repulsive forces between skyrmions, and thermal spin-orbit
torques in competing with magnonic spin torques17,18,20,21 and entropic forces22. These thermally
generated skyrmions can be further electrically detected by measuring the accompanied anomalous
Nernst voltages23. The on-chip thermoelectric generation, manipulation and detection of skyrmions
could open another exciting avenue for enabling skyrmionics, and promote interdisciplinary studies
among spin caloritronics15, magnonics24 and skyrmionics3,4,12.
