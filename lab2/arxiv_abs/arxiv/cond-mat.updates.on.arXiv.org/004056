The quest to understand, design, and synthesize new forms of quantum matter guides much of contemporary
research in condensed matter physics. One-dimensional (1D) electronic systems form the basis
for some of the most interesting and exotic phases of quantum matter. The variety of experimentally-accessible
ballistic 1D electronic systems is highly restricted, and furthermore these systems typically
have few tuning parameters other than electric and magnetic fields. However, electron waveguides
formed from two-dimensional (2D) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterointerfaces exhibit remarkable
1D properties, including ballistic multi-mode transport and strong attractive electron-electron
interaction, but these systems conspicuously lack strong or tunable spin-orbit interactions.
Here we describe a new class of quasi-1D nanostructures, based on LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ electron
waveguides, in which a sinusoidal transverse spatial modulation is imposed. Nanowires created
with this "serpentine" modulation display unique dispersive features in the subband spectra,
namely (1) a significant shift ($\sim$ 7 tesla) in the spin-dependent subband minima, and (2) fractional
conductance plateaus, some of which are continuously tunable with a magnetic field. The first property
can be understood as an engineered spin-orbit interaction associated with the periodic acceleration
of electrons as they undulate through the nanowire (ballistically), while the second property
signifies the presence of enhanced electron-electron scattering in this system due to the imposed
periodic structure. The ability to engineer these interactions in quantum wires contributes to
the tool set of a 1D solid-state quantum simulation platform.
