: In this work, we perform a systematic search for high-efficiency, three-dimensional (3D) and
two-dimensional (2D) thermoelectric materials by combining semiclassical transport techniques
with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Out of 36000 three-dimensional and 900 two-dimensional
materials currently in the publicly available JARVIS-DFT database, we identify 2932 3D and 148
2D promising thermoelectric materials using a multi-steps screening procedure, where specific
thresholds are chosen for key quantities like bandgaps, Seebeck coefficients and power factors.
We compute the Seebeck coefficients for all the materials currently in the database and validate
our calculations by comparing our results, for a subset of materials, to experimental and existing
computational datasets. We also investigate the effect of chemical, structural, crystallographic
and dimensionality trends on thermoelectric performance. We predict several classes of efficient
3D and 2D materials such as Ba(MgX)2 (X=P,As,Bi), X2YZ6 (X=K,Rb, Y=Pd,Pt, Z=Cl,Br), K2PtX2(X=S,Se),
NbCu3X4 (X=S,Se,Te), Sr2XYO6 (X=Ta, Zn, Y=Ga, Mo), TaCu3X4 (X=S, Se,Te), and XYN (X=Ti, Zr, Y=Cl,
Br). Finally, as high-throughput DFT is computationally expensive, we train machine learning
models using gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) and classical force-field inspired descriptors
(CFID) for n-and p-type Seebeck coefficients and power factors, to quickly pre-screen materials
for guiding the next set of DFT calculations. The dataset and tools are made publicly available at
