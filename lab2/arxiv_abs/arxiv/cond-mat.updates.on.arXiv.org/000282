Many-body electron-electron interaction effects are theoretically considered in monolayer
graphene from a continuum effective field-theoretic perspective by going beyond the standard
leading-order perturbative renormalization group (RG) analysis. Given that the bare fine structure
constant in graphene is of order unity, which is neither small to justify a perturbative expansion
nor large enough for strong-coupling theories to be applicable, the problem is a difficult one,
with some similarity to 2+1-dimensional strong-coupling quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this
work, we take a systematic and comprehensive analytical approach, working primarily at the Dirac
point (intrinsic graphene), by going up to three loops in the diagrammatic expansion to both ascertain
the validity of perturbation theory and to estimate quantitatively higher-order renormalization
effects. While no direct signatures for non-Fermi liquid behavior at the Dirac point have yet been
observed experimentally, there is ample evidence for the interaction-induced renormalization
of the graphene velocity as the carrier density approaches zero. We provide a critical comparison
between theory and experiment, using both bare- and screened-interaction (RPA) calculations.
We find that while the one-loop RG analysis gives reasonable agreement with the experimental data,
especially when screening and finite-density effects are included through the RPA, the two-loop
analysis reveals a strong-coupling critical point in suspended graphene, signifying either a
quantum phase transition or a breakdown of the weak-coupling RG approach. We show that the latter
is more likely by adapting Dyson's argument for the breakdown of perturbative QED to the case of graphene.
We propose future experiments and theoretical directions to make further progress in this important
and difficult problem.
