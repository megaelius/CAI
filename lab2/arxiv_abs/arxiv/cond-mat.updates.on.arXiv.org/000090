Planar arrays of magnetoinductively coupled rf SQUIDs belong to the emergent class of superconducting
metamaterials that encompass the Josephson effect. SQUID metamaterials acquire their electromagnetic
properties from the resonant characteristics of their constitutive elements, i.e., the individual
rf SQUIDs, which consist of a superconducting ring interrupted by a Josephson junction. We investigate
the response of a two-dimensional SQUID metamaterial to frequency variation of an applied alternating
magnetic field in the presence of disorder, arising from critical current fluctuations of the Josephson
elements; in effect, the resonance frequencies of individual SQUIDs are distributed randomly
around a mean value. Bistability is observed in the total current-frequency curves both in ordered
and disordered SQUID metamaterials; moreover, bistability is favoured by disorder through the
improvement of synchronization between SQUID oscillators. Relatively weak disorder widens significantly
the bistability region by helping the system to self-organize itself and leads to nearly homogeneous
states that change smoothly with varying frequency. Moreover, the total current of the metamaterial
is enhanced compared with that of uncoupled SQUIDs, through the synergetic action of coupling and
synchronization. Multistability of nearly homogeneous states allows the metamaterial to exhibit
different magnetic responses corresponding to different values of the magnetic permeability.
At low power of the incident field, high-current states exhibit extreme diamagnetic properties
corresponding to negative magnetic permeability in a narrow frequency region.
