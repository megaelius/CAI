A density functional study is presented of the interstitial Zn$_i$, Ge$_i$, and N$_i$ in ZnGeN$_2$.
Corrections to the band gap are included by means of the LDA+U method. The Zn and Ge interstitials
are both found to strongly prefer the larger octahedral site compared to the two types of tetrahedral
sites. The Zn interstitial is found to be a shallow double donor but has higher energy than previously
studied antisite defects. It has a resonance in the conduction band which is Zn-$s$ like. The Ge interstitial
is an even higher energy of formation defect and also behaves as a shallow double donor but has also
a deep level in the gap, corresponding to a Ge-$s$ orbital character while the Ge-$p$ forms a resonance
in the conduction band. The nitrogen interstitial forms a split-interstitial configuration,
as also occurs in GaN. Its electronic levels can be related to that of a N$_2$ molecule. The defect
levels in the gap correspond to the $\pi_g$-like lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of
the molecule, which here becomes filled with 3 electrons in the defect's neutral charge state. They
are found to prefer a high-spin configuration in the $q=+1$ state. The corresponding transition
levels are obtained and show that this is an amphoteric trap level occurring in $+2$, $+1$, 0 and $-1$
charge states. The two possible sites for this split interstitial, on top of Zn or on top of Ge differ
slightly in N$_2$ bond-length. While the N$_i$ defects have the lowest formation energy among the
interstitials, it is still higher than that of the antisites. Hence they are not expected to occur
in sufficient concentration to affect the intrinsic Fermi level position. In particular, they
do not contribute to the unintentional n-type background doping.
