The recently reported superconductivity 9-15 K in Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures [Li
et al. Nature 572, 624 (2019)] that were fabricated by a soft-chemical topotactic reduction approach
based on precursor Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 thin films deposited on SrTiO3 substrates, has excited an immediate
surge of research interest. To explore an alternative physical path instead of chemical reduction
for realizing superconductivity in this compound, using pulsed laser deposition, we systematically
fabricated 63 Nd0.8Sr0.2NiOx (NSNO) thin films at a wide range of oxygen partial pressures on various
different oxide substrates. Transport measurements did not find any signature of superconductivity
in all the 63 thin-film samples. With reducing the oxygen content in the NSNO films by lowering the
deposition oxygen pressure, the NSNO films are getting more resistive and finally become insulating.
Furthermore, we tried to cap a 20-nm-thick amorphous LaAlO3 layer on a Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 thin film
deposited at a high oxygen pressure of 150 mTorr to create oxygen vacancies on its surface [Liu et
al. Phys. Rev. X 3, 021010 (2013)] and did not succeed in higher conductivity either. Our experimental
results together with the recent report on the absence of superconductivity in synthesized bulk
Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 crystals [Li et al. arXiv: 1911.02420 (2019)] suggest that the chemical reduction
approach could be unique for yielding superconductivity in NSNO/SrTiO3 heterostructures. However,
SrTiO3 substrates could be reduced to generate oxygen vacancies during the chemical reduction
process as well, which may thus partially contribute to conductivity [Liu et al. Phys. Rev. Lett.
