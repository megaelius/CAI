We present an open source code to simulate entangled dynamics of open quantum systems governed by
the Lindblad master equation with tensor network methods. Tensor network methods using matrix
product states have been proven very useful to simulate many-body quantum systems and have driven
many innovations in research. Since the matrix product state design is tailored for closed one-dimensional
systems governed by the Schr\"odinger equation, the next step for many-body quantum dynamics is
the simulation of one-dimensional open quantum systems. We review the three dominant approaches
to the simulation of open quantum systems via the Lindblad master equation: quantum trajectories,
matrix product density operators, and locally purified tensor networks. The package Open Source
Matrix Product States combines these three major methods to simulate one-dimensional open quantum
systems with the Lindblad master equation. We access the same underlying tensor network algorithms
for all techniques, e.g., the tensor contractions optimized in the same way, allowing us to have
a meaningful comparison between the different approaches based on selected examples. These examples
include the finite temperature states of the transverse quantum Ising model, the dynamics of an
exciton traveling under the influence of spontaneous emission and dephasing, and a double-well
potential simulated with the Bose-Hubbard model including dephasing. We analyze which approach
is favorable leading to the conclusion that a complete set of all three methods is most beneficial,
pushing the limits of different scenarios. The convergence studies using analytical results for
macroscopic variables and exact diagonalization methods as comparison, show, for example, that
matrix product density operators are favorable for the exciton problem in our study.
