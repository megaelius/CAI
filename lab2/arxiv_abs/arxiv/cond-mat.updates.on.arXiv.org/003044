It is ambiguous to understand the structure evolution in atoms executing confined inter-state
electron-dynamics. Such atoms evolve structure on amalgamation under significant attained-dynamics.
A structure evolution is in different format depending on the ground point of atoms. Atoms of each
format deal different force-exertions for their electrons. Under neutral state, they transform
heat energy into bind energy having shape-like tick, integral or Gaussian distribution symbol
as per mechanism of electron-dynamics. In atoms evolving structure at same level of ground points,
they also deal force-exertions for feasible electrons in the same format. In atoms of space-format,
evolving structure starts just at above typical-leveled ground surface. In atoms of grounded-format,
evolving structure starts at below typical-leveled ground surface. Atoms, as per number of quadrants
simultaneously executing electron-dynamics, evolve structure of different dimensionality.
Atoms executing electron-dynamics in three quadrants show a bit different mechanism of structure
evolution. Atoms bind at the points of their generated energy because of the identical nature. Amalgamating
atoms bind lateral-wise to the targeted atom from upward-side and downward-side respectively
in structure evolution of space-format and grounded-format. In structure of surface-format,
amalgamated atoms bind to targeted atom in adjacent manner. Binding atoms layer-wise for each definite
format is by means of trapping force and energy. As the result of chemical activity of force and energy,
chemical reactivity adheres mono-layers of atoms bound under electron-dynamics. A mixed-orientation
structure develops under frustrated amalgamation of atoms. This fundamental revolution of how
structures of atoms executing electron-dynamics for conservative forces evolve may shed a new
light in the existing state of materials science.
