Present day electromagnetic field calculations have limitations that are due to techniques employing
edge-based discretization methods. While these vector finite element methods solve the issues
of tangential continuity of fields and the removal of spurious solutions, resulting fields do not
have a unique directionality at nodes in the discretization mesh. This review presents electromagnetic
field calculations in waveguides, cavity fields, and photonic crystals. We develop Hermite interpolation
polynomials and node-based finite element methods based on variational principles. We show that
the Hermite-finite element method (HFEM) delivers high accuracy and suitable for multiscale calculations
with mixed physics. We use group representation theory to derive the HFEM polynomial basis set in
two-dimensions. The energy level degeneracy in a cubic cavity can be denumerably large even though
the symmetry of the cube. We show that the additional operators available for the problem lead to
accidental degeneracy. We discuss this remarkable degeneracy and its reduction in detail. We consider
photonic crystals corresponding to a 2D checkerboard superlattice structure, and the Escher drawing
of the Horsemen which satisfies the nonsymmorphic group pg. We show that HFEM is able to deliver high
accuracy in such spatially complex examples with far less computational effort than Fourier expansion
methods. The algorithms developed here hold the promise of successful modeling of multi-physics
systems. This general method is applicable to a broad class of physical systems, to semiconducting
lasers which require simultaneous modeling of transitions in quantum wells or dots together with
EM cavity calculations, to modeling plasmonic structures in the presence of EM field emissions,
and to on-chip propagation within monolithic integrated circuits.
