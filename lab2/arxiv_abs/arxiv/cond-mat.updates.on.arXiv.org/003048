We probe the electrostatic mechanism driving adsorption of polyelectrolytes onto like-charged
membranes upon the addition of tri- and tetravalent counterions to a bathing monovalent salt solution.
We develop a one-loop-dressed strong coupling theory that treats the monovalent salt at the electrostatic
one-loop level and the multivalent counterions within a strong-coupling approach. It is shown
that the adhesive force of the multivalent counterions mediating the like-charge adsorption arises
from their strong condensation at the charged membrane. The resulting interfacial counterion
excess locally maximizes the screening ability of the electrolyte and minimizes the electrostatic
polymer grand potential. This translates into an attractive force that pulls the polymer to the
similarly charged membrane. We show that the high counterion valency enables this adsorption transition
even at weakly charged membranes. Additionally, strongly charged membranes give rise to salt-induced
correlations and intensify the interfacial multivalent counterion condensation, strenghtening
the complexation of the polymer with the like-charged membrane, as well as triggering the orientational
transition of the molecule prior to its adsorption. Finally, our theory provides two additional
key features as evidenced by previous adsorption experiments: first, the critical counterion
concentration for polymer adsorption decreases with the rise of the counterion valency, and second,
the addition of monovalent salt enhances the screening of the membrane charges and suppresses salt
correlations. This weakens the interfacial multivalent counterion condensation and results
in the desorption of the polymer from the substrate.
