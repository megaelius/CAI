Depositing thin and thick films by different coating technology units is the beauty of deposition
technology, where every synthesis takes place under varying chamber pressure. In hot-filaments
reactor, in addition to flow rates of gases, chamber pressure does consider the settlement of heat
and photon energy for available mass. Temperature of the substrate material and hot-filaments
at fixed input power varies as per residence time of entered dissociating CH4 and H2 gases under set
flow rates. Rates of dissociating gases and conversion rate of gas state carbon atoms into graphite
and diamond state carbon atoms vary largely under the varying chamber pressure. This influences
the deposition of carbon films in terms of quality and growth rate. The increase in the chamber pressure
from 3.3 kPa to 14 kPa forms different morphology-structure of carbon films comprising tiny grains,
grains and particles. The increase in the chamber pressure upto 8.6 kPa increases the growth rate
of a carbon film along with discernible features of its grains and particles. Within the range of
different intermediate chamber pressures, gas state carbon atoms are converted into diamond state
carbon atoms at a high rate. Within the range of high pressures, gas state carbon atoms converted
into graphite state carbon atoms in a large number. Here, a low growth rate of the film is obtained.
At different chamber pressures, a different amount of typical energy is there at substrate surface
as a result of different collision rates of gases and self-arching of temperature over time. So,
a carbon film of different grains and particles is deposited. Varied amount of dissociated atomic
hydrogen at different chamber pressures etch photon energy into typical energy for different rates.
