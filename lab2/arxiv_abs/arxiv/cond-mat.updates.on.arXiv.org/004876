We report the numerical investigation of strain induced superconductor-insulator quantum phase
transition on a Lieb lattice. Based on a non perturbative Monte Carlo technique, we show that in two
dimensions an s-wave superconductor undergoes transition to a highly correlated bosonic insulator
under the influence of strain, applied as staggered hopping amplitudes. We further demonstrate
a strain induced BCS-BEC like crossover in the superconducting state, such that the superconductor-insulator
transition takes place between a bosonic superconductor and a bosonic insulator. Our results suggest
that it is the contribution of the dispersive bands towards the superconducting order, which dictates
this crossover. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to report theoretical investigation
of "disorder free" superconductor-insulator phase transition in systems with Lieb lattice structure.
With the recent experimental realization of the Lieb lattice in ultracold atomic gases, photonic
lattices as well as in solid state systems, we believe that the results presented in this paper would
be of importance to initiate experimental investigation of such novel quantum phase transitions.
We further discuss the fate of such systems at finite temperature, highlighting the effect of fluctuations
on the superconducting pair formations, thermal scales and quasiparticle behavior. Our non perturbative
numerical approach to the problem enables us to capture the thermal scales of the system accurately
and provides us with mean field estimates of the ground state properties. The high temperature quasiparticle
signatures discussed in this paper are expected to serve as benchmarks for experiments such as radio
frequency and momentum resolved radio frequency spectroscopy measurements carried out on systems
such as ultracold atomic gases.
