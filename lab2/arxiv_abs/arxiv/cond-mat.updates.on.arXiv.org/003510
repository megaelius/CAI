The abundance of different species in a community often follows the log series distribution. Other
ecological patterns also have simple forms. Why does the complexity and variability of ecological
systems reduce to such simplicity? Common answers include maximum entropy, neutrality, and convergent
outcome from different underlying biological processes. This article proposes a more general
answer based on the concept of invariance, the property by which a pattern remains the same after
transformation. Invariance has a long tradition in physics. For example, general relativity emphasizes
the need for the equations describing the laws of physics to have the same form in all frames of reference.
By bringing this unifying invariance approach into ecology, we show that the log series pattern
dominates when the consequences of processes acting on abundance are invariant to the addition
or multiplication of abundance by a constant. The lognormal pattern dominates when the processes
acting on net species growth rate obey rotational invariance (symmetry) with respect to the summing
up of the individual component processes. Recognizing how these invariances connect pattern to
process leads to a synthesis of previous approaches. First, invariance provides a simpler and more
fundamental maximum entropy derivation of the log series distribution. Second, invariance provides
a simple derivation of the key result from neutral theory: the log series at the metacommunity scale
and a clearer form of the skewed lognormal at the local community scale. The invariance expressions
are easy to understand because they uniquely describe the basic underlying components that shape
pattern.
