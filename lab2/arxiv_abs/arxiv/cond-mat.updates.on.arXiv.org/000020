Upon application of an external tuning parameter, a magnetic state can be driven to a normal metal
state at zero temperature. This phenomenon is known as quantum criticality and leads to fascinating
responses in thermodynamics and transport of the compound. In the standard picture, a single quantum
critical point occurs at zero temperature, which results in a nontrivial critical behaviour in
its vicinity. Here we show that in two dimensions the scenario is considerably more complex due to
the enormous amount of quantum fluctuations. Instead of the single point separating the antiferromagnet
from the normal metal, we have discovered a broad region between these two phases where the magnetic
order is destroyed but certain areas of the Fermi surface are closed by a large gap. This gap reflects
the formation of a novel quantum state characterised by a superposition of d-wave superconductivity
and a quadrupole-density wave, id est a state in which an electron quadrupole density spatially
oscillates with a period drastically different from the one of the original spin-density wave.
At moderate temperatures both orders co-exist at short distances but thermal fluctuations destroy
the long-range order. Below a critical temperature the fluctuations are less essential and superconductivity
becomes stable. This new phenomenon may shed some light on the origin of the mysterious pseudogap
state and of the high-temperature transition into the superconducting state in cuprates. Our results
demonstrate that quantum phase transitions between antiferromagnets and normal metals in layered
materials may be the proper playground for search of new high temperature superconductors.
