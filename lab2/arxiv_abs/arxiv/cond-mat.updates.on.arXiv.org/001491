We consider the model proposed by Axelrod for dissemination of cultures on a 2-dimensional squared
lattice. We review this model from an analytic point of view. We define $\left\langle s(t)\right\rangle$
to quantify possible culture configurations at time $t$ in a society. Typical initial culture configurations
of this model are characterised. Equation of motion in terms of $\left\langle s(t)\right\rangle$
is derived. We study the graph of development of this Axelrod system toward to its culture configurations
equilibrium. Generically, we observe that this model undergoes three phases of development. We
give a quantitative explanation about these three different phases of development. Keeping up
with this Axelrod model, we characterize its culture configurations space at equilibrium point
where $\left\langle s(t_{\text{eq}})\right\rangle = 1$. This space is called monoculture space.
Understanding this space is equivalent to restrict to the space of culture configurations from
one individual in the model. This individual culture space is identified to the space $V_N^{\otimes
F}$ up to isomorphisms. Action of the permutation group $S_N$ on the space $V_{N}^{\otimes F}$ is
considered. Under this action, the observable $\left\langle s(t)\right\rangle$ is an invariant
of the Axelrod system. We explore this symmetry and classify the different inequivalent classes
of culture configurations composing the monoculture space. To achieve this, we consider the case
$N\geq F$. We propose techniques from group representation theory to perform this classification.
The inequivalent classes of culture configurations are indexed by the Dickau diagrams which are
associated to the Bell number $B_F$. A concrete example with $F=4$ and $N\geq 4$ is considered for
a full illustration of our analysis.
