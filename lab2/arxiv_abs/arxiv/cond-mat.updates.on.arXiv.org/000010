Graphene and its multilayers have attracted considerable interest owing to the fourfold spin and
valley degeneracy of their charge carriers, which enables the formation of a rich variety of broken-symmetry
states and raises the prospect of controlled phase transitions among them. In especially clean
samples, electron-electron interactions were recently shown to produce surprising patterns
of symmetry breaking and phase transitions in the integer quantum Hall regime. Although a series
of robust fractional quantum Hall states was also recently observed in graphene, their rich phase
diagram and tunability have yet to be fully explored. Here we report local electronic compressibility
measurements of ultraclean suspended graphene that reveal a multitude of fractional quantum Hall
states surrounding filling factors v = -1/2 and -1/4. In several of these states, we observe phase
transitions that indicate abrupt changes in the underlying order and are marked by a narrow region
of negative compressibility that cuts across the incompressible peak. Remarkably, as filling
factor approaches v = -1/2, we observe additional oscillations in compressibility that appear
to be related to the phase transitions and persist to within 2.5% of v = -1/2. We use a simple model based
on crossing Landau levels of composite particles with different internal degrees of freedom to
explain many qualitative features of the experimental data. Our results add to the diverse array
of correlated states observed in graphene and demonstrate substantial control over their order
parameters, showing that graphene serves as an excellent platform to study correlated electron
phases of matter.
