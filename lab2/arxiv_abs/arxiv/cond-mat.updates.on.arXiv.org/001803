We derive an analytical dynamical response theory for semi-infinite materials (SIMs) without
additional boundary conditions (ABCs). The theory is generic with its basic structure totally
independent of the particulars of electron dynamics. Analytical expressions are then obtained
of the density-density response function. It is shown that this function is naturally parsed into
two parts, one of which represents primality a bulk property while the other a pure surface property.
We then apply the theory to common electron dynamics models and provide a unified view of their underlying
propositions. The models studied include the local dielectric model (DM), the dispersive hydrodynamic
model (HDM) and specular reflection model (SRM), as well as the less common semi-classical model
(SCM) based on Boltzmann's transport equation. We show that the SRM is an extension of the HDM, just
as the HDM is an extension of the DM. The SCM improves over the SRM critically through the inclusion
of translation symmetry breaking and surface roughness effects. We further employ the response
function to evaluate the dynamical structure factor, which plays an important role in particle
scattering. Expectedly, this factor reveals a peak due to the excitation of surface plasma waves
(SPWs). Surprisingly, however, the peak is shown to be considerably sharper in the SCM than in other
models. Its width may actually be made to vanish due to an incipient instability of the system. At
the critical point, SPWs are therefore lossless. We also study the distribution of charges induced
by a charged particle grazing over a SIM surface at constant speed. This distribution is shown to
contain model-specific features that are of immediate experimental interest. Our work solves
a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics and surface science and is expected to find broad
applications.
