We present a systematic classification and analysis of possible pairing instabilities in graphene-based
moir\'e superlattices. Motivated by recent experiments on twisted double-bilayer graphene showing
signs of triplet superconductivity, we analyze both singlet and triplet pairing separately, and
describe how these two channels behave close to the limit where the system is invariant under separate
spin rotations in the two valleys, realizing an SU(2)$_+$ $\times$ SU(2)$_-$ symmetry. Further,
we discuss the conditions under which singlet and triplet can mix via two nearly degenerate transitions,
and how the different pairing states behave when an external magnetic field is applied. We find that
an approximate SU(2)$_+$ $\times$ SU(2)$_-$ symmetry can generically account for the linear increase
of the critical temperature with small magnetic fields, and we map out the possible forms of the phase
diagram as a function of temperature and magnetic field. We examine which of the pairing states can
arise in mean-field theory and the type of pairing favored in the presence of strong ferromagnetic
fluctuations, which are expected to be present in twisted double-bilayer graphene. Finally, we
also detail the differences in the classification when the additional microscopic or emergent
symmetries relevant for twisted bilayer graphene and ABC trilayer graphene on hexagonal boron
nitride are taken into account. Our study illustrates that graphene superlattices provide a rich
platform for exotic superconducting states, and could allow for the admixture of singlet and triplet
pairing even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling.
