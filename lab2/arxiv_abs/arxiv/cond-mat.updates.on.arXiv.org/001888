We present a comprehensive micromagnetic model of isolated axisymmetric skyrmions in magnetic
multilayers with perpendicular anisotropy. Most notably, the essential role of the internal dipolar
field is extensively considered with a minimum amount of assumptions on the magnetization profiles.
The tri-dimensional structure of the multilayered skyrmions is modeled by their radial profiles
in each layer. We first compare the results of the model against a full micromagnetic description
in Cartesian coordinates. Our model combines information on both layer-dependent size and chirality
of the skyrmions. We also provide a convenient criterion in order to characterize the stability
of skyrmions against anisotropic elongations that would break their cylindrical symmetry, which
allows to confirm the stability of the determined solutions. Because this model is able to treat
magnetization configurations twisted through the thickness of multilayered skyrmions, it can
provide predictions on any potential hybrid chirality in skyrmions due to the interplay of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
and dipolar interactions in multilayers. We finally apply the results of our model to the description
of the current-driven dynamics of hybrid chiral skyrmions. Using the Thiele formalism, we show
that we can predict the forces exerted on the multilayered skyrmions by vertical spin-polarized
currents, which provides a method to conform hybrid skyrmion chiralities and spin-current injection
geometries in order to optimize skyrmion motion in multilayers, to the aim of maximizing the current-induced
velocity, or canceling the skyrmion Hall angle.
