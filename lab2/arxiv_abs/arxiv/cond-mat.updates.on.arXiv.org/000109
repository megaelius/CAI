Isotropic-genesis nematic elastomers (IGNEs) are liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) that have
been randomly, permanently cross-linked in the high-temperature state so as to form an equilibrium
random solid. Thus, instead of being free to diffuse throughout the entire volume, as they would
be in the liquid state, the constituent LCPs in an IGNE are mobile only over a finite length-scale
controlled by the density of cross-links. We address the effects that such network-induced localization
have on the liquid-crystalline characteristics of an IGNE, as probed via measurements made at high
temperatures. In contrast with the case of uncross-linked LCPs, for IGNEs these characteristics
are determined not only by thermal fluctuations but also by the quenched disorder associated with
the cross-link constraints. To study IGNEs, we consider a microscopic model of dimer nematogens
in which the dimers interact via orientation-dependent excluded volume forces. The dimers are,
furthermore, randomly, permanently cross-linked via short Hookean springs, the statistics of
which we model by means of a Deam-Edwards type of distribution. We show that at length-scales larger
than the size of the nematogens this approach leads to a recently proposed phenomenological Landau
theory of IGNEs [Lu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 257803 (2012)], and hence predicts a regime of short-ranged
oscillatory spatial correlations in the nematic alignment, of both thermal and glassy types. In
addition, we consider two alternative microscopic models of IGNEs: (i) a wormlike chain model of
IGNEs that are formed via the cross-linking of side-chain LCPs; and (ii) a jointed chain model of
IGNEs that are formed via the cross-linking of main-chain LCPs. At large length-scales, both of
these models give rise to liquid-crystalline characteristics that are qualitatively in line with
those predicted by the dimer-and-springs model.
