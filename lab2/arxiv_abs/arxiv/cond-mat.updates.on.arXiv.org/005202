Transparent conducting or semiconducting oxides are important materials for (transparent) optoelectronics
and power electronics applications. While most of these oxides can be doped n-type only with room-temperature
electron mobilities on the order of 100cm^2/Vs p-type oxides are needed for the realization of pn-junction
devices but typically suffer from exessively low (<<1cm^2/Vs) hole mobilities. Tin monoxide (SnO)
is one of the few p-type oxides with a higher hole mobility, lacking a well-established understanding
of its hole transport properties. Moreover, growth of SnO is complicated by its metastability with
respect to SnO2 and Sn, requiring epitaxy for the realization of single crystalline material typically
required for high-end applications. Here, we give a comprehensive account on the epitaxial growth
of SnO, its (meta)stability, and its thermoelectric transport properties in the context of the
present literature. Textured and single-crystalline, unintentionally-doped p-type SnO(001)
films are grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The metastability of this semiconducting
oxide is addressed theoretically through an equilibrium phase diagram. Experimentally, the related
SnO growth window is rapidly determined by an in-situ growth kinetics study as function of Sn-to-O-plasma
flux ratio and growth temperature. The presence of secondary Sn and SnOx (1 < x <= 2) phases is comprehensively
studied by different methods, indicating the presence of Sn3O4 or Sn as major secondary phases,
as well as a fully oxidized SnO2 film surface. The hole transport properties, Seebeck coefficient,
and density-of-states effective mass are determined and critically discussed in the context of
the present literature on SnO, considering its anisotropic hole-effective mass.
