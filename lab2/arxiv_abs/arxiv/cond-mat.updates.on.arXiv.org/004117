The interface between a topological insulator and a normal insulator hosts localized states that
appear due to the change in band structure topology. While these states are topologically protected,
states at separate interfaces can hybridize and gap out. An important question is whether there
are other factors, such as local fields and/or disorder, that may also impact these states. In this
paper, we use a combination of experiment and theory to study heterostructures of GeTe (normal insulator)
and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ (topological insulator) in which, due to the strong chemical affinity between
the materials, there is significant intermixing at the interface where the topological state is
expected. To characterize the interface, we evaluate the band offset between GeTe and Sb$_2$Te$_3$
using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and use atom probe tomography to chart the elemental composition
along the stacking direction. We then use first-principles calculations to independently calculate
the band offset value and also to parametrize the band structure within a four-band continuum framework.
Strikingly, the continuum model reveals that the interfacial topological modes can couple over
significantly longer distances when the normal insulator medium is intermixed GeTe and Sb$_2$Te$_3$
rather than simply GeTe. We confirm this finding using first-principles calculation for thin heterostructure,
which indicate that a disordered interface is sufficient to induce long-range coupling between
embedded topological modes. Our study provides insights into how to use bulk-like structures to
manipulate topological modes. Our results also provide a microscopic basis for recent experimental
findings [Nguyen \textit{et al.}, Sci. Rep. \textbf{6}, 27716 (2016)] where topological interface
states were seen to couple over relatively large distances.
