Colloidal suspensions that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium undergo physical aging wherein
their structure evolves to lower the free energy. In aqueous suspension of Laponite, physical aging
accompanies enhancement of elastic and viscous moduli as a function of time. In this work we study
temporal evolution of elastic and viscous moduli at different frequencies and observe that freshly
prepared aqueous suspension of Laponite demonstrates identical rheological behavior reported
for the crosslinking polymeric materials undergoing chemical gelation. Consequently at a certain
time tan{\delta} is observed to be independent of frequency. However, for samples preserved under
rest condition for longer duration before applying the shear melting, the liquid to solid transition
subsequent to shear melting shows greater deviation from classical gelation. We also obtain continuous
relaxation time spectra from the frequency dependence of elastic and viscous moduli. We observe
that, with increase in the rest time, continuous relaxation time spectrum shows gradual variation
from negative slope, describing dominance of fast relaxation modes to positive slope representing
dominance of slow relaxation modes. We propose that the deviation from gelation behavior for the
shear melted suspensions originates from inability of shear melting to completely break the percolated
structure thereby creating unbroken aggregates. The volume fraction of such unbroken aggregates
increases with the rest time. For small rest times presence of fewer number of unbroken aggregates
cause deviation from the classical gelation. On the other hand, at high rest times presence of greater
fraction of unbroken aggregates subsequent to shear melting demonstrate dynamic arrest reminiscent
in that of colloidal glasses.
