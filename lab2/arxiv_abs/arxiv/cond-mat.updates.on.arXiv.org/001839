5d transition metal oxides offer new opportunities to test our understanding of the interplay of
correlation effects and spin-orbit interactions in materials in the absence of a single dominant
interaction. The subtle balance between solid-state interactions can result in new mechanisms
that minimize the interaction energy, and in material properties of potential use for applications.
We focus here on the 5d transition metal oxide NaOsO3, a strong candidate for the realization of a
magnetically driven transition from a metallic to an insulating state exploiting the so-called
Slater mechanism. Experimental results are derived from non-resonant and resonant x-ray single
crystal diffraction at the Os L-edges. A change in the crystallographic symmetry does not accompany
the metal-insulator transition in the Slater mechanism and, indeed, we find no evidence of such
a change in NaOsO3. An equally important experimental observation is the emergence of the (300)
Bragg peak in the resonant condition with the onset of magnetic order. The intensity of this space-group
forbidden Bragg peak continuously increases with decreasing temperature in line with the square
of intensity observed for an allowed magnetic Bragg peak. Our main experimental results, the absence
of crystal symmetry breaking and the emergence of a space-group forbidden Bragg peak with developing
magnetic order, support the use of the Slater mechanism to interpret the metal-insulator transition
in NaOsO3. We successfully describe our experimental results with simulations of the electronic
structure and, also, with an atomic model based on the established symmetry of the crystal and magnetic
structure.
