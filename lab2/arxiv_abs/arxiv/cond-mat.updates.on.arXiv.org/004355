Ductile metals undergo a considerable amount of plastic deformation before failure. Void nucleation,
growth and coalescence is the mechanism of failure in such metals. {\alpha}/{\beta} titanium alloys
are ductile in nature and are widely used for their unique set of properties like specific strength,
fracture toughness, corrosion resistance and resistance to fatigue failures. Voids in these alloys
were reported to nucleate on the phase boundaries between {\alpha} and {\beta} phase. Based on the
findings of crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) based investigation of the void growth
at the interface of {\alpha} and {\beta} phases [1], [2], a void nucleation, growth, and coalescence
model has been formulated. An existing single-phase crystal plasticity theory is extended to incorporate
underlying physical mechanisms of deformation and failure in dual phase titanium alloys. Effects
of various factors (stress triaxiality, Lode parameter, deformation state (equivalent strain),
and phase boundary inclination) on void nucleation, growth and coalescence are used to formulate
the constitutive model while their interaction with a conventional crystal plasticity theory
is established. An extensive parametric assessment of the model is carried out to quantify and understand
the effects of the material parameters on the overall material response. Performance of the proposed
model is then assessed and verified by comparing the results of the proposed model with the RVE study
results. Application of the constitutive model for utilisation in the design and optimisation
of the forming process of {\alpha}/{\beta} titanium alloy components is also demonstrated using
experimental data.
