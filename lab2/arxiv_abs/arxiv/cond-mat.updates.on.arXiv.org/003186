The coupling between lattice vibration quanta and valence electrons can induce charge density
modulations and decisively influence the transport properties of materials, e.g. leading to conventional
superconductivity. In high critical temperature superconductors, where electronic correlation
is the main actor, the actual role of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is being intensely debated
theoretically and investigated experimentally. We present an in-depth study of how the EPC strength
can be obtained directly from resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) data through the theoretical
approach derived by Ament et al. [EPL 95, 27008 (2011)]. The role of the model parameters (e.g. phonon
energy $\omega_0$, intermediate state lifetime $1/\Gamma$, EPC matrix element $M$, and detuning
energy $\Omega$) is thoroughly analyzed, providing general relations among them that can be used
to make quantitative estimates of the dimensionless EPC $g = (M/\omega_0)^2$ without detailed
microscopic modeling. We then apply these methods to very high resolution Cu $L_3$ edge RIXS spectra
of three Nd$_{1+x}$Ba$_{2-x}$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films. For the insulating antiferromagnetic
parent compound the value of $M$ as a function of the in-plane momentum transfer is obtained for Cu-O
bond-stretching (breathing) and bond-bending (buckling) phonon branches. For the underdoped
and the nearly optimally doped samples, the effects of Coulomb screening and of charge-density-wave
correlations on $M$ are assessed. In light of the anticipated further improvements of the RIXS experimental
resolution, this work provides a solid framework for an exhaustive investigation of the EPC in cuprates
and other quantum materials.
