The interaction with time-dependent external fields, especially the interplay between time-dependent
driving and quantum correlations, changes the familiar picture of electron transport through
nanoscale systems. Although the exact solution of the problem of AC quantum transport of noninteracting
electrons has been known for more than two decades, the treatment of correlated particles presents
a significant theoretical challenge. In this paper, using the perturbative separation of fast
electron tunnelling and slow driving time-scales, we developed a practical approach for time-dependent
quantum transport with nonequilibrium Green's functions. The fast electronic dynamics is associated
with relative time whilst the slow driving is related to the central time in the Green's functions.
The ratio of characteristic electron tunneling time over the period of harmonic driving is used
as a small parameter in the theory to obtain a convergent time-derivative expansions of the Green's
functions. This enables the algebraic solution of the Kadanoff-Baym equations in Wigner space.
Consequently, we produced analytical expressions for dynamical corrections to advanced, retarded,
and lesser Green's functions, as well as an improved expression for AC electric current. The method
developed is applicable to the general case of multi-channel electron transport through a correlated
central region. The theory is applied to different transport scenarios: time-dependent transport
through a driven single-resonant level is compared to exact results; and electron transport through
a molecular junction described by the Holstein model with a time-oscillating voltage bias is also
investigated.
