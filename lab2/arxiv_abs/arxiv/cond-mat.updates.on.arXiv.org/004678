We present a joint theoretical and experimental study of the oxygen $K$-edge spectra for LaFeO$_3$
and homovalent Ni-substituted LaFeO$_3$ (LaFe$_{0.75}$Ni$_{0.25}$O$_3$), using first-principles
simulations based on density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals and x-ray absorption
near edge structure (XANES) measurements. Ground-state and excited-state XANES calculations
employ Hubbard on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ parameters determined from first principles and
the Lanczos recursive method to obtain absorption cross sections, which allows for a reliable description
of XANES spectra in transition-metal compounds in a very broad energy range, with an accuracy comparable
to that of hybrid functionals but at a substantially lower cost. We show that standard gradient-corrected
exchange-correlation functionals fail in capturing accurately the electronic properties of
both materials. In particular, for LaFe$_{0.75}$Ni$_{0.25}$O$_3$ they do not reproduce its semiconducting
behaviour and provide a poor description of the pre-edge features at the O $K$ edge. The inclusion
of Hubbard interactions leads to a drastic improvement, accounting for the semiconducting ground
state of LaFe$_{0.75}$Ni$_{0.25}$O$_3$ and for a good agreement between calculated and measured
XANES spectra. We show that the partial substitution of Fe with Ni affects the conduction-band bottom
by generating a strongly hybridized O($2p$)-Ni($3d$) minority-spin empty electronic state.
The present work, based on a consistent correction of self-interaction errors, outlines the crucial
role of extended Hubbard functionals to describe the electronic structure of complex transition-metal
oxides such as LaFeO$_3$ and LaFe$_{0.75}$Ni$_{0.25}$O$_3$ and paves the way to future studies
on similar systems.
