We theoretically investigate the electronic and transport properties of a semi-Dirac material
under the influence of an external time dependent periodic driving field (irradiation) by means
of Floquet theory. We explore the inelastic scattering mechanism between different side-bands,
induced by irradiation, by using Floquet scattering matrix approach. The scattering probabilities
between two nearest side-bands depend monotonically on the strength of the amplitude of the irradiation.
The external irradiation induces gap into the band dispersion which is strongly dependent on the
angular orientation of momentum. Although, the high frequency limit indicates that the gap opening
does not occur in an irradiated semi-Dirac material, a careful analysis of the full band structure
beyond this limit reveals that gap opening indeed appears for higher values of momentum (away from
the Dirac point). Furthermore, the angular dependent dynamical gap is also present which cannot
be captured within the high frequency approximation. The contrasting features of irradiated semi-Dirac
material, in comparison to irradiated graphene, can be probed via the behavior of conductance.
The latter exhibits the appearance of non-zero conductance dips due to the gap opening in Floquet
band spectrum. Moreover, by considering a nanoribbon geometry of such material, we also show that
it can host a pair of edge modes which are fully decoupled from the bulk, which is in contrast to the
case of graphene nanoribbon where the edge modes are coupled to the bulk. We also investigate that
if the nanoribbon of this material is exposed to the external irradiation, decoupled edge modes
penetrate into the bulk.
