The quantum interaction between molecules and electrode s material at molecules-electrode interfaces
is a major ingredient in the electronic transport properties of organic junctions. Driven by the
coupling strength between the two materials, it results mainly in a broadening and an energy shift
of the interacting molecular orbitals. Using new electrodes materials, such as the recent semi-conducting
two-dimensional nanomaterials, has become a recent challenge in the field of molecular-organic
electronics that opens new possibilities for controlling the interfacial electronic properties
and thus the charge injection properties. In this article, we report the use of atomically thin two-dimensional
multilayer graphene films as base electrode in organic junctions with a vertical architecture.
The interfacial electronic structure dominated by the covalent bonding between bis-thienyl benzene
diazonium-based molecules and the multilayer graphene electrode has been probed by ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy and the results compared with those obtained on junctions with standard
Au electrodes. Room temperature injection properties of such interfaces have been also explored
by electronic transport measurements. We find that, despite strong variations of the density of
states, the Fermi energy and the injection barriers, both organic junctions with Au base electrodes
and multilayer graphene base electrodes show similar electronic responses. We explain this observation
by the strong orbital coupling occurring at the bottom electrode-bis(thienyl) benzene molecules
interface and by the pinning of the hybridized molecular orbitals.
