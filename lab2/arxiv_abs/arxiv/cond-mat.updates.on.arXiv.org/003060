High quality stoichiometric magnetite (Fe3O4) films grown by infrared pulsed laser deposition
(IR-PLD) on different surfaces were investigated in order to study the influence of the substrate,
orientation, and thickness on their magnetic behavior. Different single crystal (001)-oriented
substrates, i.e., SrTiO3(001), MgAl2O4(001) and MgO(001), have been used for the preparation
of epitaxial Fe3O4(001) films. By comparison, polycrystalline magnetite films were obtained
on both single crystal Al2O3(0001) and amorphous Si/SiO2 substrates. The thickness has been varied
between 50 - 400 nm. All films consist of nanocrystalline stoichiometric magnetite with very small
strain (<1\%) and present the Verwey transition (Tv) between 110-120 K, i.e., close to bulk magnetite
(122 K). In general, Tv depends on both microstructure and thickness, increasing mainly as the thickness
increases. Room temperature angular-dependent measurements reveal an in-plane fourfold symmetry
magnetic behavior for all films grown on (001)-oriented surfaces, and with the easy axes lying along
the Fe3O4 [010] and [100] directions. Remarkably, the fourfold magnetic symmetry shows up to 400
nm thick films. In turn, the films grown on single crystal Al2O3 (0001) and on amorphous Si/SiO2 surfaces
display an isotropic magnetic behavior. Coercive field (Hc) depends on microstructure and film
thickness. The largest (lowest) Hc value corresponds to the thinner film grown on a single crystal
SrTiO3(001) (amorphous Si/SiO2) surface, which present the largest (lowest) strain (crystallinity).
Moreover, the coercivity follows an inverse law with film thickness. Our results demonstrate that
we can artificially control the magnetic behavior of stoichiometric IR-PLD grown Fe3O4 films by
exploiting substrate-induced anisotropy and thickness-controlled coercivity, that might be
relevant to incorporate magnetite in future spintronic devices.
