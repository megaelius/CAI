The local moment approach (LMA) has presented itself as a powerful semi-analytical quantum impurity
solver (QIS) in the context of the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for the periodic Anderson
model and it correctly captures the low energy Kondo scale for the single impurity model, having
excellent agreement with the Bethe ansatz and numerical renormalization group results. However,
the most common correlated lattice model, the Hubbard model, has not been explored well within the
LMA+DMFT framework beyond the insulating phase. Here in our work, within the framework we attempt
to complete the phase diagram of the single band Hubbard model at zero temperature. Our formalism
is generic to any particle filling and can be extended to finite temperature. We contrast our results
with another QIS, namely the iterated perturbation theory (IPT) and show that the second spectral
moment sum-rule improves better as the Hubbard interaction strength grows stronger in LMA, whereas
it severely breaks down after the Mott transition in IPT. We also show that, in the metallic phase,
the low-energy scaling of the spectral density leads to universality which extends to infinite
frequency range at infinite correlation strength (strong-coupling). At large interaction strength,
the off half-filling spectral density forms a pseudogap near the Fermi level and filling-controlled
Mott transition occurs as one approaches the half-filling. Finally we study optical properties
and find universal features such as absorption peak position governed by the low-energy scale and
a doping independent crossing point, often dubbed as the "isosbestic point" in experiments.
