The ability to controllably manipulate the laser-induced ultrafast magnetic dynamics is a prerequisite
for future high speed spintronic devices. The optimization of devices requires the controllability
of the ultrafast demagnetization time, , and intrinsic Gilbert damping, . In previous attempts
to establish the relationship between and , the rare-earth doping of a permalloy film with two different
demagnetization mechanism is not a suitable candidate. Here, we choose Co/Ni bilayers to investigate
the relations between and by means of time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TRMOKE) via adjusting
the thickness of the Ni layers, and obtain an approximately proportional relation between these
two parameters. The remarkable agreement between TRMOKE experiment and the prediction of breathing
Fermi-surface model confirms that a large Elliott-Yafet spin-mixing parameter is relevant to
the strong spin-orbital coupling at the Co/Ni interface. More importantly, a proportional relation
between and in such metallic films or heterostructures with electronic relaxation near Fermi surface
suggests the local spin-flip scattering domains the mechanism of ultrafast demagnetization,
otherwise the spin-current mechanism domains. It is an effective method to distinguish the dominant
contributions to ultrafast magnetic quenching in metallic heterostructures by investigating
both the ultrafast demagnetization time and Gilbert damping simultaneously. Our work can open
a novel avenue to manipulate the magnitude and efficiency of Terahertz emission in metallic heterostructures
such as the perpendicular magnetic anisotropic Ta/Pt/Co/Ni/Pt/Ta multilayers, and then it has
an immediate implication of the design of high frequency spintronic devices.
