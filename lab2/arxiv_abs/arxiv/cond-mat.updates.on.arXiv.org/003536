Many-body localized (MBL) systems do not approach thermal equilibrium under their intrinsic dynamics;
MBL and conventional thermalizing systems form distinct dynamical phases of matter, separated
by a phase transition at which equilibrium statistical mechanics breaks down. True MBL is known
to occur only under certain stringent conditions for perfectly isolated one-dimensional systems,
with Hamiltonians that have strictly short-range interactions and lack any continuous non-Abelian
symmetries. However, in practice, even systems that are not strictly MBL can be nearly MBL, with
equilibration rates that are far slower than their other intrinsic timescales; thus, anomalously
slow relaxation occurs in a much broader class of systems than strict MBL. In this review we address
transport and dynamics in such nearly-MBL systems from a unified perspective. Our discussion covers
various classes of such systems: (i) disordered and quasiperiodic systems on the thermal side of
the MBL-thermal transition; (ii) systems that are strongly disordered, but obstructed from localizing
because of symmetry, interaction range, or dimensionality; (iii) multiple-component systems,
in which some components would in isolation be MBL but others are not; and finally (iv) driven systems
whose dynamics lead to exponentially slow rates of heating to infinite temperature. A theme common
to many of these problems is that they can be understood in terms of approximately localized degrees
of freedom coupled to a heat bath (or baths) consisting of thermal degrees of freedom; however, this
putative bath is itself nontrivial, being either small or very slowly relaxing. We discuss anomalous
transport, diverging relaxation times, and other signatures of the proximity to MBL in these systems.
We also survey recent theoretical and numerical methods that have been applied to study dynamics
on either side of the MBL transition.
