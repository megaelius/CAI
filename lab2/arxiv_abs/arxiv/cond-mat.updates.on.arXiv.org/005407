We derive and analyze the longitudinal and the anomalous Hall conductivity for a general momentum-block-diagonal
two-band model. This model captures a broad spectrum of physically very different systems including
N\'eel antiferromagnetic and spiral spin density waves as well as models that involve spin-orbit
interaction and are known to show topological properties. We present a complete microscopic derivation
for finite temperature and constant scattering rate $\Gamma$ that is diagonal and equal, but arbitrarily
large for both bands. We identify two criteria that allow for a unique and physically motivated decomposition
of the conductivities. On the one hand, we distinguish intraband and interband contributions that
are defined by the involved quasiparticle spectral functions. On the other hand, we distinguish
symmetric and antisymmetric contributions that are defined by the symmetry under the exchange
of the current and the electric field directions. The (symmetric) intraband contributions generalize
the formula of standard Boltzmann transport theory, which is valid only in the clean limit (small
$\Gamma$), whereas the interband contributions capture interband coherence effects beyond independent
quasiparticles. We show that the symmetric interband contribution is a correction only present
for finite $\Gamma$ and is controlled by the quantum metric. The antisymmetric interband contributions
generalize the formula of the anomalous Hall conductivity in terms of the Berry curvature to finite
$\Gamma$. We study the clean (small $\Gamma$) and dirty (large $\Gamma$) limit analytically. The
connection between the presented derivation and the Bastin and Streda formalism is given. We apply
our results to a Chern insulator, a ferromagnetic multi-d-orbital, and a spiral spin density wave
model.
