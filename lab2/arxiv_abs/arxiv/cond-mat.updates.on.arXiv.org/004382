The rational design of two-dimensional piezoelectric materials has recently garnered increasing
interest because of harnessing these materials in technological applications, including sensor
technology, actuating devices, energy harvesting, and medical applications. Several materials
possessing high piezoelectric response have been reported so far, but a high-throughput first-principles
approach to estimate the piezoelectric potential of layered materials has not been performed yet.
In this respect, we systematically investigated the piezoelectric ($e_{11}$, $d_{11}$) and elastic
(C$_{11}$ and C$_{12}$) properties of 108 thermodynamically stable two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor
materials by employing first-principle methods. Our calculations found a notable difference
between the relaxed ion coefficients calculated with GGA and LDA functionals, indicating a strong
exchange-correlation functional dependence. Nevertheless, both functionals yield the same
trends for the elastic constants and piezoelectric coefficients. Our high-throughput approach
demonstrates that the materials containing Group-\textrm{V} elements produce notably high piezoelectric
strain constants, $d_{11}$ $>$ 40 pmV$^{-1}$, and 42 of considered materials have the $e_{11}$
coefficient higher than MoS$_{2}$ insomuch as BrSSb has one of the largest $d_{11}$ with a value
of 503.6 pmV$^{-1}$. Besides, we established simple empirical models to estimate the $d_{11}$
coefficients by utilizing the relative ionic motion in the unit cell and the polarizability of the
individual elements in the compounds. The proposed models, tested for both exchange-correlation
functionals, are successful in estimating the piezoelectric constants of the studied materials
with sufficient accuracy.
