In this paper, we introduce a novel integration method of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation.
It has always been known that if during the discrete integration of the KPZ equation the nearest-neighbor
height-difference exceeds a critical value, an instability appears and the integration diverges.
One way to avoid these instabilities is to replace the KPZ nonlinear-term by a function of the same
term that depends on a single adjustable parameter which is able to control pillars or grooves growing
on the interface. Here, we propose a different integration method which consists of directly limiting
the value taken by the KPZ nonlinearity, thereby imposing a restriction rule that is applied in each
integration time-step, as if it were the growth rule of a restricted discrete model, e.g. restricted-solid-on-solid
(RSOS). Taking the discrete KPZ equation with restrictions to its dimensionless version, the integration
depends on three parameters: the coupling constant $g$, the inverse of the time-step $k$, and the
restriction constant $\varepsilon$ which is chosen to eliminate divergences while keeping all
the properties of the continuous KPZ equation. We study in detail the conditions in the parameters'
space that avoids divergences in the 1-dimensional integration and reproduce the scaling properties
of the continuous KPZ with a particular parameter set. We apply the tested methodology to the $d$-dimensional
case ($d = 3,4$) with the purpose of obtaining the growth exponent $\beta$, by establishing the conditions
of the coupling constant $g$ under which we recover known values reached by other authors, in particular
for the RSOS model. This method allows us to infer that $d = 4$ is not the critical dimension of the KPZ
universality class, where the strong-coupling phase dissapears.
