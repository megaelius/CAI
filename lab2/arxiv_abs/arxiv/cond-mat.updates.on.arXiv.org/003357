A fabrication process is developed for growth of c-axis textured aluminum nitride (AlN) film on
the sidewall of single crystal silicon (Si) micro-fins to realize fin bulk acoustic wave resonators
(FinBAR). FinBARs enable ultra-dense integration of high quality-factor (Q) resonators and low-loss
filters on a small chip footprint and provide extreme lithographical frequency scalability over
ultra- and super-high-frequency regimes. Si micro-fins with large aspect ratio are patterned
and their sidewall surfaces are atomically smoothened. The reactive magnetron sputtering AlN
deposition is engineered to optimize the hexagonal crystallinity of the sidewall AlN film with
c-axis perpendicular to the sidewall of Si micro-fin. The effect of bottom metal electrode and surface
roughness on the texture and crystallinity of the sidewall AlN film is explored. The atomic-layer-deposited
platinum film with (111) crystallinity is identified as a suitable bottom electrode for deposition
of c-axis textured AlN on the sidewall with c-axis orientation of $88.5{\deg} \pm 1.5{\deg}$ and
arc-angle of ~12{\deg} around (002) diffraction spot over film thickness. 4.2 GHz FinBAR prototype
is implemented showing a Q of 1,574 and effective electromechanical coupling (keff2) of 2.75%,
when operating in 3rd width-extensional resonance mode. The lower measured Q and keff2 compared
to simulations highlights the effect of granular texture of sidewall AlN film on limiting the performance
of FinBARs. The developed c-axis textured sidewall AlN film technology paves the way for realization
and monolithic integration of multi-frequency and multi-band FinBAR spectral processors for
the emerging carrier aggregated wireless communication systems.
