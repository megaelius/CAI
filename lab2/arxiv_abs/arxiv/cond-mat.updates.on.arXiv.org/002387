We analyze the problem of extracting the correlation length from infinite matrix product states
(MPS) and corner transfer matrix (CTM) simulations. When the correlation length is calculated
directly from the transfer matrix, it is typically significantly underestimated for finite bond
dimensions used in numerical simulation. This is true even when one considers ground states at a
distance from the critical point. We introduce extrapolation procedure to overcome this problem.
To that end we quantify how much the dominant part of the MPS/CTM transfer matrix spectrum deviates
from being continuous. The latter is necessary to capture the exact asymptotics of the correlation
function where the exponential decay is typically modified by an additional algebraic term. By
extrapolating such a refinement parameter to zero, we show that we are able to recover the exact value
of the correlation length with high accuracy. In a generic setting, our method reduces the error
by a factor of $\sim 100$ as compared to the results without extrapolation and a factor of $\sim 10$
as compared to simple extrapolation schemes using bond dimension. We test our approach in a number
of solvable models both in 1d and 2d. Subsequently, we apply it to 1d XXZ spin-$\frac32$ and the Bose-Hubbard
models in a massive regime in the vicinity of BKT critical point. We then fit the scaling form of the
correlation length and extract the position of the critical point and obtain results comparable
or better than those of other state-of-the-art numerical methods. Finally, we show how the algebraic
part of the correlation function asymptotics can be directly recovered from the scaling of the dominant
form factor within our approach. Our method provides the means for detailed studies of phase diagrams
of quantum models in 1d and, through the finite correlation length scaling of projected entangled
pair states, also in 2d.
