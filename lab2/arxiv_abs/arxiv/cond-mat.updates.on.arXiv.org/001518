During development of biological organisms, multiple complex structures are formed. In many instances,
these structures need to exhibit a high degree of order to be functional, although many of their constituents
are intrinsically stochastic. Hence, it has been suggested that biological robustness ultimately
must rely on complex gene regulatory networks and clean-up mechanisms. Here we explore developmental
processes that have evolved inherent robustness against stochasticity. In the context of the Drosophila
eye disc, multiple optical units, ommatidia, develop into crystal-like patterns. During the larva-to-pupa
stage of metamorphosis, the centers of the ommatidia are specified initially through the diffusion
of morphogens, followed by the specification of R8 cells. Establishing the R8 cell is crucial in
setting up the geometric, and functional, relationships of cells within an ommatidium and among
neighboring ommatidia. Here we study a mathematical model of these spatio-temporal processes
in the presence of stochasticity, defining and applying measures that quantify order within the
resulting spatial patterns. We observe a universal sigmoidal response to increasing transcriptional
noise. Ordered patterns persist up to a threshold noise level in the model parameters. As the noise
is further increased past a threshold point of no return, these ordered patterns rapidly become
disordered. Such robustness in development allows for the accumulation of genetic variation without
any observable changes in phenotype. We argue that the observed sigmoidal dependence introduces
robustness allowing for sizable amounts of genetic variation and transcriptional noise to be tolerated
in natural populations without resulting in phenotype variation.
