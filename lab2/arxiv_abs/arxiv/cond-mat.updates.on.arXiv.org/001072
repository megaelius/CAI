In addition to the self-governing properties, tiny-sized particles of metallic colloids are the
building blocks of large-sized particles. Thus, their study has been the subject of many publications.
In the present work, it has been discussed that gold tiny particles developed at solution surface
and inside the solution depend on the attained dynamics of atoms following by their binding mechanism.
The localized process conditions direct three-dimensional structure of surface format in monolayer
tiny particle at solution surface when atoms are in transition state. A direct supply of energy binds
amalgamated atoms into tiny particle without executing electron-dynamics following by the elongation
of one-dimensional array under the force of opposite poles. In elongated arrays, each atom starting
at centre point diffused electrons to adjacent ones of both sides dealing the same behavior under
the stretching of clamping energy knots. However, a tiny particle deals three-dimensional structure
of grounded format or mix order dimension developed near to or below solution surface where amalgamating
atoms can bind to targeted atom when executing electron-dynamics at required heat energy. At solution
surface, impinging electron streams at fixed angle results into further elongation of naturally
elongated atoms of developed tiny particles. This study highlights the fundamental process of
formation of tiny particles under electronic structure, phase transition and localized dynamics
of gold atoms. Such a tool of processing materials opens several possibilities to develop engineered
materials with specific properties.
