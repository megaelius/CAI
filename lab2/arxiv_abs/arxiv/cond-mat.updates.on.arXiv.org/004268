Malleability of metals is an example of how dynamics of defects like dislocations induced by external
stresses alters material properties and enables technological applications. However, these
defects move merely to comply with the mechanical forces applied on macroscopic scales whereas
the molecular and atomic building blocks behave like rigid particles. Here we demonstrate how motions
of crystallites and defects between them can arise within the soft matter medium in an oscillating
electric field applied to a chiral liquid crystal with polycrystalline quasi-hexagonal arrangements
of self-assembled topological solitons called "torons". Periodic oscillations of electric field
applied perpendicular to the plane of hexagonal lattices prompt repetitive shear-like deformations
of the solitons, which synchronize the electrically-powered self-shearing directions. The temporal
evolution of deformations upon turning voltage on and off is not invariant upon reversal of time,
prompting lateral translations of the crystallites of torons within quasi-hexagonal periodically
deformed lattices. We probe how these motions depend on voltage and frequency of oscillating field
applied in an experimental geometry resembling that of liquid crystal displays. We study the inter-relations
between synchronized deformations of the soft solitonic particles and their arrays and the ensuing
dynamics and giant number fluctuations mediated by motions of crystallites, 5-7 defects pairs
and grain boundaries in the orderly organizations of solitons. We discuss how our findings may lead
to technological and fundamental science applications of dynamic self-assemblies of topologically
protected but highly deformable particle-like solitons.
