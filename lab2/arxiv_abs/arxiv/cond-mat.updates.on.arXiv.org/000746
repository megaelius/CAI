We derive functional flow equations for the two-particle vertex and the self-energy in interacting
fermion systems which capture the full frequency dependence of both quantities. The equations
are applied to the hole-doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as a prototype system with entangled
magnetic, charge and pairing fluctuations. Each fluctuation channel acquires substantial dependencies
on all three Matsubara frequencies, such that the frequency dependence of the vertex cannot be accurately
represented by a channel sum with only one frequency variable in each term. At the temperatures we
are able to access, the leading instabilities are mostly antiferromagnetic, with an incommensurate
wave vector. However, at large doping, a divergence in the charge channel occurs at a finite frequency
transfer, if the vertex flow is computed without self-energy feedback. This enigmatic instability
was already observed in a calculation by Husemann et al. [Phys. Rev. B 85, 075121 (2012)], who used
an approximate separable ansatz for the frequency dependence of the vertex. We identify a simple
mechanism for this instability in terms of a random phase approximation for the charge channel with
a frequency dependent effective magnetic interaction as input. In spite of the strong momentum
and frequency dependence of the vertex, the self-energy has a Fermi liquid form. At the moderate
interaction strength where our approach is applicable, we obtain a moderate reduction of the quasi-particle
weight and a sizable decay rate with a pronounced momentum dependence. Nevertheless, the self-energy
feedback into the vertex flow turns out to be crucial, as it suppresses the unphysical finite frequency
charge instability.
