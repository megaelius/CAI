Corrosion is an inevitable phenomenon that is inherent in metals and even though there has been significant
research on this subject, no ideal protection has been discovered to fully prevent corrosion. However,
methods such as using protective coatings, and modifying the structure or composition of the material
have been used to slow down gradual corrosion and fortunately they proved to be quite beneficial.
The research focus has shifted to integrating novel materials and structures to improve the corrosion
resistance of composites. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are an attractive and promising filler due to
their chemical inertness and high mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. CNTs can fill
the gaps of metals and polymer-based composites by forming a passive layer on metals and promoting
sacrificial protection in zinc rich polymer (ZRP) coatings, and can therefore function as an anti-corrosion
filler. This paper reviews the research that has been performed to better understand the influence
of CNTs on corrosion resistance in composites. Accordingly, in metal matrix composites (MMCs),
most of the work has been carried out on electrodeposited coatings, namely Ni-based-CNT composites,
which show improved corrosion resistance by CNT addition. On the other hand, there are a few papers
that have studied the corrosion resistance of Mg-based-CNT composites and their corrosion results
contradict those obtained from other metal-CNT composites. For ZRPs or polymer-based coatings
there are a few papers that studied the effect of CNTs on the corrosion of said composites. It is believed
that CNTs can strengthen the adhesion between the coating and the substrate and facilitate sacrificial
protection by Zn particles by forming a conductive network, hence the improved corrosion resistance.
