The lamellar cuprate superconductors exhibit the highest ambient-pressure superconducting
transition temperatures (T$_C$) and, after more than three decades of extraordinary research
activity, continue to pose formidable scientific challenges. A major experimental obstacle has
been to distinguish universal phenomena from materials- or technique-dependent ones. Angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measures momentum-dependent single-particle electronic
excitations and has been invaluable in the endeavor to determine the anisotropic momentum-space
properties of the cuprates. HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Hg1201) is a single-CuO$_2$-layer cuprate
with a particularly high optimal T$_C$ and a simple crystal structure; yet there exists little information
from ARPES about the electronic properties of this model system. Here we present an ARPES study of
doping-, temperature-, and momentum-dependent systematics of near-nodal dispersion anomalies
in Hg1201. The data reveal a hierarchy of three distinct energy scales -a sub-gap low-energy kink,
an intermediate-energy kink near 55 meV, and a peak-dip-hump structure. The first two features
are attributed to the coupling of electrons to Ba-derived optical phonons and in-plane bond-stretching
phonons, respectively. The nodal peak-dip-hump structure appears to have a common doping-dependence
in several single-layer cuprates, and is interpreted as a manifestation of pseudogap physics at
the node. These results establish several universal phenomena, both in terms of connecting multiple
experimental techniques for a single material, and in terms of connecting comparable spectral
features in multiple structurally similar cuprates.
