In this work, we present a numerical model for two-dimensional axisymmetric continuous freezing
by impingement of processed meat or similar products in food industry moving along a conveyor belt.
It is developed as a computationally efficient alternative to solve conjugate heat transfer between
a fluid and a solid accompanied by phase change in some constituents of the solid phase (mostly water
in the case of food products). While we assume that the solid can be represented as an homogeneous
medium, we allow its thermophysical properties to depend on tempreature, such that our impingement
freezing model is envisioned to be valid for highly processed vegetarians products or meat such
as sausages, mince or ham freezing. Furthermore, this approach is simple in terms of computational
intensity whilst still enables to capture the complexity of continuous freezing under industrial
setting. Thus, the model is implemented in the widely used open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) library OpenFOAM, which provides a wide range of numerical tools for solving complex conjugate
transfer problems. Overall, highly non-linear freezing behaviour was found due to the phase change
inside the solid and the associated heat of fusion. We studied the effect of high fluid Reynolds numbers
as well as investigating the optimal distance between the jet and the solid surface for different
speeds of the conveyor. We found that the maximum freezing is obtained positioning the jet at a distance
H = 0.25D (where D is the diameter of the impinging jet) and setting the speed of the conveyor such that
the P\'eclet number of the solid is $\text{Pe}_{\text{s}}=8244$. The methodology developed allows
to obtain detailed insight on the freezing process for various impingement configurations at a
minimum computational cost using freely available open-source tools.
