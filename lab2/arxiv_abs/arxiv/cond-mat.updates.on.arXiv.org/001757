Gibbs states are known to play a crucial role in the statistical description of a system with a large
number of degrees of freedom. They are expected to be vital also in a quantum gravitational system
with many underlying fundamental discrete degrees of freedom. However, due to the absence of well-defined
concepts of time and energy in background independent settings, formulating statistical equilibrium
in such cases is an open issue. This is even more so in a quantum gravity context that is not based on
any of the usual spacetime structures, but on non-spatiotemporal degrees of freedom. In this paper,
after having clarified general notions of statistical equilibrium, on which two different construction
procedures for Gibbs states can be based, we focus on the group field theory formalism for quantum
gravity, whose technical features prove advantageous to the task. We use the operator formulation
of group field theory to define its statistical mechanical framework, based on which we construct
three concrete examples of Gibbs states. The first is a Gibbs state with respect to a geometric volume
operator, which is shown to support condensation to a low-spin phase. This state is not based on a
pre-defined symmetry of the system and its construction is via Jaynes' entropy maximisation principle.
The second are Gibbs states encoding structural equilibrium with respect to internal translations
on the GFT base manifold, and defined via the KMS condition. The third are Gibbs states encoding relational
equilibrium with respect to a clock Hamiltonian, obtained by deparametrization with respect to
coupled scalar matter fields.
