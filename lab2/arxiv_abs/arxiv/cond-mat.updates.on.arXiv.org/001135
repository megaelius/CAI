We experimentally study the stability of a bosonic Mott-insulator against the formation of a density
wave induced by long-range interactions, and characterize the intrinsic dynamics between these
two states. The Mott-insulator is created in a quantum degenerate gas of 87-Rubidium atoms, trapped
in a three-dimensional optical lattice. The gas is located inside and globally coupled to an optical
cavity. This causes interactions of global range, mediated by photons dispersively scattered
between a transverse lattice and the cavity. The scattering comes with an atomic density modulation,
which is measured by the photon flux leaking from the cavity. We initialize the system in a Mott-insulating
state and then rapidly increase the global coupling strength. We observe that the system falls into
either of two distinct final states. One is characterized by a low photon flux, signaling a Mott insulator,
and the other is characterized by a high photon flux, which we associate with a density wave. Ramping
the global coupling slowly, we observe a hysteresis loop between the two states - a further signature
of metastability. A comparison with a theoretical model confirms that the metastability originates
in the competition between short- and global-range interactions. From the increasing photon flux
monitored during the switching process, we find that several thousand atoms tunnel to a neighboring
site on the time scale of the single particle dynamics. We argue that a density modulation, initially
forming in the compressible surface of the trapped gas, triggers an avalanche tunneling process
in the Mott-insulating region.
