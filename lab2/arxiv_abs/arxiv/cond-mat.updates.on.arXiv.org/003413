Working within the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) framework, we construct efficient quantum
cluster algorithms for transverse field Ising antiferromagnets on the pyrochlore lattice and
the planar pyrochlore lattice, for the fully frustrated square lattice Ising model in a transverse
field (dual to the 2+1 dimensional odd Ising gauge theory), and for a transverse field Ising model
with multi-spin interactions on the square lattice, which is dual to a 2+1 dimensional even Ising
gauge theory (and reduces to the two dimensional quantum loop model in a certain limit). Our cluster
algorithms use a microcanonical update procedure that generalizes and exploits the notion of "pre-marked
motifs" introduced earlier in the context of a quantum cluster algorithm for triangular lattice
transverse field Ising antiferromagnets. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithms are significantly
more efficient than the standard link percolation based quantum cluster approach. We also introduce
a new canonical update scheme that leads to a further improvement in measurement of some observables
arising from its ability to make one-dimensional clusters in the "imaginary time" direction. Finally,
we demonstrate that refinements in the choice of premarking strategies can lead to additional improvements
in the efficiency of the microcanonical updates. As a first example of the physics that can be studied
using these algorithmic developments, we obtain evidence for a power-law ordered intermediate-temperature
phase associated with the two-step melting of long-range order in the fully frustrated square lattice
transverse field Ising model.
