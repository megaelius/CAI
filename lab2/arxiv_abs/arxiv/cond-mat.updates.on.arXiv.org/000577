Using the generalized DMFT+Sigma approach we have studied disorder influence on single-particle
properties of the normal phase and superconducting transition temperature in attractive Hubbard
model. The wide range of attractive potentials U was studied - from the weak coupling region, where
both the instability of the normal phase and superconductivity are well described by BCS model,
towards the strong coupling region, where superconducting transition is due to Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) of compact Cooper pairs, formed at temperatures much higher than the temperature
of superconducting transition. We have studied two typical models of conduction band with semi-elliptic
and flat densities of states, appropriate for three-dimensional and two-dimensional systems
respectively. For semi-elliptic density of states disorder influence on all single-particle
properties (e.g. density of states) is universal for arbitrary strength of electronic correlations
and disorder and is due only to the general disorder widening of conduction band. In the case of flat
density of states universality is absent in general case, but still the disorder influence is due
mainly to band widening and universal behavior is restored for large enough disorder. Using the
combination of DMFT+Sigma and Nozieres - Schmitt-Rink approximations we have studied disorder
influence upon superconducting transition temperature T_c for the range of characteristic values
of U and disorder, including the BCS-BEC crossover region and the limit of strong coupling. Disorder
can either suppress T_c (in the weak coupling region) or significantly increase T_c (in strong coupling
region). However in all cases the generalized Anderson theorem is valid and all changes of superconducting
critical temperature are essentially due only to the general disorder widening of the conduction
band.
