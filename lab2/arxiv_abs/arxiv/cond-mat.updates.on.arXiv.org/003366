We study the magnetocaloric effect and critical behavior of Co$_2$Cr$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Al ($x=$ 0.25,
0.5, 0.75) Heusler alloys across the ferromagnetic (FM) transition (T$_{\rm C}$). The Rietveld
refinement of x-ray diffraction patterns exhibit single phase cubic structure for all the samples.
The temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility $\chi$(T) data show a systematic enhancement
in the Curie temperature and effective magnetic moment with Mn concentration, which is consistent
with the Slater-Pauling behavior. The M(H) isotherms also exhibit the FM ordering and the analysis
of $\chi$(T) data indicates the nature of the phase transition to be a second order, which is further
supported by scaling of the entropy curves and Arrott plot. Interestingly, the Mn substitution
causes an increase in the magnetic entropy change and hence large relative cooling power for multi-stage
magnetic refrigerator applications. In order to understand the nature of the magnetic phase transition
we examine the critical exponents $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$ for the $x=$ 0.75 sample by the modified
Arrott plot and the critical isotherm analysis, which is further confirmed by Kouvel-Fisher method
and Widom scaling relation, respectively. The estimated values of $\beta=$ 0.507, $\gamma=$ 1.056,
$\delta=$ 3.084 are found to be close to the mean field theoretical values. The renormalized isotherms
(m vs h) corresponding to these exponent values collapse into two branches, above and below T$_{\rm
C}$ that validates our analysis. Our results suggest for the existence of long-range FM interactions,
which decays slower than power law as $J(r)\sim r^{-4.5}$ for a 3 dimensional mean field theory.
