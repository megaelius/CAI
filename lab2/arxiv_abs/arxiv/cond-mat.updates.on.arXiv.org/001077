In the synthesis of all sorts of materials, it is ambiguous to understand the structural evolution.
Structural evolution of solid atoms under different conditions depends on their electron-dynamics.
Electron-dynamics of targeted atoms are purely under the forces of poles instead of frictional
force or other means where they invite energy as per gauge to bind amalgamating atoms under their
attained dynamics. Solid atoms are restricted to evolve structure in one-dimension, two-dimension
and three-dimension while in surface format, space format and grounded format, respectively,
depending on the continuity of regularity in attained dynamics. In the case of short-range order
or long-range order, a structure of mixed order dimension is resulted. Nature of the medium or substrate
along with introduced conditions influence the structure evolution in certain dimension and format
both in terms of attained dynamics and electron-dynamics of atoms. Different shape generated energy
of certain electron-dynamics of targeted atom connecting to energy knot clamping electron state
of amalgamated atom at the point of its binding is because of the same nature. Atoms evolve structures
under the forces of different poles where resulted energy of targeted atom bind to energy knot clamping
electron state of amalgamating atom laterally above and below while in space format and grounded
format, respectively, whereas, bind to energy knot clamping electron state of amalgamating atom
adjacently while in surface format. This fundamental revolution in the approach, how structure
of solid atoms is evolved, may shed new light in existing state of materials science.
