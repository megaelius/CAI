Spin crossover plays a central role in the structural instability, net magnetic moment modification,
metallization, and even in superconductivity in corresponding materials. Most reports on the
pressure-induced spin crossover with a large volume collapse so far focused on compounds with single
transition metal. Here we report a comprehensive high-pressure investigation of a mixed Fe-Mn
perovskite La2FeMnO6. Under pressure, the strong coupling between Fe and Mn leads to a combined
valence/spin transition: Fe3+(S = 5/2) to Fe2+(S = 0) and Mn3+(S = 2) to Mn4+(S = 3/2), with an isostructural
phase transition. The spin transitions of both Fe and Mn are offset by ~ 20 GPa of the onset pressure,
and the lattice collapse occurs in between. Interestingly, Fe3+ ion shows an abnormal behavior
when it reaches a lower valence state (Fe2+) accompanied by a + 0.5 eV energy shift in Fe K-absorption
edge at 15 GPa. This process is associated with the charge-spin-orbital state transition from high
spin Fe3+ to low spin Fe2+, caused by the significantly enhanced t2g-eg crystal field splitting
in the compressed lattice under high pressure. Density Functional Theory calculations confirm
the energy preference of the high-pressure state with charge redistribution accompanied by spin
state transition of Fe ions. Moreover, La2FeMnO6 maintains semiconductor behaviors even when
the pressure reached 144.5 GPa as evidenced by the electrical transport measurements, despite
the huge resistivity decreasing 7 orders of magnitude compared with that at ambient pressure. The
investigation carried out here demonstrates high flexibility of double perovskites and their
good potentials for optimizing the functionality of these materials.
