We investigate the dynamics of spatially discordant alternans (SDA) driven by an instability of
intracellular calcium cycling using both amplitude equations [P. S. Skardal, A. Karma, and J. G.
Restrepo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 108103 (2012)] and ionic model simulations. We find that, close
to the alternans bifurcation, SDA is manifested as a smooth wavy modulation of the amplitudes of
both repolarization and calcium transient (CaT) alternans, similarly to the well-studied case
of voltage-driven alternans. In contrast, further away from the bifurcation, the amplitude of
CaT alternans jumps discontinuously at the nodes separating out-of-phase regions, while the amplitude
of repolarization alternans remains smooth. We show that node motion of discontinuous SDA patterns
is strongly hysteretic even in homogeneous tissue due to the novel phenomenon of "unidirectional
pinning": node movement can only be induced towards, but not away from, the pacing site in response
to a change of pacing rate or physiological parameter. In addition, we show that the wavelength of
discontinuous SDA patterns scales linearly with the conduction velocity restitution length scale,
in contrast to the wavelength of smooth patterns that scales sub-linearly with this length scale.
Those results are also shown to be robust against cell-to-cell fluctuations owing to the property
that unidirectional node motion collapses multiple jumps accumulating in nodal regions into a
single jump. Amplitude equation predictions are in good overall agreement with ionic model simulations.
Finally, we briefly discuss physiological implications of our findings. In particular, we suggest
that due to the tendency of conduction blocks to form near nodes, the presence of unidirectional
pinning makes calcium-driven alternans potentially more arrhythmogenic than voltage-driven
alternans.
