Vacuum arcing (breakdown), is a major limiting factor in various applications such as particle
accelerators, fusion reactors etc. Although it is well-known that vacuum arcs appear after intense
Field electron Emission (FE), the physical mechanism that leads from FE to the ignition of plasma
is not yet well understood. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations have shown that plasma can build
up from an intensively emitting Cu cathode, assuming that a high number of neutral atoms are evaporated
from it (at least 0.015 Cu atoms per emitted electron). This evaporation rate is impossible to obtain
under standard emission conditions and constant emitter shape. However, in this paper we present
multi-scale atomistic simulations that reveal a thermal runaway process leading to the evaporation
of large parts of the emitter. Our molecular dynamics simulations take into account concurrently
and self-consistently various physical processes, namely field-induced forces and deformations,
electron emission with finite-size and space-charge effects, Nottingham and Joule heating. We
find that fields of realistic values --relevant to high voltage electronic devices-- applied on
a sufficiently high nano-tip, are able to generate enough heat to partially melt the tip and sufficient
force to deform it, elongating and sharpening its apex. This initiates a positive feedback process
of heating, sharpening and elongation, which eventually causes evaporation of a large part of the
protrusion, in the form of both isolated neutral atoms and charged metal nano-clusters. The obtained
mean evaporation rate exceeds the minimum required to ignite plasma as found by previous PIC simulations.
