In different materials, orientationally controlled assembling of building blocks results in
the development of different anisotropic particles. These trends are pronounced in atoms of metallic
nature when in their certain transition state. Their monolayer assembly is vital as it forms the
tiny particles. When triangle-shaped packets of nano-energy were supplied by a source of certain
arrangement to that formed compact monolayer assembly, atoms bound into their shapes. Joined triangle-shaped
tiny particles developed when tuned bipolar pulses were examined. For each case, they separated
into two tiny particles while a bit non-uniformed forcing exertion to electrons of atoms making
the contact point. In electronically-flat solution surface that is controlled, re-crystallization
state atoms of tiny particles elongate equally. Electrons of left side and right side at center of
their atoms experience uniformed exertion of surface force exerting along their opposite poles.
Thus, atoms of 1D-arrays convert into structures of smooth elements. Such structures of smooth
elements flatten further by the travelling photons of different forcing energies. Originally,
binding of solid atoms should be considered under the execution of confined inter-state electron
dynamics in grounded format. Nevertheless, tiny particles developed in such structures of smooth
elements and packed for their together assembling at common-point, they deal with the forced exertion,
which remains in the immersing format. In lateral-wise adherence of shaped mono-layers, a gravitational
force exerting to electrons of uniformly elongated atoms competes to levitational force. Structures
of smooth elements adhere their shaped mono-layers in this manner develop a particle of geometrical
shape, which is not the case while developing a distorted particle.
