This paper is concerned with the role of quenched disorder in spin--1/2 quantum magnets. We analyze
the effect of disorder on systems where magnetic frustration promotes the formation of local singlets.
Our results include a theory for 2d valence-bond solids subject to weak bond randomness, as well
as extensions to strong disorder regimes. We find that the destruction of a valence-bond solid phase
by weak quenched disorder leads inevitably to the nucleation of topological defects carrying spin--1/2
moments. This renormalizes the lattice into a strongly random network of defect spins, which yield
interesting low-energy excitations. A similar conclusion is reached in a regime of stronger disorder
where short-ranged valence bonds freeze without local crystalline order: specifically such pinned
singlets are necessarily accompanied by defects which trap spin--1/2 magnetic moments, and whose
residual interactions decide the ultimate low energy fate. Motivated by these results, we conjecture
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-like restrictions on ground states for disordered magnets with spin--1/2
per clean unit cell. The conjecture is supported by an argument for 1d spin chains. We apply insights
from this study to propose an interpretation of the phenomenology of YbMgGaO$_4$, a recently discovered
triangular lattice spin--1/2 insulator, which has been suggested to be a quantum spin liquid. We
instead explore a description based on the pinned singlets instability. Experimental signatures,
including unusual specific heat, thermal conductivity, and dynamical structure factor, and their
behavior in a magnetic field, are predicted from the theory, and compare favorably with existing
measurements on YbMgGaO$_4$ and YbZnGaO$_4$.
