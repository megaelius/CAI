This article reviews odd-frequency (odd-w) pairing with focus on superconducting systems. Since
Berezinskii introduced the concept of odd frequency order in 1974 it has been viewed as an exotic
and rarely occurring in nature. Here, we present a view that the Berezinskii state is in fact a ubiquitous
superconducting order that is both non-local and odd in time. It appears under quite general circumstances
including in bulk materials, heterostructures and dynamically driven superconducting states.
It is therefore important to understand the nature of odd-w pairing. We present the properties of
odd-w pairing in bulk materials, including possible microscopic mechanisms, discuss definitions
of the odd-w superconducting order parameter, and the unusual Meissner response of odd-frequency
superconductors. Next, we present how odd-w pairing is generated in hybrid structures of nearly
any sort and focus on its relation to Andreev bound states, spin polarized Cooper pairs, and Majorana
states. We overview how odd-w pairing can be applied to non-superconducting systems such as ultracold
Fermi gases, Bose-Einstein condensates, and chiral spin-nematics. Due to the growing importance
of dynamic orders in quantum systems we also discuss the emergent view that the odd-w state is an example
of phase coherent dynamic order. We summarize the recent progress made in understanding the emergence
of odd-w states in driven superconducting systems. A more general view of odd-w superconductivity
suggests an interesting approach to this state as a realization of the hidden order with inherently
dynamic correlations. We overview progress made in this rapidly evolving field and illustrate
the ubiquity of the odd-w states and potential for future discoveries of these states in variety
of settings. We sum up the general rules/design principles to induce odd-w components using the
SPOT rule.
