We study a system of two bosons of one species and a third boson of a second species in a one-dimensional
parabolic trap at zero temperature. We assume contact repulsive inter- and intra-species interactions.
By means of an exact diagonalization method we calculate the ground and excited states for the whole
range of interactions. We use discrete group theory to classify the eigenstates according to the
symmetry of the interaction potential. We also propose and validate analytical ansatzs gaining
physical insight over the numerically obtained wavefunctions. We show that, for both approaches,
it is crucial to take into account that the distinguishability of the third atom implies the absence
of any restriction over the wavefunction when interchanging this boson with any of the other two.
We find that there are degeneracies in the spectra in some limiting regimes, that is, when the inter-species
and/or the intra-species interactions tend to infinity. This is in contrast with the three-identical
boson system, where no degeneracy occurs in these limits. We show that, when tuning both types of
interactions through a protocol that keeps them equal while they are increased towards infinity,
the systems's ground state resembles that of three indistinguishable bosons. Contrarily, the
systems's ground state is different from that of three-identical bosons when both types of interactions
are increased towards infinity through protocols that do not restrict them to be equal. We study
the coherence and correlations of the system as the interactions are tuned through different protocols,
which permit to built up different correlations in the system and lead to different spatial distributions
of the three atoms.
