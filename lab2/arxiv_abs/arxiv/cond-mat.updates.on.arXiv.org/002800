In this report, structural, electronic, magnetic and transport properties of quaternary Heusler
alloys CoRuMnGe and CoRuVZ (Z = Al, Ga) are investigated. All the three alloys are found to crystallize
in cubic structure. CoRuMnGe exhibits L2$_1$ structure whereas, the other two alloys have B2-type
disorder. For CoRuMnGe and CoRuVGa, the experimental magnetic moments are in close agreement with
the theory as well as those predicted by the Slater-Pauling rule, while for CoRuVAl, a relatively
large deviation is seen. Among these alloys, CoRuMnGe has the highest T$\mathrm{_C}$ of 560 K. Resistivity
variation with temperature reflects the half-metallic nature in CoRuMnGe alloy. CoRuVAl shows
metallic character in both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states, whereas the temperature dependence
of resistivity for CoRuVGa is quite unusual. In the last system, $\rho$ vs. T curve shows an anomaly
in the form of a maximum and a region of negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) in
the magnetically ordered state. The ab initio calculations predict nearly half-metallic ferromagnetic
state with high spin polarization of 91, 89 and 93 % for CoRuMnGe, CoRuVAl and CoRuVGa respectively.
In the case of CoRuMnGe, the XRD analysis reveals that the Co and Ru sites are equally probable. Hence,
the Co-Ru swap disordered structures of CoRuMnGe alloy are also simulated and it is found that the
disordered structures retain half-metallicity, high spin polarization with almost same magnetic
moment as in the ideal structure. Nearly half-metallic character, high TC and high spin polarization
make CoRuMnGe alloy promising for room temperature spintronic applications.
