The analysis of the dynamics of tracer particles in a complex bath can provide valuable information
about the microscopic behaviour of the bath. In this work, we study the dynamics of a forced tracer
in a colloidal bath by means of Langevin dynamics simulations and a theory model within continuum
mechanics. In the simulations, the bath is comprised by quasi-hard spheres with a volume fraction
of 50% immersed in a featureless quiescent solvent, and the tracer is pulled with a constant small
force (within the linear regime). The theoretical analysis is based on the Navier Stokes equation,
where a term proportional to the velocity arises from coarse-graining the friction of the colloidal
particles with the solvent. As a result, the final equation is similar to the Brinkman model, although
the interpretation is different. A length scale appears in the model, 1/k_0, where the transverse
momentum transport crosses over to friction with the solvent. The effective friction coefficient
experienced by the tracer grows with the tracer size faster than the prediction from Stokes law.
Additionally, the velocity profiles in the bath decay faster than in a Newtonian fluid. The comparison
between simulations and theory points to a boundary condition of effective partial slip at the tracer
surface. We also study the fluctuations in the tracer position, showing that it reaches diffusion
at long times, with a subdiffusive regime at intermediate times. The diffusion coefficient, obtained
from the long-time slope of the mean squared displacement, fulfills the Stokes-Einstein relation
with the friction coefficient calculated from the steady tracer velocity, confirming the validity
of the linear response formalism.
