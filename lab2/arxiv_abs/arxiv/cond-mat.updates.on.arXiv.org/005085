The infinite-layer structure nickelate Ba$_2$NiO$_2$(AgSe)$_2$ (BNOAS) with $d^8$ Ni ions and
a peculiar susceptibility $\chi(T)$ is studied with correlated density functional methods. The
overriding feature of the calculations is violation of Hund's rule coupled with complete but unconventional
spin-orbital polarization, leading to an unexpected low spin $^1B_1$, ``off-diagonal singlet''
(ODS) textured by an internal orbital structure of compensating $d_{x^2-y^2}^{\uparrow}$ and
$d_{z^2}^{\downarrow}$ spins. This unconventional configuration has lower energy than conventional
high-spin or low-spin alternatives. An electronic transition is obtained at a critical Ni-O separation
$d_c^{Ni-O}=$2.03~\AA, above which Ni becomes magnetic in square planar NiO$_2$ compounds. We
propose scenarios for the signature of magnetic reconstruction in $\chi(T)$ at $T_{m}$=130 K without
any Curie-Weiss background (no moment) that invoke ordering of Ni $d^8$ moieties that are largely
this generalized Kondo singlet. The underlying physics of this system is modeled by a Kondo sieve
model (2D Kondo necklace) of a ``Kondo'' $d_{z^2}$ spin on each site, coupled to a $d_{x^2-y^2}$
spin that is itself strongly coupled to neighboring like-spins within the layer. The observed magnetic
order places BNOAS below the quantum critical point of the Kondo sieve model, providing a realization
of the previously unreported long-range ordered near-singlet weak antiferromagnetic phase.
We propose electron doping experiments that would drive the system toward a $d^{9-\delta}$ configuration
and possible superconductivity with similarity to the recently reported Ba$_2$CuO$_{3.2}$ that
superconducts at 73 K.
