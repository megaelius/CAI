The phenomenon whereby atoms take a positive or negative charge by losing or gaining one or more electrons
forms the basis of familiar processes. However, those atoms which occupy unfilled state executing
electron-dynamics under force application do not ionize. Atoms of many elements dealing certain
transition state at ground surface level elongate from their centers along opposite poles under
existing force. On impinging electrons of instantaneous velocity at fixed angle to such atoms transfer
transported energy resulting into their further elongation. When electrons of gained instantaneous
velocity do not impinge at fixed angle to naturally elongated atoms, they deal deformation behavior
where stretching of energy knots clamping electrons in their states remains non-orientational
as per allocated non-uniform potential energy. In the case of inert gas atoms, an alternative process
takes place. Atoms of inert gas under certain flow rate split into electron streams while surplus
propagation of photons characteristic current in their inter-state electron gap, thus, on increasing
wavelength of travelling photons to visible range reveal light glow. In solar cells and in other
similar kinds of gadgets, photonic current is generated. All sorts of microscopes reveal details
of surface topography on resolving the image, micrometers size to subatomic level, is owing to certain
pace of reflected photons. The selected area photon reflection patterns specify that spotted dots
are due to intensities of reflected photons as well which were being controlled at certain pace of
angle while interacting to surface of structure. Many phenomena are discussed here inferring photonic
current instead of electronic current. These fundamental revolutions bring vast changes in the
existing state of science.
