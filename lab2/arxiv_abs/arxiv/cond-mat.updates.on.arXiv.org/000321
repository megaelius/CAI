Patchy particles are a popular paradigm for the design and synthesis of nanoparticles and colloids
for self-assembly. In "traditional" patchy particles, anisotropic interactions arising from
patterned coatings, functionalized molecules, DNA, and other enthalpic means create the possibility
for directional binding of particles into higher-ordered structures. Although the anisotropic
geometry of non-spherical particles contributes to the interaction patchiness through van der
Waals, electrostatic, and other interactions, how particle shape contributes entropically to
self-assembly is only now beginning to be understood. It has been recently demonstrated that, for
hard shapes, entropic forces are directional. A newly proposed theoretical framework that defines
and quantifies directional entropic forces demonstrates the anisotropic--that is, patchy--nature
of these emergent, attractive forces. Here we introduce the notion of entropically patchy particles
as the entropic counterpart to enthalpically patchy particles. Using three example "families"
of shapes, we judiciously modify entropic patchiness by introducing geometric features to the
particles so as to target specific crystal structures, which then assembled with Monte Carlo simulations.
We quantify the emergent entropic valence via a potential of mean force and torque. We generalize
these shape operations to shape anisotropy dimensions, in analogy with the anisotropy dimensions
introduced for enthalpically patchy particles. Our findings demonstrate that entropic patchiness
and emergent valence provide a way of engineering directional bonding into nanoparticle systems,
whether in the presence or absence of additional, non-entropic forces.
