Ferroelectric materials have reversible spontaneous electric polarization, which are usually
believed to be nonconducting because conduction electrons would screen out the static internal
electric fields and preclude intrinsic polarization. In 1965, Anderson and Blount proposed the
concept of ferroelectric metal, however, it is only until recently that a few ferroelectric metals
were reported. Here, by combining high-throughput ab initio calculations and a data-driven machine
learning model with new descriptors related to electronic orbitals, we systematically investigated
a large family (2,964) of two-dimensional (2D) bimetal phosphates, and discovered 60 novel stable
ferroelectric materials, including 16 ferroelectric metals with out-of-plane electric polarization
and 44 ferroelectric semiconductors that contain seven multiferroics with two or three type of
ferroic orderings and seven ferroelectric water-splitting photocatalysts. The origin of ferroelectricity
in these 2D metals is owing to the spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking induced by the vertical
displacement of bimetal atoms, where the electric polarization and spatial displacement are unveiled
to obey a quadratic law. Charge analysis reveals that conducting electrons are mainly located only
one surface and are spatially separated from the ferroelectric-paraelectric charge difference
and atom displacement related to polarization, thus giving rise to the coexistence of ferroelectricity
and metallicity, which also shows the dimensional effect plays a vital role in 2D metallic ferroelectricity.
These ferroelectric metals would have potential uses in areas of nonvolatile field-effect transistors,
programmable electronic devices, and tunable surface plasmon polariton devices.
