The templated growth of the basic porphyrin unit, free-base porphine (2H-P), is characterized
by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure
(NEXAFS) spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory (DFT). The DFT simulations
allow the deconvolution of the complex XPS and NEXAFS signatures into contributions originating
from five inequivalent carbon atoms, which can be grouped into C-N and C-C bonded species. Polarization-dependent
NEXAFS measurements reveal an intriguing organizational behavior: On both Cu(111) and Ag(111),
for coverages up to one monolayer, the molecules adsorb undeformed and parallel to the respective
metal surface. Upon increasing the coverage, however, the orientation of the molecules in the thin
films depends on the growth conditions. Multilayers deposited at low temperatures (LT) exhibit
a similar average tilting angle (30 degree relative to the surface plane) on both substrates. Conversely,
for multilayers grown at room temperature a markedly different scenario exists. On Cu(111) the
film thickness is self-limited to a coverage of approximately two layers, while on Ag(111) multilayers
can be grown easily and, in contrast to the bulk 2H-P crystal, the molecules are oriented perpendicular
to the surface. This difference in molecular orientation results in a modified line-shape of the
C 1s XPS signatures that is dependent on the incident photon energy, which is explained by comparison
with depth-resolved DFT calculations. Simulations of ionization energies for differently stacked
molecules show no indication for a packing-induced modification of the multilayer XP spectra,
thus indicating that the comparison of single molecule calculations to multilayer data is justified.
