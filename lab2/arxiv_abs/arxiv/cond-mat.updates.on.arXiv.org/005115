Domain switching pathways in ferroelectric materials visualized via dynamic Piezoresponse Force
Microscopy are explored via rotationally invariant variational autoencoders (rVAE). rVAEs simplify
the elements of the observed domain structure, crucially allowing for rotational invariance,
thereby reducing the variability of local polarization distributions to a small number of latent
variables. Importantly, these latent variable representations generally enable characteristic
aspects of materials behavior to be disentangled. For small window sizes the latent space is degenerate,
and variability is observed only in the direction of a single latent variable that can be identified
with the presence of domain wall. In this case, the rVAE effectively becomes an edge filter allowing
for arbitrary rotations, and analysis of the latent space distributions yields insight into wall
angle distributions. For larger window sizes, the latent space is 2D, and the disentangled latent
variables can be generally interpreted as the degree of switching and complexity of domain structure.
Applied to multiple consecutive PFM images acquired while monitoring domain switching, the polarization
switching mechanism can thus be visualized in the latent space, providing insight into domain evolution
mechanisms and their correlation with the microstructure. This approach is furthermore widely
tunable via a modification of VAE's loss function, as well as the priors in the latent space. This
enables broad applicability for investigating a wide range of physical and biological phenomena,
not just with scanning probes but also for electron, optical, and x-ray microscopies. The interactive
