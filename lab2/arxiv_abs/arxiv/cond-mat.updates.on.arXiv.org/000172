We consider the statistical properties over disordered samples $(\cal J)$ of the overlap distribution
$P_{\cal J}(q)$ which plays the role of an order parameter in spin-glasses. We show that near zero
temperature (i) the {\it typical } overlap distribution is exponentially small in the central region
of $-1<q<1$: $ P^{typ}(q) = e^{\overline { \ln P_{\cal J}(q) }} \sim e^{ - \beta N^{\theta}
\phi(q)} $, where $\theta$ is the droplet exponent defined here with respect to the total number
$N$ of spins (in order to consider also fully connected models where the notion of length does not
exist); (ii) the rescaled variable $v = - (\ln P_{\cal J}(q))/N^{\theta}$ remains an $O(1)$ random
positive variable describing sample-to sample fluctuations; (iii) the averaged distribution
$\overline{P_{\cal J}(q) } $ is non-typical and dominated by rare anomalous samples. These results
are derived explicitly for the spherical mean-field model with $\theta=1/3$, $\phi(q)=1-q^2
$, and the random variable $v$ corresponds to the rescaled difference between the two largest eigenvalues
of GOE random matrices. Then we compare numerically the typical and averaged overlap distributions
for the long-ranged one-dimensional spin-glass with random couplings decaying as $J(r) \propto
r^{-\sigma}$ for various values of the exponent $\sigma$, corresponding to various droplet exponents
$\theta(\sigma)$, and for the mean-field SK-model (corresponding formally to the $\sigma=0$
limit of the previous model). Our conclusion is that future studies on spin-glasses should measure
the {\it typical} overlap distribution (or even better the probability distribution over samples
of $\ln P_{\cal J}(q)$) to obtain clear conclusions on the nature of the spin-glass phase.
