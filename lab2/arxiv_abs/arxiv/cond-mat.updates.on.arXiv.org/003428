We compare the stationary hierarchical continuous-time Weierstrass flight (CTWF) with corresponding
stationary hierarchical continuous-time Weierstrass walk (CTWW). Both processes are prominent
examples of the Continuous-Time Random Walks (CTRW), but with different spatio-temporal waiting
time and displacement distributions (WTDD). Both CTWF and CTWW are non-separable, which is characterized
by the hierarchical spatial-temporal coupling in WTDD. However, in the case of CTWF, each level
of the WTDD hierarchy is separable. We assume instantaneous time-independent but level-dependent
jumps between trajectory turning points preceded by waiting of the process. In the case of CTWW,
we deal with the spatio-temporal coupling in each level of the WTDD hierarchy. We assume that the
process imitates a movement with a piecewise level-dependent velocity between trajectory turning
points. The stationary hierarchical continuous-time Weierstrass walk (CTWW) is a diffusion multi-phase
realization of the Levy walk (LW) type of stochastic processes. The CTWF is a convenient hierarchical
representation of the L\'evy flight type of stochastic processes. We found diffusion phases of
the CTWF defined by the non-diverging mean-square displacement (MSD) for a finite time, as a small
part of the corresponding CTWW diffusion diagram. Diffusion phases are distinguished by various
forms and values of diffusion exponent (composed of the temporal and spatial exponents) and different
values of kurtosis as well. This diffusion exponent plays the role of the compact order parameter.
We found the diffusion phase diagram consisting not only with the anomalous non-Gaussian (or not-fBm)
phases but also with the Brownian yet non-Gaussian ones. We also found the curve of the quadruple
points of the coexistence of four diffusion phases. Various transitions between phases were found
both as continuous and discontinuous.
