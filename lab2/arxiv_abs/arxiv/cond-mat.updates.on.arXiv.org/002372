We explore the temperature-dependent plasmonic modes of an n-doped double-layer silicene system
which is composed of two spatially separated single layers of silicene with a distance large enough
to prevent the interlayer electron tunneling. By applying an externally applied electric field,
we numerically obtain the poles of the loss function within the so-called random phase approximation,
to investigate the effects of temperature and geometry on the plasmon branches in three different
regimes: topological insulator, valley-spin polarized metal, and band insulator. Also, we present
the finite-temperature numerical results along with the zero-temperature analytical ones to
support a discussion of the distinct effects of the external electric field and temperature on the
plasmon dispersion. Our results show that at zero temperature both the acoustic and optical modes
decrease by increasing the applied electric field and experience a discontinuity at the valley-spin
polarized metal phase as the system transitions from a topological insulator to a band insulator.
At finite temperature, the optical plasmons are damped around this discontinuity and the acoustic
modes may exhibit a continuous transition. Moreover, while the optical branch of plasmons changes
non-monotonically and noticeably with temperature, the acoustic branch dispersion displays
a negligible growth with temperature for all phases of silicene. Furthermore, our finite-temperature
results indicate that the dependency of two plasmonic branches on the interlayer separation is
not affected by temperature at long wavelengths; the acoustic mode energy varies slightly with
increasing the interlayer distance, whereas the optical mode remains unchanged.
