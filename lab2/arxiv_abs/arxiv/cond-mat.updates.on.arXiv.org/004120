Structural defects in the p-ZnTe/i-CdTe/n-CdTe single-crystalline heterojunctions designed
for photovoltaic applications have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). Lattice parameters and misfit strain in the undoped
CdTe absorber layers of the heterojunctions, grown by the molecular-beam epitaxy technique on
two different substrates, GaAs and CdTe, have been determined with high-resolution X-ray diffractometry.
A dense network of misfit dislocations at the lattice-mismatched CdTe/GaAs and ZnTe/CdTe interfaces
and numerous threading dislocations and stacking faults have been shown by the cross-sectional
TEM imaging of the heterojunctions. The DLTS measurements revealed five deep-level traps in the
heterojunctions grown on the GaAs substrates and only three of them in the heterojunctions grown
on CdTe. One of the traps, showing the exponential capture kinetics of charge carriers, has been
identified as associated with the double acceptor level of Cd vacancies in the CdTe absorber layers.
All the other traps have been attributed to the electronic states of extended defects, presumably
dislocations, on the grounds of their logarithmic capture kinetics. Two of these traps, displaying
the largest values of their capture cross-section and the properties characteristic of bandlike
electronic states, have been ascribed to the core states of dislocations. It is argued that they
are most likely responsible for decreased lifetime of photo-excited carriers resulting in a low
energy conversion efficiency of solar cells based on similarly grown heterojunctions.
