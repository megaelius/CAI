In modern applications of heterogeneous liquid-phase nanocatalysis, the catalysts (e.g., metal
nanoparticles) need to be typically affixed to a colloidal carrier system for stability and easy
handling. "Passive carriers" (e.g., simple polyelectrolytes) serve for a controlled synthesis
of the nanoparticles and prevent coagulation during catalysis. Recently, however, hybrid conjugates
of nanoparticles and synthetic thermosensitive polymers have been developed that enable to change
the catalytic activity of the nanoparticles by external triggers. In particular, nanoparticles
embedded in a stimuli-responsive network made from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) have
become the most-studied examples of such hybrids. It has been demonstrated that the permeability
of the polymer network and thus the reactant flux can be switched and controlled by external stimuli.
Such "active carriers" may thus be viewed as true nanoreactors that open up new design routes in nano-catalysis
and elevate synthesis to create highly selective, programmable "colloidal enzymes". However,
only a comprehensive understanding of these materials on all time and length scales can lead to a
rational design of future, highly functional materials. Here we review the current state of the
theoretical and multi-scale simulation approaches, aiming at a fundamental understanding of
these nanoreactors. In particular, we summarize a theoretical approach for reaction rates of surface-catalyzed
bimolecular reactions in responsive nanoreactors in terms of the key material parameters, the
polymer shell permeability P and the reactant partition ratio K. We discuss recent computer simulation
studies of both atomistic and coarse-grained polymer models in which these quantities have been
characterized in some detail. We conclude with an outlook on selected open questions and future
theoretical challenges in nanoreactor modeling.
