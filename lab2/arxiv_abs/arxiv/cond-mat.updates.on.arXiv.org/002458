The dynamic behavior of bundles of actin filaments growing against a loaded obstacle is investigated
through a generalized version of the standard multi filaments Brownian Ratchet model in which the
(de)polymerizing filaments are treated not as rigid rods but as semi-flexible discrete wormlike
chains with a realistic value of the persistence length. By stochastic dynamic simulations we study
the relaxation of a bundle of $N_f$ filaments with staggered seed arrangement against a harmonic
trap load in supercritical conditions. Thanks to the time scale separation between the wall motion
and the filament size relaxation, mimiking realistic conditions, this set-up allows us to extract
a full load-velocity curve from a single experiment over the trap force/size range explored. We
observe a systematic evolution of steady non-equilibrium states over three regimes of bundle lengths
$L$. A first threshold length $\Lambda$ marks the transition between the rigid dynamic regime ($L<\Lambda$),
characterized by the usual rigid filament load-velocity relationship $V(F)$, and the flexible
dynamic regime ($L>\Lambda$), where the velocity $V(F,L)$ is an increasing function of the bundle
length $L$ at fixed load $F$, the enhancement being the result of an improved level of work sharing
among the filaments induced by flexibility. A second critical length corresponds to the beginning
of an unstable regime characterized by a high probability to develop escaping filaments which start
growing laterally and thus do not participate anymore to the generation of the polymerization force.
This phenomenon prevents the bundle from reaching at this critical length the limit behavior corresponding
to Perfect Load Sharing.
