This work relaxes the assumption of point particles prevalent in the study of thermal transport
characteristics in $\Phi^4$ chains. The particles of the modified chain, henceforth termed as
the $\Phi^{4C}$ chain, can collide with each other. Collisions have been modelled by adding a short-ranged
soft-sphere potential to the Hamiltonian of the $\Phi^4$ chain. The inclusion of soft-sphere potential
drastically alters the thermal transport characteristics while still satisfying the Fourier's
law: at low temperatures, the temperature profile has negligible boundary jumps in $\Phi^{4C}$
chains, thermal conductivity of $\Phi^{4C}$ chains is significantly smaller than $\Phi^4$ chains
at low temperatures, at high temperatures, $\Phi^{4C}$ chains have a higher thermal conductivity
than $\Phi^4$ chains, and unlike $\Phi^4$ chains, where thermal conductivity keeps decreasing
upon increasing temperature, in $\Phi^{4C}$ chains thermal conductivity abruptly decreases
first and then increases beyond an inversion temperature. Splitting the total heat current into
the contributions of the harmonic and anharmonic inter-particle forces, reveals that the harmonic
contributions decrease with increasing temperature. On the contrary, anharmonic contributions
increase with rising temperature, and beyond the inversion temperature they overtake the harmonic
contributions. Exploring the dynamics in Fourier space helps in identifying that the energy of
the lowest modes redistribute to other modes much faster in $\Phi^{4C}$ chains due to collisions.
The quicker redistribution of the energy to higher modes is the reason behind smaller thermal conductivity
in $\Phi^{4C}$ chains at low temperatures. The proposed $\Phi^{4C}$ chains have the features of
both momentum conserving as well as momentum non-conserving systems, and may become an important
tool to study thermal transport in real-life systems.
