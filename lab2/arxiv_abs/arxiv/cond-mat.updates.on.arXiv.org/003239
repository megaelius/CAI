In this work, we perform a systematic search for high-efficiency, three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional
(2D) thermoelectric materials by combining semiclassical transport techniques with density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. Out of 30000 three-dimensional and 900 two-dimensional
materials currently in the publicly available JARVIS-DFT database, we identify 698 3D and 148 2D
promising thermoelectric materials using a multi-steps screening procedure, where specific
thresholds are chosen for key quantities like bandgaps, Seebeck coefficients, power factors and
zT factors. We computed the Seebeck coefficients for all the materials currently in the database
and validated our calculations comparing our results, for a subset of materials, to experimental
and existing computational datasets. We also investigate the effect of chemical, structural,
crystallographic and dimensionality trends on thermoelectric performance. We predict several
classes of efficient 3D and 2D materials such as Ba(MgX)2 (X=P,As,Bi), X2YZ6 (X=K,Rb, Y=Pd,Pt,
Z=Cl,Br), K2PtX2(X=S,Se), NbCu3X4 (X=S,Se,Te), Sr2XYO6 (X=Ta, Zn, Y=Ga, Mo), TaCu3X4 (X=S, Se,Te),
and XYN (X=Ti, Zr, Y=Cl, Br). Finally, as high-throughput DFT is computationally expensive, we
train machine learning models using gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) and classical force-field
inspired descriptors (CFID) for n-and p-type Seebeck coefficients, power factors and zT factors,
to quickly pre-screen materials for guiding the next set of DFT calculations. The dataset and tools
are made publicly available at the websites: https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/JVASP.html
