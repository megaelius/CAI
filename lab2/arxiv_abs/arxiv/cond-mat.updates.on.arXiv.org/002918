Due to their diverse nature, the faithful description of excited states within electronic structure
theory methods remains one of the grand challenges of modern theoretical chemistry. Quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) methods have been applied very successfully to ground state properties but still remain
generally less effective than other non-stochastic methods for electronically excited states.
Nonetheless, we have recently reported accurate excitation energies for small organic molecules
at the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) within a Jastrow-free QMC protocol relying on
a deterministic and systematic construction of nodal surfaces using the selected configuration
interaction (sCI) algorithm known as CIPSI (Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection
made Iteratively). Albeit highly accurate, these all-electron calculations are computationally
expensive due to the presence of core electrons. One very popular approach to remove these chemically-inert
electrons from the QMC simulation is to introduce pseudopotentials (also known as effective core
potentials). Taking the water molecule as an example, we investigate the influence of Burkatzki-Filippi-Dolg
(BFD) pseudopotentials and their associated basis sets on vertical excitation energies obtained
with sCI and FN-DMC methods. Although these pseudopotentials are known to be relatively safe for
ground state properties, we evidence that special care may be required if one strives for highly
accurate vertical transition energies. Indeed, comparing all-electron and valence-only calculations,
we show that using pseudopotentials with the associated basis sets can induce differences of the
order of 0.05 eV on the excitation energies. Fortunately, a reasonable estimate of this shift can
be estimated at the sCI level.
