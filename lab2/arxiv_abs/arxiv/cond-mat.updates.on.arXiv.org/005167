Minimally invasive experimental methods that can measure local rate dependent mechanical properties
are essential in understanding the behaviour of soft and biological materials in a wide range of
applications. Needle based measurement techniques such as Cavitation Rheology and Volume Controlled
Cavity Expansion (VCCE), allow for minimally invasive local mechanical testing, but have been
limited to measuring the elastic material properties. Here, we propose several enhancements to
the VCCE technique to adapt it for characterization of viscoelastic response at low to medium stretch
rates ($10^{-2}$ - $1$ s${}^{-1}$). The proposed technique performs several cycles of expansion-relaxation
at controlled stretch rates in a cavity expansion setting and then employs a large deformation viscoelastic
model to capture the measured material response. Application of the technique to soft PDMS rubber
reveals significant rate dependent material response with high precision and repeatability,
while isolating equilibrated states that are used to directly infer the quasistatic elastic modulus.
The technique is further established by demonstrating its ability to capture changes in the rate
dependent material response of a tuneable PDMS system. The measured viscoelastic properties are
used to explain earlier reports of rate insensitive material response by needle based methods:
it is demonstrated that the conventional use of constant volumetric rate cavity expansion can induce
high stretch rates that lead to viscoelastic stiffening and an illusion of rate insensitive material
response. We thus conclude with a cautionary note on possible overestimation of the quasistatic
elastic modulus in previous studies and suggest that the stretch rate controlled expansion protocol,
proposed in this work, is essential for accurate estimation of both quasistatic and dynamic material
parameters.
