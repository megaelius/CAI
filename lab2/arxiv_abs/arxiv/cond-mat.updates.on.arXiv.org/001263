In a recent proposal [Jie and Zhang, Phys. Rev. A 95, 060701(R) (2017)], it has been shown that center-of-mass-momentum-dependent
two-body interactions can be generated and tuned by Raman-coupling the closed-channel bound states
in a magnetic Feshbach resonance. Here we investigate the universal relations in a three-dimensional
Fermi gas near such a laser modulated $s$-wave Feshbach resonance. Using the operator-product
expansion approach, we find that, to fully describe the high-momentum tail of the density distribution
up to $q^{-6}$ ($q$ is the relative momentum), four center-of-mass-momentum-dependent parameters
are required, which we identify as contacts. These contacts appear in various universal relations
connecting microscopic and thermodynamic properties. One contact is related to the variation
of energy with respect to the scattering length, and determines the leading $q^{-4}$ tail of the
high-momentum distribution. Another vector contact appears in the sub-leading $q^{-5}$ tail,
which is related to the velocity of closed-channel molecules. The other two contacts emerge in the
$q^{-6}$ tail, and are related, respectively, to the variation of energy with respect to the effective
range, and to the kinetic energy of closed-channel molecules. Particularly, we find that the $q^{-5}$
tail and part of $q^{-6}$ tail of the momentum distribution show anisotropic features. We derive
the universal relations, and, as a concrete example, estimate the contacts for the zero-temperature
superfluid ground state of the system using a mean-field approach to verify the anisotropic features
in the high-momentum tails of this system.
