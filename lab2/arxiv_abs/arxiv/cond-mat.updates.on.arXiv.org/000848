Pyrochlore iridate antiferromagnet is the first material in which Weyl fermions are predicted
to exist in condensed matters. Although several promising experimental results, which may be originated
from Weyl fermions, have been reported, an unambiguous proof for the presence of the Weyl semimetal
in this system has not been achieved yet. The accumulated theoretical and experimental knowledge
consistently shows that the Weyl semimetal can, in principle, be realized in this system but only
within a very narrow window in the parameter space, which makes it difficult to access the relevant
state in experiment. In this work, we theoretically propose that applying magnetic field is a promising
way to realize the Weyl semimetal phase in pyrochlore iridates since magnetic field not only can
expand the range in which the Weyl semimetal phase exists but also can create new topological semimetal
phases across additional band inversion. Here the central role is played by the presence of a quadratic
band crossing with four-fold degeneracy in the paramagnetic band structure that exists before
the time-reversal symmetry is broken. Due to the large degeneracy at the crossing point and the strong
spin-orbit coupling, the degenerate states at the crossing point can show the anisotropic Zeeman
effect, which can be described by the so-called q-term in the Luttinger Hamiltonian, as well as the
conventional isotropic Zeeman effect. Moreover, the relative magnitude of these two different
Zeeman terms can be controlled by varying the orientation of the four spins within the unit cell,
which, in turn, manipulates the topological property of the iridium band structure. Such an intriguing
behavior occurs due to the fact that the unit cell is composed of a cluster of four spins in a tetrahedron
whose magnetic mulipole moments can be continuously tuned by varying the spin orientation within
the unit cell.
