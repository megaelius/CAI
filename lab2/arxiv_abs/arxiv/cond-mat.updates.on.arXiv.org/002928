Elastic confinements play an important role in many soft matter systems and affect the transport
properties of suspended particles in viscous flow. On the basis of low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics,
we present an analytical theory of the axisymmetric flow induced by a point-force singularity (Stokeslet)
directed along the symmetry axis of a finite-sized circular elastic membrane endowed with resistance
toward shear and bending. The solution for the viscous incompressible flow surrounding the membrane
is formulated as a mixed boundary value problem, which is then reduced into a system of dual integral
equations on the inner and outer sides of the domain boundary. We show that the solution of the elastohydrodynamic
problem can conveniently be expressed in terms of a set of inhomogeneous Fredholm integral equations
of the second kind with logarithmic kernel. Basing on the hydrodynamic flow field, we obtain semi-analytical
expressions of the hydrodynamic mobility function for the translational motion perpendicular
to a circular membrane. The results are valid to leading-order in the ratio of particle radius to
the distance separating the particle from the membrane. In the quasi-steady limit, we find that
the particle mobility near a finite-sized membrane is always larger than that predicted near a no-slip
disk of the same size. We further show that the bending-related contribution to the hydrodynamic
mobility increases monotonically upon decreasing the membrane size, whereas the shear-related
contribution displays a minimum value when the particle-membrane distance is equal to the membrane
radius. Accordingly, the system behavior may be shear or bending dominated, depending on the geometric
and elastic properties of the system. Our results may find applications in the field of nanoparticle-based
sensing and drug delivery systems near elastic cell membranes.
