We study the influence of thermal fluctuations on the buckling behavior of thin elastic capsules
with spherical rest shape. Thermal fluctuations affect the buckling instability by two mechanisms.
On the one hand, thermal fluctuations can renormalize the capsule's elastic properties and its
pressure because of anharmonic couplings between normal displacement modes of different wavelengths.
This effectively lowers its critical buckling pressure [Kosmrlj and Nelson, Phys. Rev. X 7, 011002
(2017)]. On the other hand, buckled shapes are energetically favorable already at pressures below
the classical buckling pressure. At these pressures, however, buckling requires to overcome an
energy barrier, which only vanishes at the critical buckling pressure. In the presence of thermal
fluctuations the capsule can spontaneously overcome an energy barrier of the order of the thermal
energy by thermal activation already at pressures below the critical buckling pressure. We revisit
parameter renormalization by thermal fluctuations and formulate a buckling criterion based on
scale-dependent renormalized parameters to obtain a temperature-dependent critical buckling
pressure. Then we quantify the pressure-dependent energy barrier for buckling below the critical
buckling pressure using numerical energy minimization and analytical arguments. This allows
us to obtain the temperature-dependent critical pressure for buckling by thermal activation over
this energy barrier. Finally, we study the combined effect of parameter renormalization and thermal
activation by using renormalized parameters for the energy barrier in thermal activation to obtain
our final result for the temperature-dependent critical pressure, which is significantly below
the results if only parameter renormalization or only thermal activation is considered.
