We study experimentally and numerically the dynamics of the spin ice (SI) material Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$
in the low temperature and moderate magnetic field regime ($T\in$[0.1,1.7]K, $B\in$[0,0.3]T).
One of our objectives is to understand the main physics shaping the out-of-equilibrium magnetisation
vs. temperature curves. We find that single crystals, as noted before for powdered samples, tend
to abandon equilibrium at a blocking temperature $T_B$ which increases with applied field. Curiously,
this behaviour is present even within the nearest-neighbours interactions model. Simulations
and ac-susceptibility experiments show that the increasing trend in $T_B$ is stronger for fields
applied along [100]. This suggests that the field plays a part in the dynamical arrest through the
suppression of magnetic monopoles (localised thermal excitations in SI), which is quite manifest
for this field orientation. On the other hand, very far from equilibrium the effect of $B$ is the inverse
one: turning on the field after having cooled the system with zero field can increase the monopole
concentration through dissociation of bound monopole pairs, thus accelerating the dynamics.
The process is similar to that observed in electrolytes. However, for SI the polarisation state
of the vacuum out of which the monopole pairs are created is a key factor shaping the magnetisation
curves that has no analog in the electric case. We observe a threshold field near 0.2T for this fast
dynamics to take place; it is linked to the maximum magnetic force possible between the attracting
pair. Surprisingly, within a regime of low temperatures and moderate fields, an extended Ohm's
law can be used to describe the zero-field-cooled magnetisation curve obtained with the dipolar
SI model. However, in real samples the acceleration of the dynamics appears even sharper than in
simulations, possibly due to the presence of avalanches.
