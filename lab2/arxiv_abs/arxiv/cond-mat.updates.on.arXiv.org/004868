In recent experiments with ultracold atoms, both two-dimensional (2d) Chern insulators and one-dimensional
(1d) topological charge pumps have been realized. Without interactions, both systems can be described
by the same Hamiltonian, when some variables are being reinterpreted. In this paper, we study the
relation of both models when Hubbard interactions are added, using the density-matrix renormalization-group
algorithm. To this end, we express the fermionic Hofstadter model in a hybrid-space representation,
and define a family of interactions, which connects 1d Hubbard charge pumps to 2d Hubbard Chern insulators.
We study a three-band model at particle density $\rho=2/3$, where the topological quantization
of the 1d charge pump changes from Chern number $C=2$ to $C=-1$ as the interaction strength increases.
We find that the $C=-1$ phase is robust when varying the interaction terms on narrow-width cylinders.
However, this phase does not extend to the limit of the 2d Hofstadter-Hubbard model, which remains
in the $C=2$ phase. We discuss the existence of both topological phases for the largest cylinder
circumferences that we can access numerically. We note the appearance of a ferromagnetic ground
state between the strongly interacting 1d and 2d models. For this ferromagnetic state, one can understand
the $C=-1$ phase from a bandstructure argument. Our method for measuring the Hall conductivity
could similarly be realized in experiments: We compute the current response to a weak, linear potential,
which is applied adiabatically. The Hall conductivity converges to integer-quantized values
for large system sizes, corresponding to the system's Chern number.
