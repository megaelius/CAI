Near-field (NF) radiative heat transfer (RHT) over vacuum space between closely spaced bodies
can exceed the Planck far-field (FF) values by orders of magnitude. Strong effect of superconductivity
on NF RHT between plane-parallel thin-film surfaces of niobium (Nb) was recently discovered and
discussed in a short paper [Kr\'al\'ik et al., Phys. Rev. B 95, 060503 (2017)]. We present here an
extensive set of experimental results on NF as well as FF RHT for geometrically identical samples
made of niobium nitride (NbN), including a detailed discussion of the experimental setup and errors.
The results with NbN show more precise agreement with theory than the original experiments with
Nb. We observed a steep decrease of the heat flux at the transition to superconductivity when the
colder sample (absorber) passed from normal to superconducting (SC) state ($T_c \approx 15.2$
K), corresponding to up to an 8-fold contrast between the normal and SC states. This differs dramatically
from the situation in the FF regime, where only a weak effect of superconductivity was observed.
Surprisingly, the contrast remains sizeable even at high temperatures of the hot sample (radiator)
with the characteristic energy of radiation far above the SC energy gap. We explain the maximum of
contrast in heat flux between the normal and SC states, found at a distance about ten times shorter
than the crossover distance between NF and FF heat flux, being $d \approx 1000/T$ [${\mu}$m]. We
analyze in detail the roles of transversal electric (TE) and magnetic (TM) modes in the steep decrease
of heat flux below the SC critical temperature and the subsequent flux saturation at low temperatures.
Interestingly, we expose experimentally for the first time the effect of destructive interference
of FF thermal radiation in the vacuum gap, which was observable at temperatures below the absorber
superconducting transition.
