Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits a rich variety of electronic states, including
correlated insulators, superconductors, and topological phases. Understanding the microscopic
mechanisms responsible for these phases requires determining the interplay between electron-electron
interactions and quantum degeneracy due to spin and valley degrees of freedom. Signatures of strong
electron-electron correlations have been observed at partial fillings of the flat electronic
bands in recent spectroscopic measurements. Transport experiments in a magnetic field show changes
in the degeneracy of the Landau levels (LL) at fillings corresponding to an integer number of electrons
per moir\'e unit cell. However, the interplay between interaction effects and the quantum degeneracy
of the system is currently unclear. Using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM),
we observed a cascade of transitions in the spectroscopic properties of MATBG as a function of electron
filling. We find distinct changes in the chemical potential and a rearrangement of the low-energy
excitations at each integer filling of the moir\'e flat bands. These spectroscopic features are
a direct consequence of Coulomb interactions, which split the degenerate flat bands into Hubbard
sub-bands. We find these interactions, the strength of which we can extract experimentally, to
be surprisingly sensitive to the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, which strongly modifies
the spectroscopic transitions. The cascade of transitions we report here characterizes the correlated
high-temperature parent phase from which various insulating and superconducting ground-state
phases emerge at low temperatures in MATBG.
