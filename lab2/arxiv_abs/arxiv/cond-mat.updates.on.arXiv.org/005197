Mechanical properties of the cell are important biomarkers for probing its architectural changes
caused by cellular processes and/or pathologies. The development of microfluidic technologies
have enabled measuring cell mechanics at high-throughput, so that mechanical phenotyping can
be applied to large samples in reasonable time-scales. These studies typically measure the stiffness
of the cell as the only mechanical biomarker, and cannot disentangle the rheological contribution
of different structural components of the cell, including the cell cortex, the interior cytoplasm
and its immersed cytoskeletal structures, and the nucleus. Recent advancements in high-speed
fluorescent imaging have enabled probing the deformations of the cell cortex, while also tracking
different intracellular components in rates applicable to microfluidic platforms. We present
a novel method to decouple the mechanics of the cell cortex and the cytoplasm by analyzing the correlation
between the cortical deformations that are induced by external microfluidic flows, and the nucleus
displacements induced by those cortical deformations; i.e. we use the nucleus as a high-throughput
microrheological probe to study the rheology of the cytoplasm, independent of the cell cortex mechanics.
To demonstrate the applicability of this method, we consider a proof of concept model consisting
of a rigid spherical nucleus centered in a spherical cell. We obtain analytical expressions for
time-dependent nucleus velocity as a function of the cell deformations, when the interior cytoplasm
is modeled as a viscous, viscoelastic, porous and poroelastic materials, and demonstrate how the
nucleus velocity can be used to characterize the linear rheology of the cytoplasm over a wide range
of forces and time-scales/frequencies.
