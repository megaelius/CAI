The viscosity of an optical fibre over 1000 to 1150 {\deg}C is studied by inscribing an optical fibre
Bragg grating that can withstand temperatures up to 1200 {\deg}C and monitoring fibre elongation
under load through the Bragg wavelength shift. This optical interrogation offers high accuracy
and reliability compared to direct measurements of elongation, particularly at lower temperatures,
thus avoiding significant experimental error. An excellent Arrhenius fit is obtained from which
an activation energy for viscous flow of Ea = 450 kJ/mol is extracted; addition of an additional temperature
dependent pre-exponential does not change this value. This value is less than that idealised by
some literature but consistent with other literature. The log plot of viscosity is overall found
to be consistent with that reported in the literature for silica measurements on rod and beams, but
substantially higher to past work reported for optical fibres. The discrepancy from an idealised
activation energy Ea ~ 700 kJ/mol may be explained by noting the higher fictive temperature of the
fibre. On the other hand, past optical fibre results obtained by beam bending with much lower values
leave questions regarding the method of viscosity measurement and the time taken for structural
equilibration. We note that because regenerated gratings already involve post-annealing to stabilise
their operation at higher temperature, the structures are much more relaxed compared to normal
fibres. This work highlights the need to stabilize components for operation in harsh environments
before their application, despite some mechanical compromise. Given the increasing expectation
of all-optical waveguide technologies operating above 1000 {\deg}C, the need to study the behaviour
of glass over the long term brings added significance to the basic understanding of glass in this
regime.
