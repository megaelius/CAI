We study the structure and morphological changes of fluids that are in contact with solid composites
formed by alternating and microscopically wide stripes of two different materials. One type of
the stripes interacts with the fluid via long-ranged Lennard-Jones-like potential and tends to
be completely wet, while the other type is purely repulsive and thus tends to be completely dry. We
consider closed systems with a fixed number of particles that allows for stabilization of fluid
configurations breaking the lateral symmetry of the wall potential. These include liquid morphologies
corresponding to a sessile drop that is formed by a sequence of bridging transitions that connect
neighboring wet regions adsorbed at the attractive stripes. We study the character of the transitions
depending on the wall composition, stripes width, and system size. Using a (classical) nonlocal
density functional theory (DFT), we show that the transitions between different liquid morphologies
are typically weakly first-order but become rounded if the wavelength of the system is lower than
a certain critical value $L_c$. We also argue that in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., for macroscopically
large systems, the wall becomes wet via an infinite sequence of first-order bridging transitions
that are, however, getting rapidly weaker and weaker and eventually become indistinguishable
from a continuous process as the size of the bridging drop increases. Finally, we construct the global
phase diagram and study the density dependence of the contact angle of the bridging drops using DFT
density profiles and a simple macroscopic theory.
