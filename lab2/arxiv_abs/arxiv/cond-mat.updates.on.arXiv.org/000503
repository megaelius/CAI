Structural studies by synchrotron x-ray diffraction on two main-chain smectic-C elastomers reveal
the presence of two different relaxation mechanisms in these systems at low and high strains. At
low strains, the smectic layers are reoriented with layer-normals distributed in a plane perpendicular
to the stretch direction. The system relaxes relatively slowly (time-constant ~ 45 minutes) which
is attributed to the flow properties of the LC layers embedded in the elastomer network. At high strains,
the equilibration time (~ 4 - 8 minutes) conforms to a faster relaxation and appears to have its origin
in the polymer components of the system. Due to misaligned microdomains at small strains, the value
of global orientational order parameter S for the mesogenic parts is initially small (~ 0.15). With
increasing strain, the local domain-directors, the mesogens, and the polymer chains, all tend
to align parallel to the stretch direction giving rise to a higher measured value of S ~ 0.83 at a strain
of 4.0. The siloxane segments remain less ordered, attaining a value of S ~ 0.4 for a strain of 4.0.
The layers gradually become oblique to the stretch direction conforming to the structural property
of the smectic-C phase. The system finally assumes a chevron-like optically monodomain structure.
Both elastomers are locked-in this state even after removal of the external stress giving rise to
strain retention and the shape memory effect. The presence of a transverse component in the main-chain
leads to higher strain retention in the second elastomer. A preference for the orientation of the
smectic layer-normals toward the stretch direction persists after removal of external stress.
Upon thermal annealing, the chevron-like microstructure gradually melts via a different path
to the initial polydomain structure.
