Although the existence of nematic order in iron-based superconductors is now a well-established
experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic order breaks the discrete lattice
rotational symmetry by making the $x$ and $y$ directions in the Fe plane non-equivalent. This can
happen because of (i) a tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition, (ii) a spontaneous breaking
of an orbital symmetry, or (iii) a spontaneous development of an Ising-type spin-nematic order
- a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry. The Landau
theory of phase transitions dictates that the development of one of these orders should immediately
induce the other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of a "chicken and egg
problem". The three scenarios are, however, quite different from a microscopic perspective. While
in the structural scenario lattice vibrations (phonons) play the dominant role, in the other two
scenarios electronic correlations are responsible for the nematic order. In this review, we argue
that experimental and theoretical evidence strongly points to the electronic rather than phononic
mechanism, placing the nematic order in the class of correlation-driven electronic instabilities,
like superconductivity and density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models
for nematicity in the iron pnictides, and link nematicity to other ordered states of the global phase
diagram of these materials -- magnetism and superconductivity. In the magnetic model nematic order
pre-empts stripe-type magnetic order, and the same interaction which favors nematicity also gives
rise to an unconventional $s^{+-}$ superconductivity. In the charge/orbital model magnetism
appears as a secondary effect of ferro-orbital order, and the interaction which favors nematicity
gives rise to a conventional $s^{++}$ superconductivity.
