Let $(Z_t)_{t\geq 0}$ denote the derivative martingale of branching Brownian motion, i.e.\@ the
derivative with respect to the inverse temperature of the normalized partition function at critical
temperature. A well-known result by Lalley and Sellke [\textit{Ann. Probab.}, 15(3):1052--1061,
1987] says that this martingale converges almost surely to a limit $Z_\infty$, positive on the event
of survival. In this paper, our concern is the fluctuations of the derivative martingale around
its limit. A corollary of our results is the following convergence, confirming and strengthening
a conjecture by Mueller and Munier [\textit{Phys. Rev. E}, 90:042143, 2014]: \[ \sqrt{t} \left(
Z_\infty - Z_t + \frac{\log t}{\sqrt{2\pi t}} Z_\infty \right) \xrightarrow[t\to\infty]{} S_{Z_\infty},
\quad \text{in law}, \] where $S$ is a spectrally positive 1-stable L\'evy process independent
of $Z_\infty$. In a first part of the paper, a relatively short proof of (a slightly stronger form
of) this convergence is given based on the functional equation satisfied by the characteristic
function of $Z_\infty$ together with tail asymptotics of this random variable. We then set up more
elaborate arguments which yield a more thorough understanding of the trajectories of the particles
contributing to the fluctuations. In this way, we can upgrade our convergence result to functional
convergence. This approach also sets the ground for a follow-up paper, where we study the fluctuations
of more general functionals including the renormalized critical additive martingale. All proofs
in this paper are given under the hypothesis $E[L(\log L)^3] < \infty$, where the random variable
$L$ follows the offspring distribution of the branching Brownian motion. We believe this hypothesis
to be optimal.
