The extended carrier lifetime in hybrid halide perovskites was attributed to a quasi-indirect
band gap that arises due to Rashba splitting in both conduction and valence band edges. In this paper,
we present results for an effective relativistic band structure of (CH3NH3)PbI3 with the focus
on the dispersion of electronic states near the band edges of (CH3NH3)PbI3 affected by thermal structural
fluctuations. We establish a relation between the magnitude of Rashba splitting and a deviation
of Pb-atom from its centrosymmetric site position in the PbI6 octahedron. For the splitting energy
to reach the thermal energy kT~26 meV (room temperature), the displacement should be of the order
0.3 Ang, which is far above the static displacements of Pb-atoms in the tetragonal phase of (CH3NH3)PbI3.
The significant dynamic enhancement of the Rashba splitting observed at earlier simulation times
(less than 2 ps) later weakens and becomes less than the thermal energy despite the average displacement
of Pb-atoms remaining large (0.37 Ang). It is randomization of Pb-displacement vectors and associated
cancelation of the net effective magnetic field acting on electrons at the conduction band edge
is responsible for reduction of the Rashba splitting. The lattice dynamics also leads to deterioration
of Bloch character for states in the valence band leading to subsequent localization of holes, which
affects bipolar mobility of charge carriers in (CH3NH3)PbI3. These results call into question
the quasi-indirect band gap as a reason for the long carrier lifetime observed in (CH3NH3)PbI3 at
room temperature. An alternative mechanism involves dynamic localization of holes and their reduced
overlap with electrons in reciprocal space.
