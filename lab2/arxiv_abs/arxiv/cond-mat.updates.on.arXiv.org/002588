In order to gain deeper insight into the physics of the novel rotating solution of nonideal transverse
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), presented in one of our recent works, we replace the previously considered
Maxwell theory with the ${\cal{CP}}$ violating Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory. In this way,
dissipationless chiral magnetic (CM) and anomalous Hall (AH) currents appear in the MCS equation
of motion, that, together with equations of relativistic hydrodynamics, builds the set of constitutive
equations of the nonideal transverse Chern-Simons magnetohydrodynamics (CSMHD). We are, in particular,
interested in the effect of these currents on the evolution of electromagnetic fields in a uniformly
and longitudinally expanding quark-gluon plasma with chirality imbalance. Combining the constitutive
equations of CSMHD under these assumptions, we arrive, as expected, at two distinct rotating and
nonrotating solutions for electromagnetic fields. The rotation occurs with increasing rapidity
and a constant angular velocity $\omega_{0}$. Remarkably, the relative angle between the electric
and magnetic fields, $\delta$, turns out to be given by the coefficient of AH current $\kappa_{E}$
and the electric conductivity of the medium $\sigma$, as $\delta=\tan^{-1}(\kappa_{E}/\sigma)$.
Whereas the nonrotating solution implies the AH coefficient to be vanishing, and thus nonrotating
electric and magnetic fields to be either parallel or antiparallel, the relative orientation of
rotating electric and magnetic fields and the evolution of the CM conductivity $\kappa_{B}$ are
strongly affected by nonvanishing $\kappa_{E}$. We explore the effect of positive and negative
$\omega_{0}$ on the evolution of the CM current, and show, in particular, that a rotation of electromagnetic
fields with negative $\omega_{0}$ implies a sign flip of the CM current in a chiral fluid with nonvanishing
AH current.
