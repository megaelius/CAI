We use the Enskog theory for the description of the self-diffusion coefficient of hard sphere fluids
in disordered porous media. Using the scaled particle theory previously developed by us for the
description of thermodynamic properties of hard sphere fluids, simple analytical expressions
for the contact values of the fluid-fluid and fluid-matrix pair distribution functions are obtained
and used as the input of Enskog theory. The expressions obtained for the contact values are described
only by the geometric porosity and do not include the dependence on other types of porosity that are
important for the description of thermodynamic properties. It is shown that the application of
such contact values neglects the effects of trapping of fluid particles by a matrix and at least the
probe particle porosity $\phi$ should be included in the Enskog theory for a correct description
of the matrix influence. In this paper we extend the Enskog theory by changing the contact values
of the fluid-matrix and the fluid-fluid pair distribution functions with new properties which
include the dependence not only on geometric porosity but also on probe particle porosity $\phi$.
It is shown that such semi-empirical improvement of the Enskog theory corresponds to SPT2b1 approximation
for the description of thermodynamic properties and it predicts correct trends for the influence
of porous media on the diffusion coefficient of a hard sphere fluid in disordered porous media. Good
agreement with computer simulations is illustrated. The effects of fluid density, fluid to matrix
sphere size ratio, matrix porosity and matrix morphology on the self-diffusion coefficient of
hard sphere fluids are discussed.
