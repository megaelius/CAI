Thermoelectric materials create an electric potential when subject to a temperature gradient
and vice versa hence they can be used to harvest waste heat into electricity and in thermal management
applications. However, finding highly efficient thermoelectrics with high figures of merit,
zT$\geq$1, is very challenging because the combination of high power factor and low thermal conductivity
is rare in materials. Here, we use first-principles methods to analyze the thermoelectric properties
of Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ ($X$=S,Se), a recently synthesized class of lithium fast-ion conductors presenting
high thermal stability. In p-type Li$_2$Sn$X_3$, we estimate highly flat electronic valence bands
that render high Seebeck coefficients exceeding 400 ${\mu}$VK$^{-1}$ at 700K. In n-type Li$_2$Sn$X_3$,
the electronic conduction bands are slightly dispersive however the accompanying weak electron-acoustic
phonon scattering induces high electrical conductivity. The combination of high Seebeck coefficient
and electrical conductivity gives rise to high power factors, reaching a maximum of 4 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$
in p-type Li$_2$SnS$_3$ and 8 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ in n-type Li$_2$SnSe$_3$ at 300 K. Likewise,
the thermal conductivity in Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ is low as compared to conventional thermoelectric materials,
2-5 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature. As a result, we estimate a maximum zT = 1.05 in p-type
Li$_2$SnS$_3$ at 700 K and an extraordinary 3.07 (1.5) in n-type Li$_2$SnSe$_3$ at the same temperature
(300 K). Our findings of huge zT in Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ suggest that lithium fast-ion conductors, typically
employed as electrolytes in solid-state batteries, hold exceptional promise as thermoelectric
materials.
