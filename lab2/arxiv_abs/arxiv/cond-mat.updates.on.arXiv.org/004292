Two-dimensional layered Kagome-lattice 3d transition metals are emerging as an exciting platform
to explore the frustrated lattice geometry, electronic correlation and quantum topology. However,
the typical Kagome electronic bands, characterized by sets of the Dirac-like bands capped by a phase-destructive
flat band, have not been clearly observed in these materials, mainly due to the complicated electronic
structures induced by magnetism, their orbital physics are even less well investigated. Here,
we present the orbital-selective Dirac fermions and extremely flat bands in the nonmagnetic Kagome
metal CoSn, which contains Co Kagome lattice in single Co3Sn layers. Without complications from
the magnetism and with a perfect in-plane Kagome lattice, the Kagome bands of CoSn are clearly determined
both experimentally and computationally. We directly visualize that the extremely flat band with
out-of-plane dxz/dyz orbital characters runs through the whole Brillouin zone (BZ) and features
in touch with a quadratic band at the BZ center, which is a key feature to distinguish from the flat
band in heavy fermions and Morie lattice. This key evidence of Kagome flat band is critically missing
in previous experiments. The flat band top with in-plane dxy/dx2-y2 orbital characters is just
at about -0.07 eV below the Fermi level. If the chemical potential were tuned properly, superconductivity
at even higher temperature could be realized. The energy gap induced by spin-orbit interaction
at the Dirac cone with out-of-plane orbital characters is much smaller than that with in-plane orbital
characters, suggesting orbital-selective character of the Dirac fermions. Our findings explicitly
unveil orbital-selective topological electronic states, and provide insight into the recent
discoveries of multiple types of topological electronic excitations in 3d transition Kagome metals.
