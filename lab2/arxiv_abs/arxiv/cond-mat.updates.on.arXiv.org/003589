Determining which proteins interact together is crucial to a systems-level understanding of the
cell. Recently, algorithms based on Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) pairwise maximum-entropy
models have allowed to identify interaction partners among paralogous proteins from sequence
data. This success of DCA at predicting protein-protein interactions could be mainly based on its
known ability to identify pairs of residues that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure
of protein complexes and that coevolve to remain physicochemically complementary. However, interacting
proteins possess similar evolutionary histories. What is the role of purely phylogenetic correlations
in the performance of DCA-based methods to infer interaction partners? To address this question,
we employ controlled synthetic data that only involve phylogeny and no interactions or contacts.
We find that DCA accurately identifies the pairs of synthetic sequences that share evolutionary
history. While phylogenetic correlations confound the identification of contacting residues
by DCA, they are thus useful to predict interacting partners among paralogs. We find that DCA performs
as well as phylogenetic methods to this end, and slightly better than them with large and accurate
training sets. Employing DCA or phylogenetic methods within an Iterative Pairing Algorithm (IPA)
allows to predict pairs of evolutionary partners without a training set. We demonstrate the ability
of these various methods to correctly predict pairings among real paralogous proteins with genome
proximity but no known physical interaction, illustrating the importance of phylogenetic correlations
in natural data. However, for physically interacting and strongly coevolving proteins, DCA and
mutual information outperform phylogenetic methods. We discuss how to distinguish physically
interacting proteins from those only sharing evolutionary history.
