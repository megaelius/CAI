In this report, we present structural, electronic, magnetic and transport properties of Co-rich
spin gapless semiconductor CoFeCrGa using both theoretical and experimental techniques. The
key advantage of Co-rich samples $\mathrm{Co_{1+x}Fe_{1-x}CrGa}$ is the high Curie temperature
(T$\mathrm{_C}$) and magnetization, without compromising the SGS nature (up to x = 0.4), and hence
our choice. The quaternary Heusler alloys $\mathrm{Co_{1+x}Fe_{1-x}CrGa}$ (x = 0.1 to 0.5) are
found to crystallize in LiMgPdSn-type structure having space group $F\bar{4}3m$ (\# 216). The
measured Curie temperature increases from 690 K (x = 0) to 870 K (x = 0.5). Observed magnetization
values follow the Slater-Pauling rule. Measured electrical resistivity, in the temperature range
of 5-350 K, suggests that the alloys retain the SGS behavior up to x = 0.4, beyond which it reflects
metallic character. Unlike conventional semiconductors, the conductivity value ($\mathrm{\sigma_{xx}}$)
at 300 K lies in the range of 2289 S $\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ to 3294 S $\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which is close
to that of other reported SGS materials. The anomalous Hall effect is comparatively low. The intrinsic
contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity increase with x, which can be correlated with the
enhancement in chemical order. The anomalous Hall coefficient is found to increase from 38 S/cm
for x = 0.1 to 43 S/cm for 0.3. Seebeck coefficients turn out to be vanishingly small below 300 K, another
signature for being SGS. All the alloys (for different x) are found to be both chemically and thermally
stable. Simulated magnetization agrees fairly with the experiment. As such Co-rich CoFeCrGa is
a promising candidate for room temperature spintronic applications, with enhanced T$\mathrm{_C}$,
magnetic properties and SGS nature.
