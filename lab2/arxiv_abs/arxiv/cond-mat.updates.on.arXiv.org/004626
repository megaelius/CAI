Density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles investigations of structural, elastic,
electronic band structure, and optical properties of superconducting ternary phosphides (BaM2P2;
M = Ni, Rh) have been carried out in this study. This is the first detailed pressure dependent study
of these properties for the titled compounds. The calculated ambient condition properties are
compared with existing experimental and theoretical results, where available. The pressure dependent
variations of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N(EF), and the Debye temperature,
thetaD, have been studied and their effect on superconducting transition temperature have been
explored. N(EF) shows nonmonotonic pressure dependence in BaNi2P2. The pressure dependence of
N(EF) for BaRh2P2, on the other hand, is monotonic; decreasing with increasing pressure up to 15
GPa and saturating at higher pressure. Pressure dependence of N(EF) is reflected in the pressure
dependent superconducting transition temperature. The Debye temperature increases with increasing
pressure. The variation of the optical parameters (real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant,
refractive indices, reflectivity, absorption coefficient, and loss function) with photon energy
show metallic behavior complementing the features of electronic band structure calculations.
The absorption spectra of BaNi2P2 show strong optical absorption in the ultraviolet region, while
BaRh2P2 absorbs photons over a wider energy band including the entire visible range. The reflectivity
spectra for both BaNi2P2 and BaRh2P2 reveal that these materials are very strong reflectors of visible
spectrum and particularly BaNi2P2 have significant potential to be used as coating material to
reduce solar heating.
