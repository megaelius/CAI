Finding novel topological quantum matter and topological phase transitions has been a central
theme in modern physics. An outstanding example is the Chern insulator, first conceived as a theoretical
model for the quantum Hall effect without Landau levels, which was realized experimentally in magnetically
doped topological insulator (TI) at zero magnetic field, known as the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)
effect. The axion insulator is another distinct topological phase that has vanishing Chern number
but a finite topological Chern-Simon term. It was proposed to be a promising platform for exploring
quantized topological magnetoelectric coupling and axion electrodynamics in condensed matter.
Previous attempts to construct the axion insulator phase involve heterostructures of two QAH layers
with different coercive fields, which require complex epitaxial growth and ultralow temperature
measurement in finite magnetic field. Here we report the realization of an intrinsic axion insulator
phase in MnBi2Te4, which has been predicted to be a TI with interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) order.
We found that when the crystal is exfoliated down to 6 septuple layers (SLs) and tuned into the insulating
regime, the axion insulator phase is observed at zero magnetic field when the top and bottom surfaces
are subjected to opposite magnetization. More interestingly, a moderate magnetic field drives
a transition from the axion insulator phase, characterized by large longitudinal resistance and
zero Hall resistance, to a Chern insulator with zero longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall
resistance h/e2 (h is the Plank constant and e is the elemental charge). The robust and tunable axion
insulator and Chern insulator phases hosted by one stoichiometric crystal at relatively high temperature
makes it a versatile system for investigating exotic topological phases and phase transitions.
