We report numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under
a strong ac magnetic field $H(t)=H\sin\omega t$ parallel to the surface. The power dissipated by
an oscillating vortex segment driven by the surface ac Meissner currents was calculated by taking
into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(LO) viscous drag coefficient $\eta(v)$. We show that the LO decrease of $\eta(v)$ with the vortex
velocity $v$ can radically change the field dependence of the surface resistance $R_i(H)$ caused
by trapped vortices. At low frequencies $R_i(H) $ exhibits a conventional increases with $H$, but
as $\omega$ increases, the surface resistance becomes a nonmonotonic function of $H$ which decreases
with $H$ at higher fields. The effects of frequency, pin spacing and the mean free path $l_i $ on the
field dependence of $R_{i}(H) $ were calculated. It is shown that, as the surface gets dirtier and
$l_i$ decreases, the anomalous drop of $ R_{i}(H) $ with $H$ shifts to lower fields which can be much
smaller than the lower critical magnetic field. Our numerical simulations also show that the LO
decrease of $\eta(v)$ with $v$ can cause a vortex bending instability at high field amplitudes and
frequencies, giving rise to the formation of dynamic kinks along the vortex. Measurements of $R_i(H)$
caused by sparse vortices trapped perpendicular to the surface can offer opportunities to investigate
an extreme nonlinear dynamics of vortices driven by strong current densities up to the depairing
limit at low temperatures. The behavior of $R_i(H)$ which can be tuned by varying the rf frequency
or concentration of nonmagnetic impurities is not masked by strong heating effects characteristic
of dc or pulse transport measurements.
