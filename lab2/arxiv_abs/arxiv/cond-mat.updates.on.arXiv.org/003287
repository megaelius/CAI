We consider the correlations and the hydrodynamic description of random walkers with a general
finite memory moving on a $d$ dimensional hypercubic lattice. We derive a drift-diffusion equation
and identify a memory-dependent critical density. Above the critical density, the effective diffusion
coefficient decreases with the particles' propensity to move forward and below the critical density
it increases with their propensity to move forward. If the correlations are neglected the critical
density is exactly $1/2$. We also derive a low-density approximation for the same time correlations
between different sites. We perform simulations on a one-dimensional system with one-step memory
and find good agreement between our analytical derivation and the numerical results. We also consider
the previously unexplored special case of totally anti-persistent particles. Generally, the
correlation length converges to a finite value. However in the special case of totally anti-persistent
particles and density $1/2$, the correlation length diverges with time. Furthermore, connecting
a system of totally anti-persistent particles to external particle reservoirs creates a new phenomenon:
In almost all systems, regardless of the precise details of the microscopic dynamics, when a system
is connected to a reservoir, the mean density of particle at the edge is the same as the reservoir following
the zeroth law of thermodynamics. In a totally anti-persistent system, however, the density at
the edge is always higher than in the reservoir. We find a qualitative description of this phenomenon
which agrees reasonably well with the numerics.
