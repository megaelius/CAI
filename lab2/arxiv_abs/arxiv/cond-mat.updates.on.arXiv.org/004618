We study finite-temperature properties of the Kondo effect in a carbon nanotube (CNT) quantum dot
using the Wilson numerical renormalization group (NRG). In the absence of magnetic fields, four
degenerate energy levels of the CNT consisting of spin and orbital degrees of freedom give rise to
the SU(4) Kondo effect. We revisit the universal scaling behaviour of the SU(4) conductance for
quarter- and half-filling in a wide temperature range. We find that the filling dependence of the
universality at low-temperatures $T$ can be explained clearly with an extended Fermi-liquid theory.
This theory clarifies that the $T^{2}$ coefficient of conductance becomes zero at quarter-filling
whereas the coefficient at half-filling is finite. We also study a field-induced crossover from
the SU(4) to SU(2) Kondo state observed at the half-filled CNT dot. It is caused by the matching of
the spin and orbital Zeeman splittings, which lock two levels among the four at the Fermi level even
in magnetic fields $B$. We find that the conductance shows the SU($4$) scaling behaviour at $\mu_{B}B<k_{B}T_{K}^{\mathrm{SU(4)}}$
and it exhibits the SU($2$) universality at $\mu_{B}B\gg k_{B}T_{K}^{\mathrm{SU(4)}}$, where
$T_{K}^{\mathrm{SU(4)}}$ is the SU($4$) Kondo temperature. To clarify how the excited states
evolve along the SU(4) to SU(2) crossover, we also calculate the spectral function. The results
show that the Kondo resonance width of the two states locked at the Fermi level becomes sharper with
increasing fields. The spectral peaks of the other two levels moving away from the Fermi level merge
with atomic limit peaks for $\mu_{B}B \gtrsim k_{B}T_{K}^{\mathrm{SU(4)}}$.
