Ionic microgels are soft colloidal particles, composed of crosslinked polymer networks, that
ionize and swell when dispersed in a good solvent. Swelling of these permeable, compressible particles
involves a balance of electrostatic, elastic, and mixing contributions to the single-particle
osmotic pressure. The electrostatic contribution depends on the distributions of mobile counterions
and coions and of fixed charge on the polymers. Within the cell model, we employ two complementary
methods to derive the electrostatic osmotic pressure of ionic microgels. In Poisson-Boltzmann
(PB) theory, we minimize a free energy functional with respect to the electrostatic potential to
obtain the bulk pressure. From the pressure tensor, we extract the electrostatic and gel contributions
to the total pressure. In a statistical mechanical approach, we vary the free energy with respect
to microgel size to obtain exact relations for the microgel electrostatic osmotic pressure. We
present results for planar, cylindrical, and spherical geometries. For models of membranes and
microgels with fixed charge uniformly distributed over their surface or volume, we derive analogues
of the contact value theorem for charged colloids. We validate these relations by solving the PB
equation and computing ion densities and osmotic pressures. When implemented within PB theory,
the two methods yield identical electrostatic osmotic pressures for surface-charged microgels.
For volume-charged microgels, the exact electrostatic osmotic pressure equals the average of
the corresponding PB profile over the gel volume. We demonstrate that swelling of ionic microgels
depends on variation of the electrostatic pressure inside the particle and discuss implications
for interpreting experiments.
