Ultrathin semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) with at least one dimension below their exciton Bohr
radius receive a rapidly increasing attention due to their unique physicochemical properties
such as strong quantum confinement, large surface-to-volume ratio, and giant oscillator strength.
These superior properties highly depend on the shape and crystal phase of semiconductor NCs. Slight
changes in the shape and phase of NCs can cause significant changes in their properties. Therefore,
it is crucial to controllably synthesize semiconductor NCs. Here, we demonstrate not only the synthesis
of robust well-defined ultrathin ZnS nanoplatelets (NPLs) with excitonic absorption and emission,
but also the precise shape and phase control of ZnS NCs based on a soft template strategy. The key feature
of our approach is the tuning of the sulfur precursor amount, resulting in a simultaneous shape/phase
transformation between wurtzite (WZ) ZnS NPLs and zinc blende (ZB) ZnS nanorods (NRs) at moderate
temperatures (150 degree). UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra reveal very
distinct optical properties between WZ-ZnS NPLs and ZB-ZnS NRs. UV-vis absorption spectra of WZ-ZnS
NPLs clearly exhibit a sharp excitonic peak that is not observed in ZB-ZnS NRs. Besides, the PL characterization
shows that WZ-ZnS NPLs have a narrow excitonic emission peak (292 nm), while the ZB-ZnS NRs exhibit
a broad collective emission band consisting of four emission peaks (335, 359, 395, and 468 nm). The
appearance of excitonic features in the absorption spectra of ZnS NPLs is explained by interband
electronic transitions, which is simulated in the framework of density functional theory (DFT).
The presented simple and effective synthetic strategy opens a new path to synthesize further NCs
with shape and phase control for advanced applications in electronics and photonics.
