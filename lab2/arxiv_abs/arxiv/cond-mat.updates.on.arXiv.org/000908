We revisit the interpretation of quasiparticle scattering interference in cuprate high-$T_c$
superconductors. This phenomenon has been very successful in reconstructing the dispersions
of d-wave Bogoliubov excitations, but the successful identification and interpretation of QPI
in scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiments rely on theoretical results obtained for
the case of isolated impurities. We introduce a highly flexible technique to simulate STS measurements
by computing the local density of states using real-space Green's functions defined on two-dimensional
lattices with as many as 100,000 sites. We focus on the following question: to what extent can the
experimental results be reproduced when various forms of distributed disorder are present? We
consider randomly distributed point-like impurities, smooth "Coulombic" disorder, and disorder
arising from random on-site energies and superconducting gaps. We find an apparent paradox: the
QPI peaks in the Fourier-transformed local density of states appear to be sharper and better defined
in experiment than those seen in our simulations. We arrive at a no-go result for smooth-potential
disorder since this does not reproduce the QPI peaks associated with large-momentum scattering.
An ensemble of point-like impurities gets closest to experiment, but this goes hand in hand with
impurity cores that are not seen in experiment. We also study the effects of possible measurement
artifacts (the "fork mechanism"), which turn out to be of relatively minor consequence. It appears
that there is an unknown mechanism at work which renders the QPI peaks much sharper than they are based
on present theoretical understanding.
