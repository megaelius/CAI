While the tunneling conductance between two spherical-like conducting particles depends on the
relative inter-particle distance, the wave function overlap between states of two rod-like particles,
and so the tunneling conductance, depends also on the relative orientation of the rod axes. Modeling
slender rod-like particles as cylindrical quantum wells of diameter $D$ and length $L\gg D$, we
calculate the matrix element of the tunneling between two rods for arbitrary relative orientations
of the rod axes. We show that tunneling between two parallel rods is about $L/\sqrt{D\xi}$ times
larger than the tunneling matrix element for perpendicular rods, where $\xi$ is the tunneling decay
length. By considering the full dependence of the tunneling conductance on the angle between rod
axes, we calculate within an effective medium theory the conductivity of dispersions of rods with
different degrees of alignment. We find that for isotropically oriented rods, the effect of orientation
in the tunneling processes is marginal for all rod concentrations. On the contrary, for systems
of strongly aligned rods, the enhanced tunneling between nearly parallel rods increases significantly
the system conductivity in a relatively large concentration range. Next, we consider systems in
which short-range attraction between rods is added, as in dispersions of rods with depletion interaction.
We find that the strongly anisotropic attraction promotes enhanced tunneling between neighboring
parallel rods, increasing the effective medium conductivity by several orders of magnitude compared
to the case in which the angular dependence of tunneling is ignored, even for relatively weak attractions.
