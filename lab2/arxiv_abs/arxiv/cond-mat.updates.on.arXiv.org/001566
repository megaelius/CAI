This report adresses topics and questions of common interest in the fields of ultra-cold gases and
nuclear physics in the context of the BCS-BEC crossover. The BCS-BEC crossover has recently been
realized experimentally, and essentially in all of its aspects, with ultra-cold Fermi gases. This
realization, in turn, has raised the interest of the nuclear physics community in the crossover
problem, since it represents an unprecedented tool to test fundamental and unanswered questions
of nuclear many-body theory. Here, we focus on the several aspects of the BCS-BEC crossover, which
are of broad joint interest to both ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter, and which will likely
help to solve in the future some open problems in nuclear physics (concerning, for instance, neutron
stars). Similarities and differences occurring in ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter will
then be emphasized, not only about the relative phenomenologies but also about the theoretical
approaches to be used in the two contexts. After an introduction to present the key concepts of the
BCS-BEC crossover, this report discusses the mean-field treatment of the superfluid phase, both
for homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems, as well as for symmetric (spin- or isospin-balanced)
and asymmetric (spin- or isospin-imbalanced) matter. Pairing fluctuations in the normal phase
are then considered, with their manifestations in thermodynamic and dynamic quantities. The last
two Sections provide a more specialized discussion of the BCS-BEC crossover in ultra-cold Fermi
gases and nuclear matter, respectively. The separate discussion in the two contexts aims at cross
communicating to both communities topics and aspects which, albeit arising in one of the two fields,
share a strong common interest.
