Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has presented a revolutionary methodology to the nanoscience
and nanotechnology. It enables imaging the topography of surfaces, mapping the distribution of
electronic density of states, and manipulating individual atoms and molecules, all at the atomic
resolution. In particular, the atom manipulation capability has evolved from fabricating individual
nanostructures towards the scalable production of the atomic-sized devices bottom-up. The combination
of precision synthesis and in situ characterization of the atomically precise structures has enabled
direct visualization of many quantum phenomena and fast proof-of-principle testing of quantum
device functions with real-time feedback to guide the improved synthesis. In this article, several
representative examples are reviewed to demonstrate the recent development of atomic scale manipulation.
Especially, the review focuses on the progress that address the quantum properties by design through
the precise control of the atomic structures in several technologically relevant materials systems.
Besides conventional STM manipulations and electronic structure characterization with single-probe
STM, integration of multiple atomically precisely controlled probes in a multiprobe STM system
vastly extends the capability of in situ characterization to a new dimension where the charge and
spin transport behaviors can be examined from mesoscopic to atomic length scale. The automation
of the atomic scale manipulation and the integration with the well-established lithographic processes
would further push this bottom-up approach to a new level that combines reproducible fabrication,
extraordinary programmability, and the ability to produce large-scale arrays of quantum structures.
