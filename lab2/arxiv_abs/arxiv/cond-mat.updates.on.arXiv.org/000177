In this paper we consider the charge-excess functional model (CEFM) for net atomic charges in alloys
[E. Bruno et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 166401 (2003)]. We begin by deriving the CEFM energy function
in order to elucidate the approximations which underpin this model. We thereafter consider the
particular case of the CEFM in which the strength of the `local interactions' within all sites are
the same. We show that the ground state charges of this model can be expressed in terms of charge transfer
between all pairs of sites in the same manner as the optimized linear charge model [T.L. Underwood
et al., Phys. Rev. B 79, 024203 (2009)]. Hence the model considered is the generalization of the optimized
linear charge model for alloys containing more than two chemical species. We then determine the
model's unknown `geometric factors' over a wide range of parameter space. These quantities are
linked to the nature of charge screening in the model, and we illustrate that the screening becomes
increasingly universal as the strength of the local interactions are increased. We then use the
model to derive analytical expressions for various physical quantities, including the Madelung
energy and the disorder broadening in the core electron binding energies. These expressions are
applied to ternary random alloys, for which it is shown that the Madelung energy and magnitude of
disorder broadening are maximized at the composition at which the two species with the largest `electronegativity
difference' are equal, while the remaining species having a vanishing concentration. This result
is somewhat counterintuitive with regards to the disorder broadening since it does not correspond
to the composition with the highest entropy. Finally, the model is applied to CuPd and CuZn random
alloys. The model is ...
