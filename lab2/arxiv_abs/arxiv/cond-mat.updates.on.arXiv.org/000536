We investigate a method for entangling two singlet-triplet qubits in adjacent double quantum dots
via capacitive interactions. In contrast to prior work, here we focus on a regime with strong interactions
between the qubits. The interplay of the interaction energy and simultaneous large detunings for
both double dots gives rise to the double charge resonant regime, in which the unpolarized (1111)
and fully polarized (0202) four-electron states in the absence of interqubit tunneling are near
degeneracy, while being energetically well-separated from the partially polarized (0211 and
1102) states. A controlled-phase gate may be realized by combining time evolution in this regime
in the presence of intraqubit tunneling and the interqubit Coulomb interaction with refocusing
{\pi} pulses that swap the singly occupied singlet and triplet states of the two qubits via, e.g.,
magnetic gradients. We calculate the fidelity of this entangling gate, incorporating models for
two types of noise - classical, Gaussian-distributed charge fluctuations in the single-qubit
detunings and charge relaxation within the low-energy subspace via electron-phonon interaction
- and identify parameter regimes that optimize the fidelity. The rates of phonon-induced decay
for pairs of GaAs or Si double quantum dots vary with the sizes of the dipolar and quadrupolar contributions
and are several orders of magnitude smaller for Si, leading to high theoretical gate fidelities
for coupled singlet-triplet qubits in Si dots. We also consider the dependence of the capacitive
coupling on the relative orientation of the double dots and find that a linear geometry provides
the fastest potential gate.
