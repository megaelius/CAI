Many complex systems can be described as multiplex networks in which the same nodes can interact
with one another in different layers, thus forming a set of interacting and co-evolving networks.
Examples of such multiplex systems are social networks where people are involved in different types
of relationships and interact through various forms of communication media. The ranking of nodes
in multiplex networks is one of the most pressing and challenging tasks that research on complex
networks is currently facing. When pairs of nodes can be connected through multiple links and in
multiple layers, the ranking of nodes should necessarily reflect the importance of nodes in one
layer as well as their importance in other interdependent layers. In this paper, we draw on the idea
of biased random walks to define the Multiplex PageRank centrality measure in which the effects
of the interplay between networks on the centrality of nodes are directly taken into account. In
particular, depending on the intensity of the interaction between layers, we define the Additive,
Multiplicative, Combined, and Neutral versions of Multiplex PageRank, and show how each version
reflects the extent to which the importance of a node in one layer affects the importance the node
can gain in another layer. We discuss these measures and apply them to an online multiplex social
network. Findings indicate that taking the multiplex nature of the network into account helps uncover
the emergence of rankings of nodes that differ from the rankings obtained from one single layer.
Results provide support in favor of the salience of multiplex centrality measures, like Multiplex
PageRank, for assessing the prominence of nodes embedded in multiple interacting networks, and
for shedding a new light on structural properties that would otherwise remain undetected if each
of the interacting networks were analyzed in isolation.
