The chapter generalizes results on influence of uniaxial strain and adsorption on the electron
states and charge transport or localization in graphene with different configurations of imperfections
(point defects): resonant (neutral) adsorbed atoms either oxygen- or hydrogen-containing molecules
or functional groups, vacancies or substitutional atoms, charged impurity atoms or molecules,
and distortions. To observe electronic properties of graphene-admolecules system, we applied
electron paramagnetic resonance technique in a broad temperature range for graphene oxides as
a good basis for understanding the electrotransport properties of other active carbons. Applied
technique allowed observation of possible metal-insulator transition and sorption pumping effect
as well as discussion of results in relation to the granular metal model. The electronic and transport
properties are calculated within the framework of the tight-binding model along with the Kubo-Greenwood
quantum-mechanical formalism. Depending on electron density and type of the sites, the conductivity
for correlated and ordered adsorbates is found to be enhanced in dozens of times as compared to the
cases of their random distribution. In case of the uniaxially strained graphene, the presence of
point defects counteracts against or contributes to the band-gap opening according to their configurations.
The band-gap behaviour is found to be nonmonotonic with strain in case of a simultaneous action of
defect ordering and zigzag deformation. The amount of localized charge carriers (spins) is found
to be correlated with the content of adsorbed centres responsible for the formation of potential
barriers and, in turn, for the localization effects. Physical and chemical states of graphene edges,
especially at a uniaxial strain along one of them, play a crucial role in electrical transport phenomena
in graphene-based materials.
