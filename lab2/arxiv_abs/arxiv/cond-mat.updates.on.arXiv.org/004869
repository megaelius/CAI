Networks that have power-law connectivity, commonly referred to as the scale-free networks, are
an important class of complex networks. A heterogeneous mean-field approximation has been previously
proposed for the Ising model of the Barab\'{a}si-Albert model of scale-free networks with classical
spins on the nodes wherein it was shown that the critical temperature for such a system scales logarithmically
with network size. For finite sizes, there is no criticality for such a system and hence no true phase
transition in terms of singular behavior. Further, in the thermodynamic limit, the mean-field
prediction of an infinite critical temperature for the system may exclude any true phase transition
even then. Nevertheless, with an eye on potential applications of the model on biological systems
that are generally finite, one may still try to find approximations that describe the relevant observables
quantitatively. Here we present an alternative, approximate formulation for the description
of the Ising model of a Barab\'{a}si-Albert Network. Using the classical definition of magnetization,
we show that Ising models on a network can be well-approximated by a long-range interacting homogeneous
Ising model wherein each node of the network couples to all other spins with a strength determined
by the mean degree of the Barab\'{a}si-Albert Network. In such an effective long-range Ising model
of a Barab\'{a}si-Albert Network, the critical temperature is directly proportional to the number
of preferentially attached links added to grow the network. The proposed model describes the magnetization
of the majority of the sites with average or smaller than average degree better compared to the heterogeneous
mean-field approximation. The long-range Ising model is the only homogeneous description of Barab\'{a}si-Albert
networks that we know of.
