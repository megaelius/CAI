We construct a reference database of materials properties calculated using density-functional
theory in the local or generalized-gradient approximation, and an all-electron or a projector
augmented-wave (PAW) formulation, for verification and validation of first-principles simulations.
All-electron calculations use the full-potential linearised augmented-plane wave method, as
implemented in the \texttt{Elk} open-source code, while PAW calculations use the datasets developed
by some of us in the open-source \texttt{PSlibrary} repository and the \texttt{Quantum ESPRESSO}
distribution. We first calculate lattice parameters, bulk moduli, and energy differences for
alkaline metals, alkaline earths, and $3d$ and $4d$ transition metals in three ideal, reference
phases (simple cubic, fcc, and bcc), representing a standardized crystalline monoatomic solid-state
test. Then, as suggested by K. Lejaeghere {\it et al.}, [Critical Reviews in Solid State and Material
Sciences 39, p 1 (2014)], we compare the equations of state for all elements, except lanthanides
and actinides, in their experimental phase (or occasionally a simpler, closely related one). PAW
and all-electron energy differences and structural parameters agree in most cases within a few
meV/atom and a fraction of a percent, respectively. This level of agreement, comparable with the
previous study, includes also other PAW and all-electron data from the electronic-structure codes
\texttt{VASP} and \texttt{WIEN2K}, and underscores the overall reliability of current, state-of-the-art
electronic-structure calculations. At the same time, discrepancies that arise even within the
same formulation for simple, fundamental structural properties point to the urgent need of establishing
standards for verification and validation, reference data sets, and careful refinements of the
computational approaches used.
