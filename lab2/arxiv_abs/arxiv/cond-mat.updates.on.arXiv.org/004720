The mechanical properties of Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) nanowire is an emerging issue due to its application
in semiconductor and optoelectronics industries. In this paper, we conducted molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical properties and failure
behavior of Zinc-Blende (ZB) CdSe nanowire under uniaxial tensile deformation. We employed Stillinger-Weber
(SW) potential to describe the inter-atomic interactions. The effect of variation of temperatures
(100 K-600 K), sizes, and crystal orientation on the tensile response of the CdSe nanowires is investigated.
Our simulation results suggest that both ultimate tensile strength and Youngs modulus of CdSe have
an inverse relationship with temperature. From 100K to 600K, the ZB CdSe exhibits brittle type failure
thus there is no brittle to ductile transition temperature found. Results also suggest that size
has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of CdSe nanowire. It has been found that as
the cross-sectional area increases both ultimate tensile stress and Youngs modulus increases
as well. The [111] oriented ZB CdSe shows the largest ultimate tensile strength, Youngs modulus
and fracture toughness whereas the values are lowest for [100] orientation. The [110] orientation
shows the largest failure strain compared to other orientations. Finally, failure mechanisms
of CdSe nanowire are also investigated at 100K and 600K. We noticed that at 100K temperature [100]
oriented ZB CdSe fails along {111} cleavage plane however in the case of 600 K temperature, both {111}
and {100} planes are activated and cause fracture of CdSe nanowire at lower strain value. This study
can guide to design ZB CdSe based solar cell, optoelectronic and semiconductor devices by presenting
a comprehensive understanding of the mechanical and fracture characteristics of this nanowire.
