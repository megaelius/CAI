Single polymer dynamics offers a powerful approach to study molecular-level interactions and
dynamic microstructure in materials. Direct visualization of single chain dynamics has uncovered
new ideas regarding the rheology and non-equilibrium dynamics of macromolecules, including the
importance of molecular individualism, dynamic heterogeneity, and molecular sub-populations
that govern macroscale behavior. In recent years, the field of single polymer dynamics has been
extended to increasingly complex materials, including architecturally complex polymers such
as combs, bottlebrushes, and ring polymers and entangled solutions of long chain polymers in flow.
Single molecule visualization, complemented by modeling and simulation techniques such as Brownian
dynamics and Monte Carlo methods, allow for unparalleled access to the molecular-scale dynamics
of polymeric materials. In this review, recent progress in the field of single polymer dynamics
is examined by highlighting major developments and new physics to emerge from these techniques.
The molecular properties of DNA as a model polymer are examined, including the role of flexibility,
excluded volume interactions, and hydrodynamic interactions in governing behavior. Recent developments
in studying polymer dynamics in time-dependent flows, new chemistries and new molecular topologies,
and the role of intermolecular interactions in concentrated solutions are considered. Moreover,
cutting-edge methods in simulation techniques are further reviewed as an ideal complementary
method to single polymer experiments. Future work aimed at extending the field of single polymer
dynamics to new materials promises to uncover original and unexpected information regarding the
flow dynamics of polymeric systems.
