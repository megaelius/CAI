The friction-induced charging (i.e., tribocharging) and the following discharging (referred
here as tribodischarging) are always believed to have negative effects on the daily life and on the
industrial production. Thus, how to inhibit the tribocharging and the tribodischarging has caused
wide public concern. Because the discharge caused by the electrical breakdown of the ambient gas
is generally accompanied with the generation of light, we investigated here the tribocharging
and the tribodischarging by observing the light emitted during friction. We found that the position
reversal of the friction pair has a dramatic impact on the intensity of the tribo-induced light.
Experimental results show that an intense light is produced when a stationary Al2O3 disk is sliding
on a rotating SiO2 disk, but only a weak light is observed for the case of a stationary SiO2 disk and
a rotating Al2O3 disk. This means that the process of the tribocharging and the tribodischarging
can be significantly influenced owing to the change in the relative position of the friction couple.
The experimentally measured polarities of the tribo-induced charge on the friction surfaces further
indicated that the strong discharging occurs when the rotating surface is negatively charged.
The reason for the difference in the intensity of the tribocharging and tribodischarging can be
attributed to the combined effects of the contact potential difference and the temperature gradient
between the contacting surfaces on the charge transfer when friction. Finally, a simple, low cost,
yet effective approach, i.e., just keep the friction partner whose surface is tribo-induced negatively
charged as the stationary one, can be utilized to suppress the intensity of the tribocharging and
the tribodischarging. This work may provide potential applications in numerous areas of science
and engineering and also in the everyday life.
