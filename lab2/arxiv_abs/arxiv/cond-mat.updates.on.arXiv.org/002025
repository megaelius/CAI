Ice accumulation hinders the performance of, and poses safety threats for infrastructure both
on the ground and in the air. Previously, rationally designed superhydrophobic surfaces have demonstrated
some potential as a passive means to mitigate ice accretion; however, further studies on material
solutions that reduce impalement and contact time for impacting supercooled droplets and can also
repel droplets that freeze during surface contact are urgently needed. Here we demonstrate the
collaborative effect of substrate flexibility and surface nanotexture on enhancing both icephobicity
and the repellency of viscous droplets. We first investigate the influence of increased viscosity
on impalement resistance and droplet-substrate contact time after impact. Then we examine the
effect of droplet partial solidification on recoil and simulate more challenging icing conditions
by impacting supercooled water droplets onto flexible and rigid surfaces containing ice nucleation
promoters. We demonstrate a passive mechanism for shedding partially solidified droplets under
conditions where partial solidification occurs much faster than the natural droplet oscillation
which does not rely on converting droplet surface energy into kinetic energy. Using an energy-based
model, we identify a previously unexplored mechanism whereby the substrate oscillation and velocity
govern the rebound process, with low-areal density and moderately stiff substrates acting to efficiently
absorb the incoming droplet kinetic energy and rectify it back, allowing droplets to overcome adhesion
and gravitational forces, and recoil. This mechanism applies for a range of droplet viscosities,
spanning from low to high viscosity fluids and even ice slurries, which do not rebound from rigid
superhydrophobic substrates.
