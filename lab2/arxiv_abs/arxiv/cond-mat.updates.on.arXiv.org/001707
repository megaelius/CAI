Many of the properties of superconductors related to quantum coherence are revealed when the superconducting
state is forced to vary in space - in response to an external magnetic field, a proximity contact,
an interface to a ferromagnet, or to impurities embedded in the superconductor. Among the earliest
examples is Andreev reflection of an electron into a retro-reflected hole at a normal-superconducting
interface. In regions of strong inhomogeneity multiple Andreev reflection leads to the formation
of sub-gap states, Andreev bound states, with excitation energies below the superconducting gap.
These states play a central role in our understanding of inhomogeneous superconductors. The discoveries
of unconventional superconductivity in many classes of materials, advances in fabrication of
superconducting/ferromagnetic hybrids and nano-structures for confining superfluid $^3$He,
combined with theoretical developments in topological quantum matter have dramatically expanded
the significance of branch conversion scattering and Andreev bound state formation. This collection
of articles highlights developments in inhomogeneous superconductivity, unconventional superconductivity
and topological phases of superfluid $^3$He, in which Andreev scattering and bound states underpin
much of the physics of these systems. This article provides an introduction to the basic physics
of Andreev scattering, bound-state formation and their signatures. The goal is both an introduction
for interested readers who are not already experts in the field, as well as to highlight several examples
in which branch conversion scattering and Andreev bound states provide unique signatures in the
transport properties of inhomogeneous, topological and unconventional superconductors.
