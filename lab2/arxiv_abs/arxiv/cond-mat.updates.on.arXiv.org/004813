Accurately modeling the electronic structure of materials is a persistent challenge to high-throughput
screening. A promising means of balancing accuracy against computational cost are non-self-consistent
calculations with hybrid density-functional theory, where the electronic band energies are evaluated
using a hybrid functional from orbitals obtained with a less demanding (semi-)local functional.
We have quantified the performance of this technique for predicting the physical properties of
sixteen tetrahedral semiconductors with bandgaps from 0.2-5.5 eV. Provided the base functional
predicts a non-metallic electronic structure, bandgaps within 5 % of the PBE0 and HSE06 gaps can
be obtained with an order of magnitude reduction in computing time. The positions of the valence
and conduction band extrema and the Fermi level are well reproduced, further enabling calculation
of the band dispersion, density of states, and dielectric properties using Fermi's Golden Rule.
While the error in the non-self-consistent total energies is ~50 meV atom-1, the energy-volume
curves are reproduced accurately enough to obtain the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus with
minimal error. We also test the dielectric-dependent scPBE0 functional and obtain bandgaps and
dielectric constants to within 2.5 % of the self-consistent results, which amount to a significant
improvement over self-consistent PBE0 for a similar computational cost. We identify cases where
the non-self-consistent approach is expected to perform poorly, and demonstrate that partial
self-consistency provides a practical and efficient workaround. Finally, we perform proof-of-concept
calculations on CoO and NiO to demonstrate the applicability of the technique to strongly-correlated
open-shell transition-metal oxides.
