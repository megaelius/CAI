Recently, we have revealed an intrinsic instability of metals due to surface plasma waves (SPWs)
and raised the prospect of using it to create lossless SPWs. The counter-intuitive nature of this
finding prompts one to ask, why had not this instability been disclosed before, given the long history
of this subject? If this instability does exist, how far is it from reality? The present work is devoted
to answering these questions. To this end, we derive a unified macroscopic theory of SPWs that applies
to any type of electron dynamics, be they local or non-local, classical or quantum-mechanical.
In light of this theory, we analyze the behaviors of SPWs according to several electron dynamics
models, including the widely used local dielectric model (DM), the hydrodynamic model (HDM) and
the specular reflection model (SRM), in addition to the less common semi-classical model (SCM).
We find that, in order to unveil the instability, one must (i) self-consistently treat surface effects
without any of the usually imposed auxiliary conditions and (ii) include translation symmetry
breaking effects in electron dynamics. As far as we are concerned, none existing work had fulfilled
both (i) and (ii). To assess the possibility of realizing the instability, we analyze two very important
factors: the dielectric interfacing the metal and inter-band transitions, which both were ignored
in our recent work. Whereas inter-band absorption -- together with Landau damping -- is shown adverse
to the instability, a dielectric brings it closer to occurrence. One may even attain it in common
plasmonic materials such as silver under not so tough conditions.
