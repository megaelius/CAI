Weyl semimetals display a novel topological phase of matter where the Weyl nodes emerge in pairs
of opposite chirality and can be seen as either a source or a sink of Berry curvature. The exotic effects
in Weyl semimetals, such as surface Fermi arcs and the chiral anomaly, make them a new playground
for exploring novel functionalities. Further exploiting their potential applications requires
clear understanding of their topological electronic properties, such as Weyl points and Fermi
arcs. Here we report a Fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy (FT-STS) study on a type-II
Weyl semimetal candidate MoTe$_2$ whose Weyl points are predicated to be located above Fermi level.
Although its electronic structure below the Fermi level have been identified by angle resolved
photo emission spectroscopy (ARPES), by comparing our experimental data with first-principles
calculations, we are able to identify the origins of the multiple scattering channels at energies
both below and above Fermi level. Our calculations also show the existence of both trivial and topological
arc like states above the Fermi energy. In the FT-STS experiments, we have observed strong signals
from intra-arc scatterings as well as from the scattering between the arc-like surface states and
the projected bulk states. A detailed comparison between our experimental observations and calculated
results reveals the trivial and non-trivial scattering channels are difficult to distinguish
in this compound. Interestingly, we find that the broken inversion symmetry changes the terminating
states on the two inequivalent surfaces, which in turn changes the relative strength of the scattering
channels observed in the FT-STS images on the two surfaces.
