A stopping time $T$ is the first time when a trajectory of a stochastic process satisfies a specific
criterion. In this paper, we use martingale theory to derive the integral fluctuation relation
$\langle e^{-S_{\rm tot}(T)}\rangle=1$ for the stochastic entropy production $S_{\rm tot}$
at stopping times $T$ of a nonequilibrium stationary physical system. This fluctuation relation
implies the second law of thermodynamics at stopping times $\langle S_{\rm tot}(T)\rangle\geq
0$: it is not possible to reduce entropy on average, even by stopping a stochastic process at a stopping
time. The second law at stopping times implies bounds for the average amount of heat and work a system
can extract from its environment when stopped at a stopping time. Furthermore, the integral fluctuation
relation implies that certain fluctuations of entropy production are universal or are bounded
by universal functions. These universal properties descend from the integral fluctuation relation
by choosing appropriate stopping times; for example, we bound the statistics of negative records
of entropy production. We illustrate these results with simple models of nonequilibrium systems
described by Langevin equations. Using simulation results we demonstrate that, although mesoscopic
systems can extract heat from an isothermal environment when stopped at a cleverly chosen moment,
the average extracted heat is bounded by the second law at stopping times. Analogously, although
stationary stochastic heat engines, such as Feynman's ratchet, can reach average efficiencies
above the Carnot limit when stopped at an intelligently chosen moment, the average efficiency is
bounded by the second law of thermodynamics at stopping times.
