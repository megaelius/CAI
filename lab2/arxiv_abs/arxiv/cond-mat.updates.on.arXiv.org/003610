We present a predictive local field theory for the nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting active
Brownian particles with a spherical shape in two spatial dimensions. The theory is derived by a rigorous
coarse-graining starting from the Langevin equations that describe the trajectories of the individual
particles. For maximal accuracy and generality of the theory, it includes configurational order
parameters and derivatives up to infinite order. In addition, we discuss possible approximations
of the theory and present reduced models that are easier to apply. We show that our theory contains
popular models such as Active Model B + as special cases and that it provides explicit expressions
for the coefficients occurring in these and other, often phenomenological, models. As a further
outcome, the theory yields an analytical expression for the density-dependent mean swimming speed
of the particles. To demonstrate an application of the new theory, we analyze a simple reduced model
of the lowest nontrivial order in derivatives, which is able to predict the onset of motility-induced
phase separation of the particles. By a linear stability analysis, an analytical expression for
the spinodal corresponding to motility-induced phase separation is obtained. This expression
is evaluated for the case of particles interacting repulsively by a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson potential.
The analytical predictions for the spinodal associated with these particles are found to be in very
good agreement with the results of Brownian dynamics simulations that are based on the same Langevin
equations as our theory. Furthermore, the critical point predicted by our analytical results agrees
excellently with recent computational results from the literature.
