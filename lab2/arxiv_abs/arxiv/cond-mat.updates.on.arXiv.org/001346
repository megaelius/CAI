This report aims at covering the overlap between ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter in the
context of the BCS-BEC crossover. The BCS-BEC crossover has recently been realized experimentally,
and essentially in all of its aspects, with ultra-cold Fermi gases. This realization, in turn, has
raised the interest of the nuclear physics community in the crossover problem, since it represents
an unprecedented tool to test fundamental and unanswered questions of nuclear many-body theory.
Here, we focus on the several aspects of the BCS-BEC crossover, which are of broad joint interest
to both ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter, and which will likely help to solve in the future
some open problems in nuclear physics (concerning, for instance, neutron stars). Similarities
and differences occurring in ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter will then be emphasized,
not only about the relative phenomenologies but also about the theoretical approaches to be used
in the two contexts. After an introduction to present the key concepts of the BCS-BEC crossover,
this report discusses the mean-field treatment of the superfluid phase, both for homogeneous and
inhomogeneous systems, as well as for symmetric (spin- or isospin-balanced) and asymmetric (spin-
or isospin-imbalanced) matter. Pairing fluctuations in the normal phase are then considered,
with their manifestations in thermodynamic and dynamic quantities. The last two Sections provide
a more specialized discussion of the BCS-BEC crossover in ultra-cold Fermi gases and nuclear matter,
respectively. The separate discussion in the two contexts aims at cross communicating to both communities
topics and aspects which, albeit arising in one of the two fields, share a strong common interest.
