Nanoparticle monolayer sheets are ultrathin inorganic-organic hybrid materials that combine
highly controllable optical and electrical properties with mechanical flexibility and remarkable
strength. Like other thin sheets, their low bending rigidity allows them to easily roll into or conform
to cylindrical geometries. Nanoparticle monolayers not only can bend, but also cope with strain
through local particle rearrangement and plastic deformation. This means that, unlike thin sheets
such as paper or graphene, nanoparticle sheets can much more easily conform to surfaces with complex
topography characterized by non-zero Gaussian curvature, like spherical caps or saddles. Here,
we investigate the limits of nanoparticle monolayers' ability to conform to substrates with Gaussian
curvature by stamping nanoparticle sheets onto lattices of larger polystyrene spheres. Tuning
the local Gaussian curvature by increasing the size of the substrate spheres, we find that the stamped
sheet morphology evolves through three characteristic stages: from full substrate coverage,
where the sheet extends over the interstices in the lattice, to coverage in the form of caps that conform
tightly to the top portion of each sphere and fracture at larger polar angles, to caps that exhibit
radial folds. Through analysis of the nanoparticle positions, obtained from scanning electron
micrographs, we extract the local strain tensor and track the onset of strain-induced dislocations
in the particle arrangement. By considering the interplay of energies for elastic and plastic deformations
and adhesion, we construct arguments that capture the observed changes in sheet morphology as Gaussian
curvature is tuned over two orders of magnitude.
