We present a systematic study of shape controlled domain reversal phenomenon in patterned Nickel
and Permalloy thin films for thickness lying in the Neel and Bloch regime. The films were patterned
with continuous stripes of varying aspect ratios using photo-lithography. MOKE measurements
and Kerr microscopy have been done in longitudinal arrangement for magnetic fields applied along
the length and the width of the stripes. For magnetic fields applied along the length of the stripes,
domain reversal phenomenon resulted in propagation of domains from one stripe to another for both
Neel and Bloch regime of Ni and Py thin films. Similarly, for magnetic fields applied along the width
of the stripes, stripe domains along with multiple domain walls were observed during the magnetization
reversal in Neel as well as Bloch regime of Ni and Py thin films. We observed a decrease in domain width
and an increase in domain wall density as one goes from Neel regime to Bloch regime for both Ni and Py
films. The comparison of domain reversal in Ni and Py stripes shows that the domains switch gradually
in Ni compared to Py thin films. Shape anisotropy was found to be the dominant factor to determine
the domain reversal mechanism in all cases. It was noticed that the effect of shape anisotropy increases
as the aspect ratio is increased. Micromagnetic OOMMF simulations were also done to support the
experimental data. Furthermore, we have shown that the coercive fields can be tuned by varying the
aspect ratios of the patterned structures. The ability to control the magnetization reversal and
domain wall density in these patterned structures is a key to various applications of spintronics.
