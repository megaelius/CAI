We aim to investigate relationships between select processing parameters or inputs (composition,
temperature, annealing time) and two structural parameters, specifically, the mean radius and
volume fraction of the Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals. To this end, we have deviced a combined CALPHAD and
machine learning approach that led to well-calibrated metamodels able to predict structural parameters
quickly and accurately for any desired inputs. In order to generate data for the mean radius and volume
fraction of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals, we have used a precipitation model based in the software Thermocalc
to perform annealing simulations at a set of temperatures (490-550~\degree C) and for varying Fe
and Si concentrations (Fe$_{72.89 +x}$Si$_{16.21-x}$B$_{6.90}$Nb$_{3}$Cu$_{1}$, $-3\leq
x \leq 3$ atomic \%). Thereafter, we used the data to develop metamodels for the mean radius and volume
fraction via the \emph{k}-Nearest Neighbour algorithm. The metamodels are shown to reproduce
closely the trends obtained from the precipitation model over the entire annealing timescale.
Our further analysis via parallel coordinate charts shows the effect of composition, temperature,
and annealing time, and helps identify combinations thereof that lead to the desired mean radius
and volume fraction for the nanocrystalline phase. This approach utilizes experimental (thermodynamic
and kinetic) databases from the CALPHAD approach so as to capture the physics of nucleation and growth,
while the machine learning algorithm provides the robustness needed to analyze the effects of processing
parameters for this complex precipitation problem. This work contributes to understanding the
linkages between processing parameters and desired microstructural characteristics (crystal
size and volume fraction) responsible for achieving targeted properties, and illustrates ways
to reduce the time from alloy discovery to deployment.
