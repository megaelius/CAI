The protected electron states at the boundaries or on the surfaces of topological insulators (TIs)
have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigations. Such states are
enforced by very strong spin-orbit interaction in solids composed of heavy elements. Here, we study
the composite particles -- chiral excitons -- formed by the Coulomb attraction between electrons
and holes residing on the surface of an archetypical three-dimensional topological insulator
(TI), Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Photoluminescence (PL) emission arising due to recombination of excitons
in conventional semiconductors is usually unpolarized because of scattering by phonons and other
degrees of freedom during exciton thermalization. On the contrary, we observe almost perfectly
polarization-preserving PL emission from chiral excitons. We demonstrate that the chiral excitons
can be optically oriented with circularly polarized light in a broad range of excitation energies,
even when the latter deviate from the (apparent) optical band gap by hundreds of meVs, and that the
orientation remains preserved even at room temperature. Based on the dependences of the PL spectra
on the energy and polarization of incident photons, we propose that chiral excitons are made from
massive holes and massless (Dirac) electrons, both with chiral spin textures enforced by strong
spin-orbit coupling. A theoretical model based on such proposal describes quantitatively the
experimental observations. The optical orientation of composite particles, the chiral excitons,
emerges as a general result of strong spin-orbit coupling in a 2D electron system. Our findings can
potentially expand applications of TIs in photonics and optoelectronics.
