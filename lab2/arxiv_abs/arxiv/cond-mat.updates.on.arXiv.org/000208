Shape anisotropy of colloidal nanoparticles has emerged as an important design variable for engineering
assemblies with targeted structure and properties. In particular, a number of polyhedral nanoparticles
have been shown to exhibit a rich phase behavior [Agarwal et al., Nature Materials, 2011, 10, 230].
Since real synthesized particles have polydispersity not only in size but also in shape, we explore
here the phase behavior of binary mixtures of hard convex polyhedra having similar sizes but different
shapes. Choosing representative particle shapes from those readily synthesizable, we study in
particular four mixtures: (i) cubes and spheres (with spheres providing a non-polyhedral reference
case), (ii) cubes and truncated octahedra, (iii) cubes and cuboctahedra, and (iv) cuboctahedra
and truncated octahedra. The phase behavior of such mixtures is dependent on the interplay of mixing
and packing entropy, which can give rise to miscible or phase-separated states. The extent of mixing
of two such particle types is expected to depend on the degree of shape similarity, relative sizes,
composition, and compatibility of the crystal structures formed by the pure components. While
expectedly the binary systems studied exhibit phase separation at high pressures due to the incompatible
pure-component crystal structures, our study shows that the essential qualitative trends in miscibility
and phase separation can be correlated to properties of the pure components, such as the relative
values of the order-disorder transition pressure (ODP) of each component. Specifically, if for
a mixture A+B we have that ODP_B <ODP_A and \Delta ODP = ODP_A - ODP_B, then at any particular pressure
where phase separation occurs, the larger the \Delta ODP the lower the solubility of A in the B-rich
ordered phase and the higher the solubility of B in the A-rich ordered phase.
