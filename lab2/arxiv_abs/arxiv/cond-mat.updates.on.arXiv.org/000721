A broad applicability multiscale approach to the reconstruction of multiphase materials including
porous ones is reported. We devised a method that uses overall entropic descriptors (EDs). For a
binary pattern, they quantify spatial inhomogeneity and statistical complexity. The EDs extract
structural information that is complementary to that given by correlation functions. When applied
to a 3D sample, the needed information provides a single cross-section. The suitable entropic cost
function can be easily defined. It was found that the reconstructing procedure is significantly
boosted when we start from the synthetic 3D configuration generated by the randomly overlapping
spheres of an empirically selected radius. The simulating annealing (SA) results suggest the entropy
method offers a kind of compromise between the computational efficiency and the accuracy of reconstructions.
Other option is the low-cost approximate reconstructing of entire 3D porous medium. Then, the modified
entropy approach uses neither the input cross-section image nor the SA algorithm. The needed information
contains the ED-curve related to the input tomography 3D image. The second trial ED-curve corresponds
to a quick synthetic 3D configuration. In A-approach, it is generated by interpenetrating spheres
(for ceramics and carbonate samples) while in the B, the overlapping super-spheres (for sandstone
sample) appear and the so-called phase entropic descriptors are used. The both of them use a radius
determined from the recently uncovered two-exponent power-law (TEPL). Furthermore, the usage
of the super-sphere deformation parameter allows controlling the phase inhomogeneity of prototypical
microstructures. The latter approach can be extended for multiphase media.
