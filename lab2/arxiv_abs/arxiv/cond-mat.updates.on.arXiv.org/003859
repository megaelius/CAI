Features of low dimensional magnetism resulting from a square-net arrangement of Co atoms in trirutile
CoTa$_2$O$_6$ is studied in the present work by means of density functional theory and is compared
with the experimental results of specific heat and neutron diffraction. The small total energy
differences between the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration of CoTa$_2$O$_6$
shows that competing magnetic ground states exist, with the possibility of transition from FM to
AFM phase at low temperature. Our calculation further suggests the semi-conducting behavior for
CoTa$_2$O$_6$ with a band gap of $\sim$0.41 eV. The calculated magnetic anisotropy energy is $\sim$2.5
meV with its easy axis along the [100] (in-plane) direction. Studying the evolution of magnetism
in Co$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$Ta$_2$O$_6$ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1). it is found that the sharp AFM transition
exhibited by CoTa$_2$O$_6$ at $T_N$ = 6.2 K in its heat capacity vanishes with Mg-dilution, indicating
the obvious effect of weakening the superexchange pathways of Co. The current specific heat study
reveals the robust nature of $T_N$ for CoTa$_2$O$_6$ in applied magnetic fields. Clear indication
of short-range magnetism is obtained from the magnetic entropy, however, diffuse components are
absent in neutron diffraction data. At $T_N$, CoTa$_2$O$_6$ enters a long-range ordered magnetic
state which can be described using a propagation vector, (1/4, 1/4, 0). Upon Mg-dilution at $x \geq$0.1,
the long-range ordered magnetism is destroyed. The present results should motivate an investigation
of magnetic excitations in this low-dimensional anisotropic magnet.
