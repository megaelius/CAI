When the magnetic field has a parallel component to the current density ${\bf J}$ there appear force-free
effects due to flux cutting and crossing. This results in an anisotropic ${\bf E}({\bf J})$ relation,
being ${\bf E}$ the electric field. Understanding force-free effects is interesting not only for
the design of superconducting power and magnet applications but also for material characterization.
This work develops and applies a fast and accurate computer modeling method based on a variational
approach that can handle force-free anisotropic ${\bf E}({\bf J})$ relations and perform fully
three dimensional (3D) calculations. We present a systematic study of force-free effects in rectangular
thin films and prisms with several finite thicknesses under applied magnetic fields with arbitrary
angle $\theta$ with the surface. The results are compared with the same situation with isotropic
${\bf E}({\bf J})$ relation. The thin film situation shows gradual critical current density penetration
and a general increase of the magnitude of the magnetization with the angle $\theta$ but a minimum
at the remnant state of the magnetization loop. The prism model presents current paths with 3D bending
for all angles $\theta$. The average current density over the thickness agrees very well with the
thin film model except for the highest angles. The prism hysteresis loops reveal a peak after the
remnant state, which is due to the parallel component of the self-magnetic-field and is implicitly
neglected for thin films. The presented numerical method shows the capability to take force-free
situations into account for general 3D situations with a high number of degrees of freedom. The results
reveal new features of force-free effects in thin films and prisms.
