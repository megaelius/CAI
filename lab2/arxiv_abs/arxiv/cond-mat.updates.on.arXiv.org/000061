Experiments on the fractional quantized Hall effect in the zeroth Landau level of graphene have
revealed some striking differences between filling factors in the ranges 0<|\nu|<1 and
1<|\nu|<2. We argue that these differences can be largely understood as a consequence of
the effects of terms in the Hamiltonian which break SU(2) valley symmetry, which we find to be important
for |\nu|<1 but negligible for |\nu| >1. The effective absence of valley anisotropy for |\nu|>1
means that states with odd numerator, e.g. |\nu|=5/3 or 7/5 can accommodate charged excitations
in the form of large valley skyrmions, which have a low energy cost, and may be easily induced by coupling
to impurities. The absence of observed quantum Hall states at these fractions is likely due to the
effects of valley skyrmions. For |\nu|<1, the anisotropy terms favor phases in which electrons
occupy states with opposite spins, similar to the antiferromagnetic state previously hypothesized
to be the ground state at \nu=0. The anisotropy and Zeeman energies suppress large-area skyrmions,
so that quantized Hall states can be observable at a set of fractions similar to those in GaAs two-dimensional
electron systems. In a perpendicular magnetic field B, the competition between the Coulomb energy,
which varies as B^{1/2}, and the Zeeman energy, which varies as B, can explain the observation of
apparent phase transitions as a function of B for fixed \nu, as transitions between states with different
degrees of spin polarization. In addition to an analysis of various fractional states, and an examination
of the effects of disorder on valley skyrmions, we present new experimental data for the energy gaps
at integer fillings \nu=0 and \nu= -1, as a function of magnetic field, and we examine the possibility
that valley-skyrmions may account for the smaller energy gaps observed at \nu= -1.
