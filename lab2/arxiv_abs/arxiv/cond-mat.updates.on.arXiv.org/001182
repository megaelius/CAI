The particle-hole (PH) symmetry at half-filled Landau level requires the relationship between
the flux number N_phi and the particle number N on a sphere to be exactly N_phi - 2(N-1) = 1. The wave
functions of composite fermions with 1/2 "orbital spin", which contributes to the shift "1" in the
N_phi and N relationship, are proposed, shown to be PH symmetric, and validated with exact finite
system results. It is shown the many-body composite electron and composite hole wave functions
at half-filling can be formed from the two components of the same spinor wave function of a massless
Dirac fermion at zero-magnetic field. It is further shown that away from half-filling, the many-body
composite electron wave function at filling factor nu and its PH conjugated composite hole wave
function at 1-nu can be formed from the two components of the very same spinor wave functions of a massless
Dirac fermion at non-zero magnetic field. This relationship leads to the proposal of a very simple
Dirac composite fermion effective field theory, where the two-component Dirac fermion field is
a particle-hole spinor field coupled to the same emergent gauge field, with one field component
describing the composite electrons and the other describing the PH conjugated composite holes.
As such, the density of the Dirac spinor field is the density sum of the composite electron and hole
field components, and therefore is equal to the degeneracy of the Lowest Landau level. On the other
hand, the charge density coupled to the external magnetic field is the density difference between
the composite electron and hole field components, and is therefore neutral at exactly half-filling.
It is shown that the proposed particle-hole spinor effective field theory gives essentially the
same electromagnetic responses as Son's Dirac composite fermion theory does.
