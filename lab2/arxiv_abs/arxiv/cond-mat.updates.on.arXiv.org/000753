We investigate the influence of viscoelastic nature of the adhesive on the intermittent peel front
dynamics by extending a recently introduced model for peeling of an adhesive tape. As time and rate-dependent
deformation of the adhesives are measured in stationary conditions, a crucial step in incorporating
the viscoelastic effects applicable to unstable intermittent peel dynamics is the introduction
of a dynamization scheme that eliminates the explicit time dependence in terms of dynamical variables.
We find contrasting influences of viscoelastic contribution in different regions of tape mass,
roller inertia, and pull velocity. As the model acoustic energy dissipated depends on the nature
of the peel front and its dynamical evolution, the combined effect of the roller inertia and pull
velocity makes the acoustic energy noisier for small tape mass and low-pull velocity while it is
burstlike for low-tape mass, intermediate values of the roller inertia and high-pull velocity.
The changes are quantified by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent and analyzing the statistical
distributions of the amplitudes and durations of the model acoustic energy signals. Both single
and two stage power-law distributions are observed. Scaling relations between the exponents are
derived which show that the exponents corresponding to large values of event sizes and durations
are completely determined by those for small values. The scaling relations are found to be satisfied
in all cases studied. Interestingly, we find only five types of model acoustic emission signals
among multitude of possibilities of the peel front configurations.
