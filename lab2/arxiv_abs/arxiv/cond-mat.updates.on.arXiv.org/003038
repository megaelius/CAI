Many people rely on online social networks as sources for news and information, and the spread of
media content with ideologies across the political spectrum both influences online discussions
and impacts actions offline. To examine such phenomena, we generalize bounded-confidence models
of opinion dynamics on a social network by incorporating media accounts as influencers. We quantify
partisanship of content as a continuous parameter on an interval, and we present higher-dimensional
generalizations to incorporate content quality and increasingly nuanced political positions.
We simulate our model with one and two ideological dimensions, and we use the results of our simulations
to quantify the "entrainment" of non-media account content to the ideologies of media accounts
in networks. We maximize media impact over a social network by tuning the number of media accounts
that promote the content and the number of followers of the accounts. From our numerical computations,
we find that the entrainment of the ideology of content spread by non-media accounts to media ideology
depends on structural features of networks, such as size, mean number of followers, and the receptiveness
of nodes to different opinions. We then introduce content quality --- a key novel contribution of
our work --- into our model. We incorporate multiple media sources with ideological biases and quality-level
estimates that we draw from real media sources and demonstrate that our model can produce distinct
communities ("echo chambers") that are polarized in both ideology and quality. Our model provides
a step toward understanding content quality and ideology in spreading dynamics, with ramifications
for how to mitigate the spread of undesired content and promote the spread of desired content.
