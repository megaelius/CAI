The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) - the generation of a transverse electric voltage by a longitudinal
heat current in conducting ferromagnets or antiferromagnets - is an appealing approach for thermoelectric
power generation in spin caloritronics. The ANE in antiferromagnets is particularly convenient
for the fabrication of highly efficient and densely integrated thermopiles as lateral configurations
of thermoelectric modules increase the coverage of heat source without suffering from the stray
fields that are intrinsic to ferromagnets. In this work, using first-principles calculations
together with a group theory analysis, we systematically investigate the spin order-dependent
ANE in noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn-based antiperovskite nitrides Mn$_{3}X$N ($X$ = Ga,
Zn, Ag, and Ni). The ANE in Mn$_{3}X$N is forbidden by symmetry in the R1 phase but amounts to its maximum
value in the R3 phase. Among all Mn$_{3}X$N compounds, Mn$_{3}$NiN presents the most significant
anomalous Nernst conductivity of 1.80 AK$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ at 200 K, which can be further enhanced
if strain, electric, or magnetic fields are applied. The ANE in Mn$_{3}$NiN, being one order of magnitude
larger than that in the famous Mn$_{3}$Sn, is the largest one discovered in antiferromagnets so
far. The giant ANE in Mn$_{3}$NiN originates from the sharp slope of the anomalous Hall conductivity
at the Fermi energy, which can be understood well from the Mott relation. Our findings provide a novel
host material for realizing antiferromagnetic spin caloritronics which promises exciting applications
in energy conversion and information processing.
