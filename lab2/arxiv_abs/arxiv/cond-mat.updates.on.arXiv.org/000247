A fundamental prediction of quantum theory that is derived from the "projection postulate" is that
under continuous measurement, the state of a system traces out a "quantum trajectory" in time that
depends upon its measurement record, and that in certain situations, the quantum state of a system
stochastically collapses at a finite rate toward a random eigenstate. On the other hand, quantum
theory also predicts that environmental coupling produces the opposite effect of spreading the
wave function into a mixed state. Studying the effect of these two competing processes, as the ratio
of their strengths is varied, on the distribution of a quantum state is of fundamental interest in
any setting, but especially so in the mechanical realm. A key issue, however, is that a fundamental
study of such physics can not entail an a priori assumption of the projection postulate itself, and
Bayesian inference may therefore not be employed to observe the quantum state. In this theoretical
work we propose a feasible way to perform such a fundamental test with a mechanical wave function
in the energy eigenbasis. The scheme is based on an optomechanical setup wherein optical fields
provide a direct probe of the energy variance of the mechanical wave function. Such an energy variance
probe is unprecedented in any type of system. Numerical simulations that incorporate the projection
postulate predict a monotonic decrease in the time-averaged energy variance as the ratio of continuous
measurement strength to dissipation is increased. The measurement strength in the proposed scheme
is tunable in situ, and the behavior predicted by the simulations therefore implies that the scheme
amounts to a way to verifiably control in situ the time-averaged variance of a mechanical wave function
over the course of a single quantum trajectory.
