Fitted interatomic potentials are widely used in atomistic simulations thanks to their ability
to compute the energy and forces on atoms quickly. However, the simulation results crucially depend
on the quality of the potential being used. Force matching is a method aimed at constructing reliable
and transferable interatomic potentials by matching the forces computed by the potential as closely
as possible, with those obtained from first principles calculations. The potfit program is an implementation
of the force-matching method that optimizes the potential parameters using a global minimization
algorithm followed by a local minimization polish. We extended potfit in two ways. First, we adapted
the code to be compliant with the KIM Application Programming Interface (API) standard (part of
the Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models Project). This makes it possible to use potfit to fit many
KIM potential models, not just those prebuilt into the potfit code. Second, we incorporated the
geodesic Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) minimization algorithm into potfit as a new local minimization
algorithm. The extended potfit was tested by generating a training set using the KIM Environment-Dependent
Interatomic Potential (EDIP) model for silicon and using potfit to recover the potential parameters
from different initial guesses. The results show that EDIP is a "sloppy model" in the sense that its
predictions are insensitive to some of its parameters, which makes fitting more difficult. We find
that the geodesic LM algorithm is particularly efficient for this case. The extended potfit code
is the first step in developing a KIM-based fitting framework for interatomic potentials for bulk
and two dimensional materials. The code is available for download via https://www.potfit.net.
