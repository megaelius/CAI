In this paper, we first identify the plaquette-centered rotation symmetry $C_{4}^{p}$, which
is found to stabilize the Fermi-surface structure of Fe-based superconductors. Together with
the $S_{4}$ symmetry previously found by Hu and Hao (Phys. Rev. X 2, 021009 (2012)), we are able to
solve the puzzle of pairing symmetry of superconductivity in $\text{KFe}_{2}\text{As}_{2}$
in a simple but comprehensive way. By modeling the material with a strong coupling $t-J_{1}-J_{2}$
model, we find phase transitions of pairing symmetry driven by the competition between the local
spin antiferromagnetic couplings from nodal $d\times s$-wave to nodeless $s_{\pm}$-wave through
a narrow intermediate $s_{\pm}+id\times s$ mixed pairing phase, in consistent with the pressure
experiment conducted by Taillefer's group (Nature Physics 9, 349 (2013)). While the hole Fermi
pockets around the Brillouin zone center usually give rise to nodeless $s$-wave Cooper pairing,
the emergent $d$-wave form factor arises from the projection of inter-orbital Cooper pairing onto
the Fermi surface determined by the $C_{4}^{p}$ symmetry. Moreover, the $S_{4}$ symmetry dictates
2 copies of $d$-wave pairing condensates, counting 8 nodes in total. We further show that weakly
breaking $C_{4}^{p}$ naturally leads to the octet nodal gap as precisely observed in laser angle
resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Neither accidental nor due to high angular momentum of Cooper
pairs, the octet nodes can be attributed to a symbolic equation "$8=4+4$", which reflects the interplay
between the $C_{4}^{p}$ and $S_{4}$ symmetries and sheds new light on the enigma of the pairing symmetry
in $\text{KFe}_{2}\text{As}_{2}$.
