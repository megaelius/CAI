We present a unified framework for the renormalisation of the Hamiltonian and eigenbasis of a system
of correlated electrons, unveiling thereby the interplay between electronic correlations and
many-particle entanglement. For this, we extend substantially the unitary renormalization group
(URG) scheme introduced in Refs.[1-3]. We recast the RG as a discrete flow of the Hamiltonian tensor
network, i.e., the collection of various $2n$-point scattering vertex tensors comprising the
Hamiltonian. The renormalisation progresses via unitary transformations that block diagonalizes
the Hamiltonian iteratively via the disentanglement of single-particle eigenstates. This procedure
incorporates naturally the role of quantum fluctuations. The interplay between various UV energy
scales enables the coupled RG equations to flow towards a stable fixed point in the IR. Importantly,
the vertex tensor network is observed to govern the RG flow of the tensor network that denotes the
coefficients of the many-particle eigenstates. The RG evolution of various many-particle entanglement
features of the eigenbasis are, in turn, quantified through the coefficient tensor network. In
this way, we show that the URG framework provides a microscopic understanding of holographic renormalisation:
the RG flow of the vertex tensor network generates a eigenstate coefficient tensor network possessing
a many-particle entanglement metric. We find that the eigenstate tensor network accommodates
sign factors arising from fermion exchanges, and that the IR fixed point reached generically involves
a trivialisation of the fermion sign factor. Several results are presented for the emergence of
composite excitations in the neighbourhood of a gapless Fermi surface, as well as for the condensation
phenomenon involving the gapping of the Fermi surface.
