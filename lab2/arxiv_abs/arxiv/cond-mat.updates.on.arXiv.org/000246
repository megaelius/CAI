Use of 2G HTS coated conductors in several power applications has become popular in recent years.
Their large current density under high magnetic fields makes them suitable candidates for high
power capacity applications such as stacks, coils, magnets, cables and current leads. For this
reason, modeling and simulation of their electromagnetic properties is very desirable in the design
and optimization processes. For many applications, when symmetries allow it, simple models consisting
of 1D or 2D representations are well suited for providing a satisfying description of the problem
at hand. However, certain designs such as racetrack coils and finite-length or non-straight stacks,
do pose a 3D problem that cannot be easily reduced to a 2D configuration. Full 3-D models have been
developed, but their use for simulating superconducting devices is a very challenging task involving
a large-scale computational problem. In this work, we present a new method to simulate the electromagnetic
transient behavior of 2G HTS stacks and coils. The method, originally used to model stacks of straight
superconducting tapes or circular coils in 2D, is now extended to 3D. The main idea is to construct
an anisotropic bulklike equivalent for the stack or coil, such that the geometrical layout of the
internal alternating structures of insulating, metallic, superconducting and substrate layers
is reduced while keeping the overall electromagnetic behavior of the original device. Besides
the aforementioned interest in modeling and simulating 2G HTS coated conductors, this work gives
a further step towards efficient 3D modeling and simulation of superconducting devices for large
scale applications.
