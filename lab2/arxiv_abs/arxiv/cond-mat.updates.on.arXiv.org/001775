Within a saddle-point solution for the extended slave-boson scheme, we suggest a transition to
an antiferromagnetic topological insulating phase and study its Z_2 topological classification
with non-topological antiferromagnetic insulator phase in three-dimensional topological Kondo
insulator, which is described by the periodic Anderson model with spin-orbit coupled hybridization
between d and f electrons. In a wide parameter region, as the hybridization strength is reduced,
the ground states undergo a second-order transition to antiferromagnetic insulating states.
Although time-reversal symmetry $\Theta$ is broken, the antiferromagnetic states preserve a
combined symmetry S=\Theta T_D, where T_D is a translation by lattice vector D which inverts the
AF configuration, consequently, the antiferromagnetic states are classified by their Z_2 invariants,
into antiferromagnetic topological insulating phase (AFTI) and non-topological antiferromagnetic
insulating phase (nAF). The magnetic transitions take place either between AFTI and strong topological
insulating phase (STI), or between nAF and weak topological insulating phase (WTI), depending
mainly on the electron hopping amplitudes. By varying certain model parameters under special setting
of electron hopping amplitudes, a topological transition between AFTI and nAF occurs , driven by
closing of bulk gap. By diagonalizing parallel slabs with open boundaries, we find that on the AF-ordered
surfaces of AFTI, there are topologically protected gapless Dirac cones, which exhibit helical
spin texture on the Fermi surfaces, showing weak spin-momentum locking, in agreement with the Z_2
classification of AFTI. Our results may account for the pressure-induced magnetic phase in topological
Kondo insulator SmB_6 and provide a reasonable way to realize an AFTI in heavy-fermion systems.
