Maxwellian ratchets are autonomous, finite-state thermodynamic engines that implement input-output
informational transformations. Previous studies of these "demons" focused on how they exploit
environmental resources to generate work: They randomize ordered inputs, leveraging increased
Shannon entropy to transfer energy from a thermal reservoir to a work reservoir while respecting
both Liouvillian state-space dynamics and the Second Law. However, to date, correctly determining
such functional thermodynamic operating regimes was restricted to a very few engines for which
correlations among their information-bearing degrees of freedom could be calculated exactly
and in closed form---a highly restricted set. Additionally, a key second dimension of ratchet behavior
was largely ignored---ratchets do not merely change the randomness of environmental inputs, their
operation constructs and deconstructs patterns. To address both dimensions, we adapt recent results
from dynamical-systems and ergodic theories that efficiently and accurately calculate the entropy
rates and the rate of statistical complexity divergence of general hidden Markov processes. In
concert with the Information Processing Second Law, these methods accurately determine thermodynamic
operating regimes for finite-state Maxwellian demons with arbitrary numbers of states and transitions.
In addition, they facilitate analyzing structure versus randomness trade-offs that a given engine
makes. The result is a greatly enhanced perspective on the information processing capabilities
of information engines. As an application, we give a thorough-going analysis of the Mandal-Jarzynski
ratchet, demonstrating that it has an uncountably-infinite effective state space.
