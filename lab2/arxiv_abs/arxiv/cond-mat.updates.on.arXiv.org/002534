1T-TaS2 is a layered material that exhibits charge density wave (CDW) induced distinct electrical
resistivity phases and has attracted a lot of attention for interesting device applications. However,
such resistivity switching effects are often weak, and cannot be modulated by an external gate voltage
- limiting their widespread usage. Using a back-gated 1T-TaS2/2H-MoS2 heterojunction, here we
show that the usual resistivity switching in TaS2 due to different phase transitions is accompanied
with a surprisingly strong modulation in the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the TaS2/MoS2 interface
- providing an additional knob to control the degree of the phase-transition-driven resistivity
switching by an external gate voltage. In particular, the commensurate (C) to triclinic (T) phase
transition results in an increase in the SBH owing to a collapse of the Mott gap in TaS2. The change
in SBH allows us to estimate an electrical Mott gap opening of ~71 +/- 7 meV in the C phase of TaS2. On
the other hand, the nearly-commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC) phase transition results
in a suppression in the SBH, and the heterojunction shows a gate-controlled resistivity switching
up to 17.3, which is ~14.5 times higher than that of standalone TaS2. The findings mark an important
step forward showing a promising pathway to externally control as well as amplify the CDW induced
resistivity switching. This will boost device applications that exploit these phase transitions,
such as ultra-broadband photodetection, negative differential conductance, fast oscillator
and threshold switching in neuromorphic circuits.
