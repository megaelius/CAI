In this work, we have studied the structural, elastic, mechanical, electronic, bonding, acoustic,
thermal and optical properties of TaX (X = P, As) in detail via first-principles method using the
density functional theory. A comprehensive study of elastic constants and moduli shows that both
TaP and TaAs possesses low to medium level of elastic anisotropy (depending on the measure), reasonably
good machinability, mixed bonding characteristics with ionic and covalent contributions, brittle
nature and relatively high Vickers hardness with a low Debye temperature and melting temperature.
The minimum thermal conductivities and anisotropies of TaX (X = P, As) are calculated. Bond population
analysis supports the bonding nature as predicted by the elastic parameters. The bulk electronic
band structure calculations reveal clear semi-metallic features with signature Dirac cone-like
dispersions near the Fermi level. A pseudogap in the electronic energy density of states at the Fermi
level separating the bonding and the antibonding states indicates significant electronic stability
of tetragonal TaX (X = P, As). The reflectivity spectra show almost non-selective behavior over
a wide range of photon energy encompassing visible to mid-ultraviolet regions. High reflectivity
over wide spectral range makes TaX suitable as reflecting coating. TaX (X = P, As) are very efficient
absorber of ultraviolet radiation. Both the compounds are moderately optically anisotropic owing
to the anisotropic nature of the electronic band structure. The refractive indices are very high
in the infrared to visible range. All the energy dependent optical parameters show metallic features
and are in complete accord with the underlying bulk electronic density of states calculations.
