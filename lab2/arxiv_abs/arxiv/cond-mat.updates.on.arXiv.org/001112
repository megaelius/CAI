We present a study of the influence of disorder on the Mott metal-insulator transition for the organic
charge-transfer salt $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl. To this end, disorder was introduced
into the system in a controlled way by exposing the single crystals to x-ray irradiation. The crystals
were then fine-tuned across the Mott transition by the application of continuously controllable
He-gas pressure at low temperatures. Measurements of the thermal expansion and resistance show
that the first-order character of the Mott transition prevails for low irradiation doses achieved
by irradiation times up to 100 h. For these crystals with a moderate degree of disorder, we find a first-order
transition line which ends in a second-order critical endpoint, akin to the pristine crystals.
Compared to the latter, however, we observe a significant reduction of both, the critical pressure
$p_c$ and the critical temperature $T_c$. This result is consistent with the theoretically-predicted
formation of a soft Coulomb gap in the presence of strong correlations and small disorder. Furthermore,
we demonstrate, similar to the observation for the pristine sample, that the Mott transition after
50 h of irradiation is accompanied by sizable lattice effects, the critical behavior of which can
be well described by mean-field theory. Our results demonstrate that the character of the Mott transition
remains essentially unchanged at a low disorder level. However, after an irradiation time of 150
h, no clear signatures of a discontinuous metal-insulator transition could be revealed anymore.
These results suggest that, above a certain disorder level, the metal-insulator transition becomes
a smeared first-order transition with some residual hysteresis.
