At mesoscopic scales electrolyte solutions are modeled by the fluctuating generalized Poisson-Nernst-Planck
(PNP) equations [J.-P. P\'eraud et al., Phys. Rev. F, 1(7):074103, 2016]. However, at length and
time scales larger than the Debye scales, electrolytes are effectively electroneutral, and the
charged-fluid PNP equations become too stiff to solve numerically. Here we formulate the isothermal
incompressible equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics for reactive multispecies mixtures involving
charged species in the electroneutral limit, and design a numerical algorithm to solve these equations.
Our model does not assume a dilute electrolyte solution but rather treats all species on an equal
footing, accounting for cross-diffusion and non-ideality using Maxwell-Stefan theory. By enforcing
local electroneutrality as a constraint, we obtain an elliptic equation for the electric potential
that replaces the Poisson equation in the fluctuating PNP equations. We develop a second-order
midpoint predictor-corrector algorithm to solve either the charged-fluid or electroneutral
equations with only a change of the elliptic solver. We use the electroneutral algorithm to study
a gravitational fingering instability, triggered by thermal fluctuations, at an interface where
an acid and base react to neutralize each other. Our results demonstrate that, because the four ions
diffuse with very different coefficients, one must treat each ion as an individual species, and
cannot treat the acid, base, and salt as neutral species. This emphasizes the differences between
electrodiffusion and classical Fickian diffusion, even at electroneutral scales.
