Many properties of solids such as the glass state are commonly treated as nonequilibrium phenomena,
which involve many conceptual difficulties. However, few studies have addressed the problem of
understanding equilibrium itself. Equilibrium is commonly assessed based on the assumption that
its thermodynamic state should be determined solely by temperature and pressure. However, this
assumption must be reappraised from the beginning through a rigorous definition of equilibrium
because no rigorous proof for this assumption exists. Previous work showed that for solids, the
equilibrium positions of all constituent atoms of the solid are state variables (TC). In this study,
this conclusion is further elaborated starting from the principles of solid-state physics. This
theory has been applied to glass materials. Results show that first, the glass state is an equilibrium
state. Accordingly, the properties of a glass can be solely described by the present positions of
the atom, irrespective of their previous history. Second, the glass transition, although a nonequilibrium
phenomenon, is well described using TCs if the thermal part of the energy is be assumed to be well separated
from the structural part. The only dynamic parameter involved in this approach is the relaxation
time, which is uniquely determined using the present values of the TCs. Therefore, complicated
functions describing the past history are unnecessary. This implies that the activation energy
for the structural relaxation strongly depends on TCs. This finding provides a reasonable understanding
of the large deviations from the Arrhenius law. The unrealistic values of the activation energy
and of the pre-exponential factor of the relaxation time can be resolved on this basis. The theory
is particularly suitable for experiments that do not involve hypothetical quantities and models;
therefore, all quantities are measurable.
