Bulk boundary correspondence in topological materials allows to study their bulk topology through
the investigation of their topological boundary modes. However, for classes that share similar
boundary phenomenology, the growing diversity of topological phases may lead to ambiguity in the
topological classification of materials. Such is the current status of bulk bismuth. While some
theoretical models indicate that bismuth possesses a trivial topological nature, other theoretical
and experimental studies suggest non-trivial topological classifications such as a strong or
a higher order topological insulator, both of which hosts helical modes on their boundaries. Here
we use a novel approach to resolve the topological classification of bismuth by spectroscopically
mapping the response of its boundary modes to a topological defect in the form of a screw dislocation
(SD). We find that the edge mode extends over a wide energy range, and withstands crystallographic
irregularities, without showing any signs of backscattering. It seems to bind to the bulk SD, as
expected for a topological insulator (TI) with non-vanishing weak indices. We argue that the small
scale of the bulk energy gap, at the time reversal symmetric momentum $L$, positions bismuth within
the critical region of a topological phase transition to a strong TI with non-vanishing weak indices.
We show that the observed boundary modes are approximately helical already on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$
trivial side of the topological phase transition. This work opens the door for further possibilities
to examine the response of topological phases to crystallographic topological defects, and to
uniquely explore their associated bulk boundary phenomena.
