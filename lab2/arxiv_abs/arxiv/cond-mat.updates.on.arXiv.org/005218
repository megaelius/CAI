We develop a supervised machine learning algorithm that is able to learn topological phases of finite
condensed matter systems from bulk data in real lattice space. The algorithm employs diagonalization
in real space together with any supervised learning algorithm to learn topological phases through
an eigenvector ensembling procedure. We combine our algorithm with decision trees and random forests
to successfully recover topological phase diagrams of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models from
bulk lattice data in real space and show how the Shannon information entropy of ensembles of lattice
eigenvectors can be used to retrieve a signal detailing how topological information is distributed
in the bulk. We further use insights obtained from these information entropy signatures to engineer
global topological features from real space lattice data that still carry most of the topological
information in the lattice, while greatly diminishing the size of feature space, thus effectively
amounting to a topological lattice compression. Finally, we explore the theoretical possibility
of interpreting the information entropy topological signatures in terms of emergent information
entropy wave functions, which lead us to Heisenberg and Hirschman uncertainty relations for topological
phase transitions. The discovery of Shannon information entropy signals associated with topological
phase transitions from the analysis of data from several thousand SSH systems illustrates how model
explainability in machine learning can advance the research of exotic quantum materials with properties
that may power future technological applications such as qubit engineering for quantum computing.
