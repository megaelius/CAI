Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has received great interest in recent years as a wide bandgap analog
of graphene-derived systems. However, the thermal transport properties of h-BN, which can be critical
for device reliability and functionality, are little studied both experimentally and theoretically.
The primary challenge in the experimental measurements of the anisotropic thermal conductivity
of h-BN is that typically sample size of h-BN single crystals is too small for conventional measurement
techniques, as state-of-the-art technologies synthesize h-BN single crystals with lateral sizes
only up to 2.5 mm and thickness up to 200 {\mu}m. Recently developed time-domain thermoreflectance
(TDTR) techniques are suitable to measure the anisotropic thermal conductivity of such small samples,
as it only requires a small area of 50x50 {\mu}m2 for the measurements. Accurate atomistic modeling
of thermal transport in bulk h-BN is also challenging due to the highly anisotropic layered structure.
Here we conduct an integrated experimental and theoretical study on the anisotropic thermal conductivity
of bulk h-BN single crystals over the temperature range of 100 K to 500 K, using TDTR measurements
with multiple modulation frequencies and a full-scale numerical calculation of the phonon Boltzmann
transport equation starting from the first principles. Our experimental and numerical results
compare favorably for both the in-plane and through-plane thermal conductivities. We observe
unusual temperature-dependence and phonon-isotope scattering in the through-plane thermal
conductivity of h-BN and elucidate their origins. This work not only provides an important benchmark
of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of h-BN but also develops fundamental insights into the
nature of phonon transport in this highly anisotropic layered material.
