Experimental Fowler-Nordheim plots taken from orthodoxly behaving carbon nanotube (CNT) field
electron emitters are known to be linear. This shows that, for such emitters, there exists a characteristic
field enhancement factor (FEF) that is constant for a range of applied voltages and applied macroscopic
fields $F_\text{M}$. A constant FEF of this kind can be evaluated for classical CNT emitter models
by finite-element and other methods, but (apparently contrary to experiment) several past quantum-mechanical
(QM) CNT calculations find FEF-values that vary with $F_\text{M}$. A common feature of most such
calculations is that they focus only on deriving the CNT real-charge distributions. Here we report
on calculations that use density functional theory (DFT) to derive real-charge distributions,
and then use these to generate the related induced-charge distributions and related fields and
FEFs. We have analysed three carbon nanostructures involving CNT-like nanoprotrusions of various
lengths, and have also simulated geometrically equivalent classical emitter models, using finite-element
methods. We find that when the DFT-generated local induced FEFs (LIFEFs) are used, the resulting
values are effectively independent of macroscopic field, and behave in the same qualitative manner
as the classical FEF-values. Further, there is fair to good quantitative agreement between a characteristic
FEF determined classically and the equivalent characteristic LIFEF generated via DFT approaches.
Although many issues of detail remain to be explored, this appears to be a significant step forwards
in linking classical and QM theories of CNT electrostatics. It also shows clearly that, for ideal
CNTs, the known experimental constancy of the FEF value for a range of macroscopic fields can also
be found in appropriately developed QM theory.
