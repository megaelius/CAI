The local thermodynamics of a system with long-range interactions in d dimensions is studied using
the mean-field approximation. Long-range interactions are introduced through pair interaction
potentials that decay as a power law in the interparticle distance. We compute the local entropy,
Helmholtz free energy and grand potential per particle in the microcanonical, canonical and grand
canonical ensembles, respectively. The one-particle distribution function approach is also
considered. From the local entropy per particle we obtain the local equation of state of the system
by using the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium. This equation of state turns out to be
the ideal gas equation of state regardless of the pair interaction potential characterizing the
long-range interactions. By volume integration of the relation between the different thermodynamic
potentials at the local level, we find the corresponding equation satisfied by the potentials at
the global level. It is shown that the potential energy enters as a thermodynamic variable which
modifies the global thermodynamic potentials. As a result, we find a generalized Gibbs-Duhem equation
which relates the potential energy to the temperature, pressure and chemical potential. For the
marginal case where the power of the decaying interaction potential is equal to the dimension of
the space, the usual Gibbs-Duhem equation is recovered. As examples of application of this equation,
we consider spatially uniform interaction potentials and the self-gravitating gas. We also point
out a close relationship with the thermodynamics of small systems.
