Modern large network systems normally work in cooperation and incorporate dependencies between
their components for purposes of efficiency and regulation. Such dependencies may become a major
risk since they can cause small scale failures to propagate throughout the system. Thus, the dependent
nodes could be a natural target for malicious attacks that aim to exploit these vulnerabilities.
Here, we consider for the first time a new type of targeted attacks that are based on the dependency
between the networks. We study strategies of attacks that range from dependency-first to dependency-last,
where a fraction $1-p$ of the nodes with dependency links, or nodes without dependency links, respectively,
are initially attacked. We systematically analyze, both analytically and numerically, the percolation
transition of partially interdependent Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) networks, where a fraction
$q$ of the nodes in each network are dependent upon nodes the other network. We find that for a broad
range of dependency strength $q$, `dependency-first' strategy, which intuitively is expected
to increase the system's vulnerability, actually leads to a more stable system, in terms of lower
critical percolation threshold $p_c$, compared with random attacks of the same size. In contrast,
the `dependency-last' strategy leads to a more vulnerable system, i.e., higher $p_c$, compared
with a random attack. By exploring the dynamics of the cascading failures initiated by dependency-based
attacks, we explain this counter-intuitive effect. Our results demonstrate that the most vulnerable
components in a system of interdependent networks are not necessarily the ones that lead to the maximal
immediate impact but those which initiate a cascade of failures with maximal accumulated damage.
