TurboRVB is a computational package for {\it ab initio} Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations of
both molecular and bulk electronic systems. The code implements two types of well established QMC
algorithms: Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and Diffusion Monte Carlo in its robust and efficient
lattice regularized variant. A key feature of the code is the possibility of using strongly correlated
many-body wave functions. The electronic wave function (WF) is obtained by applying a Jastrow factor,
which takes into account dynamical correlations, to the most general mean-field ground state,
written either as an antisymmetrized geminal product with spin-singlet pairing, or as a Pfaffian,
including both singlet and triplet correlations. This wave function can be viewed as an efficient
implementation of the so-called resonating valence bond (RVB) ansatz, first proposed by L. Pauling
and P. W. Anderson in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, respectively. The RVB ansatz
implemented in TurboRVB has a large variational freedom, including the Jastrow correlated Slater
determinant as its simplest, but nontrivial case. Moreover, it has the remarkable advantage of
remaining with an affordable computational cost, proportional to the one spent for the evaluation
of a single Slater determinant. The code implements the adjoint algorithmic differentiation that
enables a very efficient evaluation of energy derivatives, comprising the ionic forces. Thus,
one can perform structural optimizations and molecular dynamics in the canonical NVT ensemble
at the VMC level. For the electronic part, a full WF optimization is made possible thanks to state-of-the-art
stochastic algorithms for energy minimization. The code has been efficiently parallelized by
using a hybrid MPI-OpenMP protocol, that is also an ideal environment for exploiting the computational
power of modern GPU accelerators.
