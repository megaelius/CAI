We review our earlier studies on the order parameter distribution of the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
(SK) model. Through Monte Carlo technique, we investigate the behavior of the order parameter distribution
at finite temperatures. The zero temperature study of the spin glass order parameter distribution
is made by the exact diagonalization method. We find in low-temperature (high-transverse-field)
spin glass region, the tail (extended up to zero value of order parameter) and width of the order parameter
distribution become zero in thermodynamic limit. Such observations clearly suggest the existence
of a low-temperature (high-transverse-field) ergodic region. We also find in high-temperature
(low-transverse-field) spin glass phase the order parameter distribution has nonzero value for
all values of the order parameter even in infinite system size limit, which essentially indicates
the nonergodic behavior of the system. We study the annealing dynamics by the paths which pass through
both ergodic and nonergodic spin glass regions. We find the average annealing time becomes system
size independent for the paths which pass through the quantum-fluctuation-dominated ergodic
spin glass region. In contrast to that, the annealing time becomes strongly system size dependent
for annealing down through the classical-fluctuation-dominated nonergodic spin glass region.
We investigate the behavior of the spin autocorrelation in the spin glass phase. We observe that
the decay rate of autocorrelation towards its equilibrium value is much faster in the ergodic region
with respect to the nonergodic region of the spin glass phase.
