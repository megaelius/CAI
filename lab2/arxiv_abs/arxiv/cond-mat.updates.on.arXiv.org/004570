Raman enhancement techniques are essential for fundamental studies in light-matter interactions
and find widespread application in microelectronics, bio-chemical sensing, and clinical diagnosis.
Two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) are emerging
rapidly as potential platforms for Raman enhancement. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new
technique of Raman enhancement driven by nonradiative energy transfer (NRET) achieving a $10$-fold
enhancement in the Raman intensity in a vertical vdWH comprising of a monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenide (1L-TMD) placed on a multilayer SnSe\tsub2. Consequently, several weak Raman
peaks become visible which are otherwise imperceptible. We also show a strong modulation of the
enhancement factor by tuning the spectral overlap between the 1L-TMD and SnSe\tsub2 through temperature
variation and the results are in remarkable agreement with a Raman polarizability model capturing
the effect of NRET. The observed NRET driven Raman enhancement is a novel mechanism which has not
been experimentally demonstrated thus far and is distinct from conventional surface (SERS), tip
(TERS) or Interference enhanced Raman scattering (IERS) mechanisms that are driven solely by charge
transfer or electric field enhancement. The mechanism can also be used in synergy with plasmonic
nanostructures to achieve additional selectivity and sensitivity beyond hot spot engineering
for applications like molecular detection using 2D/molecular hybrids. Our results open new avenues
for engineering Raman enhancement techniques coupling the advantages of uniform enhancement
accessible across a wide junction area in vertical vdWHs.
