The recent experiment [Y. Wang et al., Science 366, 1125 (2019)] on magnon-mediated spin-transfer
torque (MSTT) was interpreted in terms of a picture where magnons are excited within an antiferromagnetic
insulator (AFI), by applying nonequilibrium electronic spin density at one of its surfaces, so
that their propagation across AFI deprived of conduction electrons eventually leads to reversal
of magnetization of a ferromagnetic metal (FM) attached to the opposite surface of AFI. We employ
a recently developed time-dependent nonequilibrium Green functions combined with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation (TDNEGF+LLG) formalism to evolve electrons quantum-mechanically while they interact
via self-consistent back-action with localized magnetic moments described classically by atomistic
spin dynamics solving a system of LLG equations. Upon injection of square current pulse as the initial
condition, TDNEGF+LLG simulations of FM-polarizer/AFI/FM-analyzer junctions show that reversal
of localized magnetic moments within FM-analyzer is less efficient, in the sense of requiring larger
pulse height and its longer duration, than conventional electron-mediated STT (ESTT) driving
magnetization switching in standard FM-polarizer/normal-metal/FM-analyzer spin valve. Since
both electronic, generated by spin pumping from AFI, and magnonic, generated by direct transmission
from AFI, spin currents are injected into the FM-analyzer, its localized magnetic moments will
experience combined MSTT and ESTT. Nevertheless, we demonstrate, by artificially turning off
ESTT, that MSTT plays a dominant role whose understanding paves the way for all-magnon-driven magnetization
switching devices with no electronic parts.
