We theoretically investigate strong-coupling and finite temperature effects on the p-wave contacts,
as well as the asymptotic behavior of the momentum distribution in large momentum region in a one-component
Fermi gas with a tunable p-wave interaction. Including p-wave pairing fluctuations within a strong-coupling
theory, we calculate the p-wave contacts above the superfluid transition temperature $T_{\rm
c}$ from the adiabatic energy relations. We show that while the p-wave contacts related to the scattering
volume monotonically increases with increasing the interaction strength, one related to the effective
range non-monotonically depends on interaction strength and its sign changes in the intermediate-coupling
regime. The non-monotonic interaction dependence of these quantities is shown to originate from
the competition between the increase of the cutoff momentum and the decrease of the coupling constant
of the p-wave interaction with increasing the effective range. We also analyze the asymptotic form
of the momentum distribution in large momentum region. In contrast to the conventional s-wave case,
we show that the asymptotic behavior cannot be completely described by only the p-wave contacts,
and the extra terms, which is not related to the thermodynamic properties, appear. Furthermore,
in high temperature region, we find that the extra terms dominate the sub-leading term of the large-momentum
distribution. We also directly compare our results with the recent experimental measurement,
by including the effects of a harmonic trap potential within the local density approximation. We
show that our model explains the dependence on the interaction strength of the p-wave contacts.
