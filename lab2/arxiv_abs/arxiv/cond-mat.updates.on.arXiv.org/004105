The geometric, electronic and magnetic properties of silicene-related systems present the diversified
phenomena through the first-principles calculations. The critical factors, the group-IV monoelements,
buckled/planar structures, stacking configurations, layer numbers, and van der Waals interactions
of bilayer composites are taken into account simultaneously. The developed theoretical framework
is responsible for the concise physical and chemical pictures. The delicate evaluations and analyses
are conducted on the optimal lattices, the atom- $\&$ spin-dominated energy bands, the atom-, orbital-
$\&$ spin-projected vanHove singularities, and the magnetic moments. Most importantly, they
achieve the decisive mechanisms, the buckled/planar honeycomb lattices, the multi-/single-orbital
hybridizations, and the significant/negligible spin-orbital couplings. Furthermore, we investigate
the stacking-configuration-induced dramatic transformations of the essential properties by
the relative shift in bilayer graphene and silicene. The lattice constant, interlayer distance,
the buckle height, and the total energy essentially depend on the magnitude and direction of the
relative shift: AA $\rightarrow$ AB $\rightarrow$ AA$^{\prime}$ $\rightarrow$ AA. Apparently,
sliding bilayer systems are quite different between silicene and graphene in terms of electronic
properties, strongly depending on the buckled/planar honeycomb lattices, the multi-/single-orbital
hybridizations, the dominant/observable interlayer hopping integrals, and the significant/negligible
spin interactions. The predicted results can account for the up-to-date experimental measurements.
