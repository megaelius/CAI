Natural hard composites like human bone possess a combination of strength and toughness that exceeds
that of their constituents and of many engineered composites. This augmentation is attributed
to their complex hierarchical structure, spanning multiple length scales; in bone, characteristic
dimensions range from nanoscale fibrils to microscale lamellae to mesoscale osteons and macroscale
organs. The mechanical properties of bone have been studied, with the understanding that the isolated
microstructure at micro- and nano-scales gives rise to superior strength compared to that of whole
tissue, and the tissue possesses an amplified toughness relative to that of its nanoscale constituents.
Nanoscale toughening mechanisms of bone are not adequately understood at sample dimensions that
allow for isolating salient microstructural features, because of the challenge of performing
fracture experiments on small-sized samples. We developed an in-situ three-point bend experimental
methodology that probes site-specific fracture behavior of micron-sized specimens of hard material.
Using this, we quantify crack initiation and growth toughness of human trabecular bone with sharp
fatigue pre-cracks and blunt notches. Our findings indicate that bone with fatigue cracks is two
times tougher than that with blunt cracks. In-situ data-correlated electron microscopy videos
reveal this behavior arises from crack-bridging by nanoscale fibril structure. The results reveal
a transition between fibril-bridging (~1 $\mu$m) and crack deflection/twist (~500 $\mu$m) as
a function of length-scale, and quantitatively demonstrate hierarchy-induced toughening in
a complex material. This versatile approach enables quantifying the relationship between toughness
and microstructure in various complex material systems and provides direct insight for designing
biomimetic composites.
