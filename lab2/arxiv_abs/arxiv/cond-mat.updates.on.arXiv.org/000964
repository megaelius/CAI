In the search for quantum spin liquids, candidate materials for the Kitaev model and its extensions
have been intensively explored during the past decade, as the models realize the exact quantum spin
liquids in the ground state. Thus far, insulating magnets in the low-spin $d^5$ electron configuration
under the strong spin-orbit coupling have been studied for realizing the Kitaev-type bond-dependent
anisotropic interactions between the spin-orbital entangled Kramers doublets. To extend the
candidates, here we investigate the systems in a high-spin $d^7$ electron configuration, whose
ground state is described by the spin-orbital entangled Kramers doublet. By the second- order perturbation
in terms of the $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ and $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hoppings, we show that the effective spin
model possesses the anisotropic Kitaev interactions as well as the isotropic Heisenberg ones.
While the Kitaev interaction is always ferromagnetic, the Heisenberg interaction can become either
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the Coulomb interactions and the crystalline
electric fields. We also derive the effective model for the low-spin $d^5$ electron configuration
within the same perturbation scheme, in which the Kitaev interaction becomes both ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic, while the Heisenberg one always ferromagnetic. Referring to the previous
study for the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that the quantum spin liquid phase exists in the reasonable
parameter region in both $d^7$ and $d^5$ cases, while the former has a richer structure of the phase
diagram. We discuss the advantages of the $d^7$ case in comparison with the $d^5$ case. Our results
indicate that the high-spin $d^7$ state provides another platform for the Kitaev-type quantum
spin liquid.
