Millimeter sized single crystals of Mo3Sb7 are grown using the self-flux technique and a thorough
characterization of their structural, magnetic, thermal and transport properties is reported.
The structure parameters for the high-temperature cubic phase and the low-temperature tetragonal
phase were, for the first time, determined with neutron single crystal diffraction. Both X-ray
powder diffraction and neutron single crystal diffraction at room temperature confirmed that
Mo3Sb7 crystallizes in Ir3Ge7-type cubic structure with space group Im-3m. The cubic-tetragonal
structure transition at 53K is verified by the peak splitting of (4 0 0) reflection observed by X-ray
single crystal diffraction and the dramatic intensity change of (12 0 0) peak observed by neutron
single crystal diffraction. The structural transition is accompanied by a sharp drop in magnetic
susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and thermopower while cooling. A weak lambda anomaly
was also observed around 53K in the temperature dependence of specific heat and the entropy change
across the transition is estimated to be 1.80J/molMoK. The temperature dependence of magnetic
susceptibility was measured up to 750K and it follows a Curie-Weiss behavior above room temperature.
Analysis of the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility suggests a spin gap of 110K around 53K.
A typical phonon thermal conductivity was observed in the low temperature tetragonal phase. A glassy
phonon thermal conductivity above 53K suggests a structural instability in a wide temperature
range. Superconductivity was observed at 2.35K in the as-grown crystals and the dimensionless
specific heat jump was determined to be 1.49, which is slightly larger than the BCS value of 1.43 for
the weak-coupling limit.
