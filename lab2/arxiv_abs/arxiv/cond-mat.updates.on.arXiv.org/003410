The continuous miniaturization of modern electromechanical systems calls for a comprehensive
understanding of the mechanical properties of metallic materials specific to micrometer and sub-micrometer
scales. At these scales, the nature of dislocation-mediated plasticity changes radically: sub-micrometer
metallic samples exhibit high yield strengths, however accompanied by detrimental intermittent
strain fluctuations compromising forming processes and endangering structural stability. In
this paper, we studied the effects of plate-like $\theta^\prime$-Al$_2$Cu precipitates on the
strength, plastic fluctuations and deformation mechanisms of Al-Cu alloys from micro-pillar
compression testing. The plate-like precipitates have diameters commensurate with the external
size of the Al-Cu micro-pillars. Our results show that these plate-like precipitates can strengthen
the materials and suppress plastic fluctuations efficiently at large sample sizes ($\geq 3 \mu
m$). However, the breakdown of the mean-field pinning landscape at smaller scales weakens its taming
effect on intermittency. Over an intermediate range of sample sizes allowing the precipitates
to cross the entire pillar, an enhanced apparent strain hardening and a sharp decrease of jerkiness
are observed, in association with the presence of {100}-slip traces along the coherent $\theta^\prime$-Al$_2$Cu
precipitate/$\alpha$-Al matrix interface and precipitate shearing. These complex effects of
plate-like precipitates on plasticity are analyzed, experimentally and theoretically, in view
of the interferences between external and internal sizes, and the related modifications of the
underlying plastic mechanisms.
