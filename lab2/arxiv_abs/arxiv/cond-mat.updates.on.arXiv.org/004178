We investigate the universal behavior of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation with temporally
correlated noise. The presence of time correlations in the microscopic noise breaks the statistical
tilt symmetry, or Galilean invariance, of the original KPZ equation with delta-correlated noise
(denoted SR-KPZ). Thus it is not clear whether the KPZ universality class is preserved in this case.
Conflicting results exist in the literature, some advocating that it is destroyed even in the limit
of infinitesimal temporal correlations, while others find that it persists up to a critical range
of such correlations. Using non-perturbative and functional renormalization group techniques,
we study the influence of two types of temporal correlators of the noise: a short-range one with a
typical time-scale $\tau$, and a power-law one with a varying exponent $\theta$. We show that for
the short-range noise with any finite $\tau$, the symmetries (the Galilean symmetry, and the time-reversal
one in $1+1$ dimension) are dynamically restored at large scales, such that the long-distance and
long-time properties are governed by the SR-KPZ fixed point. In the presence of a power-law noise,
we find that the SR-KPZ fixed point is still stable for $\theta$ below a critical value $\theta_{\textrm{th}}$,
in accordance with previous renormalization group results, while a long-range fixed point controls
the critical scaling for $\theta>\theta_{\textrm{th}}$, and we evaluate the $\theta$-dependent
critical exponents at this long-range fixed point, in both $1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions. While the
results in $1+1$ dimension can be compared with previous studies, no other prediction was available
in $2+1$ dimension. We finally report in $1+1$ dimension the emergence of anomalous scaling in the
long-range phase.
