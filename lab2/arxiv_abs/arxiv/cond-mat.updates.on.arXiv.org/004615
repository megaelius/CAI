Nonperturbative methods play an important role in quantum many-body systems, especially in situations
with an interplay of continuum and bound states and/or large coupling strengths between the constituents.
Employing the Luttinger-Ward functional (LWF) we have computed the equation of state (EoS) of the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) using fully dressed selfconsistent 1- and 2-body propagators. We first
give an alternative derivation of our previously reported results for resumming the ladder diagram
series of the LWF using a "matrix log" technique which accounts for dynamically formed bound and
resonant states. Two types of solutions were found in selfconsistent fits to lattice-QCD data for
the EoS, heavy-quark free energy and quarkonium correlators: a strongly coupled scenario (SCS)
with broad parton spectral functions and strong meson resonances near the transition temperature
vs. a weakly coupled scenario (WCS) with well-defined parton quasiparticles and weak meson resonances.
Here, we discuss how these solutions can be distinguished by analyzing the pertinent transport
properties. We focus on the specific shear viscosity, $(4\pi )\eta/s$, and the heavy-quark diffusion
coefficient, $(2\pi T) {\cal D}_s$, including its mass dependence. At low temperatures, in the
SCS, they turn out to be a factor of 2 within their conjectured quantum lower bound, while they are
a factor of 2-5 larger in the WCS. At higher temperatures, the transport parameters of the two scenarios
approach each other. We propose the ratio $ (4\pi\eta/s)/(2\pi T {\cal D}_s )$ as a measure to distinguish
the perturbative and strong-coupling limits of 5/2 and 1, respectively.
