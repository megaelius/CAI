In this work we present and discuss theoretical models of redox molecular junctions that account
for recent observations of nonlinear charge transport phenomena, such as hysteresis and hysteretic
negative differential resistance (NDR). A defining feature in such models is the involvement of
at least two conduction channels - a slow channel that determines transitions between charge states
of the bridge and a fast channel that dominates its conduction. Using Marcus theory of heterogeneous
electron transfer (ET) at metal-molecule interfaces we identify and describe different regimes
of nonlinear conduction through redox molecular bridges, where the transferring charge can be
highly localized around the redox moiety. This localization and its stabilization by polarization
of the surrounding medium and/or conformational changes can lead to decoupling of the current response
dynamics from the timescale of the voltage sweep (that is, the current does not adiabatically follow
the voltage), hence to the appearance of memory (thermodynamic irreversibility) in this response
that is manifested by hysteresis in current-voltage cycles. In standard voltammetry such irreversibility
leads to relative shift of the current peaks along the forward and backward voltage sweeps. The common
origin of these behaviors is pointed out and expressions of the threshold voltage sweep rates are
provided. In addition, the theory is extended (a) to analyze the different ways by which such phenomena
are manifested in single sweep cycles and in ensemble averages of such cycles, and (b) to examine
quantum effects in the fast transport channel.
