Two topics, evolving rapidly in separate fields, were combined recently: The out-of-time-ordered
correlator (OTOC) signals quantum-information scrambling in many-body systems. The Kirkwood-Dirac
(KD) quasiprobability represents operators in quantum optics. The OTOC has been shown to equal
a moment of a summed quasiprobability. That quasiprobability, we argue, is an extension of the KD
distribution. We explore the quasiprobability's structure from experimental, numerical, and
theoretical perspectives. First, we simplify and analyze the weak-measurement and interference
protocols for measuring the OTOC and its quasiprobability. We decrease, exponentially in system
size, the number of trials required to infer the OTOC from weak measurements. We also construct a
circuit for implementing the weak-measurement scheme. Next, we calculate the quasiprobability
(after coarse-graining) numerically and analytically: We simulate a transverse-field Ising
model first. Then, we calculate the quasiprobability averaged over random circuits, which model
chaotic dynamics. The quasiprobability, we find, distinguishes chaotic from integrable regimes.
We observe nonclassical behaviors: The quasiprobability typically has negative components.
It becomes nonreal in some regimes. The onset of scrambling breaks a symmetry that bifurcates the
quasiprobability, as in classical-chaos pitchforks. Finally, we present mathematical properties.
The quasiprobability obeys a Bayes-type theorem, for example, that exponentially decreases the
memory required to calculate weak values, in certain cases. A time-ordered correlator analogous
to the OTOC, insensitive to quantum-information scrambling, depends on a quasiprobability closer
to a classical probability. This work not only illuminates the OTOC's underpinnings, but also generalizes
quasiprobability theory and motivates immediate-future weak-measurement challenges.
