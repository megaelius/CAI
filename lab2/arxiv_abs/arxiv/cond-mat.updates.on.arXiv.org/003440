Solid solubility (SS) is one of the most important features of alloys, which is usually difficult
to be largely tuned in the entire alloy concentrations by external approaches. Some alloys that
were supposed to have promising physical properties could turn out to be much less useful because
of their poor SS, e.g., the case for monolayer BNC [(BN)1-x(C2)x] alloys. Until now, an effective
approach on significantly enhancing SS of (BN)1-x(C2)x in the entire x is still lacking. In this
article, a novel mechanism of selective orbital coupling between high energy wrong-bond states
and surface states mediated by the specific substrate has been proposed to stabilize the wrong-bonds
and in turn significantly enhance the SS of (BN)1-x(C2)x alloys. Surprisingly, we demonstrate
that five ordered alloys, exhibiting variable direct quasi-particle bandgaps from 1.35 to 3.99
eV, can spontaneously be formed at different x when (BN)1-x(C2)x is grown on hcp-phase Cr. Interestingly,
the optical transitions around the band edges in these ordered alloys, accompanied by largely tunable
exciton binding energies of ~1 eV at different x, are significantly strong due to their unique band
structures. Importantly, the disordered (BN)1-x(C2)x alloys, exhibiting fully tunable bandgaps
from 0 to ~6 eV in the entire x, can be formed on Cr substrate at the miscibility temperature of ~1200
K, which is greatly reduced compared to that of 4500~5600 K in free-standing form or on other substrates.
Our discovery not only may resolve the long-standing SS problem of BNC alloys, but also could significantly
extend the applications of BNC alloys for various optoelectronic applications.
