Predicting the morphodynamics of sedimentary landscapes due to fluvial and aeolian flows requires
answering the following questions: Is the flow strong enough to initiate sediment transport, is
the flow strong enough to sustain sediment transport once initiated, and how much sediment is transported
by the flow in the saturated state (i.e., what is the transport capacity)? In the geomorphological
and related literature, the widespread consensus has been that the initiation, cessation, and
capacity of fluvial transport, and the initiation of aeolian transport, are controlled by fluid
entrainment of bed sediment caused by flow forces overcoming local resisting forces, whereas aeolian
transport cessation and capacity are controlled by impact entrainment caused by the impacts of
transported particles with the bed. Here the physics of sediment transport initiation, cessation,
and capacity is reviewed with emphasis on recent consensus-challenging developments in sediment
transport experiments, two-phase flow modeling, and the incorporation of granular physics' concepts.
Highlighted are the similarities between dense granular flows and sediment transport, such as
a superslow granular motion known as creeping (which occurs for arbitrarily weak driving flows)
and system-spanning force networks that resist bed sediment entrainment; the roles of the magnitude
and duration of turbulent fluctuation events in fluid entrainment; the traditionally overlooked
role of particle-bed impacts in triggering entrainment events in fluvial transport; and the common
physical underpinning of transport thresholds across aeolian and fluvial environments. This
sheds a new light on the well-known Shields diagram, where measurements of fluid entrainment thresholds
could actually correspond to entrainment-independent cessation thresholds.
