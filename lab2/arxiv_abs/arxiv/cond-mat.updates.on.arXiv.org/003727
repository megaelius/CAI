The classical nucleation equation, applied to two liquids, is completed by an additional enthalpy
for solid supercluster formation governing the liquid and glass transformations. This model,
successfully applied to d-mannitol, triphenyl phosphite and n-butanol, defines a formation rule
of strong glacial phase, explaining the origin of the first-order transition of water from fragile-to-strong
liquid at TLL = 228.5 K, only knowing Tg = 137.1 K, the melting heat and the melting temperature Tm.
All thermodynamic properties and transitions, even under pressure P, are now predicted in agreement
with experiments of Kanno and Angell (1979), Mishima (1994), Mishima and Stanley (1998), Loerting
et al (2006), Amann-Winkel et al (2013), Shephard and Salzmann (2016, 2017), Tulk et al (2019). This
glacial phase is formed at TLL = 0.8367*Tm for P < 0.017 GPa. (TLL) decreases with P < 0.017 GPa and disappears
for P > 0.55 GPa. The lowest-density liquid is, at once, the glacial phase of fragile and high-density
liquids. It is formed at TLL, remains liquid during the first cooling, and gives rise to the glass
phase by heating through a first-order transition without latent heat at TK2 = 122.4 K. Ordered liquid
Phase 3 appears during the first heating above Tg = 137.1 K, with its own Kauzmann temperature, superheating
above Tm up to Tn+ if crystallization is avoided. The latent heat at TLL exists during the first cooling
and is compensated during the next cooling by Phase 3 formation heat. The first-order transition
without latent heat at TK2 = 122.4 K induces ordered Phase 3, becomes underlying below Tg in further
heating and induces an enthalpy excess at Tm which is used to predict TK2. This description agrees
with the broken bond and solid fractal structure percolation theories.
