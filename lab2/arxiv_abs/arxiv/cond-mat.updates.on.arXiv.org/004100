The study of the competition or coexistence of different ground states in many-body systems is an
exciting and actual topic of research, both experimentally and theoretically. Quantum fluctuations
of a given phase can suppress or enhance another phase depending on the nature of the coupling between
the order parameters, their dynamics and the dimensionality of the system. The zero temperature
phase diagrams of systems with competing scalar order parameters with quartic and bilinear coupling
terms have been previously studied for the cases of a zero temperature bicritical point and of coexisting
orders. In this work, we apply the Matsubara summation technique from finite temperature quantum
field theory to introduce the effects of thermal fluctuations on the effective potential of these
systems. This is essential to make contact with experiments. We consider two and three-dimensional
materials characterized by a Lorentz invariant quantum critical theory. We obtain that in both
cases, thermal fluctuations lead to weak first-order temperature phase transitions, at which
coexisting phases arising from quantum corrections become unstable. We show that above this critical
temperature, the system presents scaling behavior consistent with that approaching a quantum
critical point. Below the transition the specific heat has a thermally activated contribution
with a gap related to the size of the domains of the ordered phases. We show that the critical temperature
(Tc) in the coexistence region decreases as a function of the distance to the zero temperature classical
bicritical point. This indicates that at the fine tuned value of this transition, the system attains
the highest Tc in the region of coexistence.
