We investigate the radial oscillations of small gas bubbles trapped in yield-stress fluid and driven
by an acoustic pressure field. We model the rheological behavior of the yield-stress fluid using
the recently developed elasto-visco-plastic (EVP) constitutive equation that takes into account
the elastic and visco-plastic deformations of the material [P. Saramito, J. NonNewton. Fluid Mech.
158 (1-3) (2009) pp.154-161]. Assuming that the bubble remains spherical during the pressure driving,
we reduce the problem to a set of ODEs and an integrodifferential equation, which we solve numerically
for the case of two yield-stress fluids, a sot Carbopol gel and a stiffer Kaolin suspension. We find
that, depending on the amplitude and frequency of the pressure field, the radial oscillations of
the bubble produce elastic stresses that may or may not suffice to yield the surrounding material.
We evaluate the critical amplitude of the acoustic pressure required to achieve yielding and we
find a good agreement between numerical simulations and an analytical formula derived under the
assumption of linear deformations. Finally, we examine the bubble oscillation amplitude for a
very wide range of applied pressures both below and above the critical value to assess the impact
of yielding on the bubble dynamics. This analysis could be used to identify a signature of yielding
in experiments where the radial dynamics of a bubble is measured. More generally, these results
can be used to rationalize the optimal conditions for pressure-induced bubble release from yield-stress
fluids, which is relevant to various biomedical and industrial applications, including oil industry
and food processing.
