A key assumption of polymer physics is that the random chains polymers extend in flow. Recent experimental
evidence has shown that polymer chains compress in Couette flow in a manner counter to expectation.
Here, scaling arguments developed previously are used to determine the relationship between the
viscosity and chain radius of gyration. Scaling arguments determine the viscosity-radius of gyration
relationship to be such that the viscosity is proportional to the radius to the power of 9. The viscosity
is shown to be a power law function of the radius, and to decrease with decreasing radius under conditions
where the chains are ideal random walks in concentrated solution. Furthermore, this relationship
is consistent with both the widely observed viscosity-temperature and viscosity-shear rate behavior
observed in polymer rheology. The assumption of extension is not consistent with these observations
as it would require that the chains increase in size with increasing temperature. Shear thinning
is thus a result of a decreasing radius with increasing shear rate as the radius is proportional to
the the shear rate raised to the power law exponent divided by 9. The thermal expansion coefficient
determines the variation in the power law exponents that are measured for different polymer systems.
Typical values on n enable the measured reduction in coils size behavior to be fitted. Furthermore,
the absurd notion that polymer chains extend to reduce the viscosity implies that an increasing
chain size results in a reduced viscosity is addressed. This assumption would require that the viscosity
increases with reducing coil radius which is simply unphysical.
