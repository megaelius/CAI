Power-law distributed cascade failures are well known in power-grid systems. Understanding this
phenomena has been done by various DC threshold models, self-tuned at their critical point. Here
we attempt to describe it using an AC threshold model, with a second-order Kuramoto type equation
of motion of the power-flow. We have focused on the exploration of network heterogeneity effects,
starting from homogeneous 2D lattices to the US power-grid, possessing identical nodes and links,
to a realistic electric power-grid obtained from the Hungarian electrical database. The last one
exhibits node dependent parameters, topologically marginally on the verge of robust networks.
We show that too weak quenched heterogeneity, coming solely from the probabilistic self-frequencies
of nodes (2D lattice) is not sufficient to find power-law distributed cascades. On the other hand
too strong heterogeneity destroys the synchronization of the system. We found agreement with the
empirically observed power-law failure size distributions on the US grid, as well as on the Hungarian
networks near the synchronization transition point. We have also investigated the consequence
of replacing the usual Gaussian self-frequencies to exponential distributed ones, describing
renewable energy sources. We found a drop in the steady state synchronization averages, but the
cascade size distribution both for the US and Hungarian systems remained insensitive and have kept
the universal tails, characterized by the exponent $\tau\simeq 1.8$. We have also investigated
the effect of an instantaneous feedback mechanism in case of the Hungarian power-grid.
