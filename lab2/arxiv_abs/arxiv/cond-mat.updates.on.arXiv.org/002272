We use active microrheology to determine the frequency dependent moduli of a linear viscoelastic
fluid in terms of the polymer time constant ($\lambda$), and the polymer ($\mu_p$) and solvent viscosity
($\mu_s$), respectively. We measure these parameters from the response function of an optically
trapped Brownian probe in the fluid under an external perturbation, and at different dilutions
of the viscoelastic component in the fluid. This is an improvement over bulk microrheology measurements
in viscoelastic Stokes-Oldroyd B fluids which determine the complex elastic modulus $G(\omega)$
of the fluid, but do not, however, reveal the characteristics of the polymer chains and the Newtonian
solvent of the complex fluid individually. In a recent work [Paul \textit{et al}., 2018 J. Phys.
Condens. Matter \textbf{30} 345101], we linearized the Stokes-Oldroyd B fluid model and thereby
explicitly formulated the frequency dependent moduli in terms of ($\mu_p$) and ($\mu_s$), which
we now extend to account for an external sinusoidal force applied to the probe particle. We measure
$\lambda$, $\mu_p$, and $\mu_s$ experimentally, and compare with existing the $\lambda$ values
in the literature for the same fluid at some of the dilution levels, and obtain good agreement. Further,
we use these parameters to calculate the complex elastic modulus of the fluid again at certain dilutions
and verify successfully with existing data. This establishes our method as an alternate approach
in the active microrheology of complex fluids which should reveal information about the composition
of such fluids in significantly greater detail and high signal to noise.
