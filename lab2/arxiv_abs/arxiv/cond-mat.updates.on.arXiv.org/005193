Hexagonal La$_2$Ni$_7$ and rhombohedral Y$_2$Ni$_7$ are weak itinerant antiferromagnet (wAFM)
and ferromagnet (wFM), respectively. The crystal structure and magnetic properties of $A_2B_7$
intermetallic compounds ($A$ = La, Y, $B$ = Ni) have been investigated combining X-ray powder diffraction
and magnetic measurements. The La$_{2-x}$Y$_x$Ni$_7$ intermetallic compounds with $0 \leq x
\leq 1$ crystallize in the Ce$_{2}$Ni$_7$-type hexagonal structure with Y preferentially located
in the [$AB_2$] units. The compounds with larger Y content ($1.2 \leq x < 2$) crystallize in both hexagonal
and rhombohedral (Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type) structures with a progressive substitution of Y for La in
the $A$ sites belonging to the [$AB_5$] units. Y$_2$Ni$_7$ crystallizes in the rhombohedral structure
only. The average cell volume decreases linearly versus Y content, whereas the c/a ratio presents
a minimum at $x = 1$ due to geometric constrains. The magnetic properties are strongly dependent
on the structure type and the Y content. La$_{2}$Ni$_7$ displays a complex metamagnetic behavior
with split AFM peaks. Compounds with x = 0.25 and 0.5 display a wAFM ground state and two metamagnetic
transitions, the first one towards an intermediate wAFM state and the second one towards a FM state.T$_N$
and the second critical field increase with the Y content, indicating a stabilization of the AFM
state. LaYNi$_7$, which is as the boundary between the two structure types, presents a very wFM state
at low field and an AFM state as the applied field increases. All the compounds with $x > 1$ and containing
a rhombohedral phase are wFM with $T_C$ = 53(2) K. In addition to the experimental studies, first
principles calculations using spin polarization have been performed to interpret the evolution
of both structural phase stability and magnetic ordering for $0 \leq x < 2$.
