Using the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) and SCAN+U approximations for
describing electron exchange-correlation (XC) within density functional theory, we investigate
the oxidation energetics, lattice constants, and electronic structure of binary Ce-, Mn-, and
Fe-oxides, which are crucial ingredients for generating renewable fuels using two-step, oxide-based,
solar thermochemical reactors. Unlike other common XC functionals, we find that SCAN does not over-bind
the O2 molecule, based on direct calculations of its bond energy and robust agreement between calculated
formation enthalpies of main group oxides versus experiments. However, in the case of transition-metal
oxides (TMOs), SCAN systematically overestimates (i.e., yields too negative) oxidation enthalpies
due to remaining self-interaction errors in the description of their ground-state electronic
structure. Adding a Hubbard U term to the transition-metal centers, where the magnitude of U is determined
from experimental oxidation enthalpies, significantly improves the qualitative agreement and
marginally improves the quantitative agreement of SCAN+U-calculated electronic structure and
lattice parameters, respectively, with experiments. Importantly, SCAN predicts the wrong ground-state
structure for a few oxides, namely, Ce2O3, Mn2O3, and Fe3O4, while SCAN+U predicts the right polymorph
for all systems considered in this work. Hence, the SCAN+U framework, with an appropriately determined
U, will be required to accurately describe ground-state properties and yield qualitatively consistent
electronic properties for most transition- metal and rare earth oxides.
