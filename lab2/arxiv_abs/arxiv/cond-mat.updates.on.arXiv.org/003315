It is difficult to understand the structure evolution in atoms executing confined inter-state
electron dynamics. The structure of such atoms gets evolved during amalgamation due to significantly
attained dynamics. The evolution of such structure takes place in a different format depending
on the incurred ground point of atoms. Atoms of each format deal with different forced exertions
for their electrons. In neutral state, they transform heat energy into bind energy having shapes
like tick symbol, integral symbol or Gaussian distribution symbol as per mechanism of electron
dynamics. The evolving structure of atoms at the same level of ground points deals with forced exertions
for feasible electrons in the same format as well. In atoms of space format, the structure starts
evolving above the typical level ground surface. In atoms of grounded format, the structure starts
evolving below the typical level ground surface. The structure of atoms, as per number of quadrants
simultaneously execute electron dynamics and starts evolving in different dimensions. Atoms,
executing electron dynamics in three quadrants, show a bit different mechanism for structure evolution.
Atoms bind at the points of their generated energy because of their identical nature. Amalgamating
atoms bind to the targeted atom in a lateral way from upward side and downward side respectively during
the evolution of structure in space format and grounded format. In structure of surface format,
amalgamated atoms bind to targeted atom in adjacent manner. The binding of atoms in layers for each
definite format is by means of trapped force and energy. As a result of chemical activity related
to force and energy, the chemical reactivity adheres to mono layers of atoms bound under electron
dynamics...
