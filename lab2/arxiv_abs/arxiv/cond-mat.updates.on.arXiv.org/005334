Generalized mode-coupling theory (GMCT) is a first-principles-based and systematically correctable
framework to predict the complex relaxation dynamics of glass-forming materials. The formal theory
amounts to a hierarchy of infinitely many coupled integro-differential equations, which may be
approximated using a suitable finite-order closure relation. Although previous studies have
suggested that finite-order GMCT leads to well-defined solutions, and that the hierarchy converges
as the closure level increases, no rigorous and general result in this direction is known. Here we
unambiguously establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to generic, schematic GMCT
hierarchies that are closed at arbitrary order. We consider two types of commonly invoked closure
approximations, namely mean-field and exponential closures. We also distinguish explicitly
between overdamped and underdamped glassy dynamics, corresponding to hierarchies of first-order
and second-order integro-differential equations, respectively. We find that truncated GMCT
hierarchies closed under an exponential closure conform to previously developed mathematical
theories, such that the existence of a unique solution can be readily inferred. Self-consistent
mean-field closures, however, of which the well-known standard-MCT closure approximation is
a special case, warrant additional arguments for mathematical rigour. We demonstrate that the
existence of a priori bounds on the solution is sufficient to also prove that unique solutions exist
for such self-consistent hierarchies. To complete our analysis, we present simple arguments to
show that these a priori bounds must exist, motivated by the physical interpretation of the GMCT
solutions as density correlation functions. Overall, our work contributes to the theoretical
justification of GMCT for studies of the glass transition, placing GMCT on a firmer mathematical
footing.
