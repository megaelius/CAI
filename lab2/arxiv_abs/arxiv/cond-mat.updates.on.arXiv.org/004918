Purpose: To demonstrate an alternative to the rinse and rub (RR) method for cleaning pollutants
from the exterior surface of soft contact lenses. This proposed technique is termed Polymer on Polymer
Pollutant Removal (PoPPR), which utilizes the elastic properties of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
to physically remove contaminants from contact lens surfaces through non-adhesive unpeeling.
Methods: Three different ratios of setting agent to polymer PDMS (1:30, 1:40, and 1:50) were evaluated
using the PoPPR method against the control method of RR with a commercial multi-purpose lens cleaning
solution. Three simulated pollutants of different sizes: pollen (25-40 {\mu}m), microbeads (1-5
{\mu}m), and nanoparticles (5-10 nm), were used to test the effectiveness of both cleaning methods.
The fraction of pollutants removed from each contact lens was recorded and evaluated for significance.
Results: PDMS 1:40 was found to be the optimal ratio for lens cleaning using the PoPPR method. For
larger particles (>10 {\mu}m), no difference was observed between conventional RR and proposed
PoPPR method (p > 0.05). However, the new PoPPR technique was significantly better at removing small
PM2.5 particles (<2.5 {\mu}m) compared to the RR method, specifically for microbeads (p = 0.006)
and nanoparticles (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This proof-of-concept work demonstrates that the PoPPR
method of cleaning contact lenses is as effective as the conventional cleaning method for larger
particles such as pollen. The PoPPR method is more effective at removing extremely fine particulate
pollutants, including microplastics and nanoparticles. This method offers a potentially more
efficient cleaning protocol that could enhance the safety, health, and comfort of contact lens
users, especially those living in regions with significant air pollution.
