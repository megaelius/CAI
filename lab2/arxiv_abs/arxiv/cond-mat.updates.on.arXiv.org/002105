My study is about Halide Perovskites (HaPs) and focuses the fundamental structural, chemical and
dielectric properties of HaPs in reference to their PV-related properties. * I present my main research
model: HaP single-crystals - their growth and characterization; * I start by exploring the bond
nature of HaPs using Nanoindentation and Solid-State NMR techniques. * I explore the 'deformation
potential' of the structure and show that its low and positive value in HaPs strongly suggests a pronounced
'defect tolerance'. * I explore the scattering mechanism of charges in the soft and highly polarizable
system such as HaPs, and show that its low mobility (relative to other heteropolar systems) is fundamental
and cannot be improved. I also show that a positive 'deformation potential' (so the valence band
is 'anti-bonding', where a system should promote 'defect-tolerance') is something that is common
to other highly polarizable systems, such as AgX, and Pb-chalcogenides. * I explore the chemistry
of the system and show that HaPs can easily break to constituents, but also easily be made by the same
constituents, suggesting a low activation energy for annealing process to take care even at RT.
This RT annealing can promote 'self-healing' at ~second to ~minute time-scale, which we clearly
observe. We find 'entropic-stabilization' to be very important in 'self-healing' processes of
that kind. * I explore the importance of symmetry breaking in the HaP structure, which can induce
a polar - and thus Ferroelectric - structure. We conclude that Ferroelectricity is not a fundamental
property of HaPs, since it doesn't exist in MAPbBr3, but only in MAPbI3 - as proven unambiguously
- and what is present in MAPbI3 is in doubt important for photovoltaics, when using them at RT or above.
