The performance of electronic and spintronic devices based on two-dimensional semiconductors
(2D SC) is largely dependent on the quality and resistance of the metal/SC electrical contacts,
as well as preservation of the intrinsic properties of the SC channel. Direct Metal/SC interaction
results in highly resistive contacts due to formation of large Schottky barriers and considerably
affects the properties of the 2D SC. In this work, we address these two important issues in monolayer
$\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ Field-Effect transistors (FETs). We encapsulate the $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ channel
with hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN), using bilayer h-BN at the metal/SC interface. The bilayer
h-BN eliminates the metal/$\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ chemical interactions, preserves the electrical
properties of $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ and reduces the contact resistances by prevention of Fermi-level
pinning. We investigate electrical transport in the monolayer $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ FETs that yields
close to intrinsic electron mobilities ($\approx 26\ \mathrm{cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}}$) even at room
temperature. Moreover, we experimentally study the charge transport through Metal/h-BN/$\mathrm{MoSe_2}$
tunnel contacts and we explicitly show that the dielectric bilayer of h-BN provides highly efficient
gating (tuning the Fermi energy) of the $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ channel at the contact regions even with
small biases. Also we provide a theoretical model that allows to understand and reproduce the experimental
$I-V$ characteristics of the contacts. These observations give an insight into the electrical
behavior of the metal/h-BN/2D SC heterostructure and introduce bilayer h-BN as a suitable choice
for high quality tunneling contacts that allows for low energy charge and spin transport.
