We report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of phonon spectra in the parent superconductor
iron-tuned chalcogenide Fe$_{1+x}$Te, for two different x contents (x $\leq$ 0.11), using neutron
time-of-flight technique. Thermal neutron spectroscopy allowed to collect the low-temperature
Stokes spectra over an extended Q-range, at 2, 40 and 120K - hence covering both the magnetic monoclinic
and the paramagnetic tetragonal phases. Whereas cold-neutrons allowed to measure high-resolution
anti-Stokes spectra at 140, 220 and 300K, thus covering the tetragonal phase. Our results evidence
a spin-phonon coupling behaviour towards the observed noticeable temperature-dependent change
of the Stokes spectra across the transition temperatures. On the other hand, the anti-Stokes spectra
reveal a pronounced hardening of the low-energy, acoustic region, of the phonon spectrum, upon
heating, indicating a strong anharmonicity and a subtle dependence of phonons on structural evolution
within the tetragonal phase. Experimental results are accompanied by ab initio calculations of
phonon spectra of the tetragonal stoichiometric phase for a comparison with the high-resolution
anti-Stokes spectra. Calculations included different density functional methods. Spin polarization
and van der Waals interaction, were either considered or neglected, individually or concomitantly,
in order to study their respective effect on lattice dynamics description. Our results suggest
that including van der Waals interaction has only a slight effect on phonon dynamics, however, phonon
spectra are better described when spin polarization is included, in a cooperative way with van der
Waals interactions.
