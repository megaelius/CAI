Beryllium was recently discovered to harbor a Dirac nodal line (DNL) in its bulk phase and the DNL-induced
non-trivial drumhead-like surface states (DNSSs) on its (0001) surface, rationalizing several
already-existing historic puzzles [Phys. Rev. Lett., \textbf{117}, 096401 (2016)]. However,
to date the underlying mechanism, as to why its (0001) surface exhibits an anomalously large electron-phonon
coupling effect ($\lambda_{e-ph}^s$ $\approx$ 1.0), remains unresolved. Here, by means of first-principles
calculations we have evidenced that the coupling of the DNSSs with the phononic states mainly contributes
to its novel surface \emph{e-ph} enhancement. Besides that the experimentally observed $\lambda_{e-ph}^s$
and the main Eliashberg coupling function (ECF) peaks have been reproduced well, we have decomposed
the ECF, $\alpha^{2}$$F$(\emph{k},\textbf{\emph{q}};\emph{v}), and the \emph{e-ph} coupling
strength $\lambda(\emph{k},\textbf{\emph{q}};\emph{v})$ as a function of each electron momentum
(\emph{k}), each phonon momentum (\textbf{\emph{q}}) and each phonon mode ($v$), evidencing
the robust connection between the DNSSs and both $\alpha^{2}$$F$(\emph{k},\textbf{\emph{q}};\emph{v})
and $\lambda(\emph{k},\textbf{\emph{q}};\emph{v})$. The results reveal the strong \emph{e-ph}
coupling between the DNSSs and the phonon modes, which contributes over 80$\%$ of the $\lambda_{e-ph}^s$
coefficient on the Be (0001) surface. It highlights that the anomalously large \emph{e-ph} coefficient
on the Be (0001) surface can be attributed to the presence of its DNL-induced DNSSs, clarifying the
long-term debated mechanism.
