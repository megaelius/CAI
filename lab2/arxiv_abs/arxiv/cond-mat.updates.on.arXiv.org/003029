The AC conductivity response in a broad frequency range of disordered materials is of great interest
not only for technological applications, but also from a theoretical point of view. The Jonscher
power exponent value, and its temperature dependence, is a very important parameter in dielectric
data analysis as well as the physical interpretation of conduction mechanisms in disordered materials.
In some cases the power exponent of AC conductivity has been reported to be greater than 1 at the low
frequency regime. This fact seems to contradict the universal dynamic response. The present work
focuses on the analysis of dielectric spectroscopy measurements in polymeric materials, below
100 MHz. The apparent power exponent n gets values in the range (0,1) and is directly related to the
characteristics of mobile charges at shorter time scales, in the case of the occurrence of DC conduction
and the slowest polarization mechanism that is due to the charge motions within sort length scales,
in log(epsilon'')-log(frequenvy) plot. The emergence of apparent n values in the range [1,2],
for a relatively narrow frequency range, may be attributed to an additional molecular dipolar relaxation
contribution at higher frequencies, in log(epsilon'')-log(frequency) plot. The appearance
of apparent n values in the range (1,2], can be assigned to the existence of a well defined minimum
between DC conductivity contribution and a molecular dipolar dispersion or between two well separated
dielectric loss mechanisms, in log(epsilon'')-log(frequency) plots, above the crossover frequency.
In these latter cases, the apparent power exponent n is merely related to the Havriliak-Negami equation
shape parameters of the higher frequencies molecular dipolar relaxations.
