We discuss the modeling of the electrical manipulation of spin qubits in the linear-response regime
where the Rabi frequency is proportional to the magnetic field and to the radio-frequency electric
field excitation. We show that the Rabi frequency can be obtained from a generalized g-tensor magnetic
resonance formula featuring a g-matrix and its derivative g' with respect to the electric field
(or gate voltage) as inputs. These matrices can be easily calculated from the wave functions of the
qubit at zero magnetic field. The g-matrix formalism therefore provides the complete dependence
of the Larmor and Rabi frequencies on the orientation of the magnetic field at very low computational
cost. It also provides a compact model for the control of the qubit, and a simple framework for the
analysis of the effects of symmetries on the anisotropy of the Larmor and Rabi frequencies. We discuss,
in particular, the impact of mirror planes on the shape of g, g' and Rabi frequency map. The g-matrix
formalism applies to a wide variety of electron and hole qubits, and we focus on a hole qubit on silicon-on-insulator
with front and back gates as an illustration. The Rabi frequency of the hole qubit shows a complex
dependence on the orientation of the magnetic field, which can be understood from the symmetries
of the wave functions. These symmetries can actually be controlled by the gates. In particular,
the Rabi frequency is very small at a particular bias point where the wave functions show three (approximate)
mirror planes. The hole qubit can, therefore, be switched between a bias point with large Rabi frequency
for manipulation and a bias point where it is largely decoupled from the electric field but presumably
longer-lived. The calculated Rabi frequency map however differs qualitatively from recent experiments.
We suggest that non-intentional strains might be responsible for these discrepancies.
