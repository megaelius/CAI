The $d$-wave superconductor $\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$ has been proposed as a strong candidate for supporting
the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state near the low-temperature boundary of its
upper critical field. Neutron diffraction, however, finds spin-density wave (SDW) order in this
part of the phase diagram for field in the $a$-$b$ plane, and evidence for the SDW disappears as the
applied field is rotated toward the tetragonal $c$ axis. It is important to understand the interplay
between the SDW and a possible FFLO state in $\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$, as the mere existence of an SDW
does not necessary exclude an FFLO state. Here, based on a model constructed on the basis of available
experiments, we show that an FFLO state competes with an SDW phase. The SDW state in $\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$
is stabilized when the field is directed close to the $a$-$b$ plane. When the field is rotated toward
the $c$ axis, the FFLO state emerges, and the SDW phase disappears. In the FFLO state, the nodal planes
with extra quasiparticles (where the superconducting order parameter is zero) are perpendicular
to the field, and in the SDW phase, the quasiparticle density of states is reduced. We test this model
prediction by measuring heat transported by normal quasiparticles in the superconducting state.
As a function of field, we observe a reduction of thermal conductivity for field close to the $a$-$b$
plane and an enhancement of thermal conductivity when field is close to the $c$ axis, consistent
with theoretical expectations. Our modeling and experiments, therefore, indicate the existence
of the FFLO state when field is parallel to the $c$ axis.
