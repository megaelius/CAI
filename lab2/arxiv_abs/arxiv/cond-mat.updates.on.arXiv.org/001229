Production of nanostructures by polymeric templating or the synergistic interaction between
the nanoparticles and the polymeric matrix is a cost-effective and popular method known as the bottom-up
approach in the nanofabrication industry. In this paper, we use the matrix of equilibrium polymers
(or Wormlike micelles) to assemble nanoparticles into various morphological structures via synergistic
interactions of the nanoparticles and the matrix. We report the structural transitions of nanoparticles
and polymeric chains from percolating to non-percolating structures as a result of the change in
the minimum approaching distance between nanoparticles and the matrix equilibrium polymers.
We also investigate the effect of the change in the polymeric density and show that the anisotropy
of nanoparticle clusters formed is governed by the polymeric density. We report the formation of
percolating networks of rods, sheets and anisotropic nanoclusters as well as individual nanorods,
nanosheets. It is shown that not only the nanostructure can be governed by the polymeric (or Wormlike
micellar) density, but also the pore shape and pore size can be changed by changing the minimum approaching
distance between nanoparticles and polymers. The two transition points (one for polymeric chains
and the other for nanoparticles) from percolating to non-percolating transitions are established
by a qualitative as well as a quantitative analysis. The investigations give us the control parameters
for tailoring the nanostructures which is promising for the field of nanofabrication. Moreover,
the parameters can be used to tailor the mesoporous nanostructures formed in the system which has
a great potential to optimize the performance of batteries. An attempt is also made to get a theoretical
insight into these structural transitions.
