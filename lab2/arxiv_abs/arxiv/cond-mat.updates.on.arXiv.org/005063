Predicting the mechanical failure of parts in service requires understanding their deformation
behavior, and associated dynamic microstructural evolution up to the near-atomic scale. Solutes
are known to interact with defects generated by plastic deformation, thereby affecting their displacement
throughout the microstructure and hence the material mechanical response to solicitation. This
effect is studied here in a polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy with two different Nb contents
that lead to a significant change in their creep lifetime. Creep testing at 750C and 600 MPa shows
that the high-Nb alloy performs better in terms of creep strain rate. Considering the similar initial
microstructures, the difference in mechanical behavior is attributed to a phase transformation
that occurs along planar faults, controlled by the different types of stacking faults and alloy
composition. Electron channeling contrast imaging reveals the presence of stacking faults in
both alloys. Microtwinning is observed only in the low-Nb alloy, rationalizing in part the higher
creep strain rate. In the high-Nb alloy, atom probe tomography evidences two different types of
stacking faults based on their partitioning behavior. Superlattice intrinsic stacking faults
(SISF) were found enriched in Nb, Co, Cr and Mo while only Nb and Co was segregated at superlattice
extrinsic stacking faults. Based on their composition, a local phase transformation occurring
along the faults is suggested, resulting in slower creep strain rate in the high-Nb alloy. In comparison,
mainly SISF enriched in Co, Cr, Nb and Mo were found in the low-Nb alloy. Following the results presented
here, and those available in the literature, an atomic-scale driven alloy design approach that
controls and promotes local phase transformation along planar faults at 750C is proposed, aiming
to design superalloys with enhanced creep resistance.
