Ultra-cold quantum turbulence is expected to decay through a cascade of Kelvin waves. These helical
excitations couple vorticity to the quantum fluid causing long wavelength phonon fluctuations
in a Bose-Einstein condensate. This interaction is hypothesized to be the route to relaxation for
turbulent tangles in quantum hydrodynamics. The local induction approximation is the lowest order
approximation to the Biot-Savart velocity field induced by a vortex line and, because of its integrability,
is thought to prohibit energy transfer by Kelvin waves. Using the Biot-Savart description, we derive
a generalization to the local induction approximation which predicts that regions of large curvature
can reconfigure themselves as Kelvin wave packets. While this generalization preserves the arclength
metric, a quantity conserved under the Eulerian flow of vortex lines, it also introduces a non-Hamiltonian
structure on the geometric properties of the vortex line. It is this non-Hamiltonian evolution
of curvature and torsion which provides a resolution to the missing Kelvin wave motion. In this work,
we derive corrections to the local induction approximation in powers of curvature and state them
for utilization in vortex filament methods. Using the Hasimoto transformation, we arrive at a nonlinear
integro-differential equation which reduces to a modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger type evolution
of the curvature and torsion on the vortex line. We show that this modification seeks to disperse
localized curvature profiles. At the same time, the non-Hamiltonian break in integrability bolsters
the deforming curvature profile and simulations show that this dynamic results in Kelvin wave propagation
along the dispersive vortex medium.
