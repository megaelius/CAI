Tunable dry adhesion is a crucial mechanism in compliant manipulation. The gripping force, mainly
originated from the van der Waals force between the adhesive composite and the object to be gripped,
can be controlled by reversibly varying the physical properties (e.g., stiffness) of the composite
via external stimuli. The maximal gripping force Fmax and its tunability depend on, among other
factors, the stress distribution on the gripping interface and its fracture dynamics (during detaching),
which in turn are determined by the composite microstructure. Here, we present a computational
framework for the modeling and design of a class of binary smart composites containing a porous low-melting-point
alloy (LMPA) phase and a polymer phase, in order to achieve desirable dynamically tunable dry adhesion.
In particular, we employ spatial correlation functions to quantify, model and represent the complex
bi-continuous microstructure of the composites, from which a wide spectrum of realistic virtual
3D composite microstructures can be generated using stochastic optimization. A recently developed
volume-compensated lattice-particle (VCLP) method is then employed to model the dynamic interfacial
fracture process to compute Fmax for different composite microstructures. We focus on the interface
defect tuning (IDT) mechanism for dry adhesion tuning enabled by the composite, in which the thermal
expansion of the LMPA phase due to Joule heating initializes small cracks on the adhesion interface,
subsequently causing the detachment of the gripper from the object due to interfacial fracture.
We find that for an optimal microstructure among the ones studied here, a 10-fold dynamic tuning
of Fmax before and after the thermal expansion of the LMPA phase can be achieved. Our computational
results can provide valuable guidance for experimental fabrication of the LMPA-polymer composites.
