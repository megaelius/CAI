The optimal design of DNA origami systems that assemble rapidly and robustly is hampered by the lack
of a model for self-assembly that is sufficiently detailed yet computationally tractable. Here,
we propose a model for DNA origami that strikes a balance between these two criteria by representing
these systems on a lattice at the level of binding domains. The free energy of hybridization between
individual binding domains is estimated with a nearest-neighbour model. Double helical segments
are treated as rigid rods, but we allow flexibility at points where the backbone of one of the strands
is interrupted, which provides a reasonably realistic representation of partially and fully assembled
states. Particular attention is paid to the constraints imposed by the double helical twist, as
they determine where strand crossovers between adjacent helices can occur. To improve the efficiency
of sampling configuration space, we develop Monte Carlo methods for sampling scaffold conformations
in near-assembled states, and we carry out simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, enabling
us to avoid considering states with unbound staples. We demonstrate that our model can quickly sample
assembled configurations of a small origami design previously studied with the oxDNA model, as
well as a design with staples that span longer segments of the scaffold. The sampling ability of our
method should allow for good statistics to be obtained when studying the assembly pathways, and
is suited to investigating in particular the effects of design and assembly conditions on these
pathways and their resulting final assembled structures.
