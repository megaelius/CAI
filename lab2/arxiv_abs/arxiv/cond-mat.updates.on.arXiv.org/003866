AlN is an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor which has been developed for applications including
power electronics and optoelectronics. Thermal management of these applications is the key for
stable device performance and allowing for long lifetimes. AlN, with its potentially high thermal
conductivity, can play an important role serving as a dielectric layer, growth substrate, and heat
spreader to improve device performance. However, the intrinsic high thermal conductivity of bulk
AlN predicted by theoretical calculations has not been experimentally observed because of the
difficulty in producing materials with low vacancy and impurity levels, and other associated defect
complexes in AlN which can decrease the thermal conductivity. This work reports the growth of thick
AlN layers by MOCVD with an air-pocketed AlN layer and the first experimental observation of intrinsic
thermal conductivity from 130 K to 480 K that matches density-function-theory calculations for
single crystal AlN, producing some of the highest values ever measured. Detailed material characterizations
confirm the high quality of these AlN samples with one or two orders of magnitude lower impurity concentrations
than seen in commercially available bulk AlN. Measurements of these commercially available bulk
AlN substrates from 80 K to 480 K demonstrated a lower thermal conductivity, as expected. A theoretical
thermal model is built to interpret the measured temperature dependent thermal conductivity.
Our work demonstrates that it is possible to obtain theoretically high values of thermal conductivity
in AlN and such films may impact the thermal management and reliability of future electronic and
optoelectronics devices.
