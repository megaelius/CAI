The time-dependent numerical renormalization group method (TDNRG) [Anders et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 95}, 196801 (2005)] was recently generalized to multiple quenches and arbitrary finite
temperatures [Nghiem et al., Phys. Rev. B {\bf 89}, 075118 (2014)] by using the full density matrix
approach [Weichselbaum et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 99}, 076402 (2007)]. In this paper, we numerically
implement this formalism to study the response of a quantum impurity system to a general pulse and
periodic driving which are approximated by a sufficient number of quenches. We show how the NRG approximation
affects the trace of the projected density matrices and the continuity of the time-evolution of
a local observable. For the general pulse case, the local observable in the long-time limit exhibits
a dependence on the switch-on time, the time interval between the first and last quenches, as well
as on the pulse shape. In particular, the long-time limit is improved for longer switch-on times
and smoother pulses. This lends support to our earlier suggestion that the long-time limit of observables
can be improved by replacing a sudden large quench by a sequence of smaller ones acting over a finite
time-interval: longer switch-on times and smoother pulses, i.e., increased adiabaticity, favor
relaxation of the system to its correct thermodynamic long-time limit. For the case of periodic
driving, we compare the TDNRG results to exact analytic ones for the non-interacting resonant level
model, finding better agreement at short to intermediate time scales in the case of smoother driving.
Finally, we demonstrate the validity of the multiple-quench TDNRG formalism for arbitrary temperatures
by studying the time-evolution of the occupation number in the Anderson impurity model in response
to a periodic switching of the local level from the mixed valence to the Kondo regime at finite temperatures.
