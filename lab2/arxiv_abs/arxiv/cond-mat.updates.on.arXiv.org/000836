The interplay between Kondo effect, indirect magnetic interaction and geometrical frustration
is studied in the Kondo lattice on the one-dimensional zig-zag ladder. Using the density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG), the ground state and various short- and long-range spin- and density-correlation
functions are calculated for the model at half-filling as a function of the antiferromagnetic Kondo
interaction down to $J=0.3t$ where $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping. Geometrical frustration
is shown to lead to at least two critical points: Starting from the strong-$J$ limit, where almost
local Kondo screening dominates and where the system is a nonmagnetic Kondo insulator, antiferromagnetic
correlations between nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor local spins become stronger
and stronger, until at $J^{\rm dim}_{\rm c} \approx 0.89t$ frustration is alleviated by a spontaneous
breaking of translational symmetry and a corresponding transition to a dimerized state. This is
characterized by antiferromagnetic correlations along the legs and by alternating antiferro-
and ferromagnetic correlations on the rungs of the ladder. A mechanism of partial Kondo screening
that has been suggested for the Kondo lattice on the triangular lattice is not realized in the one-dimensional
case; a generalized dimerization mechanism, however, represents a conceivable way to cope with
frustration in two dimensions as well. Furthermore, within the symmetry-broken dimerized state,
a magnetic transition to a $90^{\circ}$ quantum spin spiral with quasi-long-range order is found
at $J^{\rm mag}_{\rm c} \approx 0.84t$. The quantum-critical point is characterized by a diverging
spin-structure factor $S(q)$ at wave vector $q=\pi/2$ and the closure of the spin gap. This is opposed
to the model on the simple chain, which is known to have a finite spin gap for all $J>0$ at half-filling.
