We report some novel properties of a square lattice filled with white sites, randomly occupied by
black sites (with probability $p$). We consider connections up to second nearest neighbours, according
to the following rule. Edge-sharing sites, i.e. nearest neighbours of similar type are always considered
to belong to the same cluster. A pair of black corner-sharing sites, i.e. second nearest neighbours
may form a 'cross-connection' with a pair of white corner-sharing sites. In this case assigning
connected status to both pairs simultaneously, makes the system quasi-three dimensional, with
intertwined black and white clusters. The two-dimensional character of the system is preserved
by considering the black diagonal pair to be connected with a probability $q$, in which case the crossing
white pair of sites are deemed disjoint. If the black pair is disjoint, the white pair is considered
connected. In this scenario we investigate (i) the variation of the Euler number $\chi(p) \ [=N_B(p)-N_W(p)]$
versus $p$ graph for varying $q$, (ii) variation of the site percolation threshold with $q$ and (iii)
size distribution of the black clusters for varying $p$, when $q=0.5$. Here $N_B$ is the number of
black clusters and $N_W$ is the number of white clusters, at a certain probability $p$. We also discuss
the earlier proposed 'Island-Mainland' transition (Khatun, T., Dutta, T. & Tarafdar, S. Eur. Phys.
J. B (2017) 90: 213) and show mathematically that the proposed transition is not, in fact, a critical
phase transition and does not survive finite size scaling. It is also explained mathematically
why clusters of size 1 are always the most numerous.
