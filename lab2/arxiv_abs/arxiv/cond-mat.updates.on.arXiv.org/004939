Out-of-equilibrium, strong correlation in a many-body system triggers emergent properties that
can act in important ways to constrain the natural dissipation of energy and matter. Networks of
atoms, intricately engineered to arrange positions and tune interaction energies, exhibit striking
dynamics. But, strong correlation itself can also act to restrict available phase space. Relaxation
confined by strong correlation gives rise to scale invariance and density distributions characteristic
of self-organized criticality. For some time, we have observed signs of self-organization in the
avalanche, bifurcation and quench of a state-selected Rydberg gas of nitric oxide to form an ultracold,
strongly correlated ultracold plasma. The robust arrested relaxation of this system forms a disordered
state with quantum-mechanical properties that appear to support a coherent destruction of transport.
Work reported here focuses on initial stages of avalanche and quench, using the mm-wave spectroscopy
of an embedded quantum probe to characterize the intermolecular interaction dynamics associated
with the evolution to plasma. Double-resonance excitation prepares a Rydberg gas of nitric oxide
composed of a single selected state, $n_0f(2)$. Penning ionization, followed by an avalanche of
electron-Rydberg collisions, forms a plasma of NO$^+$ ions and weakly bound electrons, in which
a residual population of $n_0$ Rydberg molecules evolves to high-$\ell$. At long times, $n_0\ell(2)
\rightarrow (n_0 \pm 1)d(2)$ depletion resonances signal collision-free energy redistribution
in the basis of central-field Rydberg states. The widths and asymmetries of Fano lineshapes witness
the degree to which coupling to the arrested bath broadens the bright state as well as how bright-state
predissociation mixes the network of levels in the localized ensemble.
