For an MD system representing a monatomic liquid, the distribution of $3N$-dimensional potential
energy structures consists of two classes, random and symmetric. This distribution is shown and
discussed for liquid Na. The random class constitutes the liquid phase domain. In V-T theory, the
liquid atomic motion consists of prescribed vibrations in a random valley, plus parameterized
transit motions between valleys. The theory has been strongly verified at 395.1K, a bit above melting.
Our goal here is to test this theory for its ability to explain the temperature ($T$) dependence of
the mean square displacement (MSD) at $T\leq395.1$K. The test results are positive at 204.6K, where
the time evolution equations, controlled by a transit rate decreasing with $T$, accurately account
for MD data for the MSD. To test at significantly lower $T$, where the MD system does not remain in the
liquid phase, the theoretical liquid MSD is calibrated for $T\leq$ 204.6K. The Kob-Andersen (K-A)
dynamic slowing down graph is shown for liquid Na at $T\leq395.1$K. The following observations
are discussed in terms of the atomic motion. (a) The agreement between pure vibrational motion and
MD data for time correlation functions in the vibrational interval is so far highly accurate. (b)
The "bump" ahead of the plateau in the MSD at low $T$ is attributed to the vibrational excess. (c) The
K-A graph from theory for liquid Na, and the same graphs from MD data for a liquid Lennard-Jones binary
mixture (BMLJ) and liquid silica, are identical in the ballistic period and in the purely diffusive
time interval. (d) The glass transition proceeds in the symmetric manifold. These and other discussions
confirm that V-T theory can explain the $T$ dependence observed in K-A graphs.
