We study a variant of the cyclic Lotka-Volterra model with three-agent interactions. Inspired
by a multiplayer variation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, the model describes an ideal ecosystem
in which cyclic competition among three species develops through cooperative predation. Its rate
equations in a well-mixed environment display a degenerate Hopf bifurcation, occurring as reactions
involving two predators plus one prey have the same rate as reactions involving two preys plus one
predator. We estimate the magnitude of the stochastic noise at the bifurcation point, where finite
size effects turn neutrally stable orbits into erratically diverging trajectories. In particular,
we compare analytic predictions for the extinction probability, derived in the Fokker-Planck
approximation, with numerical simulations based on the Gillespie stochastic algorithm. We then
extend the analysis of the phase portrait to heterogeneous rates. In a well-mixed environment,
we observe a continuum of degenerate Hopf bifurcations, generalizing the above one. Neutral stability
ensues from a complex equilibrium between different reactions. Remarkably, on a two-dimensional
lattice, all bifurcations disappear as a consequence of the spatial locality of the interactions.
In the second part of the paper, we investigate the effects of mobility in a lattice metapopulation
model with patches hosting several agents. We find that strategies propagate along the arms of rotating
spirals, as they usually do in models of cyclic dominance. We observe propagation instabilities
in the regime of large wavelengths. We also examine three-agent interactions inducing nonlinear
diffusion.
