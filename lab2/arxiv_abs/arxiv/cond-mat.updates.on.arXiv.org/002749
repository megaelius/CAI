Electron transport in clean 2D systems with weak electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling can transition
from an Ohmic to a ballistic or a hydrodynamic regime. The ballistic regime occurs when electron-electron
(e-e) scattering is weak whereas the hydrodynamic regime arises when this scattering is strong.
Despite this difference, we find that vortices and a negative nonlocal resistance believed to be
quintessentially hydrodynamic are equally characteristic of the ballistic regime. These non-Ohmic
regimes cannot be distinguished in DC transport without changing experimental conditions. Further,
as our kinetic calculations show, the hydrodynamic regime in DC transport is highly fragile and
is wiped out by even sparse disorder and e-ph scattering. We show that microwave-frequency AC sources
by contrast readily excite hydrodynamic modes with current vortices that are robust to disorder
and e-ph scattering. Indeed, current reversals in the non-Ohmic regimes occur via repeated vortex
generation and mergers through reconnections, as in classical 2D fluids. Crucially, AC sources
give rise to strong correlations across the entire device that unambiguously distinguish all regimes.
These correlations in the form of nonlocal current-voltage and voltage-voltage phases directly
check for the presence of a nonlocal current-voltage relation signifying the onset of non-Ohmic
behavior as well as also for the dominance of bulk interactions, needed to confirm the presence of
a hydrodynamic regime. We use these probes to demarcate all regimes in an experimentally realizable
graphene device and find that the ballistic regime has a much larger extent in parameter space than
the hydrodynamic regime.
