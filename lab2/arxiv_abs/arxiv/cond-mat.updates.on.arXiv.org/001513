Controlling morphology-structure of metallic colloids is an unusual phenomenon. Here, various
shape-structure of colloidal particles are synthesized and are investigated for different process
parameters. At solution surface, different tiny shaped particles of gold are developed where packets
of nano shape energy converted monolayer assembly into their own shape depending on the ratio of
bipolar pulse OFF to ON time. Tiny particles of joint triangular shape developed under the certain
bipolar pulse time and are separated by themselves on exerting force of surface format at their perturbed
axis between the points of connection. However, under unipolar pulse, triangular-shaped tiny
particles developed directly as the placed packets of nano shape energy in single triangle. Atoms
of one-dimensional arrays of various tiny particles elongate as per available force where their
developed structure of smooth elements deal dominating force at tip resulting into pack at common
centre to develop particles of various anisotropy and geometry. When the ratio of bipolar pulse
OFF to ON time is very large, the resulting particles are distorted while those developed at smaller
values of this ratio reveal geometric anisotropic shapes. When the ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to
ON time is 3, resulted particles reveal low aspect ratio to those developed at the inverse value of
this ratio. At longer pulse ON time, tiny particles developed in structure of smooth elements having
width less than inter-spacing distance where increased density of travelling photons at interface
better align electrons of non-orientational stretching of clamping energy knots in their atoms.
When elongated atoms of tiny particles misaligned at an extended level, stretched energy knots
clamped electrons which could not recover under the forcing energies of travelling photons where
their structure is messed up.
