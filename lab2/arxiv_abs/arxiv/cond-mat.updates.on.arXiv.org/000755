Heat sources whose characteristic dimension $R$ is comparable to phonon mean free paths display
thermal resistances that exceed conventional diffusive predictions. This has direct implications
to (opto)electronics thermal management and phonon spectroscopy. Theoretical analyses have
so far limited themselves to particular experimental configurations. Here, we build upon the multidimensional
Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to derive universal expressions for the apparent conductivity
suppression $S(R) = \kappa_{\text{eff}}(R)/\kappa_{\text{bulk}}$ experienced by radially
symmetric 2D and 3D sources. In striking analogy to cross-plane heat conduction in thin films, a
distinct quasiballistic regime emerges between ballistic ($\kappa_{\text{eff}} \sim R$) and
diffusive ($\kappa_{\text{eff}} \simeq \kappa_{\text{bulk}}$) asymptotes that displays a
logarithmic dependence $\kappa_{\text{eff}} \sim \ln(R)$ in single crystals and fractional
power dependence $\kappa_{\text{eff}} \sim R^{2-\alpha}$ in alloys (with $\alpha$ the L\'evy
superdiffusion exponent). Analytical solutions and Monte Carlo simulations for spherical and
circular heat sources in Si, GaAs, Si$_{0.99}$Ge$_{0.01}$ and Si$_{0.82}$Ge$_{0.18}$, all carried
out from first principles, confirm the predicted generic tendencies. Contrary to the thin film
case, common approximations like kinetic theory estimates $\kappa_{\text{eff}} \simeq \sum
S_{\omega}^{\text{grey}} \, \kappa_{\omega}$ and modified Fourier temperature curves perform
relatively poorly. Up to threefold deviations from the BTE solutions for sub-100$\,$nm sources
underline the need for rigorous treatment of multidimensional nondiffusive transport.
