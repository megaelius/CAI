The nucleation and growth of pure titanium nanoparticles in a low-pressure sputter plasma has been
believed to be essentially impossible. The addition of impurities, such as oxygen or water, facilitates
this and allows the growth of nanoparticles. However, it seems that this rout requires so high oxygen
densities that metallic nanoparticles in the hexagonal Ti-phase cannot be synthesized. Here we
present a model which explains results for the nucleation and growth of titanium nanoparticles
in the absent of reactive impurities. In these experiments, a high partial pressure of helium gas
was added which increased the cooling rate the process gas in the region where nucleation occurred.
This is important for two reasons. First, a reduced gas temperature enhances Ti2 dimer formation
mainly because a lower gas temperature gives a higher gas density, which reduces the dilution of
the Ti vapor through diffusion. The same effect can be achieved by increasing the gas pressure. Second,
a reduced gas temperature has a "more than exponential" effect in lowering the rate of atom evaporation
from the nanoparticles during their growth from a dimer to size where they are thermodynamically
stable, r*. We show that this early stage evaporation is not possible to model thermodynamically.
Instead, the single-event nature of the evaporation process has to be considered. This leads to
an evaporation probability from nanoparticles that is exactly zero below a critical nanoparticle
temperature that is size-dependent. Together, the mechanisms above explain two experimentally
found limits for nucleation in an oxygen-free environment. First, there is a lower limit to the pressure
for dimer formation. Second, there is an upper limit to the gas temperature above which evaporation
makes the further growth to stable nuclei impossible.
