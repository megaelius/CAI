Ga2O3 has attracted great attention for electronic device applications due to its ultra-wide bandgap,
high breakdown electric field, and large-area affordable substrates grown from the melt. However,
its thermal conductivity is significantly lower than that of other wide bandgap semiconductors,
which will impact its ability to be used in high power density applications. Thermal management
in Ga2O3 electronics will be the key for device reliability, especially for high power and high frequency
devices. Similar to the method of cooling GaN-based high electron mobility transistors by integrating
it with high thermal conductivity diamond substrates, this work studies the possibility of heterogeneous
integration of Ga2O3 with diamond for thermal management of Ga2O3 devices. In this work, Ga2O3 was
deposited onto single crystal diamond substrates by ALD and the thermal properties of ALD-Ga2O3
thin films and Ga2O3-diamond interfaces with different interface pretreatments were measured
by TDTR. We observed very low thermal conductivity of these Ga2O3 thin films due to the extensive
phonon grain boundary scattering resulting from the nanocrystalline nature of the Ga2O3 film.
However, the measured thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of the Ga2O3-diamond interfaces are
about 10 times larger than that of the Van der Waals bonded Ga2O3 diamond interfaces, which indicates
the significant impact of interface bonding on TBC. Furthermore, the TBC of the Ga-rich and O-rich
Ga2O3-diamond interfaces are about 20% smaller than that of the clean interface, indicating interface
chemistry affects interfacial thermal transport. Overall, this study shows that a high TBC can
be obtained from strong interfacial bonds across Ga2O3-diamond interfaces, providing a promising
route to improving the heat dissipation from Ga2O3 devices.
