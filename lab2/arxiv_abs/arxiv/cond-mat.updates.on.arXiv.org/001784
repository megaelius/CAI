Environmental contamination and human exposure to dyes have dramatically increased over the past
decades because of their increasing use in such industries as textiles, paper, plastics, tannery
and paints. These dyes can cause deterioration in water quality by imparting color to the water and
inducing the photosynthetic activity of aquatic organisms by hindering light penetration. Moreover,
some of the dyes are considered carcinogenic and mutagenic for human health. Therefore, efficient
treatment and removal of dyes from wastewater have attracted considerable attention in recent
years. Photocatalysis, due to its mild reaction condition, high degradation, broad applied area
and facile manipulation, is a promising method of solving environmental pollution problems. In
this paper, we report the synthesis of graphene oxide-tin oxide (GO-SnO2) nanocomposite and the
effectiveness of this composite in decolorizing Methylene Blue. Tin oxide was prepared by liquid
phase co-precipitation method and graphene oxide-tin oxide (GOSnO2) nanocomposite were prepared
by solution mixing method. Tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles have been ardently investigated as photocatalyst
for water purification and environment decontamination but the photon generated electron and
hole pair (EHP) recombination is one of the limiting factors. Graphene oxide-tin oxide (GO-SnO2)
nanocomposite is very propitious to overcome this limitation for photocatalytic application.
The as-synthesized graphene oxide (GO) and GO-SnO2 nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray
Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX). The GO-SnO2 nanocomposite showed better photocatalytic degradation efficiency for Methylene
Blue compared to SnO2 and Graphene oxide. Keywords: Graphene Oxide(GO),Methylene Blue, Nanocomposite,
