Topological photonics has emerged as a novel route to engineer the flow of light. Topologically-protected
photonic edge modes, which are supported at the perimeters of topologically-nontrivial insulating
bulk structures, have been of particular interest as they may enable low-loss optical waveguides
immune to structural disorder. Very recently, there is a sharp rise of interest in introducing gain
materials into such topological photonic structures, primarily aiming at revolu-tionizing semiconductor
lasers with the aid of physical mechanisms existing in topological physics. Examples of re-markable
realizations are topological lasers with unidirectional light output under time-reversal symmetry
breaking and topologically-protected polariton and micro/nano-cavity lasers. Moreover, the
introduction of gain and loss provides a fascinating playground to explore novel topological phases,
which are in close relevance to non-Hermitian and parity-time symmetric quantum physics and are
in general difficult to access using fermionic condensed matter systems. Here, we review the cutting-edge
research on active topological photonics, in which optical gain plays a pivotal role. We discuss
recent realizations of topological lasers of various kinds, together with the underlying physics
explaining the emergence of topological edge modes. In such demonstrations, the optical modes
of the topological lasers are deter-mined by the dielectric structures and support lasing oscillation
with the help of optical gain. We also address recent researches on topological photonic systems
in which gain and loss themselves essentially influence on topological prop-erties of the bulk
systems. We believe that active topological photonics provides powerful means to advance mi-cro/nanophotonics
systems for diverse applications and topological physics itself as well.
