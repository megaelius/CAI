Generally, one has two strategies to achieve magnetic frustration: through geometric means or
interactions with different length scales. As the former leads to much simpler theoretical treatments
it is favored and so magnetic sublattices with geometric frustration are sought after. One approach
to finding such lattices is to design them chemically by using non-magnetic linker ligands. Here
we report on the magnetic properties of one such family of materials, the transition metal ($TM$)
selenite hydrate compounds chemical formula $TM_3$(SeO$_3$)$_3$H$_2$O . These materials link
highly distorted $TM$O$_6$ octahedra via non-magnetic [SeO$_3$]$^{2+}$ linkers. Using $TM$
= Mn, Co and Ni we report on the structural effects of changing the $TM$ site and how they may influence
the magnetic structure. Using magnetic susceptibility and neutron powder diffraction we identify
low temperature magnetic transitions for all three compounds characterized by the onset of long-range
AFM order with moderate frustration indexes. Consideration of the magnetic structures reveal
that the magnetic order is sensitive to the $TM$ site ion and is tunable as it is changed - especially
from Mn to Co - with changes in both the moment direction and the ordering vector. Field dependent
susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal metamagnetic transitions in both Mn$_3$(SeO$_3$)$_3$H$_2$O
and Co$_3$(SeO$_3$)$_3$H$_2$O indicating nearby magnetic ground states accessible under relatively
small applied fields. Density functional theory calculations broadly confirm these results,
showing both a sensitivity of the magnetic structure to the $TM$ and its local environment. Although
no spin liquid behavior is achieved, these results suggest the fruitfulness of such synthesis philosophies
and encourage future work to engender higher frustration in these materials via doping, field,
pressure or larger linker ligands.
