Three-dimensional topological insulators (TI's) in proximity with superconductors are expected
to exhibit exotic phenomena such as topological superconductivity (TSC) and Majorana bound states
(MBS), which may have applications in topological quantum computation. In superconductor-TI-superconductor
Josephson junctions, the supercurrent versus the phase difference between the superconductors,
referred to as the current-phase relation (CPR), reveals important information including the
nature of the superconducting transport. Here, we study the induced superconductivity in gate-tunable
Josephson junctions (JJs) made from topological insulator BiSbTeSe2 with superconducting Nb
electrodes. We observe highly skewed (non-sinusoidal) CPR in these junctions. The critical current,
or the magnitude of the CPR, increases with decreasing temperature down to the lowest accessible
temperature (T ~ 20 mK), revealing the existence of low-energy modes in our junctions. The gate dependence
shows that close to the Dirac point the CPR becomes less skewed, indicating the transport is more
diffusive, most likely due to the presence of electron/hole puddles and charge inhomogeneity.
Our experiments provide strong evidence that superconductivity is induced in the highly ballistic
topological surface states (TSS) in our gate-tunable TI- based JJs. Furthermore, the measured
CPR is in good agreement with the prediction of a model which calculates the phase dependent eigenstate
energies in our system, considering the finite width of the electrodes as well as the TSS wave functions
extending over the entire circumference of the TI.
