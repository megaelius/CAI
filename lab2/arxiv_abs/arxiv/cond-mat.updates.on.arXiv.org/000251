By means of space-group symmetry arguments, we argue that the electronic pairing in iron-based
high temperature superconductors shows a structure which is a linear combination of planar s-wave
and d-wave symmetry channels, both preserving the 3-dimensional A_1g irreducible representation
of the corresponding crystal point-group. We demonstrate that the s- and d-wave channels are determined
by the parity under reflection of the electronic orbitals through the iron planes, and by improper
rotations around the iron sites. We provide evidence of these general properties by performing
accurate quantum Monte Carlo ab-initio calculations of the pairing function, for a FeSe lattice
with tetragonal experimental geometry at ambient pressure. We find that this picture survives
even in the FeSe under pressure and at low temperatures, when the tetragonal point-group symmetry
is slightly broken. In order to achieve a higher resolution in momentum space we introduce a BCS model
that faithfully describes our QMC variational pairing function on the simulated 4x4 FeSe unit cell.
This allows us to provide a k-resolved image of the pairing function, and show that non-isotropic
contributions in the BCS gap function are related to the improper s-wave symmetry. Our theory can
rationalize and explain a series of contradictory experimental findings, such as the observation
of twofold symmetry in the FeSe superconducting phase, the anomalous drop of T_c with Co-impurity
in LaFeAsO_(1-x)F_x, the s-to-d-wave gap transition in BaFe_2As_2 under K doping, and the nodes
appearing in the LiFeAs superconducting gap upon P isovalent substitution.
