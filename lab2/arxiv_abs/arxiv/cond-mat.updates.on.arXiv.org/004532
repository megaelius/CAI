Beyond Bose and Fermi statistics, there still exist various kinds of generalized quantum statistics.
Two ways to approach generalized quantum statistics: (1) in quantum mechanics, generalize the
permutation symmetry of the wave function and (2) in statistical mechanics, generalize the maximum
occupation number of quantum statistics. The connection between these two approaches, however,
is obscure. In this paper, we suggest a unified framework to describe various kinds of generalized
quantum statistics. We first provide a general formula of canonical partition functions of ideal
$N$-particle gases obeying various kinds of generalized quantum statistics. Then we reveal the
connection between the permutation phase of the wave function and the maximum occupation number,
through constructing a method to obtain the permutation phase and the maximum occupation number
from the canonical partition function. In our scheme, the permutation phase of wave functions is
generalized to a matrix phase, rather than a number. It is commonly accepted that different kinds
of statistics are distinguished by the maximum number. We show that the maximum occupation number
is not sufficient to distinguish different kinds of generalized quantum statistics. As examples,
we discuss a series of generalized quantum statistics in the unified framework, giving the corresponding
canonical partition functions, maximum occupation numbers, and the permutation phase of wave
functions. Especially, we propose three new kinds of generalized quantum statistics which seem
to be the missing pieces in the puzzle. The mathematical basis of the scheme are the mathematical
theory of the invariant matrix, the Schur-Weyl duality, the symmetric function, and the representation
theory of the permutation group and the unitary group. The result in this paper builds a bridge between
the statistical mechanics and such mathematical theories.
