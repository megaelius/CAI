The origin of incommensurate structural modulation in Ni-Mn based Heusler type magnetic shape
memory alloys (MSMAs) is still an unresolved issue inspite of intense focus on this due to its role
in the magnetic field induced ultra-high strains. In the archetypal MSMA Ni2MnGa, the observation
of non-uniform displacement of atoms from their mean positions in the modulated martensite phase,
premartensite phase and charge density wave as well as the presence of phason broadening of satellite
peaks have been taken in support of the electronic instability model linked with a soft acoustic
phonon. We present here results of a combined high resolution synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction
(SXRPD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) study on Ni2Mn1.4In0.6 using (3+1)D superspace group
approach, which reveal not only uniform atomic displacements in the modulated structure of the
martensite phase with physically acceptable ordered magnetic moments in the antiferromagnetic
phase at low temperatures but also the absence of any premartensite phase and phason broadening
of the satellite peaks. Our HRTEM studies and first principles calculations of the ground state
also support uniform atomic displacements predicted by powder diffraction studies. All these
observations suggest that the structural modulation in the martensite phase of Ni2Mn1.4In0.6
MSMA can be explained in terms of the adaptive phase model. The present study underlines the importance
of superspace group analysis using complimentary SXRPD and NPD in understanding the physics of
the origin of modulation as well as the magnetic and the modulated ground states of the Heusler type
MSMAs. Our work also highlights the fact that the mechanism responsible for the origin of modulated
structure in different Ni-Mn based MSMAs may not be universal and it must be investigated thoroughly
in different alloy compositions.
