Group IV and V monolayers are very crucial 2D materials for their high carrier mobilities, tunable
band gaps, and optical linear dichroism. Very recently, a novel group IV-V binary compound, Sn2Bi,
has been synthesized on silicon substrate, and has shown very interesting electronic and thermoelectric
properties. Further investigations show that show that the monolayer would be stable in freestanding
form by hydrogenation. Inspired by this, by means of ab-initio calculations, we systematically
predict and investigate eight counterparts of Sn2Bi, namely Si2P, Si2As, Si2Sb, Si2Bi, Ge2P, Ge2As,
Ge2Sb, and Ge2Bi. The cohesive energies, phonon dispersions, and AIMD calculations show that,
similar to Sn2Bi, all of these freestanding monolayers are stable when they are hydrogenated. These
hydrogenated monolayers are semiconductors with wide band gaps, which are favorable for opto-electronic
purposes. The Si2Y and Ge2Y structures possess indirect and direct band gaps, respectively. They
represent very interesting optical characteristics, such as good absorption in the visible region
and linear dichroism, which are crucial for solar cell and beam-splitting devices, respectively.
Moreover, the Ge2P and Si2Sb monolayers are promising for highspeed nano-electronic devices,
because of their high carrier mobility, whereas Si2Bi, Ge2P, and Si2As monolayers are suitable
candidates for thermoelectricity. Finally, the Si2Sb and Si2Bi monolayers have suitable band
gaps and band edge positions for photocatalytic water splitting. Summarily, our investigations
offer very interesting and promising properties for this family of binary compounds. We hope that
our predictions open ways to new experimental studies and fabrication of suitable 2D materials
for next generation opto-electronic, thermoelectric, and photocatalytic devices.
