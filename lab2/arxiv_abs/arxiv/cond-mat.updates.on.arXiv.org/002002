Bloch oscillations originate from the translational symmetry of crystals. These oscillations
occur with a fundamental period that a semiclassical wavepacket takes to traverse a Brillouin-zone
loop. We introduce a new type of Bloch oscillations whose periodicity is an integer ($\mu{>}1$)
multiple of the fundamental period. The period multiplier $\mu$ is a topological invariant protected
by the space groups of crystals, which include more than just translational symmetries. For example,
$\mu$ divides $n$ for crystals with an $n$-fold rotational or screw symmetry; with a reflection,
inversion or glide symmetry, $\mu$ equals two. We identify the commonality underlying all period-multiplied
oscillations: the multi-band Berry-Zak phases, which encode the holonomy of adiabatic transport
of Bloch functions in quasimomentum space, differ pairwise by integer multiples of $2\pi/\mu$.
For a class of multi-band subspaces whose projected-position operators commute, period multiplication
has a complementary explanation through the real space distribution of Wannier functions. This
complementarity follows from a one-to-one correspondence between Berry-Zak phases and the centers
of Wannier functions. A Wannier description of period multiplication does not always exist, as
we exemplify with band subspaces with either a nonzero Chern number or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Kane-Mele
topological order. To help identify band subspaces with $\mu{>}1$, a general theorem is presented
that outputs Zak phases that are symmetry-protected to integer multiples of $2\pi/n$, given the
point-group symmetry representation of any gapped band subspace. A cold-atomic experiment that
has observed period-multiplied Bloch oscillations is discussed, and directions are provided
for future experiments.
