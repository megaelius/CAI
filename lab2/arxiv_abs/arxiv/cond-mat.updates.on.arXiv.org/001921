Kesterite I$_2$-II-IV-V$_4$ semiconductors are promising solar absorbers for photovoltaics
applications. The band gap and it's character, either direct or indirect, are fundamental properties
determining photovoltaic-device efficiency. We use a combination of accurate first-principles
calculations and machine learning to predict the properties of the band gap for a large number of
kesterite I$_2$-II-IV-V$_4$ semiconductors. In determining the magnitude of the fundamental
gap, we compare results for a number of machine-learning models, and achieve a root mean squared
error as low as 283 meV; the best results are achieved using support-vector regression with a radial-bias
kernel. This error is well within the uncertainty of even the most advanced first-principles methods
for calculating semiconductor band gaps. Predicting the direct--indirect property of the band
gap is more challenging. After significant feature engineering, we are able to train a classifier
that predicts the nature of the band gap with an accuracy of 89 \% using logistic regression. Using
these trained models, the band gap properties of 1568 kesterite I$_2$-II-IV-V$_4$ compounds are
predicted. We find 717 compounds with band gaps in the range 0.5 -- 2.5 eV that can potentially act
as solar absorbers, and 242 materials with a band gap in the ``\emph{optimum range}" of 1.2 -- 1.8
eV. The stability of these 242 compounds is assessed by calculating the Energy Above Hull using the
Materials Project database, and the band gaps are verified using hybrid functional calculations;
in the end, we identify 25 compounds that are expected to be synthesizable, and have a band gap in the
range 1.2 -- 1.8 eV -- most of which are previously unexplored. These results will be useful in the
materials engineering of efficient photovoltaic devices.
