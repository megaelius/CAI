Cost-affordable phenolic membranes having gradient nanostructures can be facilely synthesized
from resol oligomers in the presence of ZnCl2 and poloxamers. The gradient nanostructures are formed
by stacking phenolic nanoparticles with gradually enlarged diameters as the distance from the
upper surface increases. The use of poloxamers for creating gelation surroundings is of great significance
for controlling the growth of phenolic nanoparticles, which in turn dictates the performance of
the phenolic membranes thus-produced. Hence, a study of the effects of poloxamers species on the
preparation of the phenolic membranes is highly demanded since such robust membranes have much
potential to be scale up for mass production. Herein, the poloxamer Pluronic F127 (EO106-PO70-EO106;
EO = ethyleneoxide, PO = propyleneoxide) was introduced in the membrane-forming formulations.
As opposed to P123 (EO20-PO70-EO20) that we used previously, F127 possessing extended PEO chains
can delay the gelation during membrane formation. Hence, the phenolic nucleates are able to grow
for longer durations, leading to the generation of more distinct gradient nanostructures in the
phenolic membranes. Enhanced permeance can then be realized with F127-derived phenolic membranes.
We also demonstrate that L31 (EO1-PO22-EO1) with merely single terminal EO units at the ends of the
PPO block could be used to prepare gradient phenolic membranes. This work is not only much helpful
to deeply understand the design of the structural gradient in phenolic membranes, but capable of
sheding light on the development of such intriguing structures for water purification.
