Adsorption of CO$_2$ on a semiconductor surface is a prerequisite for its photocatalytic reduction.
Owing to superior photocorrosion resistance, nontoxicity and suitable band edge positions, TiO$_2$
is considered to be the most efficient photocatalyst for facilitating redox reactions. However,
due to the absence of adequate understanding of the mechanism of adsorption, the CO$_2$ conversion
efficiency on TiO$_2$ surfaces has not been maximized. While anatase TiO$_2$ (101) is the most stable
facet, the (001) surface is more reactive and it has been experimentally shown that the stability
can be reversed and a larger percentage (up to ~ 89%) of the (001) facet can be synthesized in the presence
fluorine ions. Therefore, through density functional calculations we have investigated the CO$_2$
adsorption on TiO$_2$ (001) surface. We have developed a three-state quantum-mechanical model
that explains the mechanism of chemisorption, leading to the formation of a tridentate carbonate
complex. The electronic structure analysis reveals that the CO$_2$-TiO$_2$ interaction at the
surface is uniaxial and long ranged, which gives rise to anisotropy in binding energy (BE). It negates
the widely perceived one-to-one correspondence between coverage and BE and infers that the spatial
distribution of CO$_2$ primarily determines the BE. A conceptual experiment is devised where the
CO$_2$ concentration and flow direction can be controlled to tune the BE within a large window of
~1.5 eV. The experiment also reveals that a maximum of 50% coverage can be achieved for chemisorption.
In the presence of water, the activated carbonate complex forms a bicarbonate complex by overcoming
a potential barrier of ~0.9 eV.
