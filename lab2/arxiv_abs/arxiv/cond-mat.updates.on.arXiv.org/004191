Dirac materials are of great interest as condensed matter realizations of the Dirac and Weyl equations.
In particular, they serve as a starting point for the study of topological phases. This physics has
been extensively studied in electronic systems such as graphene, Weyl- and Dirac semi-metals.
In contrast, recent studies have highlighted several examples of Dirac-like cones in collective
excitation spectra, viz. in phonon, magnon and triplon bands. These cannot be directly related
to the Dirac or Weyl equations as they are bosonic in nature with pseudo-unitary band bases. In this
article, we show that any Dirac-like equation can be smoothly deformed into a form that is applicable
to bosonic bands. The resulting bosonic spectra bear a two-to-one relation to that of the parent
Dirac system. Their dispersions inherit several interesting properties including conical band
touching points and a gap-opening-role for `mass' terms. The relationship also extends to the band
eigenvectors with the bosonic states carrying the same Berry connections as the parent fermionic
states. The bosonic bands thus inherit topological character as well. If the parent fermionic system
has non-trivial topology that leads to mid-gap surface states, the bosonic analogue also hosts
surface states that lie within the corresponding band gap. The proposed bosonic Dirac structure
appears in several known models. In materials, it is realized in Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$ and
possibly in CoTiO$_3$ as well as in paramagnetic honeycomb ruthenates. Our results allow for a rigorous
understanding of Dirac phononic and magnonic systems and enable concrete predictions, e.g., of
surface states in magnonic topological insulators and Weyl semi-metals.
