(Ba/Sr)3NbFe3Si2O14 is a magnetoelectric multiferroic with an incommensurate antiferromagnetic
spiral magnetic structure which induces electric polarization at 26 K. The structure, as revealed
by x-rays and neutrons, as well as static and dynamic magnetic and dielectric properties of these
compounds have been studied down to 6 K under different conditions. Both the compounds have similar
crystal structure but with different lattice constants down to 6 K. The Ba-and Sr-compounds exhibit
a transition at 26 K and 25 K respectively, as indicated by the specific heat capacity and dc specific
magnetization, into an antiferromagnetic state. Although Ba and Sr are isovalent, they exhibit
very different static and dynamic magnetic behavior. The Ba-compound exhibits both thermal and
magnetic field hysteresis with the thermal hysteresis decreasing with increasing magnetic field,
a behavior typical of glasses. The glassy behavior is also clearly seen in the ac susceptibility
studies which show a dispersive peak in the range 40 K to 90 K in the frequency range 10^1 Hz to 10^4 Hz.
The dispersive behavior follows a cluster glass critical slowing dynamics with a freezing temperature
of 35 K and a critical exponent of 3.9, a value close to the 3-D Ising model. The Sr-compound however
does not exhibit any dispersive behavior except for the invariant transition at 25 K in ac susceptibility
with no magnetic field hysteresis at all temperatures. The dielectric constant studied in the frequency
range 10^1 Hz to 10^6 Hz also reflects the magnetic behavior of the two compounds. The Ba-compound
has two distinct dispersive peaks near TN and in the range 40 K to 125 K while the Sr-compound has a single
dispersive peak in the range 40 K to 80 K. The activation energy of the high temperature dispersive
peak in both compounds however is found to be similar, 71 meV and 65 meV respectively for Ba- and Sr-compounds.
