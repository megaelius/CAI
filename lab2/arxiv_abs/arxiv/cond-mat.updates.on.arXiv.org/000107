Electric-field-induced resistance switching (RS) phenomena have been studied for over 60 years
in metal/dielectrics/metal structures. In these experiments a wide range of dielectrics have
been studied including binary transition metal oxides, perovskite oxides, chalcogenides, carbon-
and silicon-based materials, as well as organic materials. RS phenomena can be used to store information
and offer an attractive performance, which encompasses fast switching speeds, high scalability,
and the desirable compatibility with Si-based complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication.
This is promising for nonvolatile memory technology, i.e. resistance random access memory (RRAM).
However, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism is still lacking. This impedes
a faster product development as well as an accurate assessment of the device performance potential.
Generally speaking, RS occurs not in the entire dielectric but only a small, confined region, which
results from the local variation of conductivity in dielectrics. In this review, we focus on the
RS in oxides with such an inhomogeneous conductivity. According to the origin of the conductivity
inhomogeneity, the RS phenomena and their working mechanism are reviewed by dividing them into
two aspects: interface RS, based on the change of contact resistance at metal/oxide interface due
to the change of Schottky barrier and interface chemical layer, and bulk RS, realized by the formation,
connection, and disconnection of conductive channels in the oxides. Finally the current challenges
of RS investigation and the potential improvement of the RS performance for the nonvolatile memories
are discussed.
