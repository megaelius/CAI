To explore the doping dependence of the recently discovered charge density wave (CDW) order in YBa2Cu3Oy,
we present a bulk-sensitive high-energy x-ray study for several oxygen concentrations, including
strongly underdoped YBa2Cu3O6.44. Combined with previous data around the so-called 1/8 doping,
we show that bulk CDW order exists at least for hole concentrations (p) in the CuO2 planes of 0.078
<~ p <~ 0.132. This implies that CDW order exists in close vicinity to the quantum critical
point for spin density wave (SDW) order. In contrast to the pseudogap temperature T*, the onset temperature
of CDW order decreases with underdoping to T_CDW ~ 90K in YBa2Cu3O6.44. Together with a weakened
order parameter this suggests a competition between CDW and SDW orders. In addition, the CDW order
in YBa2Cu3O6.44 shows the same type of competition with superconductivity as a function of temperature
and magnetic field as samples closer to p = 1/8. At low p the CDW incommensurability continues the
previously reported linear increasing trend with underdoping. In the entire doping range the in-plane
correlation length of the CDW order in b-axis direction depends only very weakly on the hole concentration,
and appears independent of the type and correlation length of the oxygen-chain order. The onset
temperature of the CDW order is remarkably close to a temperature T^\dagger that marks the maximum
of 1/(T_1T) in planar 63^Cu NQR/NMR experiments, potentially indicating a response of the spin
dynamics to the formation of the CDW. Our discussion of these findings includes a detailed comparison
to the charge stripe order in La2-xBaxCuO4.
