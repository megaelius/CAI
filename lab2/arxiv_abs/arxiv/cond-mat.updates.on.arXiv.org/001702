Current state of the art devices for detecting and manipulating Majorana fermions commonly consist
of networks of Majorana wires and tunnel junctions. We study a key ingredient of these networks -
a topological Josephson junction with charging energy - and pinpoint crucial features for device
implementation. The phase dependent tunneling term contains both the usual 2pi-periodic Josephson
term and a 4pi-periodic Majorana tunneling term representing the coupling between Majoranas on
both sides of the junction. In non-topological junctions when the charging energy is small compared
to the Josephson tunneling scale the low energy physics is described by 2pi phase slips. By contrast,
in a topological junction, due to the 4pi periodicity of the tunneling term it is usually expected
that only 4pi phase slips are possible while 2pi phase slips are suppressed. However, we find that
if the ratio between the strengths of the Majorana assisted tunneling and the Josephson tunneling
is small, as is likely to be the case for many setups, 2pi phase slips occur and may even dominate the
low energy physics. In this limit one can view the 4pi phase slips as a pair of 2pi phase slips with arbitrarily
large separation. We provide an effective descriptions of the system in terms of 2pi and 4pi phase
slips valid for all values of the tunneling ratio. Comparing the spectrum of the effective models
with numerical simulations we determine the cross-over between the 4pi phase slip regime to 2pi
phase slip dominated regime. We also discuss the role of the charging energy as well as the implications
of our results on the dissipative phase transitions expected in such a system.
