We show that electron pairing is indispensable for the development of the leading edge gap as observed
in ARPES measurement in the underdoped cuprates, even though clear evidence for the violation of
the particle-hole symmetry is found in the electron spectrum. To support this assertion, we studied
the electron spectrum under the scattering of diffusive antiferromagnetic(AF) spin fluctuation,
which is thought to be a major candidate for a competing order in the competing order scenario of the
pseudogap phenomena. We find that the Fermi level crossing along the M=$(\pi,0)$ to X=$(\pi,\pi)$
line can only be avoided when the M point is pushed above the Fermi level in this scenario. We argue
that the same conclusion holds in all competing order scenarios that preserve the U(1) charge conservation.
The inconsistency between this prediction and the ARPES observation implies that a competing order
in the particle-hole channel alone is not sufficient to explain the pseudogap as observed in ARPES
measurement. We also find that the electron system always forms a single large Fermi surface under
the scattering of short-ranged dynamical spin fluctuation, rather than forming small Fermi pockets
as predicted by the AF band folding picture. The AF shadow band is smeared out in energy as a result
of the dispersion in the scattered quasiparticle state and the diffusion in spin fluctuation energy.
Nevertheless, we find that the AF band folding effect is important for the understanding of the quasiparticle
dynamics in the pseudogap phase, especially, of the origin of the high energy hump structure in the
anti-nodal region and the signature of particle-hole asymmetry in the electron spectrum.
