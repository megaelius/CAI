Majorana zero modes are fractional quantum excitations appearing in pairs, each pair being a building
block for quantum computation . Some possible signatures of these excitations have been reported
as zero bias peaks at endpoints of one-dimensional semiconducting wires and magnetic chains. However,
1D systems are by nature fragile to a small amount of disorder that induces low-energy excitations,
hence obtaining Majorana zero modes well isolated in a hard gap requires extremely clean systems.
Two-dimensional systems offer an alternative route to get robust Majorana zero modes. Indeed,
it was shown recently that Pb/Co/Si(111) could be used as a platform for generating 2D topological
superconductivity with a strong immunity to local disorder. While 2D systems exhibit dispersive
chiral edge states, they can also host Majorana zero modes located on local topological defects.
According to predictions, if an odd number of zero modes are located in a topological domain an additional
zero mode should appear all around the domain's edge. Here we use scanning tunneling spectroscopy
to characterize a disordered superconducting monolayer of Pb coupled to underlying Co-Si magnetic
islands meant to induce a topological transition. We show that pairs of zero modes are stabilized:
one zero mode positioned at a point in the middle of the magnetic domain and its zero mode partner extended
all around the domain. The zero mode pair is remarkably robust, it is isolated within a hard superconducting
energy gap and it appears totally immune to the strong disorder present in the Pb monolayer. Our theoretical
scenario supports the protected Majorana nature of this zero mode pair, highlighting the role of
magnetic or spin-orbit coupling textures. This robust pair of Majorana zero modes offers a new platform
for theoretical and experimental study of quantum computing.
