A charged droplet can be electrodynamically levitated in the air using a quadrupole trap by typically
applying a sinusoidal electric field. When a charged drop is levitated it exhibits surface oscillations
simultaneously building charge density due to continuous evaporation and subsequently undergoes
breakup due to Rayleigh instability. In this work, we examined large-amplitude surface oscillations
of a sub-Rayleigh charged drop and its subsequent breakup, levitated by various applied signals
such as sine, square and ramp waveform at various imposed frequencies, using high-speed imaging
(recorded at 100-130 thousand Frames Per Second (fps)). It is observed that the drop surface oscillates
in sphere-prolate-sphere-oblate (SPSO) mode and seldom in the sphere-prolate-sphere (SPS) mode
depending on the intricate interplay of various forces due to charge(q), the intensity of applied
field ($\Lambda$) and shift of the droplet from the geometric center of the trap ($z_{shift}$).
The Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis shows that the droplet oscillates with the forced
frequency irrespective of the type of the applied waveform. While in the sinusoidal case, the nonlinearities
are significant, in the square and ramp potentials, there is an admittance of all the harmonic frequencies
of the applied potential. Interestingly, the breakup characteristics of a critically charged
droplet is found to be unaffected by the type of the applied waveform. The experimental observations
are validated with an analytical theory as well as with the Boundary Integral (BI) simulations in
the potential flow limit and the results are found to be in a reasonable agreement.
