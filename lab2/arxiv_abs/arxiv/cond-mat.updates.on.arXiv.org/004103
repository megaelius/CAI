We employ Statistical Field Theory techniques for coarse-graining the steady-state properties
of Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles. The computation is carried on in the framework of the Unified
Colored Noise approximation that allows an effective equilibrium picture. We thus develop a mean-field
theory that allows to describe in a unified framework the phenomenology of scalar Active Matter.
In particular, we are able to describe through spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism two peculiar
features of Active Systems that are (i) The accumulation of active particles at the boundaries of
a confining container, and (ii) Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS). \textcolor{black}{We
develop a mean-field theory for steric interacting active particles undergoing to MIPS and for
Active Lennard-Jones (ALJ) fluids.} \textcolor{black}{Within this framework}, we discuss the
universality class of MIPS and ALJ \textcolor{black}{showing that it falls into Ising universality
class.} We \textcolor{black}{thus} compute analytically the critical line $T_c(\tau)$ for both
models. In the case of MIPS, $T_c(\tau)$ gives rise to a reentrant phase diagram compatible with
an inverse transition from liquid to gas as the strength of the noise decreases. \textcolor{black}{However,
in the case of particles interacting through anisotropic potentials, } the field theory acquires
a $\varphi^3$ term that, \textcolor{black}{in general, cannot be canceled performing the expansion
around the critical point.} In this case, the \textcolor{black}{Ising} critical point might \textcolor{black}{be
replaced} by a first-order phase transition \textcolor{black}{region}.
