We studied the connection between the structural relaxation and viscosity for a binary model of
repulsive particles in the supercooled liquid regime. The used approach is based on the decomposition
of the macroscopic Green-Kubo stress correlation function into the correlation functions between
the atomic level stresses. Previously we used the approach to study an iron-like single component
system of particles. The role of vibrational motion has been addressed through the demonstration
of the relationship between viscosity and the shear waves propagating over large distances. In
our previous considerations, however, we did not discuss the role of the structural relaxation.
Here we suggest that the contribution to viscosity from the structural relaxation can be taken into
account through the consideration of the contribution from the atomic stress auto-correlation
term only. This conclusion, however, does not mean that only the auto-correlation term represents
the contribution to viscosity from the structural relaxation. Previously the role of the structural
relaxation for viscosity has been addressed through the considerations of the transitions between
inherent structures and within the mode-coupling theory by other authors. In the present work,
we study the structural relaxation through the considerations of the parent liquid and the atomic
level stress correlations in it. The comparison with the results obtained on the inherent structures
also is made. Our results suggest that in the supercooled liquid regime the vibrational contribution
to viscosity extends over the times which are much larger than the Einstein's vibrational period
and much larger than the times which it takes for the shear waves to propagate over the model systems.
Besides addressing the atomic level shear stress correlations, we also studied correlations between
the atomic level pressure elements.
