The availability of huge molecular databases generated by first principles quantum mechanics
(QM) computations opens new venues for data science to accelerate the discovery of new molecules,
drugs, and materials. Models that combine QM with machine learning (ML) known as QM-ML models have
been successful in delivering the accuracy of QM at the speed of ML. In this study, we show that by integrating
well-known signal processing (SP) techniques (i.e. short time Fourier transform, continuous
wavelet analysis and Wigner-Ville distribution) in the QM-ML pipeline, we obtain a powerful machinery
(QM-SP-ML) that can be used for representation, visualization and forward design of molecules.
More precisely, in this study, we show that the time-frequency-like representation of molecules
encodes their structural, geometric, energetic, electronic and thermodynamic properties. This
is demonstrated by using the new representation in the forward design loop as input to a deep convolutional
neural networks trained on first principles computational QM calculations such as density functional
theory, which outputs the properties of the molecules. Tested on the QM9 dataset (composed of 133,855
molecules and 19 properties), the new QM-SP-ML model is able to predict the properties of molecules
with a mean absolute error (MAE) below acceptable chemical accuracy (i.e. MAE < 1 kcal/mol for total
energies and MAE < 0.1 ev for orbital energies). Furthermore, the new approach performs similarly
or better compared to other ML state-of-the-art techniques described in the literature. In all,
in this study, we show that the new QM-SP-ML model represents a powerful technique for molecular
forward design, and open new venues for SP practitioners to participate in the molecular design
endeavors. All the codes and data generated and used in this study are available at https://github.com/TABeau/QM-SP-ML.
