The readout of a classical memory can be modelled as a problem of quantum channel discrimination,
where a decoder retrieves information by distinguishing the different quantum channels encoded
in each cell of the memory [S. Pirandola, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 090504 (2011)]. In the case of optical
memories, such as CDs and DVDs, this discrimination involves lossy bosonic channels and can be remarkably
boosted by the use of nonclassical light (quantum reading). Here we generalize these concepts by
extending the model of memory from single-cell to multi-cell encoding. In general, information
is stored in a block of cells by using a channel-codeword, i.e., a sequence of channels chosen according
to a classical code. Correspondingly, the readout of data is realized by a process of "parallel"
channel discrimination, where the entire block of cells is probed simultaneously and decoded via
an optimal collective measurement. In the limit of an infinite block we define the quantum reading
capacity of the memory, quantifying the maximum number of readable bits per cell. This notion of
capacity is nontrivial when we suitably constrain the physical resources of the decoder. For optical
memories (encoding bosonic channels), such a constraint is energetic and corresponds to fixing
the mean total number of photons per cell. In this case, we are able to prove a separation between the
quantum reading capacity and the maximum information rate achievable by classical transmitters,
i.e., arbitrary classical mixtures of coherent states. In fact, we can easily construct nonclassical
transmitters that are able to outperform any classical transmitter, thus showing that the advantages
of quantum reading persist in the optimal multi-cell scenario.
