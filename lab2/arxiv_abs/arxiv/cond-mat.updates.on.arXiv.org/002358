Fractionalized excitations are of considerable interest in recent condensed-matter physics.
Fractionalization of the spin degrees of freedom into localized and itinerant Majorana fermions
are predicted for the Kitaev spin liquid, an exactly solvable model with bond-dependent interactions
on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. As function of temperature, theory predicts a characteristic
two-peak structure of the heat capacity as fingerprint of these excitations. Here we report on detailed
heat-capacity experiments as function of temperature and magnetic field in high-quality single
crystals of {\alpha}-RuCl3 and undertook considerable efforts to determine the exact phonon background.
We measured single-crystalline RhCl3 as non-magnetic reference and performed ab-initio calculations
of the phonon density of states for both compounds. These ab-initio calculations document that
the intrinsic phonon contribution to the heat capacity cannot be obtained by a simple rescaling
of the nonmagnetic reference using differences in the atomic masses. Sizable renormalization
is required even for non-magnetic RhCl3 with its minute difference from the title compound. In {\alpha}-RuCl3
in zero magnetic field, excess heat capacity exists at temperatures well above the onset of magnetic
order. In external magnetic fields far beyond quantum criticality, when long-range magnetic order
is fully suppressed, the excess heat capacity exhibits the characteristic two-peak structure.
In zero field, the lower peak just appears at temperatures around the onset of magnetic order and
seems to be connected with canonical spin degrees of freedom. At higher fields, beyond the critical
field, this peak is shifted to 10 K. The high-temperature peak located around 50 K is hardly influenced
by external magnetic fields, carries the predicted amount of entropy, R/2 ln2, and may resemble
remnants of Kitaev physics.
