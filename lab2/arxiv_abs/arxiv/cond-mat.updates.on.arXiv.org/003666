We study more than $10^4$ random aggregates of $10^6$ monodisperse sticky hard spheres each, generated
by various static algorithms. Their packing fraction varies from 0.370 up to 0.593. These aggregates
are shown to be based on two types of disordered structures: random regular polytetrahedra and random
aggregates, the former giving rise to $\delta$ peaks on pair distribution functions. Distortion
of structural (Delaunay) tetrahedra is studied by two parameters, which show some similarities
and some differences in terms of overall tendencies. Isotropy of aggregates is characterized by
the nematic order parameter. The overall structure is then studied by distinguishing spheres in
function of their contact coordination number (CCN). Distributions of average CCN around spheres
of a given CCN value show trends that depend on packing fraction and building algorithms. The radial
dependency of the average CCN turns out to be dependent upon the CCN of the central sphere and shows
discontinuities that resemble those of the pair distribution function. Moreover, it is shown that
structural details appear when the CCN is used as pseudo chemical parameter, such as various angular
distribution of bond angles, partial pair distribution functions, Ashcroft-Langreth and Bhatia-Thornton
partial structure factors. These allow distinguishing aggregates with the same values of packing
fraction or average tetrahedral distortion or even similar global pair distribution function,
indicative of the great interest of paying attention to contact coordination numbers to study more
precisely the structure of random aggregates.
