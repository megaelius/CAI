Coalescence of tiny particles for a larger particle is worthwhile. In different materials, building
blocks assemble by the orientationally controlled packing to develop shaped mono layers of geometrical
shape particles. Orientationally controlled assembling appears to be more favorable in atoms
of metallic elements. Atoms arrange in monolayer assembly at first place. Re-crystallization
occurs in atoms at solution surface-electrons position in tilting manner nearly half-length above
and half-length below to their clamped energy knots. At air-solution interface, when triangle-shaped
packets of nano-energy were supplied to atoms of compact monolayer assembly, atoms bound in their
shape and size. Blocks of joined triangular shape tiny particles are developed by the tuned bipolar
pulses. When a force exerted to perturbed state electrons of face to face atoms joined at unsettled
binding point, a block of joined triangle-shaped tiny particles separated into two tiny particles
having the same equilateral triangular geometry. At electronically flat solution surface, atoms
of tiny particles elongate nearly at equal rate when in re-crystallization state. From the centre
of each transitional behavior atom, electrons of east-west poles deal with the exertion of surface
force along their opposite poles. Thus, arrays of bound atoms formed a tiny-shaped particle developed
in its structures of smooth elements. Such structures of smooth elements are flattened by the forced
energy of traveled photons along the air-solution interface. Originally, binding of solid atoms
when in neutral state is to be anticipated under the execution of confined inter-state electron
dynamics, where they keep ground point below the ground surface. Nevertheless, tiny particles
when develop rather than evolve, they come from different regions to assemble their structures
of smooth elements adjacent-wise. So, ...
