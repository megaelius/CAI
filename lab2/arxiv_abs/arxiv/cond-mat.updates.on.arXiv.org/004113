Calculations of electronic and optical properties of solids at finite temperature including electron-phonon
interactions and quantum zero-point renormalization have enjoyed considerable progress during
the past few years. Among the emerging methodologies in this area, we recently proposed a new approach
to compute optical spectra at finite temperature including phonon-assisted quantum processes
via a single supercell calculation [Zacharias and Giustino, Phys. Rev. B 94, 075125 (2016)]. In
the present work we considerably expand the scope of our previous theory starting from a compact
reciprocal space formulation, and we demonstrate that this improved approach provides accurate
temperature-dependent band structures in three-dimensional and two-dimensional materials,
using a special set of atomic displacements in a single supercell calculation. We also demonstrate
that our special displacement reproduces the thermal ellipsoids obtained from X-ray crystallography,
and yields accurate thermal averages of the mean-square atomic displacements. At a more fundamental
level, we show that the special displacement represents an exact single-point approximant of an
imaginary-time Feynman's path integral for the lattice dynamics. This enhanced version of the
special displacement method enables non-perturbative, robust, and straightforward ab initio
calculations of the electronic and optical properties of solids at finite temperature, and can
easily be used as a post-processing step to any electronic structure code. Given its simplicity
and numerical stability, the present development is suited for high-throughput calculations
of band structures, quasiparticle corrections, optical spectra, and transport coefficients
at finite temperature.
