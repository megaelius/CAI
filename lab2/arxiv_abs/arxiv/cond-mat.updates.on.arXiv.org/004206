We study spin-$1/2$ chains with long-range power-law decaying unfrustrated (bipartite) Heisenberg
exchange $J_r \propto r^{-\alpha}$ and multi-spin interactions $Q$ favoring a valence-bond solid
(VBS) ground state. Employing quantum Monte Carlo techniques and Lanczos diagonalization, we
analyze order parameters and excited-state level crossings to characterize quantum states and
phase transitions in the $(\alpha,Q)$ plane. For weak $Q$ and sufficiently slowly decaying Heisenberg
interactions (small $\alpha$), the system has a long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic (AFM)
ground state, and upon increasing $\alpha$ there is a continuous transition into a quasi long-range
ordered (QLRO) critical state of the type in the standard Heisenberg chain. For rapidly decaying
long-range interactions, there is transition between QLRO and VBS ground states of the same kind
as in the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain. Our most important finding is a direct continuous
quantum phase transition between the AFM and VBS states - a close analogy to the 2D deconfined quantum-critical
point. In previous 1D analogies the ordered phases both have gapped fractional excitations, and
the critical point is a conventional Luttinger Liquid. In our model the excitations fractionalize
upon transitioning from the AFM state, changing from spin waves to deconfined spinons. We extract
critical exponents at the AFM-VBS transition and use order-parameter distributions to study emergent
symmetries. We find emergent O($4$) symmetry of the O($3$) AFM and scalar VBS order parameters.
Thus, the order parameter fluctuations exhibit the covariance of a uniaxially deformed O($4$)
sphere (an "elliptical" symmetry). This unusual quantum phase transition does not yet have any
known field theory description, and our detailed results can serve to guide its construction. We
discuss possible experimental realizations.
