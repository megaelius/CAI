Graphene electronics has motivated much of graphene science for the past decade. A primary goal
was to develop high mobility semiconducting graphene with a band gap that is large enough for high
performance applications. Graphene ribbons were thought to be semiconductors with these properties,
however efforts to produce ribbons with useful bandgaps and high mobility has had limited success.
We show here that high quality epitaxial graphene nanoribbons 40 nm in width, with annealed edges,
grown on sidewall SiC are not semiconductors, but single channel room temperature ballistic conductors
for lengths up to at least 16 micrometers. Mobilities exceeding one million corresponding to a sheet
resistance below 1 Ohm have been observed, thereby surpassing two dimensional graphene by 3 orders
of magnitude and theoretical predictions for perfect graphene by more than a factor of 10. The graphene
ribbons behave as electronic waveguides or quantum dots. We show that transport in these ribbons
is dominated by two components of the ground state transverse waveguide mode, one that is ballistic
and temperature independent, and a second thermally activated component that appears to be ballistic
at room temperature and insulating at cryogenic temperatures. At room temperature the resistance
of both components abruptly increases with increasing length, one at a length of 160 nm and the other
at 16 micrometers. These properties appear to be related to the lowest energy quantum states in the
charge neutral ribbons. Since epitaxial graphene nanoribbons are readily produced by the thousands,
their room temperature ballistic transport properties can be used in advanced nanoelectronics
as well.
