We present the detailed formalism of the extremely correlated Fermi liquid theory, developed for
treating the physics of the t-J model. We start from the exact Schwinger equation of motion for the
Greens function for projected electrons, and develop a systematic expansion in a parameter \lambda,
relating to the double occupancy. The resulting Greens function has a canonical part arising from
an effective Hamiltonian of the auxiliary electrons, and a caparison part, playing the role of a
frequency dependent adaptive spectral weight. This adaptive weight balances the requirement
at low \omega, of the invariance of the Fermi volume, and at high \omega, of decaying as c_0/(i \omega),
with a correlation depleted c_0 <1. The effective Hamiltonian H_{eff} describing the auxiliary
Fermions is given a natural interpretation with an effective interaction V_{eff} containing both
the exchange J(ij), and the hopping parameters t(ij). It is made Hermitian by adding suitable terms
that ultimately vanish, in the symmetrized theory developed in this paper. Simple but important
shift invariances of the t-J model are noted with respect to translating its parameters uniformly.
These play a crucial role in constraining the form of V_{eff} and also provide checks for further
approximations. The auxiliary and physical Greens function satisfy two sum rules, and the Lagrange
multipliers for these are identified. A complete set of expressions for the Greens functions to
second order in \lambda is given, satisfying various invariances. A systematic iterative procedure
for higher order approximations is detailed. A superconducting instability of the theory is noted
at the simplest level with a high transition temperature.
