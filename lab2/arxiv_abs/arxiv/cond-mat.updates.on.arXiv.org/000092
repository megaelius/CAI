Brinicles are hollow tubes of ice from centimetres to metres in length that form under floating sea
ice in the polar oceans when dense, cold brine drains downwards from sea ice into sea water close to
its freezing point. When this extremely cold brine leaves the ice it freezes the water it comes into
contact with; a hollow tube of ice --- a brinicle --- growing downwards around the plume of descending
brine. We show that brinicles can be understood as a form of the self-assembled tubular precipitation
structures termed chemical gardens, plant-like structures formed on placing together a soluble
metal salt, often in the form of a seed crystal, and an aqueous solution of one of many anions, often
silicate. On one hand, in the case of classical chemical gardens, an osmotic pressure difference
across a semipermeable precipitation membrane that filters solutions by rejecting the solute
leads to an inflow of water and to its rupture. The internal solution, generally being lighter than
the external solution, flows up through the break, and as it does so a tube grows upwards by precipitation
around the jet of internal solution. Such chemical-garden tubes can grow to many centimetres in
length. In the case of brinicles, on the other hand, in floating sea ice we have porous ice in a mushy
layer that filters out water, by freezing it, and allows concentrated brine through. Again there
is an osmotic pressure difference leading to a continuing ingress of sea water in a siphon pump mechanism
that is sustained as long as the ice continues to freeze. Since the brine that is pumped out is denser
than the sea water, and descends rather rises, a brinicle is a downwards growing tube of ice; an inverse
chemical garden.
