Study of the formation and evolution of large scale, ordered structures is an enduring theme in science.
The generation, evolution and control of large sized magnetic domains are intriguing and challenging
tasks, given the complex nature of competing interactions present in any magnetic system. Here,
we demonstrate large scale non-coplanar ordering of spins, driven by picosecond, megagauss magnetic
pulses derived from a high intensity, femtosecond laser. Our studies on a specially designed Yttrium
Iron Garnet (YIG)/dielectric/metal film sandwich target, show the creation of complex, large,
concentric, elliptical shaped magnetic domains which resemble the layered shell structure of
an onion. The largest shell has a major axis of over hundreds of micrometers, in stark contrast to
conventional sub micrometer scale polygonal, striped or bubble shaped magnetic domains found
in magnetic materials, or the large dumbbell shaped domains produced in magnetic films irradiated
with accelerator based relativistic electron beams. Through micromagnetic simulations, we show
that the giant magnetic field pulses create ultrafast terahertz (THz) spin waves. A snapshot of
these fast propagating spin waves is stored as the layered onion shell shaped domains in the YIG film.
Typically, information transport via spin waves in magnonic devices occurs in the gigahertz (GHz)
regime, where the devices are susceptible to thermal disturbances at room temperature. Our intense
laser light pulse - YIG sandwich target combination, paves the way for room temperature table-top
THz spin wave devices, which operate just above or in the range of the thermal noise floor. This dissipation-less
device offers ultrafast control of spin information over distances of few hundreds of microns.
