It is imperative that useful quantum computers be very difficult to simulate classically; otherwise
classical computers could be used for the applications envisioned for the quantum ones. Perfect
quantum computers are unarguably exponentially difficult to simulate: the classical resources
required grow exponentially with the number of qubits $N$ or the depth $D$ of the circuit. Real quantum
computing devices, however, are characterized by an exponentially decaying fidelity $\mathcal{F}
\sim (1-\epsilon)^{ND}$ with an error rate $\epsilon$ per operation as small as $\approx 1\%$ for
current devices. In this work, we demonstrate that real quantum computers can be simulated at a tiny
fraction of the cost that would be needed for a perfect quantum computer. Our algorithms compress
the representations of quantum wavefunctions using matrix product states (MPS), which capture
states with low to moderate entanglement very accurately. This compression introduces a finite
error rate $\epsilon$ so that the algorithms closely mimic the behavior of real quantum computing
devices. The computing time of our algorithm increases only linearly with $N$ and $D$. We illustrate
our algorithms with simulations of random circuits for qubits connected in both one and two dimensional
lattices. We find that $\epsilon$ can be decreased at a polynomial cost in computing power down to
a minimum error $\epsilon_\infty$. Getting below $\epsilon_\infty$ requires computing resources
that increase exponentially with $\epsilon_\infty/\epsilon$. For a two dimensional array of
$N=54$ qubits and a circuit with Control-Z gates, error rates better than state-of-the-art devices
can be obtained on a laptop in a few hours. For more complex gates such as a swap gate followed by a controlled
rotation, the error rate increases by a factor three for similar computing time.
