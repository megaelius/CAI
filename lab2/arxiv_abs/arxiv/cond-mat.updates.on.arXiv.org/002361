High-performing thermoelectric materials such as Zn$_4$Sb$_3$ and PbTe have atomic disorder
as the root to their favorable properties. This makes it extremely difficult to understand and model
their properties at a quantitative level, and thus effective structure-property relations are
challenging to obtain. Cu$_{2-x}$Se is an intensely studied, cheap and non-toxic high performance
thermoelectric, which exhibits highly peculiar transport properties, especially around the
$\beta$ to $\alpha$ phase transition around 400 K, which must be related to the detailed nature of
the crystal structure. Attempts to solve the crystal structure of the low temperature phase, $\beta$-Cu$_{2-x}$Se,
have been unsuccessful since 1936. So far all studies have assumed that $\beta$-Cu$_{2-x}$Se has
a three-dimensional periodic structure, but here we show that the structure is ordered only in two
dimensions while being disordered in the third dimension with a random stacking sequence. Using
the three-dimensional difference pair distribution function (3D-$\Delta$PDF) analysis method
for diffuse single crystal X-ray scattering, we solve the structure of the ordered layer and show
that there are two modes of stacking disorder present, which give rise to an average structure with
higher symmetry. The present approach allows for a direct solution of structures with disorder
in some dimensions and order in others. The local and extended structure of a solid determines its
properties and Cu$_{2-x}$Se represents an example of a high-performing thermoelectric material
where the local atomic structure differs significantly from the average periodic structure observed
from Bragg crystallography.
