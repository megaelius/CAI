We report results of terahertz Faraday and Kerr rotation spectroscopy measurements on thin films
of $\text{Bi}_{1-x}\text{Sb}_{x}$, an alloy system that exhibits a semimetal-to-topological-insulator
transition as the Sb composition $x$ increases. By using a single-shot time-domain terahertz spectroscopy
setup combined with a table-top pulsed mini-coil magnet, we conducted measurements in magnetic
fields up to 30~T, observing distinctly different behaviors between semimetallic ($x < 0.07$)
and topological insulator ($x > 0.07$) samples. Faraday and Kerr rotation spectra for the semimetallic
films showed a pronounced dip that blue-shifted with the magnetic field, whereas spectra for the
topological insulator films were positive and featureless, increasing in amplitude with increasing
magnetic field and eventually saturating at high fields ($>$20~T). Ellipticity spectra for the
semimetallic films showed resonances, whereas the topological insulator films showed no detectable
ellipticity. To explain these observations, we developed a theoretical model based on realistic
band parameters and the Kubo formula for calculating the optical conductivity of Landau-quantized
charge carriers. Our calculations quantitatively reproduced all experimental features, establishing
that the Faraday and Kerr signals in the semimetallic films predominantly arise from bulk hole cyclotron
resonances while the signals in the topological insulator films represent combined effects of
surface carriers originating from multiple electron and hole pockets. These results demonstrate
that the use of high magnetic fields in terahertz magnetopolarimetry, combined with detailed electronic
structure and conductivity calculations, allows us to unambiguously identify and quantitatively
determine unique contributions from different species of carriers of topological and nontopological
nature in Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$.
