Cavity mode theory and analysis of open cavities and plasmonic particles is an essential component
of optical resonator physics, offering considerable insight and efficiency for connecting to
quantum optical properties such as the Purcell effect. However, obtaining the dissipative modes
in normalized form for arbitrarily shaped open cavity systems is notoriously difficult, often
involving complex spatial integrations, even after performing the necessary full space solutions
to Maxwell's equations. The formal solutions are termed quasinormal modes which are known to diverge
in space, and additional techniques are frequently required to obtain more accurate field representations
in the far field. In this work we introduce a new finite-difference time-domain technique that can
obtain normalized quasinormal modes using a simple dipole-excitation source and an inverse Green
function technique, in real frequency space, without having to perform any spatial integrations.
Moreover, we show how these modes are naturally regularized to ensure the correct field decay behaviour
in the far field, and thus can be used at any position within and outside the resonator. We term these
modes "regularized quasinormal modes" and show the reliability and generality of the theory, by
studying the generalized Purcell factor of quantum dipole emitters near metallic nanoresonators,
hybrid devices with metal nanoparticles coupled to dielectric waveguides, as well as coupled cavity-waveguides
in photonic crystals slabs. We also compare our results with full-dipole simulations of Maxwell's
equations without any approximations and show excellent agreement.
