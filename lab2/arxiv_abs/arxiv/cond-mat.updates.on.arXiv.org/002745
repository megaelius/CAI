While catalytic mechanisms on electrode surfaces have been proposed for decades, the pathways
by which the product's chemical bonds evolve from the initial charge-trapping intermediates have
not been resolved in time. Here, we discover a reactive population of charge-trapping intermediates
with states in the middle of a semiconductor's band-gap to reveal the dynamics of two parallel transition
state pathways for their decay. Upon photo-triggering the water oxidation reaction from the n-SrTiO3
surface with band-gap, pulsed excitation, the intermediates' microsecond decay reflects transition
state theory (TST) through: (1) two distinct and reaction dependent (pH, T, Ionic Strength, and
H/D exchange) time constants, (2) a primary kinetic salt effect on each activation barrier and an
H/D kinetic isotope effect on one, and (3) realistic activation barrier heights (0.4 - 0.5 eV) and
TST pre-factors (10^11 - 10^12 Hz). A photoluminescence from midgap states in n-SrTiO3 reveals
the reaction dependent decay; the same spectrum was previously assigned by us to hole-trapping
at parallel Ti-O(dot)-Ti (bridge) and perpendicular Ti-O(dot) (oxyl) O-sites using in situ ultrafast
vibrational and optical spectroscopy. Therefore, the two transition states are naturally associated
with the decay of these respective intermediates. Furthermore, we show that reaction conditions
select between the two pathways, one of which reflects a labile intermediate facing the electrolyte
(the oxyl) and the other a lattice oxygen (the bridge). Altogether, we experimentally isolate an
important activation barrier for water oxidation, which is necessary for designing water oxidation
catalysts with high O2 turn over. Moreover, in isolating it, we identify competing mechanisms for
O2 evolution at surfaces and show how to use reaction conditions to select between them.
