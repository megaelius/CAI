Mode-coupling theory (MCT) constitutes one of the few first-principles-based approaches to describe
the physics of the glass transition, but the theory's inherent approximations compromise its accuracy
in the activated glassy regime. Here we show that microscopic generalized mode-coupling theory
(GMCT), a recently proposed hierarchical framework to systematically improve upon standard MCT,
provides a promising pathway toward a more accurate first-principles description of glassy dynamics.
We present a comprehensive numerical analysis for Percus-Yevick hard spheres by performing explicitly
wavenumber- and time-dependent GMCT calculations up to sixth order. Specifically, we calculate
the location of the critical point, the associated non-ergodicity parameters, the time-dependent
dynamics of the density correlators at both absolute and reduced packing fractions, and we test
several universal scaling relations in the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-relaxation regimes. It is found
that higher-order GMCT can successfully remedy some of standard MCT's pathologies, including
an underestimation of the critical glass transition density and an overestimation of the hard-sphere
fragility. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that the celebrated scaling laws of standard
MCT are preserved in GMCT at all closure levels, and that the predicted critical exponents manifestly
improve as more levels are incorporated in the GMCT hierarchy. Although formally the GMCT equations
should be solved up to infinite order to reach full convergence, our finite-order GMCT calculations
unambiguously reveal a uniform convergence pattern for the dynamics. We thus argue that GMCT can
provide a feasible and controlled means to bypass MCT's main uncontrolled approximation, offering
hope for the future development of a quantitative first-principles theory of the glass transition.
