The energy vs. crystal momentum E(k) diagram for a solid (band structure) constitutes the road map
for navigating its optical, magnetic, and transport properties. By selecting crystals with specific
atom types, composition and symmetries, one could design a target band structure and thus desired
properties. A particularly attractive outcome would be to design energy bands that are split into
spin components with a momentum-dependent splitting, as envisioned by Pekar and Rashba [Zh. Eksperim.
i Teor. Fiz. 47 (1964)], enabling spintronic application. The current paper provides "design principles"
for wavevector dependent spin splitting (SS) of energy bands that parallels the traditional Dresselhaus
and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) - induce splitting, but originates from a fundamentally different
source -- antiferromagnetism. We identify a few generic AFM prototypes with distinct SS patterns
using magnetic symmetry design principles. These tools allow also the identification of specific
AFM compounds with SS belonging to different prototypes. A specific compound -- centrosymmetric
tetragonal MnF2 -- is used via density functional band structure calculations to quantitatively
illustrate one type of AFM SS. Unlike the traditional SOC-induced effects restricted to non-centrosymmetric
crystals, we show that antiferromagnetic-induced spin splitting broadens the playing field to
include even centrosymmetric compounds, and gives SS comparable in magnitude to the best known
('giant') SOC effects, even without SOC, and consequently does not rely on the often-unstable high
atomic number elements required for high SOC. We envision that use of the current design principles
to identify an optimal antiferromagnet with spin-split energy bands would be beneficial for efficient
spin-charge conversion and spin orbit torque applications without the burden of requiring compounds
containing heavy elements.
