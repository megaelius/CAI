We report an investigation of Metal Insulator Transition (MIT) using conductivity and magnetoconductance
(MC) measurements down to 0.3 K in Nd_{0.7}La_{0.3}NiO_{3} films grown on crystalline substrates
of LaAlO_{3} (LAO), SrTiO_{3} (STO), and NdGaO_{3}(NGO) by pulsed laser deposition. The film grown
on LAO experiences a compressive strain and shows metallic behavior with the onset of a weak resistivity
upturn below 2 K which is linked to the onset of weak localization contribution. Films grown on STO
and NGO show a crossover from a Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) resistance regime to Negative
Temperature Coefficient (NTC) resistance regime at definite temperatures. We establish that
a cross-over from PTC to NTC on cooling does not necessarily constitute a MIT because the extrapolated
conductivity at zero temperature \sigma_{0} though small (<10 S/cm) is finite, signalling the
existence of a bad metallic state and absence of an activated transport. The value of \sigma_{0}
for films grown on NGO is reduced by a factor of 40 compared to that for films grown on STO. We show that
a combination of certain physical factors makes substituted nickelate (that are known to exhibit
first order Mott type transition), undergo a continuous transition as seen in systems undergoing
disorder/composition driven Anderson transition. The MC measurement also support the above observation
and show that at low temperature there exists a positive MC that arises from the quantum interference
which co-exists with a spin-related negative MC that becomes progressively stronger as the electrons
approach a strongly localized state in the film grown on NGO.
