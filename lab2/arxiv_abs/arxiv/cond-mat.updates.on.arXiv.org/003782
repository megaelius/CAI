Accelerating the design of materials with artificial neural network draws more attention due to
its magnitude potential. In the past works, some tools of materials information have been developed
to promote the industrialize of state-of-the-art materials, such as the materials project, AFlow,
and open quantum materials database. Else, more various endeavors are required for artificial
general intelligence in the area of materials. In our works, we design neural networks named MATGANIP,
which applies a combination of generative adversarial networks, graph networks, convolutional
neural networks, and long short term memory for the perovskite materials. We adopt it for the building
of a structure-property relationship, where the trained properties contain: the computational
geometric property, tolerance factor; and the ground state property of Quantum theory, the vacuum
energy. Moreover, the data-set about the ABX3 perovskites is used for the learning of tolerance
factor, to extend its function of tolerance factor into the structural identification of the arrangement
of disorder atoms; another data-set about the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results
is for the ground state energy of quantum theory, to obtain the more accurate result than the training
of DFT calculated results in similar works. In our training task of the DFT date-set, we adopt the
intuitive criterion to evaluate its performance: the mean absolute error (MAE) is smaller than
0.3 meV/atom, and the mean absolute error rate (MAER) is smaller than 0.01%. These results prove
the potential ability of our MATGANIP in developing the relationship between materials structure
and their properties. Notably, it suits for some scenes involved massive possible structures and
their properties, such as the arrangement of the atoms in the structural phase transition of the
inorganic perovskites with mixed atoms.
