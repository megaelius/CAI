High precision placement and integration of color centers in a silicon-based nanosystem, such
as a nanowire (NW) array, exhibiting high integration functionality and high photoluminescence
(PL) yield can serve as a critical building block towards the practical realization of devices in
the emerging field of quantum technologies. Herein, we report on an innovative synthesis route
for realizing ultrathin silicon carbide (SiC) NW arrays doped with and without oxygen (SiC:Ox),
and also erbium (Er). The arrays of the deterministically positioned NWs are grown in a self-aligned
manner through chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD). A key enabler of this synthesis route is that
SiC:Ox NW photonic crystal (PC) nanostructures are engineered with tailored geometry in precise
locations during nanofabrication. These ultrathin NW PC structures not only facilitate the on-demand
positioning of Er3+ ions but are pivotal in engineering the emission properties of these color centers.
Through a combinational and systematic micro-PL (uPL) and power-dependence PL (PDPL) spectroscopy,
PC architecture geometry effects on Er3+-related 1538 nm emission, which is the telecommunication
wavelength used in optical fibers, were studied. Approximately 60-fold and 30-fold enhancements
for, respectively, the room-temperature Er3+ PL emission and lifetime in the NW PC sample were observed
compared to its thin-film analog. Furthermore, the 1538 nm emission in SiC:Ox NW PC was found to be
modulated linearly with the PC lattice periodicity of the structure. The observed characteristics
reveal the efficient Er3+-emission extraction from the technologically-friendly SiC:Ox NW PC
structures.
