Superconductivity often emerges in proximity of other symmetry-breaking ground states, such
as antiferromagnetism or charge-density-wave (CDW) order. However, the subtle inter-relation
of these phases remains poorly understood, and in some cases even the existence of short-range correlations
for superconducting compositions is uncertain. In such circumstances, ultrafast experiments
can provide new insights, by tracking the relaxation kinetics following excitation at frequencies
related to the broken symmetry state. Here, we investigate the transient terahertz conductivity
of BaPb1-xBixO3 - a material for which superconductivity is adjacent to a competing CDW phase - after
optical excitation tuned to the CDW absorption band. In insulating BaBiO3 we observed an increase
in conductivity and a subsequent relaxation, which are consistent with quasiparticles injection
across a rigid semiconducting gap. In the doped compound BaPb0.72Bi0.28O3 (superconducting below
Tc=7K), a similar response was also found immediately above Tc. This observation evidences the
presence of a robust gap up to T=40 K, which is presumably associated with short-range CDW correlations.
A qualitatively different behaviour was observed in the same material fo T>40 K. Here, the photo-conductivity
was dominated by an enhancement in carrier mobility at constant density, suggestive of melting
of the CDW correlations rather than excitation across an optical gap. The relaxation displayed
a temperature dependent, Arrhenius-like kinetics, suggestive of the crossing of a free-energy
barrier between two phases. These results support the existence of short-range CDW correlations
above Tc in underdoped BaPb1-xBixO3, and provide new information on the dynamical interplay between
superconductivity and charge order.
