We consider a simple fluid confined between two parallel walls (substrates), separated by a distance
L. The walls exert competing surface fields so that one wall is attractive and may be completely wet
by liquid (it is solvophilic) while the other is solvophobic. Such asymmetric confinement is sometimes
termed a `Janus Interface'. The second wall is: (i) purely repulsive and therefore completely dry
(contact angle 180 degrees) or (ii) weakly attractive and partially dry (the contact angle is typically
in the range 160-170 degrees). At low temperatures, but above the bulk triple point, we find using
classical density functional theory (DFT) that the fluid is highly structured in the liquid part
of the density profile. In case (i) a sequence of layering transitions occurs: as L is increased at
fixed chemical potential (mu) close to bulk gas--liquid coexistence, new layers of liquid-like
density develop discontinuously. In contrast to confinement between identical walls, the solvation
force is repulsive for all wall separations and jumps discontinuously at each layering transition
and the excess grand potential exhibits many metastable minima as a function of the adsorption.
For a fixed temperature T=0.56Tc, where Tc is the bulk critical temperature, we determine the transition
lines in the L, mu plane. In case (ii) we do not find layering transitions and the solvation force oscillates
about zero. We discuss how our mean-field DFT results might be altered by including effects of fluctuations
and comment on how the phenomenology we have revealed might be relevant for experimental and simulation
studies of water confined between hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates, emphasizing it is important
to distinguish between cases (i) and (ii).
