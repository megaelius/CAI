The recently discovered two-dimensional magnetic semiconductor CrI$_3$ is an intriguing case
for spintronic applications since it is a ferromagnet in the bulk, but an antiferromagnet in bilayer
form, with its magnetic ordering amenable to external manipulations. Using first-principles
quantum transport calculations, which combine nonequilibrium Green functions with noncollinear
density functional theory, we predict that injecting unpolarized charge current parallel to the
interface of bilayer-CrI$_3$/monolayer-TaSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure will induce
spin-orbit torque (SOT) driven dynamics of magnetization on the first monolayer of CrI$_3$ that
is in direct contact with TaSe$_2$. By combining calculated complex angular dependence of SOT with
the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for classical dynamics of magnetization, we demonstrate
that this can reverse the direction of magnetization on the first monolayer to become parallel to
that of the second monolayer, thereby converting bilayer CrI$_3$ from antiferromagnet to ferromagnet
while not requiring any external magnetic field. We explain the mechanism of such current-driven
nonequilibrium phase transition by showing that first monolayer of CrI$_3$ becomes conducting
due to evanescent wavefunctions injected by metallic monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide
TaSe$_2$, while concurrently acquiring strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) via this proximity effect,
whereas the second monolayer of CrI$_3$ remains insulating. Thus, injected current flows only
through the first monolayer of CrI$_3$ to generate nonequilibrium spin density, in the presence
of SOC, and the corresponding SOT.
