Artificial ferromagnetic nanofiber networks with new electronic, magnetic, mechanical and other
physical properties can be prepared by electrospinning and may be regarded as the base of bio-inspired
cognitive computing units. For this purpose, it is necessary to examine all relevant physical parameters
of such nanofiber networks. Due to the more or less random arrangement of the nanofibers and the possibility
of gaining bent nanofibers in this production process, elementary single nanofibers with varying
bending radii, from straight fibers to those bent along half-circles, were investigated by micromagnetic
simulations, using different angles with respect to the external magnetic field. As expected from
the high aspect ratios and the resulting strong shape anisotropy, all magnetization reversal processes
took place via domain wall processes. Changing the cross-section from circular to a circle-segment
or a rectangle significantly altered the coercive fields and its dependence on the bending radius,
especially for the magnetic field oriented perpendicular (90 deg) to the fiber axes. In all three
cross-sections, an angle of 45{\deg} between the fiber orientation and the external magnetic field
resulted in the smallest influence of the bending radius. The shapes of the longitudinal and transverse
hysteresis curves showed strong differences, depending on cross-section, bending radius and
orientation to the magnetic field, often depicting distinct transverse magnetization peaks perpendicular
to the fibers for fibers which were not completely oriented parallel to the magnetic field. Varying
these parameters thus provides a broad spectrum of magnetization reversal processes in magnetic
nanofibers and correspondingly scenarios for a variety of fiber-based information processing.
