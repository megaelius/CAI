The solvent quality determines the collapsed or the expanded state of a polymer. For example, a polymer
dissolved in a poor solvent collapses, whereas in a good solvent it opens up. While this standard
understanding is generally valid, there are examples when a polymer collapses even in a mixture
of two good solvents. This phenomenon, commonly known as co-non-solvency, is usually associated
with smart polymers. Moreover, recent experiments have shown that the elastin-like polypeptides
(ELPs) show co-non-solvency behavior in aqueous-ethanol mixtures. In this study, we investigate
the phase behavior of ELPs in aqueous binary mixtures using molecular dynamics simulations of all-atom
and complementary explicit solvent generic models. The model is parameterized by mapping the solvation
free energy obtained from the all-atom simulations onto the generic interaction parameters. For
this purpose, we derive segment based generic parameters for four different peptides, namely proline
(P), valine (V), glycine (G) and alanine (A). Here we compare the conformational behavior of two
ELP sequences, namely VPGGG and VPGVG, in aqueous-ethanol and -urea mixtures. Consistent with
recent experiments, we find that ELPs show co-non-solvency in aqueous-ethanol mixtures. Ethanol
molecules have preferential binding with all ELP residues and thus driving the coil-to-globule
transition. On the contrary, ELP conformations show weak variation in aqueous-urea mixtures.
Our simulations suggest that the glycine residues dictate the overall behavior of ELPs in aqueous-urea,
where urea molecules have a rather weak preferential binding with glycine, i.e., less than kT. While
the validation of the latter findings will require more detailed experimental investigation,
the results presented here may provide a new twist to the present understanding of cosolvent interactions
with peptides and proteins.
