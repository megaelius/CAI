We theoretically study topological planar Josephson junctions (JJs) formed from spin-orbit-coupled
two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) proximitized by two superconductors and subjected to
an in-plane magnetic field $B_\parallel$. Compared to previous studies of topological superconductivity
in these junctions, here we consider the case where the superconducting leads are narrower than
the superconducting coherence length. In this limit the system may be viewed as a proximitized multiband
wire, with an additional knob being the phase difference $\phi$ between the superconducting leads.
A combination of mirror and time-reversal symmetry may put the system into the class BDI. Breaking
this symmetry changes the symmetry class to class D. The class D phase diagram depends strongly on
$B_{\parallel}$ and chemical potential, with a weaker dependence on $\phi$ for JJs with narrower
superconducting leads. In contrast, the BDI phase diagram depends strongly on both $B_\parallel$
and $\phi$. Interestingly, the BDI phase diagram has a "fan"-shaped region with phase boundaries
which move away from $\phi = \pi$ linearly with $B_\parallel$. The number of distinct phases in the
fan increases with increasing chemical potential. We study the dependence of the JJ's critical
current on $B_\parallel$, and find that minima in the critical current indicate first-order phase
transitions in the junction only when the spin-orbit coupling strength is small. In contrast to
the case of a JJ with wide leads, in the narrow case these transitions are not accompanied by a change
in the JJ's topological index. Our results, calculated using realistic experimental parameters,
provide guidelines for present and future searches for topological superconductivity in JJs with
narrow leads, and are particularly relevant to recent experiments [A. Fornieri et al., Nature (London)
569, 89 (2019)].
