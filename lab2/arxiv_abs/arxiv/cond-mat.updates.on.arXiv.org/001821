The quest to understand interaction between light and matter stretches back to the ray optics of
Euclid and Ptolemy. In recent decades, studies at the quantum scale were performed by coupling an
isolated emitter to a single mode of the electromagnetic field, standard quantum optics providing
a complete toolbox for describing such a setup. Current efforts aim to explore the coherent dynamics
of systems containing an emitter coupled to several electromagnetic degrees of freedom. Combining
superconducting metamaterials and qubits could allow for the observation of genuinely macroscopic
quantum effects such as a giant Lamb shift or non-classical states of multimode optical fields.
In this work, we couple a transmon qubit to a high impedance, centimeter-scale, metamaterial waveguide,
made of 4700 in-situ tunable Josephson junctions. Our device combines three essential properties
required to go beyond the standard quantum optics paradigm and reach the multi-mode, many-body
regime, namely: a tunable waveguide with a high density of electromagnetic modes, a qubit non-linearity
comparable to the other relevant energy scales, and ultrastrong coupling between the qubit and
the waveguide modes. Besides providing experimental evidence for these non-trivial requirements,
we also develop a quantitative theoretical description that does not contain any phenomenological
parameters and that accurately takes into account vacuum fluctuations of our large scale quantum
circuit in the regime of ultrastrong coupling and intermediate non-linearity. Furthermore, we
show that the influence on the transmon of our fully controllable on-chip environment well approximates
that of the macroscopic bath envisioned in the celebrated work of Caldeira and Leggett. Our work
demonstrates that Josephson waveguides offer a promising platform to explore many-body quantum
optics.
