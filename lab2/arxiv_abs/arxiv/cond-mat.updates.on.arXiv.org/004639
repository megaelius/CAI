We investigate some foundational issues in the quantum theory of spin transport, in the general
case when the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator $H_0$ does not commute with the spin operator in
view of Rashba interactions, as in the typical models for the Quantum Spin Hall effect. A gapped periodic
one-particle Hamiltonian $H_0$ is perturbed by adding a constant electric field of intensity $\varepsilon
\ll 1$ in the $j$-th direction, and the linear response in terms of a $S$-current in the $i$-th direction
is computed, where $S$ is a generalized spin operator. We derive a general formula for the spin conductivity
that covers both the choice of the conventional and of the proper spin current operator. We investigate
the independence of the spin conductivity from the choice of the fundamental cell (Unit Cell Consistency),
and we isolate a subclass of discrete periodic models where the conventional and the proper $S$-conductivity
agree, thus showing that the controversy about the choice of the spin current operator is immaterial
as far as models in this class are concerned. As a consequence of the general theory, we obtain that
whenever the spin is (almost) conserved, the spin conductivity is (approximately) equal to the
spin-Chern number. The method relies on the characterization of a non-equilibrium almost-stationary
state (NEASS), which well approximates the physical state of the system (in the sense of space-adiabatic
perturbation theory) and allows moreover to compute the response of the adiabatic $S$-current
as the trace per unit volume of the $S$-current operator times the NEASS. This technique can be applied
in a general framework, which includes both discrete and continuum models.
