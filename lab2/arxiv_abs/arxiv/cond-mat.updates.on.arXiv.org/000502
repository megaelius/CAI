Combining experimental data, numerical transport calculations, and theoretical analysis, we
study the temperature-dependent resistivity of high-mobility 2D Si MOSFETs to search for signatures
of weak localization induced quantum corrections in the effective metallic regime above the critical
density of the so-called two-dimensional metal-insulator transition (2D MIT). The goal is to look
for the effect of logarithmic insulating localization correction to the metallic temperature
dependence in the 2D conductivity so as to distinguish between the 2D MIT being a true quantum phase
transition versus being a finite-temperature crossover. We use the Boltzmann theory of resistivity
including the temperature dependent screening effect on charged impurities in the system to fit
the data. We analyze weak perpendicluar field magnetoresistance data taken in the vicinity of the
transition and show that they are consistent with weak localization behavior in the strongly disordered
regime $k_F\ell\gtrsim1$. Therefore we supplement the Botzmann transport theory with a logarithmic
in temperature quantum weak localization correction and analyze the competition of the insulating
temperature dependence of this correction with the metallic temperature dependence of the Boltzmann
conductivity. Using this minimal theoretical model we find that the logarithmic insulating correction
is masked by the metallic temperature dependence of the Botzmann resistivity and therefore the
insulating $\log T$ behavior may be apparent only at very low temperatures which are often beyond
the range of temperatures accessible experimentally. Analyzing the low-$T$ experimental Si MOSFET
transport data we identify signatures of the putative insulating behavior at low temperature and
density in the effective metallic phase.
