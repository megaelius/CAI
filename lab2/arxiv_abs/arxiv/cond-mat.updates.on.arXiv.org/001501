We present the theory of thermoelectric transport in metals with long-lived quasiparticles, carefully
addressing the interplay of electron-electron scattering as well as electron-impurity scattering,
but neglecting electron-phonon scattering. In Fermi liquids with a large Fermi surface and weak
electron-impurity scattering, we provide universal and simple formulas for the behavior of the
thermoelectric conductivities across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic crossover. In this regime,
the electrical conductivity is relatively unchanged by hydrodynamic effects. In contrast, the
thermal conductivity can be parametrically smaller than predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law.
A less severe violation of the Mott law arises. We quantitatively compare the violations of the Wiedemann-Franz
law arising from (i) momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering in the collision integral,
(ii) hydrodynamic modifications of the electron-impurity scattering rate, and (iii) thermal
broadening of the Fermi surface, and show that (i) is the largest. We present simple formulas for
electrical and thermal magnetoconductivity across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic limit, along
with a more complicated formula for the thermoelectric magnetoconductivity. In a finite magnetic
field, the Lorenz number may be smaller or larger than predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law, and
the crossover between these behaviors is a clear prediction for experiments. The arbitrarily strong
violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law found in our work arises entirely from electron-electron
interaction effects within the Fermi liquid paradigm, and does not imply any non-Fermi liquid behavior.
We predict clear experimental signatures of bulk hydrodynamics in high-mobility 2D GaAs semiconductor
structures, where failure of the Wiedemann-Franz law should persist down to very low temperatures
in high-quality, low-density samples.
