Poly($para$-phenylene) has been recognized as one important family of conducting polymers upon
doping with donors or acceptors. This system possesses a chain-like structure with infinite benzene
rings linked with the single C-C bond. Oligophenyls as models of poly($para$-phenylene) with short
chains in the \emph{para} position were found to exhibit superconductivity at transition temperatures
ranging from 3 K to 123 K upon dopant. Structural studies have revealed that there exist the order-disorder
transitions in many \emph{p}-oligophenyls with almost doubled lattice constants in the \emph{b}
and \emph{c} directions at low temperatures, seemingly supporting the formation of the charge-density-wave
order. Such a transition is of relevance to the understanding of the emergence of novel quantum functionality
where unconventional polaronic interactions are relevant for the new emerging theory of superconductivity
in this system. However, the accurate temperatures for the order-disorder transitions amongst
these \emph{p}-oligophenyls are still needed to be determined. The chain length effects on the
order-disorder transitions in this system remain unknown. Here we report the systematic investigation
of the evolution of vibrational properties of the crystalline \emph{p}-oligophenyls over a wide
temperature range. The order-disorder transition is identified by three indicators, the lowest
energy peak together with the intensity ratios between the 1280 cm$^{-1}$ and 1220 cm$^{-1}$ modes
and between the two modes at around 1600 cm$^{-1}$. A phase diagram of the order-disorder transition
temperature as well as the melting curve for \emph{p}-oligophenyls is thus established. The former
is found to increase with the chain length and saturates at around 350 K for poly($para$-phenylene).
