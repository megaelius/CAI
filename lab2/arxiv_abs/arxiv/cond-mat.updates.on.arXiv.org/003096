We present results on a meso-scale model for amorphous matter in athermal, quasi-static (a-AQS),
steady state shear flow. In particular, we perform a careful analysis of the scaling with the lateral
system size, $L$, of: i) statistics of individual relaxation events in terms of stress relaxation,
$S$, and individual event mean-squared displacement, $M$, and the subsequent load increments,
$\Delta \gamma$, required to initiate the next event; ii) static properties of the system encoded
by $x=\sigma_y-\sigma$, the distance of local stress values from threshold; and iii) long-time
correlations and the emergence of diffusive behavior. For the event statistics, we find that the
distribution of $S$ is similar to, but distinct from, the distribution of $M$. We find a strong correlation
between $S$ and $M$ for any particular event, with $S\sim M^{q}$ with $q\approx 0.65$. $q$ completely
determines the scaling exponents for $P(M)$ given those for $P(S)$. For the distribution of local
thresholds, we find $P(x)$ is analytic at $x=0$, and has a value $\left. P(x)\right|_{x=0}=p_0$
which scales with lateral system length as $p_0\sim L^{-0.6}$. Extreme value statistics arguments
lead to a scaling relation between the exponents governing $P(x)$ and those governing $P(S)$. Finally,
we study the long-time correlations via single-particle tracer statistics. The value of the diffusion
coefficient is completely determined by $\langle \Delta \gamma \rangle$ and the scaling properties
of $P(M)$ (in particular from $\langle M \rangle$) rather than directly from $P(S)$ as one might
have naively guessed. Our results: i) further define the a-AQS universality class, ii) clarify
the relation between avalanches of stress relaxation and diffusive behavior, iii) clarify the
relation between local threshold distributions and event statistics.
