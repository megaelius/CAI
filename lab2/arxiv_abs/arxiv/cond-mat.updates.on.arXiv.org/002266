Tiny-sized particles under the scheme of monolayer assembly, comprising gold atoms, developed
at a different processing time in a pulse-based process. For a different processing time, atoms
bind into different tiny particles under the placing packets of nanoshape energy where they elongate
as per arrangement and when in one-dimensional arrays, they convert into structures of smooth elements.
For different processing time and where tiny particles possess triangular-shape, they pack to
develop for extended shapes where development rate of an anisotropic particle is not more than millisecond
time. Increasing the processing time of solution upto certain duration increases the number of
developing tiny particles in a triangular-shape, so, their extended shapes also. Uniformly adjacent-orientation
of electrons in atoms of tiny-shaped particle is because of exerting uniform surface force along
their opposite poles as per gained potential energy where stretching of their clamped energy knots
is remained orientational-based. At a different processing time, inter-spacing distance of spotted
intensity spots in selective area photons reflection patterns of particles is remained the same
as for the case of their structures of smooth elements visualized through transmission microscope
high-resolution images. When the forceful coinciding of two parallel structures of smooth elements
is occurred, they bind into single structure of smooth element by giving the double width where filled
state electrons and unfilled energy knots belonging to sides of elongated atoms of parallel structures
of smooth elements coordinate. Also, at this node, study disregards the theory of van der Waals interactions
and surface plasmons, thus, provides understanding of the diffusion-based processes along with
many others with new insights, so, opening the alternative routes to design materials and explore
science.
