Metallic colloids are frequently used in industry and provide understanding of science at microns
to nanometers scales along with their applicability for various technologically important applications.
Present investigations deal morphology-structure of gold, silver and their binary composition
while processing the certain amount of their solutions in a newly designed process and tap opportunities
of developing tiny shaped particles. At tuned ratio of pulse OFF to ON time and when gold solution
was processed, several tiny shaped particles developed at solution surface. Such tiny particles
deal force at the tip of each converted structure of smooth element under the steady-state immersing
behavior pointing toward common centre to pack for developing different geometric anisotropic
shaped particles. Under identical parameters along with pulse time, processing solutions of silver
nitrate and binary composition of chloroauric acid-silver nitrate result into develop tiny particles
having no specific shape where their packing deal mixed behavior of force resulting into develop
distorted particles. Elongation and deformation of gold and silver atoms while in different structures
is because of the plastically-driven behavior of electrons as per stretching of their clamped energy
knots. In structure of three-dimensional where electrons of atoms do not deal transition require
for elongation they retain the structure as it is known in hcp structure or two-dimensional structure.
Different nature of precursors along with morphology-structure of particles is discussed in this
paper opening abundant avenues of research.
