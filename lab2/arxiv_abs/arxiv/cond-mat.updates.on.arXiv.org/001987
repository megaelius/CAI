The recent discovery of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism proves that magnetic anisotropy
can overcome thermal fluctuations and stabilize long-range magnetic orders in the 2D limit at finite
temperatures. This has immediately triggered tremendous interest in potential 2D magnet-based
applications, ranging from ultra-thin magnetic sensors to high efficiency spin filter devices.
Naturally, a complete description of the 2D magnetic phase is now needed, which requires not only
the identification of the ordered ground state, but equally important, the understanding of the
excitations, i.e., spin waves, or equivalently, magnons. Here, using polarized micro-Raman spectroscopy,
we report the definitive evidence of two sets of zero-momentum spin waves in a 2D honeycomb ferromagnet
CrI3 at frequencies of 2.28 and 3.75 THz, respectively, that are three orders of magnitude higher
than those of the conventional ferromagnets (typically at GHz frequencies). Surprisingly, by
tracking the layer number dependence of both spin waves, we notice that the integrated intensity
of each magnon mode shows no thickness dependence, indicative of surface magnons. Moreover, we
show that, from more than ten-layer to monolayer CrI3, the spin wave frequencies (2.28 and 3.75 THz)
and their onset temperatures (45 K) remain nearly constant, while their lifetimes decrease significantly
from 50 and 100 ps to 15 ps, but remaining an order of magnitude longer than their corresponding spin
wave temporal periods. Our results of two branches of high-frequency and long-lived surface spin
waves in the 2D Ising ferromagnet CrI3 demonstrate intriguing spin dynamics and intricate interplay
with thermal fluctuations in the 2D limit, thus opening up new opportunities for ultrafast spintronics
incorporating 2D magnets.
