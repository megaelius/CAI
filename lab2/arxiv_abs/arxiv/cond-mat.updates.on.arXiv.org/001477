A major challenge for future spintronics is to develop suitable spin transport channels with long
spin lifetime and propagation length. Graphene can meet these requirements, even at room temperature.
On the other side, taking advantage of the fast motion of chiral textures, i.e., N\'eel-type domain
walls and magnetic skyrmions, can satisfy the demands for high-density data storage, low power
consumption and high processing speed. We have engineered epitaxial structures where an epitaxial
ferromagnetic Co layer is sandwiched between an epitaxial Pt(111) buffer grown in turn onto MgO(111)
substrates and a graphene layer. We provide evidence of a graphene-induced enhancement of the perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy up to 4 nm thick Co films, and of the existence of chiral left-handed N\'eel-type
domain walls stabilized by the effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the stack.
The experiments show evidence of a sizeable DMI at the gr/Co interface, which is described in terms
of a conduction electron mediated Rashba-DMI mechanism and points opposite to the Spin Orbit Coupling-induced
DMI at the Co/Pt interface. In addition, the presence of graphene results in: i) a surfactant action
for the Co growth, producing an intercalated, flat, highly perfect fcc film, pseudomorphic with
Pt and ii) an efficient protection from oxidation. The magnetic chiral texture is stable at room
temperature and grown on insulating substrate. Our findings open new routes to control chiral spin
structures using interfacial engineering in graphene-based systems for future spin-orbitronics
devices fully integrated on oxide substrates.
