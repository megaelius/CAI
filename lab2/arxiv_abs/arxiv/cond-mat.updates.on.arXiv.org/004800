Continuously monitoring the environment of a quantum many-body system reduces the entropy of (purifies)
the reduced density matrix of the system, conditional on the outcomes of the measurements. We show
that, for mixed initial states, a balanced competition between measurements and entangling interactions
within the system can result in a dynamical purification phase transition between (i) a phase that
locally purifies at a constant system-size-independent rate, and (ii) a "mixed" phase where the
purification time diverges exponentially in the system size. The residual entropy density in the
mixed phase implies the existence of a quantum error-protected subspace where quantum information
can be reliably hidden from the measurements. We show that these codes are of potential relevance
to fault-tolerant quantum computation as they satisfy optimal tradeoffs between encoded information
densities and error thresholds. In spatially local models in 1 + 1 dimensions, this phase transition
for mixed initial states occurs concurrently with a recently identified class of entanglement
phase transitions for pure initial states. We numerically explore this transition for random quantum
circuits in 1+1 dimensions and all-to-all models. Unlike for pure initial states, the mutual information
of an initially completely-mixed state grows at most logarithmically in time. The purification
transition studied here naturally generalizes to systems with long-range interactions where
conventional notions of entanglement transitions have to be reformulated. Purification dynamics
may also be more robust in experiments, where imperfections generically reduce entanglement and
drive the system towards mixed states. We describe the motivations for studying this novel class
of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics in the context of advanced quantum computing platforms and
fault-tolerant quantum computation.
