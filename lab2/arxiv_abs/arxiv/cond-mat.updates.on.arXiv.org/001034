Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) has been investigated in Co2FeAl (CFA)
ultrathin films of various thicknesses (0.8 nm<tCFA<2 nm) grown on Si substrates, using Pt, W, Ir
and MgO buffer or/and capping layers. Vibrating sample magnetometry revealed that magnetization
at saturation (Ms) for the Pt and Ir buffered films is higher than the usual Ms of CFA due to the proximity
induced magnetization (PIM) in Ir and Pt, estimated to be 19% and 27%, respectively. The presence
of PIM in these materials is confirmed using x-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity. Moreover, while
no PIM is induced in W, higher PIM is obtained with Pt when it is used as buffer layer rather than capping
layer. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) in the Damon-Eshbach geometry has been used to investigate
iDMI constants and the perpendicular anisotropy field versus the annealing temperature. The DMI
sign has been found to be negative for Pt/CFA and Ir/CFA while it is positive for W/CFA. The thickness
dependence of the effective iDMI constant for stacks involving Pt and W shows the existence of two
regimes similarly to that of the perpendicular anisotropy constant due to the degradation of the
interfaces as the CFA thickness approaches the nanometer. The surface iDMI and anisotropy constants
of each stack have been determined for the thickest samples where a linear thickness dependence
of the effective iDMI constant and the effective magnetization has been observed. The interface
anisotropy and iDMI constants, investigated for Pt/CFA/MgO system, showed different trends with
the annealing temperature. The decrease of iDMI constant with increasing annealing temperature
is probably due to the electronic structure changes at the interfaces, while the increase of the
interface anisotropy constant is coherent the interface quality and disorder enhancement.
