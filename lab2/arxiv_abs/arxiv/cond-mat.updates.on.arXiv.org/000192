Recently the materials possessing structure of molecular and supramolecular matrix are more and
more actively studied. They are relative to many polymeric materials of a technological origin,
such as rubber, and living biological tissues. Processes of mechanical deformation of such continuous
media have peculiarities connected, first, with accounting for internal friction and dissipation
of energy, and secondly, with nonlinearity of their elastic and viscous properties, that is with
violation of Hook and Newtons laws. Problem of modeling of these systems reduce to the analysis of
the corresponding equivalent mechanical or electric circuit (see examples in the classical monograph
by Frenkel). Rheological properties of described medium are governed by the differential equations
of the first order on time (the evolution equations), as well as a huge variety of other physical processes.
The physical phenomena in nonlinear systems with dissipation have a big community, including such
it would seem far areas, as dynamics of magnetization in ferrite. Therefore the problem of studying
new effects of viscous friction in the conditions of nonlinearity and heterogeneity, is very actual
as in respect of fundamental research nonlinear and non-uniform environments, and in many areas
of materials science, design of new materials, engineering of biological substitutes of living
tissues and development of the micromagnetic devices using essentially new opportunities. Traditional
approaches to mechanics of viscoelastic bodies sometimes are excessively difficult, and more
evident and available representations are necessary. The invaluable role in studying of the operating
processes mechanisms of elastic deformation and motility of biological materials, is played by
the mathematical modeling.
