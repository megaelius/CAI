Local configurational symmetry in lattice structures may give rise to stationary, compact solutions,
even in the absence of disorder and nonlinearity. These compact solutions are related to the existence
of flat dispersion curves (bands). Nonlinearity can destabilize such compactons. One common flat-band-generating
system is the 1D cross-stitch model, in which compactons were shown to exist for the photonic lattice
with Kerr nonlinearity. The compactons exist there already in the linear regime and are not generally
destructed by that nonlinearity. Smooth nonlinearity of this kind does not allow doing a complete
stability analysis for this chain. We consider a discrete mechanical system with flat dispersion
bands, in which the nonlinearity exists due to impact constraints. There, one can use the concept
of the saltation matrix for the analytic construction of the monodromy matrix. Besides, we consider
a smooth nonlinear lattice with linearly connected massless boxes, each containing two symmetric
anharmonic oscillators. In this model, the flat bands and discrete compactons also readily emerge.
This system also permits performing comprehensive stability analysis, at least in the anti-continuum
limit, due to the reduced number of degrees-of-freedom. In both systems, there exist two types of
localization. The first one is the complete localization, and the second one is the more common exponential
localization. The latter type is associated with discrete breathers (DBs). Two principal mechanisms
for the loss of stability are revealed. The first one is the possible internal instability of the
symmetric and/or antisymmetric solution in the individual unit cell of the chain. One can interpret
this instability pattern as internal resonance between the compacton and the DB. The other mechanism
is global instability related to resonance of the stationary solution with the propagation frequencies.
