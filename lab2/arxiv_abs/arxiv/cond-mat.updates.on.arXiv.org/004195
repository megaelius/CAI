An extension of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem to one employing dynamical parameters that vary with
time according to quantum dynamics is rigorously derived, avoiding any linear response or other
approximations. The resulting theorem for the dynamics of observables, valid to all orders in external
fields, is found to contain generalized Berry curvature type of quantities that incorporate the
dynamics through explicit and nontrivial time-dependence; these Berry quantities resemble the
so called anomalous terms (in semiclassical equations of motion in solids) but are both of magnetic
and electric type, the former being associated with Quantum Hall Effect type of behaviors and the
latter with Polarization type of behaviors. By way of application of the new theorem, the quantum
equations of motion of a spinless and a spinfull electron in a solid are derived without any adiabatic
or semiclassical approximation. The charge current formula for a many-body and interacting spinfull
system is also derived and is found to consist of a longitudinal and a transverse part; phenomenological
interpretations with respect to polarization and magnetization currents respectively then emerge
in a natural way. In addition, a formula for the topological magnetoelectric effect for an interacting
spinfull electron system is also provided. By carefully defining singlevaluedness in parameter
space, in a nonstandard fashion and in higher rigor than usual, we are able to discuss in clarity the
issue of possible obstruction of this singlevaluedness, the associated creation of Berry monopoles
in parameter space and the quantization of the flux of Berry curvature (but with nontrivial dynamics
included in its definition).
