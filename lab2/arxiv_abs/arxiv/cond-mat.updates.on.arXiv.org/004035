Based on ab initio band structure calculations we formulate a general theoretical method for description
of the temperature dependence of electric field gradient in solids. The method employs a procedure
of averaging multipole electron density component (L \neq 0) inside a sphere vibrating with the
nucleus at its center. As a result of averaging each Fourier component (K \neq 0) on the sphere is reduced
by the square root of the Debye-Waller factor [exp(-W)]. The electric field gradient expressed
as a sum of K-components most frequently decreases with temperature (T), but under certain conditions
it can also increase with T. The method is applied to calculations of the temperature evolution of
the electric field gradients of pristine zinc and cadmium crystallized in the hexagonal lattice.
For calculations within our model of crucial importance is the temperature dependence of mean-square
displacements which can be taken from experiment or obtained from the phonon modes in the harmonic
approximation. For the case of Zn we have used data obtained from single crystal x-ray diffraction.
In addition, for Zn and Cd we have calculated mean-square displacements with the phonopy package.
With the experimental data for displacements in Zn the calculation of electron band structure parameters
reproduces the temperature dependence of the electric field gradient very accurately. Within
the harmonic approximation of the phonopy package the decrease of electric field gradients in Zn
and Cd with temperature is overestimated. Our calculations indicate that the anharmonic effects
are of considerable importance in the temperature dependence of electric field gradients.
