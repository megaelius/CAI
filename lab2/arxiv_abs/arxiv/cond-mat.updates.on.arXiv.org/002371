We study an one-dimensional model of aggregation and fragmentation of clusters of particles obeying
a stochastic discrete-time kinetics of the generalized Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process
(TASEP) on open chains. Isolated particles and the first particle of a cluster of particles hop one
site forward with probability $p$; when the first particle of a cluster hops, the remaining particles
of the same cluster may hop with a modified probability $p_m$, modeling a special kinematic interaction,
or remain in place with probability $1-p_m$. The model contains as special cases the TASEP with parallel
update ($p_m =0$) and with sequential backward-ordered update ($p_m =p$). These cases have been
exactly solved for the stationary states and their properties thoroughly studied. The limiting
case of $p_m =1$, which corresponds to irreversible aggregation, has been recently studied too.
Its phase diagram in the plane of injection ($\alpha$) and ejection ($\beta$) probabilities was
found to have a different topology. Here we studied the generic case of attraction $p< p_m <1$. We
found that the topology of the phase diagram at $p_m =1$ changes sharply to the one corresponding
to $p_m =p$ as soon as $p_m$ becomes less than $1$. Then a maximum current phase appears in the square
domain $\alpha_c(p,p_m) \le \alpha \le 1$ and $\beta_c(p,p_m) \le \beta \le 1$, where $\alpha_c(p,p_m)=
\beta_c(p,p_m)\equiv \sigma_c(p,p_m)$ are parameter-dependent critical values. By extensive
computer simulations, we estimated the singular behavior of $\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+}
\sigma_c(p,1-\epsilon)\rightarrow p$, at fixed $p=0.6$. The properties of the phase transitions
between the three stationary phases at $p< p_m <1$ were assessed by computer simulations and random
walk theory.
