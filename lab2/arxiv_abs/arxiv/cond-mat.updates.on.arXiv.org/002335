Density functional theory (DFT) is used for quantum mechanical simulations of electrons in molecules
and materials, for applications in chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering. However,
usage of DFT for large numbers of atoms is hindered by typical scaling of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$. Demonstration
of a sufficiently accurate reduced model with deep neural networks would enable widespread application
of DFT on larger, more complex systems for new scientific discoveries. We show that deep neural networks
can be integrated into, or fully replace, the Kohn-Sham density functional theory scheme for multi-electron
systems in simple harmonic oscillator and random external potentials. We first show that self-consistent
charge densities can be used as input to an extensive deep neural network to make predictions for
correlation, exchange, external, kinetic and total energies simultaneously. Additionally,
we show that one can also make all of the same predictions with the external potential rather than
the self-consistent charge density, which allows one to circumvent the Kohn-Sham scheme altogether.
We then show that a self-consistent charge density found from a non-local exchange-correlation
functional can be used to make energy predictions for a semi-local exchange-correlation functional.
Lastly, we use a deep convolutional inverse graphics network to predict the charge density given
an external potential and asses the viability of the predicted charge densities. This work shows
that extensive deep neural networks are generalizable and transferable given the variability
of the potentials and the fact that they can scale to an arbitrary system size with an $\mathcal{O}(N)$
computational cost.
