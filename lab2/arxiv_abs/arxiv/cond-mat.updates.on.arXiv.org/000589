The discovery in 2001 of superconductivity in some heavy fermion compounds of the RMIn$_5$ (R=4f
or 5f elements, M=Co, Rh, Ir) family, has triggered enormous amount of research pointing to understand
the physical origin of superconductivity and its relation with magnetism. Although many properties
have been clarified, there are still crutial questions that remain unanswered. One of these questions
is the particular role of the transition metal in determining the value of critical superconducting
temperature (Tc). In this work, we analyse an interesting regularity that is experimentally observed
in this family of compounds, where the lowest N\'eel temperatures are obtained in the Co-based materials.
We focus our analysis on the GdMIn$_5$ compounds and perform density-functional-theory based
total-energy calculations to obtain the parameters for the exchange coupling interactions between
the magnetic moments located at the Gd$^{3+}$ ions. Our calculations indicate that the ground state
of the three compounds is a $C$-type antiferromagnet determined by the competition between the
first- and second-neighbor exchange couplings inside GdIn$_3$ planes and stabilized by the couplings
across MIn$_2$ planes. We then solve a model with these magnetic interactions using a mean-field
approximation and Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The results obtained for the calculated N\'eel
and Curie-Weiss temperatures, the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility are in very good
agreement with the existent experimental data. Remarkably, we show that the first neighbor interplane
exchange coupling in the Co-based material is much smaller than in the Rh and Ir analogues due to a
more two dimensional behaviour in the former. This result explains the observed lower N\'eel temperature
in Co-115 systems and may shed light on the fact that the Co-based 115 superconductors present the
highest Tc.
