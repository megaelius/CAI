We consider the relaxation process and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of natural generalizations
to arbitrary dimensions of the well known one dimensional East process. These facilitated models
are supposed to catch some of the main features of the complex dynamics of fragile glasses. We focus
on the low temperature regime (small density $c \approx e^{-\beta}$ of the facilitating sites).
In the literature the relaxation process for the above models has been assumed to be quasi-one dimensional
and, in particular, their equilibration time has been computed using the relaxation time of the
East model ($d=1$) on the equilibrium length scale $L_c=(1/c)^{1/d}$ in $d$-dimension. This led
to the derivation of a super-Arrhenius scaling for the relaxation time of the form $T_{\rm rel} \asymp
\exp(\beta^2/d\log 2)$. In a companion paper, using mainly renormalization group ideas and electrical
networks methods, we rigorously establish that instead $T_{\rm rel} \asymp \exp(\beta^2/2d\log
2)$, a result showing that the relaxation process cannot be quasi-one-dimensional. The above scaling
sharply confirms previous MCAMC (Monte Carlo with Absorbing Markov Chains) simulations. Next
we compute the relaxation time at finite and mesoscopic length scales, and show a dramatic dependence
on the boundary conditions, yet another indication of key dimensional effects. Our final result
is related to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Starting with a single facilitating site at the
origin we show that, up to length scales $L=O(L_c)$, its influence propagates much faster (on a logarithmic
scale) along the diagonal direction than along the axes directions. Such unexpected result is due
to a rather delicate balance between dynamical energy barriers and entropic effects in the constrained
dynamics.
