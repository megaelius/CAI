The onset of frictional motion is mediated by rupture-like slip fronts, which nucleate locally
and propagate eventually along the entire interface causing global sliding. The static friction
coefficient is a macroscopic measure of the applied force at this particular instant when the frictional
interface loses stability. However, experimental studies are known to present important scatter
in the measurement of static friction; the origin of which remains unexplained. Here, we study the
nucleation of local slip at interfaces with slip-weakening friction of random strength and analyze
the resulting variability in the measured global strength. Using numerical simulations that solve
the elastodynamic equations, we observe that multiple slip patches nucleate simultaneously,
many of which are stable and grow only slowly, but one reaches a critical length and starts propagating
dynamically. We show that a theoretical criterion based on a static equilibrium solution predicts
quantitatively well the onset of frictional sliding. We develop a Monte-Carlo model by adapting
the theoretical criterion and pre-computing modal convolution terms, which enables us to run efficiently
a large number of samples and to study variability in global strength distribution caused by the
stochastic properties of local frictional strength. The results demonstrate that an increasing
spatial correlation length on the interface, representing geometric imperfections and roughness,
causes lower global static friction. Conversely, smaller correlation length increases the macroscopic
strength while its variability decreases. We further show that randomness in local friction properties
is insufficient for the existence of systematic precursory slip events. Random or systematic non-uniformity
in the driving force, such as potential energy or stress drop, is required for arrested slip fronts.
