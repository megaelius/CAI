Herein, we report on the synthesis and investigation of two triazino-isoquinoline tetrafluoroborate
electrolytes as hole-blocking layers in methylammonium triiodide perovskite photovoltaic devices
with fullerene electron extraction layer. We find that increasing the thickness of the dipolar
hole-blocking layer results in a gradual increase in the open-circuit voltage suggesting that
aggregation of the molecules can enhance the dipole induced by the layer. This finding is confirmed
by theoretical calculations demonstrating that while both molecules exhibit a similar dipole
moment in their isolated state, this dipole is significantly enhanced when they aggregate. Ultra-violet
photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that both derivatives exhibit a high ionisation
potential of 7 eV, in agreement with their effective hole-blocking nature demonstrated by the devices.
However, each of the molecules shows a different electron affinity due to the increased conjugation
of one of the derivatives. While the change in electron transport level between the two derivatives
is as high as 0.3 eV, the difference in the open-circuit voltage of both types of devices is negligible,
suggesting that the electron transport level plays only a minor role in determining the open-circuit
voltage of the device. Numerical device simulations confirm that the increase in built-in potential,
arising from the high dipole of the electrolyte layer, compensates for the non-ideal energetic
alignment of the charge transport levels, resulting in high VOC for a range of electron transport
levels. Our study demonstrates that the application of small molecule electrolytes as hole-blocking
layer in inverted architecture perovskite solar cells is a powerful tool to enhance the open-circuit
voltage of the devices and provides useful guidelines for designing future generations of such
compounds.
