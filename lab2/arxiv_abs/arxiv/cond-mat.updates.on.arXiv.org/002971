The structural, optical, morphological and nonlinear optical properties of Cu:ZnO spray-coated
films are studied. The surface morphology of Cu:ZnO thin films turned out to be homogenous, crack
free and well covered with pea-shaped grains. The peak shift observed in the x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy spectra of the Cu:ZnO thin films infers the defect states present in the films. The
satellite peak observed at 939.9 eV for Cu2P core-level spectra confirms the +2 oxidation state
of Cu in the films. The formation of additional defect levels in the nanostruc-tures upon Cu doping
was investigated using photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy studies. The luminescent
centers in the violet, blue and green spectral region were observed. The most prominent emission
was centered at the blue color center for 5% Cu:ZnO thin films. The en-hancement in the PL emission
intensity confirms the increase in the defect state density upon Cu doping. The shifting of the UV
emission peak to the visible region validates the increase in the non-radiative recombination
process in the films upon doping. The phonon modes observed in Raman analysis around 439, 333 and
558 cm-1 confirm the improvement in the crystallinity and formation of defect states in the films.
X-ray diffraction reveals that the deposited films are of single-phase wurtzite ZnO structure
with preferential growth orientation parallel (0 0 2) to the C-axis. The third-order optical susceptibility
\c{hi}(3) has been increased from 3.5 x 10-4 to 2.77 x 10-3 esu due to the enhancement of electronic
transition to different defect levels formed in the films and through local heating effects arising
due to continuous wave laser illumination. The enhanced third harmonic generation signal investigated
using a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm and 8 ns pulse width shows the credibility of Cu:ZnO films in frequency
tripling applications.
