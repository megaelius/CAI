Atomic and molecular samples reduced to temperatures below 1 microkelvin, yet still in the gas phase,
afford unprecedented energy resolution in probing and manipulating how their constituent particles
interact with one another. For simple atoms, such as alkalis, scattering resonances are extremely
well-characterized. However, ultracold physics is now poised to enter a new regime, where far more
complex species can be cooled and studied, including magnetic lanthanide atoms and even molecules.
For molecules, it has been speculated that a dense forest of resonances in ultracold collision cross
sections will likely express essentially random fluctuations, much as the observed energy spectra
of nuclear scattering do. According to the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture, these fluctuations
would imply chaotic dynamics of the underlying classical motion driving the collision. This would
provide a paradigm shift in ultracold atomic and molecular physics, necessitating new ways of looking
at the fundamental interactions of atoms in this regime, as well as perhaps new chaos-driven states
of ultracold matter. In this report we provide the first experimental demonstration that random
spectra are indeed found at ultralow temperatures. In the experiment, an ultracold gas of erbium
atoms is shown to exhibit many Fano-Feshbach resonances, for bosons on the order of 3 per gauss. Analysis
of their statistics verifies that their distribution of nearest-neighbor spacings is what one
would expect from random matrix theory. The density and statistics of these resonances are explained
by fully-quantum mechanical scattering calculations that locate their origin in the anisotropy
of the atoms' potential energy surface. Our results therefore reveal for the first time chaotic
behavior in the native interaction between ultracold atoms.
