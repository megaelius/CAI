Motion of active particles, such as catalytic micro- and nano-motors, is usually characterized
via either dynamic light scattering or optical microscopy. In both cases, speed of particles is
obtained from the calculus of the mean square displacement (MSD) and typically, the theoretical
formula of the MSD is derived from the motion equations of an active Brownian particle. One of the
most commonly reported parameters is the speed of the particle, usually attributed to its propulsion,
and is widely used to compare the motion efficiency of catalytic motors. However, it is common to
find different methods to compute this parameter, which are not equivalent approximations and
do not possess the same physical meaning. Here, we review the standard methods of speed analysis
and focus on the errors that arise when analyzing the MSD of self-propelled particles. We analyze
the errors from the computation of the instantaneous speed, as well as the propulsive speed and diffusion
coefficient through fittings to parabolic equations, and we propose a revised formula for the motion
analysis of catalytic particles moving with constant speed that can improve the accuracy and the
amount of information obtained from the MSD. Moreover, we emphasize the importance of spotting
the presence of different motion dynamics, such as particles with active angular speed or that move
under the presence of drift, and how the breaking of ergodicity can completely change the analysis
by considering particles with an exponentially decaying speed. In all cases, real data from enzymatically
propelled micro-motors and simulations are used to back up the theories. Finally, we propose several
analytical approaches and analyze limiting cases that will help to deal with these scenarios while
still obtaining accurate results.
