We study a two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding model of a topological crystalline insulator (TCI)
protected by rotation symmetry. The model is built by stacking two Chern insulators with opposite
Chern numbers which transform under conjugate representations of the rotation group, e.g. $p_\pm$
orbitals. Despite its apparent similarity to the Kane-Mele model, it does not host stable gapless
surface states. Nevertheless the model exhibits topological responses including the appearance
of quantized fractional charge bound to rotational defects (disclinations) and the pumping of
angular momentum in response to threading an elementary magnetic flux, which are described by a
mutual Chern-Simons coupling between the electromagnetic gauge field and an effective gauge field
corresponding to the rotation symmetry. We show that although the filled bands of the model do not
admit a symmetric Wannier representation, this obstruction is removed on addition of appropriate
atomic orbitals, which implies `fragile' topology. As a result, the response of the model can be
derived by representing it as a superposition of atomic orbitals with positive and negative integer
coefficients. Following the analysis of the model, which serves as a prototypical example of 2D
TCIs protected by rotation, we show that all TCIs protected by point group symmetries which do not
have protected surface states are either atomic insulators or fragile phases. We then use dimensional
reduction to map the problem of classifying 2D TCIs protected by rotation to a zero-dimensional
(0D) problem which is then used to obtain the complete non-interacting classification of such TCIs
as well as the reduction of this classification in the presence of interactions.
