Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid systems provide a promising platform for hosting unpaired
Majorana fermions towards the realisation of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing.
In this study, we employ the Keldysh Non-Equilibrium Green's function formalism to model quantum
transport in normal-superconductor junctions. We analyze III-V semiconductor nanowire Josephson
junctions (InAs/Nb) using a three-dimensional discrete lattice model described by the Bogolubov-de
Gennes Hamiltonian in the tight-binding approximation, and compute the Andreev bound state spectrum
and current-phase relations. Recent experiments [Zuo et al., Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ \textbf{119},187704
(2017)] and [Gharavi et al., arXiv:1405.7455v2 (2014)] reveal critical current oscillations
in these devices, and our simulations confirm these to be an interference effect of the transverse
sub-bands in the nanowire. We add disorder to model coherent scattering and study its effect on the
critical current oscillations, with an aim to gain a thorough understanding of the experiments.
The oscillations in the disordered junction are highly sensitive to the particular realisation
of the random disorder potential, and to the gate voltage. A macroscopic current measurement thus
gives us information about the microscopic profile of the junction. Finally, we study dephasing
in the channel by including elastic electron-phonon interactions. The oscillations thus obtained
are in excellent qualitative agreement with the experimental data, and this signifies the essential
role of phase-breaking processes in III-V semiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions.
