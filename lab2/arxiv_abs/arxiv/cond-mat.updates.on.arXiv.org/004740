We derive expressions for the leading-order far-field flows generated by mobile colloids trapped
at planar fluid-fluid interfaces. We consider both externally driven colloids and active colloids
(swimmers) either adjacent to or adhered to the interface. In the latter case, we assume a pinned
contact line. The Reynolds and capillary numbers are assumed small, in line with typical colloidal
systems involving air- or alkane-aqueous interfaces. At clean (surfactant-free) interfaces,
the hydrodynamic modes are essentially a restricted set of the usual Stokes multipoles in a bulk
fluid. To leading order, driven colloids simply exert Stokelets parallel to the interface, while
active colloids drive different kinds of fluid motion depending on their trapped configuration.
We then consider how these modes are altered by the presence of an incompressible surfactant layer,
which occurs at high Marangoni numbers. This limiting behavior is typical for colloidal-scale
systems at small capillary numbers, even when scant surfactant is present. Compared to a clean interface,
we find that incompressibility substantially weakens flow directed normal to the interface. Interestingly,
for both driven and active colloids, we find that the leading-order flow normal to the interface
is associated with colloid asymmetry with respect to the interfacial plane. Flow parallel to the
interface, however, is not weakened. Moreover, surface-viscous stresses, if present, potentially
generate very long-ranged flow on the interface itself and into the surrounding fluids. We examine
the limiting forms of such flows. Our results have important implications for advective mass transport
enhancement near fluid boundaries.
