We report on the crystal and magnetic structures, magnetic, and transport properties of SrMnSb$_2$
single crystals grown by the self-flux method. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal an
antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at $T_{\rm N} = 295(3)$ K. Above $T_{\rm N}$, the susceptibility
slightly increases and forms a broad peak at $T \sim 420$ K, which is a typical feature of two-dimensional
magnetic systems. Neutron diffraction measurements on single crystals confirm the previously
reported C-type AFM structure below $T_{\rm N}$. Both de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) and Shubnikov-de
Haas (SdH) effects are observed in SrMnSb$_2$ single crystals. Analysis of the oscillatory component
by a Fourier transform shows that the prominent frequencies obtained by the two different techniques
are practically the same within error regardless of sample size or saturated magnetic moment. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) reveals the existence of stacking faults in the crystals, which result
from a horizontal shift of Sb atomic layers suggesting possible ordering of Sb vacancies in the crystals.
Increase of temperature in susceptibility measurements leads to the formation of a strong peak
at $T \sim {570}$ K that upon cooling under magnetic field the susceptibility shows a ferromagnetic
transition at $T_{\rm C} \sim 580$ K. Neutron powder diffraction on crushed single-crystals does
not support an FM phase above $T_{\rm N}$. Furthermore, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
measurements of a single crystal at the $L_{2,3}$ edge of Mn shows a signal due to induced canting
of AFM moments by the applied magnetic field. All evidence strongly suggests that a chemical transformation
at the surface of single crystals occurs above 500 K concurrently producing a minute amount of ferromagnetic
impurity phase.
