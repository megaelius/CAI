Solid-state electronic spins are extensively studied in quantum information science, both for
quantum computation, sensing and communication. Electronic spins are highly interesting due
to their large magnetic moments, which offer fast operations for computing and communication,
and high sensitivity for sensing. However, the large moment also implies higher sensitivity to
a noisy magnetic environment, which often reduces coherence times. Yet, material preparation
of the spectroscopic properties of electronic spins, e.g. using clock transitions and isotopic
engineering, can yield remarkable spin coherence times, as for electronic spins in GaAs, donors
in silicon and vacancy centres in diamond. For no material it has been demonstrated, however, that
such coherence enhancement techniques can be engineered at the same time for transitions in the
spin and optical domains. Here we demonstrate simultaneously induced clock transitions for both
microwave and optical domains in an isotopically purified $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal,
reaching coherence times of above 100 $\mu$s and 1~ms in the optical and microwave domain, respectively.
This effect is due to the highly anisotropic hyperfine interaction in $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$,
which makes each electronic state an entangled Bell state. In particular, our results shows the
great potential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ for quantum processing applications relying
on both optical and spin manipulation, such as optical quantum memories, microwave-to-optical
quantum transducers, and single spin detection. In general, similar effects should also be observable
in a range of different materials with anisotropic hyperfine interaction.
