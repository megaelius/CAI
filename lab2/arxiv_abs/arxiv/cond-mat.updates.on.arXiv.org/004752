Improved understanding of charge-transport in single molecules is essential for harnessing the
potential of molecules e.g. as circuit components at the ultimate size limit. However, interpretation
and analysis of the large, stochastic datasets produced by most quantum transport experiments
remains an ongoing challenge to discovering much-needed structure-property relationships.
Here, we introduce Segment Clustering, a novel unsupervised hypothesis generation tool for investigating
single molecule break junction distance-conductance traces. In contrast to previous machine
learning approaches for single molecule data, Segment Clustering identifies groupings of similar
pieces of traces instead of entire traces. This offers a new and advantageous perspective into dataset
structure because it facilitates the identification of meaningful local trace behaviors that
may otherwise be obscured by random fluctuations over longer distance scales. We illustrate the
power and broad applicability of this approach with two case studies that address common challenges
encountered in single molecule studies: First, Segment Clustering is used to extract primary molecular
features from a varying background to increase the precision and robustness of conductance measurements,
enabling small changes in conductance in response to molecular design to be identified with confidence.
Second, Segment Clustering is applied to a known data mixture to qualitatively separate distinct
molecular features in a rigorous and unbiased manner. These examples demonstrate two powerful
ways in which Segment Clustering can aid in the development of structure-property relationships
in molecular quantum transport, an outstanding challenge in the field of molecular electronics.
