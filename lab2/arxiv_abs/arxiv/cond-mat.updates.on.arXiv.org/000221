Active microswimmers are known to affect the macroscopic viscosity of suspensions in a more complex
manner than passive particles. For puller-like microswimmers an increase in the viscosity has
been observed. It has been suggested that the persistence of the orientation of the microswimmers
hinders the rotation that is normally caused by the vorticity. It was previously shown that some
sorts of algaes are bottom-heavy swimmers, i.e. their centre of mass is not located in the centre
of the body. In this way, the algae affects the vorticity of the flow when it is perpendicular oriented
to the axis of gravity. This orientation of gravity to vorticity is given in a rheometer that is equipped
with a cone-plate geometry. Here we present measurements of the viscosity both in a cone-plate and
a Taylor-Couette cell. The two set-ups yielded the same increase in viscosity although the axis
of gravitation in the Taylor-Couette cell is parallel to the direction of vorticity. In a complementary
experiment we tested the orientation of the direction of swimming through microscopic observation
of single \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} and could not identify a preferred orientation,
i. e. our specific strain of \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} are not bottom-heavy swimmers.
We thus conclude that bottom heaviness is not a prerequisite for the increase of viscosity and that
the effect of gravity on the rheology of our strain of \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} is negligible.
This finding reopens the question of whether origin of persistence in the orientation of cells is
actually responsible for the increased viscosity of the suspension.
