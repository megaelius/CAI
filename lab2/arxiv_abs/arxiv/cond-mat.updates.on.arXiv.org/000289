We consider gelation of colloidal particles in suspension after cessation of shear flow. Particle
aggregation is driven by a temperature-tunable attractive potential which controls the growth
of clusters under isothermal conditions. A series of frequency resolved time sweeps is used to systematically
reconstruct the frequency dependent dynamic moduli as a function of time and temperature or attraction
strength. The data display typical hallmarks of gelation with an abrupt transition from a fluid
state into a dynamically arrested gel state after a characteristic gelation time $t_g$ that varies
exponentially with temperature and serves to collapse the evolution of the system onto a universal
curve. We observe the viscoelastic properties of the critical gel where we find that $G'(\omega)\approxeq
G''(\omega)\sim \omega^{n_c}$ where $n_c=0.5$ in a narrow time window across all attraction strengths.
We measure a dynamic critical exponent of $\kappa=0.25$ which is similar to that observed in crosslinked
polymer gels. The approach to the critical gel is therefore governed by $\eta_0\sim-\epsilon^{-s}$
and $G_e\sim\epsilon^z$ with $s=z=2$ where $\epsilon=p/p_c-1$ is the distance to the gel point.
Remarkably, the relaxation moduli of the near-critical gels are identical across the temperatures
considered, with $G(t)\approx0.33t^{-0.5}$. This suggests an underlying strong similarity
in gel structure in the regime of attraction strengths considered, despite the differences in aggregation
kinetics. We contrast these findings with the behavior of a colloidal glass undergoing dynamical
arrest where no critical state is observed and where the arrest time of the system displays a marked
frequency dependence. These findings highlight the underlying structural differences between
colloidal gels and glasses which are manifest in their dynamic properties in the vicinity of the
liquid-to-solid transition.
