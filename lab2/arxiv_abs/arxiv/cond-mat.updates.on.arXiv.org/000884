We classify and characterize three dimensional $U(1)$ quantum spin liquids (deconfined $U(1)$
gauge theories) with global symmetries. These spin liquids have an emergent gapless photon and
emergent electric/magnetic excitations (which we assume are gapped). We first discuss in great
detail the case with time reversal and $SO(3)$ spin rotational symmetries. We find there are 15 distinct
such quantum spin liquids based on the properties of bulk excitations. We show how to interpret them
as gauged symmetry-protected topological states (SPTs). Some of these states possess fractional
response to an external $SO(3)$ gauge field, due to which we dub them "fractional topological paramagnets".
We identify 11 other anomalous states that can be grouped into 3 anomaly classes. The classification
is further refined by weakly coupling these quantum spin liquids to bosonic Symmetry Protected
Topological (SPT) phases with the same symmetry. This refinement does not modify the bulk excitation
structure but modifies universal surface properties. Taking this refinement into account, we
find there are 168 distinct such $U(1)$ quantum spin liquids. After this warm-up we provide a general
framework to classify symmetry enriched $U(1)$ quantum spin liquids for a large class of symmetries.
As a more complex example, we discuss $U(1)$ quantum spin liquids with time reversal and $Z_2$ symmetries
in detail. Based on the properties of the bulk excitations, we find there are 38 distinct such spin
liquids that are anomaly-free. There are also 37 anomalous $U(1)$ quantum spin liquids with this
symmetry. Finally, we briefly discuss the classification of $U(1)$ quantum spin liquids enriched
by some other symmetries.
