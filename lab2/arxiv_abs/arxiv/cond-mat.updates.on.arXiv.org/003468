Understanding the mechanisms which relate properties of liquid and solid phases is crucial for
fabricating new advanced solid materials, such as glasses, quasicrystals and high-entropy alloys.
Here we address this issue for quasicrystal-forming Al-Cu-Fe alloys which can serve as a model for
studying microscopic mechanisms of quasicrystal formation. We study experimentally two structural-sensitive
properties of the liquid -- viscosity and undercoolability -- and compare results with \textit{ab
initio} investigations of short-range order (SRO). We observe that SRO in Al-Cu-Fe melts is polytetrahedral
and mainly presented by distorted Kasper polyhedra. However, topologically perfect icosahedra
are almost absent an even stoichiometry of icosahedral quasicrystal phase that suggests the topological
structure of local polyhedra does not survive upon melting. It is shown that the main features of
interatomic interaction in Al-Cu-Fe system, extracted from radial distribution function and
bong-angle distribution function, are the same for both liquid and solid states. In particular,
the system demonstrates pronounced repulsion between Fe and Cu as well as strong chemical interaction
between Fe and Al, which are almost concentration-independent. We argue that SRO and structural-sensitive
properties of a melt may serve as useful indicators of solid phase formation. In particular, in the
concentration region corresponding to the composition of the icosahedral phase, a change in the
chemical short-range order is observed, which leads to minima on the viscosity and udercoolability
isotherms and has a noticeable effect on the initial stage of solidification.
