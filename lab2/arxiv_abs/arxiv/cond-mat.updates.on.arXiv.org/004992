In this work, the room temperature polar vapor sensing behavior of two dimentional (2D) heterojunction
Graphene-TiS3 materials and TiS3 nanoribbons is investigated. TiS3 nanoribbons were synthesized
via chemical vapor transport (CVT) and their structure was investigated by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X- ray spectroscopy
(EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR) analysis. The gas sensing performance of the TiS3 nanoribbons was assessed through the
observed changes in their electronic behavior. Sensing devices were fabricated with gold contacts
and with lithographically patterned graphene (Gr) electrodes in a 2D heterojunction Gr-TiS3-Gr
architecture.. It is observed that the gold contacted TiS3 device has a rather linear I-V behavior
while the Gr-TiS3-Gr heterojunction forms a contact with a higher Schottky barrier (250 meV). I-V
responses of the sensors were recorded at room temperature with a relative humidity of 55% and for
different ethanol vapor concentrations (varying from 2 to 20 ppm). I-V plots indicated an increase
in the resistance of Gr-TiS3-Gr by the adsorption of water and ethanol molecules with relatively
high sensing response (~3353% at 2 ppm). Our results reveal that selective and stable responses
to a low concentration of ethanol vapor (2 ppm) can be achieved at room temperature with transient
response and recovery times of around 6 s and 40 s, respectively. Our proposed design demonstrate
a new approach for selective molecular recognition using polar interactions between analyte vapors
and heterojunctions of 2D-materials.
