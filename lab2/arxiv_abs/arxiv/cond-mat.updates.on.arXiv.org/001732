The cuprate high-temperature superconductors are known to host a wide array of effects due to interactions
and disorder. In this work, we look at some of the consequences of these effects which can be visualized
by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. These interaction and disorder effects can be incorporated
into a mean-field description by means of a self-energy appearing in the Green's function. We first
examine the quasiparticle scattering interference spectra in the superconducting state at optimal
doping as temperature is increased. Assuming agreement with angle-resolved photoemission experiments
which suggest that the scattering rate depends on temperature, resulting in the filling of the $d$-wave
gap, we find that the peaks predicted by the octet model become progressively smeared as temperature
is increased. When the scattering rate is of the same order of magnitude as the superconducting gap,
the spectral function shows Fermi-arc-like patterns, while the power spectrum of the local density
of states shows the destruction of the octet-model peaks. We next consider the normal state properties
of the optimally-doped cuprates. We model this by adding a marginal Fermi liquid self-energy to
the normal-state propagator, and consider the dependence of the QPI spectra on frequency, temperature,
and doping. We demonstrate that the MFL self-energy leads to a smearing of the caustics appearing
in the normal-state QPI power spectrum as either temperature or frequency is increased at fixed
doping. The smearing is found to be more prominent in the MFL case than in an ordinary Fermi liquid.
We also consider the case of a marginal Fermi liquid with a strongly momentum-dependent self-energy
which gives rise to a visible "nodal-antinodal" dichotomy at the normal state, and discuss how the
spectra as seen in ARPES and STS differ from both an isotropic metal and a broadened $d$-wave superconductor.
