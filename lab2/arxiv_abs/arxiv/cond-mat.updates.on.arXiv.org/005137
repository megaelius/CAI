The BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 compounds with x = 0 (parent), x = 0.10 (under-doped), x = 0.31, 0.33, 0.53 (superconductors
with Tc = 27.3 K, 27.6 K, 13.9 K, respectively) and x = 0.70, 0.77 (over-doped) have been investigated
by the 57Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy versus temperature with special attention paid to regions
of the spin density wave, the nematic phase and the superconducting transition. Comparing to the
parent compound, the BaFe2(As0.90P0.10)2 exhibits reduced amplitude of SDW and preserved universality
class of two-dimensional magnetic planes with one-dimensional spins. The nematic phase region
for x = 0.10 is characterized by incoherent magnetic order. The BaFe2(As0.69P0.31)2 shows coexistence
of weak magnetic order and superconductivity due to vicinity of the quantum critical point. The
charge density modulations are perturbed near Tc for BaFe2(As0.67P0.33)2 and BaFe2(As0.47P0.53)2
superconductors. Pronounced hump of the average quadrupole splitting across superconducting
transition is observed for x = 0.33. The phosphorus substitution increases the Debye temperature
of BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 compound. Moreover, experimental electron charge densities at the Fe nuclei
in this material conclusively show that it should be recognized as a hole-doped system. The measured
M\"ossbauer spectral shift and the spectral area remain unaffected by transition to the superconducting
state, which indicate that neither the average electron density at the Fe nuclei nor the dynamical
properties of the Fe-sublattice are sensitive to the superconducting transition. Theoretical
calculations of the hyperfine parameters determining the patterns of the M\"ossbauer spectra
of BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 with x = 0, 0.31, 0.5, and 1.0 were performed within the framework of the density
functional theory.
