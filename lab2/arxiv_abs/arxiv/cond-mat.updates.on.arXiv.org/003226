${}^3$He spin-echo experiments have been used to study surface morphology, molecular and atomic
surface diffusion, phonon dispersions, phason dispersions and even phase transitions of ionic
liquids. However, the interactions between ${}^3$He atoms and surfaces or their adsorbates are
typically isotropic and weak. To overcome these limitations, one can use molecules instead of ${}^3$He
in surface spin-echo experiments. The molecular degrees of freedom, such as rotation, may be exploited
to provide additional insight into surfaces and the behaviour of their adsorbates. Indeed, a recent
experiment has shown that ortho-hydrogen can be used as a probe that is sensitive to the orientation
of a Cu(115) surface [Godsi et al., Nat. Comm. 8, 15357 (2017)]. However, the additional degrees
of freedom offered by molecules also pose a theoretical challenge: a large manifold of molecular
states and magnetic field-induced couplings between internal states. Here, we present a fully
quantum mechanical approach to model molecular surface spin-echo experiments and connect the
experimental signal to the elements of the time-independent molecule-surface scattering matrix.
We present a one-dimensional transfer matrix method that includes the molecular hyperfine degrees
of freedom and accounts for the spatial separation of the molecular wavepackets due to the magnetic
control fields. We apply the method to the case of ortho-hydrogen, show that the calculated experimental
signal is sensitive to the scattering matrix elements, and perform a preliminary comparison to
experiment. This work sets the stage for Bayesian optimization to determine the scattering matrix
elements from experimental measurements and for a framework that describes molecular surface
spin-echo experiments to study dynamic surfaces.
