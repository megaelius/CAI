Above a critical temperature known as the Leidenfrost point (LFP), a heated surface can suspend
a liquid droplet above a film of its own vapor. The insulating vapor film can be highly detrimental
in metallurgical quenching and thermal control of electronic devices, but may also be harnessed
to reduce drag and generate power. Manipulation of the LFP has occurred mostly through experiment,
giving rise to a variety of semi-empirical models that account for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability,
nucleation rates, and superheat limits. However, a truly comprehensive model has been difficult
given that the LFP varies dramatically for different fluids and is affected by system pressure,
surface roughness and liquid wettability. Here, we identify the vapor film instability for small
length scales that ultimately sets the collapse condition at the Leidenfrost point. From a linear
stability analysis, it is shown that the main film stabilizing mechanisms are the liquid-vapor
surface tension, viscous transport of vapor mass, and evaporation at the liquid-vapor interface.
Meanwhile, van der Waals interaction between the bulk liquid and the solid substrate across the
vapor phase drives film collapse. This physical insight into vapor film dynamics allows us to derive
an ab-initio, mathematical expression for the Leidenfrost point of a fluid. The expression captures
the experimental data on the LFP for different fluids under various surface wettabilities and ambient
pressures. For fluids that wet the surface (small intrinsic contact angle), the expression can
be simplified to a single, dimensionless number that encapsulates the nanoscale instability governing
the LFP.
