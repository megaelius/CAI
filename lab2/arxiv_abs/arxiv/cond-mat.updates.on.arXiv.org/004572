Using the non-interacting Anderson tight-binding model on the Bethe lattice as a toy model for the
many-body quantum dynamics, we propose a novel and transparent theoretical explanation of the
anomalously slow dynamics that emerges in the bad metal phase preceding the Many-Body Localization
transition. By mapping the time-decorrelation of many-body wave-functions onto Directed Polymers
in Random Media, we show the existence of a glass transition within the extended regime separating
a metallic-like phase at small disorder, where delocalization occurs on an exponential number
of paths, from a bad metal-like phase at intermediate disorder, where resonances are formed on rare,
specific, disorder dependent site orbitals on very distant generations. The physical interpretation
of subdiffusion and non-exponential relaxation emerging from this picture is complementary to
the Griffiths one, although both scenarios rely on the presence of heavy-tailed distribution of
the escape times. We relate the dynamical evolution in the glassy phase to the depinning transition
of Directed Polymers, which results in macroscopic and abrupt jumps of the preferred delocalizing
paths when a parameter like the energy is varied, and produce a singular behavior of the overlap correlation
function between eigenstates at different energies. By comparing the quantum dynamics on loop-less
Cayley trees and Random Regular Graphs we discuss the effect of loops, showing that in the latter
slow dynamics and apparent power-laws extend on a very large time-window but are eventually cut-off
on a time-scale that diverges at the MBL transition.
