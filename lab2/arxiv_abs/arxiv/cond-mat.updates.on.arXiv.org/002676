We formulate a method of deriving effective low-energy Hamiltonian for nonperiodic systems such
as interfaces for strongly correlated electron systems by extending conventional multi-scale
$\textit{ab initio}$ scheme for correlated electrons (MACE). We apply the formalism to copper-oxide
high $T_{\rm c}$ superconductors in an example of the interface between overdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$
and Mott insulating La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$ recently realized experimentally. We show that the parameters
of the $E_g$ Hamiltonian derived for the La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$/La$_{1.55}$Sr$_{0.45}$CuO$_{4}$
superlattice differ considerably from those for the bulk La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$, particularly significant
in the partially-screened Coulomb parameters and the level offset between the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$
and $d_{z^{2}}$ orbitals, $\Delta E$. In addition, we investigate the effect of the lattice relaxation
on the $E_g$ Hamiltonian by carefully comparing the parameters derived before and after the structure
optimization. We find that the CuO$_{6}$ octahedra distort after the relaxation as a consequence
of the Madelung potential difference between the insulator and metal sides, by which the layer dependence
of the hopping and Coulomb parameters becomes more gradual than the unrelaxed case. Furthermore,
the structure relaxation dramatically changes the $\Delta E$ value and the occupation number at
the interface. This study not only evidences the importance of the ionic relaxation around interfaces
but also provides a set of layer-dependent parameters of the $E_g$ Hamiltonian, which is expected
to provide further insight into the interfacial superconductivity when solved with low-energy
solvers.
