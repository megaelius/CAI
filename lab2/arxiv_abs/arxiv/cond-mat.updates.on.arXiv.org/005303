In this tutorial, we combine the different scientific fields of information theory, thermodynamics,
regularization theory and non-destructive imaging, especially for photoacoustic and photothermal
imaging. The goal is to get a better understanding of how information gaining for subsurface imaging
works and how the spatial resolution limit can be overcome by using additional information. Here,
the resolution limit in photoacoustic and photothermal imaging is derived from the irreversibility
of attenuation of the pressure wave and of heat diffusion during propagation of the signals from
the imaged subsurface structures to the sample surface, respectively. The acoustic or temperature
signals are converted into so-called virtual waves, which are their reversible counterparts and
which can be used for image reconstruction by well-known ultrasound reconstruction methods. The
conversion into virtual waves is an ill-posed inverse problem which needs regularization. The
reason for that is the information loss during signal propagation to the sample surface, which turns
out to be equal to the entropy production. As the entropy production from acoustic attenuation is
usually small compared to the entropy production from heat diffusion, the spatial resolution in
acoustic imaging is higher than in thermal imaging. Therefore, it is especially necessary to overcome
this resolution limit for thermographic imaging by using additional information. Incorporating
sparsity and non-negativity in iterative regularization methods gives a significant resolution
enhancement, which was experimentally demonstrated by one-dimensional imaging of thin layers
with varying depth or by three-dimensional imaging, either from a single detection plane or from
three perpendicular detection planes on the surface of a sample cube.
