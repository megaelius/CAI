Here we report the evolution of structural, magnetic and transport properties in MnBi$_{2-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_4$
(0$\leq x \leq$2) single crystals. MnSb$_2$Te$_4$, isostructural to MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, has the
lattice parameters of \textit{a}=4.2445(3)$\AA$ and \textit{c}=40.869(5)$\AA$, respectively.
With increasing Sb content in MnBi$_{2-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_4$, the \textit{a}-lattice decreases linearly
following the Vegards law while the \textit{c}-lattice shows little compositional dependence.
The \textit{a}-lattice contraction occurs by reducing Mn-Te-Mn bond angle while Mn-Te bond length
remains nearly constant. The anisotropic magnetic properties suggest an antiferromagnetic order
below T$_N$=19\,K for MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ with the magnetic moments aligned along the crystallographic
\textit{c}-axis. The antiferromagnetic ordering temperature slightly decreases from 24\,K
for MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ to 19\,K for MnSb$_2$Te$_4$. More dramatic change was observed for the critical
magnetic fields required for the spin-flop transition and moment saturation. With increasing
Sb content, both critical fields decrease and in MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ a small field of 3\,kOe is enough
to saturate the moment. In high magnetic fields, the saturation moment shows significant suppression
from 3.56$\mu_B$/Mn for MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ to 1.57$\mu_B$/Mn for MnSb$_2$Te$_4$. Data analyses
suggest that both the interlayer magnetic interaction and single ion anisotropy decrease with
increasing Sb content. The partial substitution of Bi by Sb also dramatically affects the transport
properties. A crossover from n-type to p-type conducting behavior is observed around x=0.63. Our
results show close correlation between structural, magnetic and transport properties in MnBi$_{2-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_4$
and that partial substitution of Bi by Sb is an effective approach to fine tuning both the magnetism
and transport properties of MnBi$_{2-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_4$.
