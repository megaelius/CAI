Starting from a realistic extended Hubbard model for a $p_{x,y}$-orbital tight-binding model
on the Honeycomb lattice, we perform a thorough investigation on the possible electron instabilities
in the magic-angle-twisted bilayer-graphene near the van Hove (VH) dopings. Here we focus on the
interplay between the SU(2)$\times$SU(2) and the $D_3$ symmetries. While the former leads to the
degeneracy between the inter-valley SDW and CDW and that between the inter-valley singlet and triplet
SCs, the latter leads to the degeneracy and competition among the three symmetry-related wave vectors
of the DW orders, originating from the FS-nesting. The interplay between the two degeneracies leads
to intriguing quantum states relevant to recent experiments, as revealed by our systematic RPA
based calculations followed by a succeeding mean-field energy minimization for the ground state.
At the SU(2)$\times$SU(2) symmetric point, the degenerate inter-valley SDW and CDW are mixed into
a new state of matter dubbed as the chiral SO(4) spin-charge DW. This state simultaneously hosts
three mutually perpendicular 4-component vectorial spin-charge DW orders with each adopting
one wave vector. In the presence of a tiny inter-valley exchange interaction with coefficient $J_H\to
0^{-}$, a pure chiral SDW state is obtained. In the case of $J_H\to 0^{+}$, a nematic CDW order is accompanied
by two SDW orders with equal amplitudes. This nematic CDW+SDW state possesses a stripy distribution
of the charge density, consistent with the recent STM observations. On the aspect of SC, while the
triplet $p+ip$ and singlet $d+id$ topological SCs are degenerate at $J_H=0$ near the VH dopings,
the former (latter) is favored for $J_H\to 0^{-}$ ($J_H\to 0^{+}$). In addition, the two asymmetric
doping-dependent behaviors of the superconducting Tc obtained are well consistent with experiments.
