We prove duality relations for two interacting particle systems: the q-deformed totally asymmetric
simple exclusion process (q-TASEP) and the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). Expectations
of the duality functionals correspond to certain joint moments of particle locations or integrated
currents, respectively. Duality implies that they solve systems of ODEs. These systems are integrable
and for particular step and half stationary initial data we use a nested contour integral ansatz
to provide explicit formulas for the systems' solutions and hence also the moments. We form Laplace
transform like generating functions of these moments and via residue calculus we compute two different
types of Fredholm determinant formulas for such generating functions. For ASEP, the first type
of formula is new and readily lends itself to asymptotic analysis (as necessary to reprove GUE Tracy-Widom
distribution fluctuations for ASEP), while the second type of formula is recognizable as closely
related to Tracy and Widom's ASEP formula. For q-TASEP both formulas coincide with those computed
via Borodin and Corwin's Macdonald processes. Both q-TASEP and ASEP have limit transitions to the
free energy of the continuum directed polymer, the logarithm of the solution of the stochastic heat
equation, or the Hopf-Cole solution to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. Thus, q-TASEP and ASEP
are integrable discretizations of these continuum objects; the systems of ODEs associated to their
dualities are deformed discrete quantum delta Bose gases; and the procedure through which we pass
from expectations of their duality functionals to characterizing generating functions is a rigorous
version of the replica trick in physics.
