Amorphous solids manifest puzzling effects of mysterious degrees of freedom often referred to
as "two-level systems." These degrees of freedom give rise to a heat capacity and phonon scattering
that are in great excess over what would be expected for a solid that has a unique vibrational ground
state. Of particular conceptual importance is the apparent near universality of phonon scattering
in amorphous solids made by quenching a liquid. To rationalise this universality, scale-free scenarios
have been proposed that either hinge on there being long-range interactions between bare structural
degrees of freedom or that invoke long-range criticality stemming from the emergence of marginally
stable vibrational modes. In a contrasting, local scenario, the puzzling low-temperature degrees
of freedom are, instead, weakly-interacting, strongly anharmonic degrees of freedom each of which
involves the motion of a few hundred particles. These anharmonic degrees of freedom correspond
to the low-barrier subset of the cooperative activated events responsible for mass transport near
the glass transition temperature $T_g$. In this scenario, the universality of phonon scattering
comes about because the characteristic energy scale of the local anharmonic resonances and the
strength of their interaction with phonons are both set by $T_g$, while their concentration is set
by a cooperativity size $\xi$ for dynamics at the glass transition temperature. Despite their stylistic
differences, all these scenarios attempt to describe the gradual freezing-out of translational
degrees of freedom as an aperiodic assembly of atoms is cooled toward absolute zero. The local scenario
is distinct in explicitly predicting qualitatively new physics at the length scale $\xi$. A key
signature of this lengthscale is the vibrational excitations of the locally-activated configurations
