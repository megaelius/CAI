Lead iodide perovskites have attracted considerable interest in the upcoming photovoltaic technologies
and optoelectronic devices. Therefore, an accurate theoretical description of the electronic
and optical properties especially to understand the excitonic effects in this class of materials
is of scientific and practical interest. However, despite several theoretical research endeavours
in past, the most accurate analysis of the key electronic parameters for solar cell performance,
such as optical properties, effective mass, exciton binding energy (E$_B$) and the radiative exciton
lifetime are still largely unknown. Here, we employ state-of-the-art first-principles based
methodologies viz. hybrid functional(HSE06) combined with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), many-body
perturbation theory (GW, BSE), model-BSE (mBSE), Wannier-Mott (WM) and Density Functional Perturbation
Theory (DFPT). By taking a prototypical model system viz. APbI$_3$ (A = Formamidinium (FA), methylammonium
(MA), and Cs), an exhaustive analysis is presented on the theoretical understanding of the optical,
electronic and excitonic properties. We show that tuning of exact exchange parameter ($\alpha$)
in HSE06 calculations incorporating SOC, followed by single shot GW, and BSE play a pivotal role
in obtaining a reliable predictions for the experimental bandgap. We demonstrate that mBSE approach
improves the feature of optical spectra w.r.t experiments. Furthermore, WM approach and ionic
contribution to dielectric screening (below 16 meV) ameliorate the E$_B$. Our results reveal that
the direct-indirect band gap transition (Rashba splitting) may be a factor responsible for the
reduced charge carrier recombination rate in MAPbI$_3$ and FAPbI$_3$. The role of cation ''A''
for procuring the long-lived exciton lifetime is well understood. This proposed methodology allows
to design new materials with tailored excitonic properties.
