Recent theoretical and experimental work has demonstrated how the superconducting critical temperature
$(T_c)$ can be modified by rotating the magnetisation of a single homogeneous ferromagnet proximity-coupled
to the superconducting layer. This occurs when the superconductor and ferromagnet are separated
by a thin heavy normal metal which provides an enhanced interfacial Rashba spin-orbit interaction.
We consider the reciprocal effect: magnetisation reorientation driven by the superconducting
phase transition. We solve the tight-binding Bogolioubov-de Gennes equations on a lattice self-consistentl
and find that the relative angle between the spin-orbit field and the magnetisation gives rise to
a contribution in the free energy even in the normal state, due to band-structure effects. For temperatures
below $T_c$, superconductivity gives rise to a competing contribution. We demonstrate that by
lowering the temperature, in addition to reorientation of the favoured magnetisation direction
from in-plane (IP) to out-of-plane (OOP), a $\pi/4$ IP rotation for thicker ferromagnetic layers
is possible. Furthermore, computation of $T_c$ in the ballistic limit shows a dependence on the
IP orientation of the magnetisation - in contrast to our previous result on diffusive limit. This
finding is relevant with respect to thin-film heterostructures which are likely to be in the ballistic
regime of transport. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of observing the magnetic
anisotropy induced by the superconducting transition when other magnetic anisotropies, such
as the shape anisotropy for a ferromagnetic film, are taken into account. Our work suggests that
the superconducting condensation energy in principle can trigger a reorientation of the magnetisation
of a thin-film ferromagnet upon lowering the temperature below $T_c$, in particular for ferromagnets
with weak magnetic anisotropies.
