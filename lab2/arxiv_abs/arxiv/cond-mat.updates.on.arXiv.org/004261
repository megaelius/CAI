Spiroborate anions based inorganic electrolytes and ionic liquids (ILs) have fascinating electrochemical
and tribological properties, and have received widespread attention in industrial applications.
Molecular chiralities of spiroborate anions have a significant effect on microstructures and
macroscopic functionalities of these ionic materials in applications, and thus deserve a fundamental
understanding. In current work, we performed quantum chemistry calculations to address binding
strength and coordination structures of chiral bis(mandelato)borate ([BMB]) anions with representative
alkali metal ions, as well as electronic properties of alkali metal ion-[BMB] ion pair complexes.
The optimized [BMB] conformers are categorized into V-shaped, bent, and twisted structures with
varied electrostatic potential contours, conformational energies, and distinct alkali metal
ion-[BMB] binding structures. Alkali metal ions have additional associations with phenyl groups
in V-shaped [BMB] conformers owing to preferential cation-$\pi$ interactions. Furthermore,
effects of molecular chiralities of [BMB] anions on thermodynamics and microstructural properties
of tetraalkylphosphonium [BMB] ILs were studied by performing extensive atomistic interactions.
Oxygen atoms in [BMB] anions have competitive hydrogen bonding interactions with hydrogen atoms
in cations depending on molecular chiralities and steric hindrance effects of [BMB] anions. However,
molecular chiralities of [BMB] anions have negligible effect on liquid densities of tetraalkylphosphonium
[BMB] ILs and spatial distributions of boron atoms in anions around phosphorous atoms in cations.
Enlarging tetraalkylphosphonium cation sizes leads to enhanced cation-anion hydrogen bonding
and Coulombic interactions due to enhanced segregation of polar groups in apolar networks in heterogeneous
IL matrices.
