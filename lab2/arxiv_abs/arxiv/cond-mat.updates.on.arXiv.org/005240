Silver benzeneselenolate [AgSePh] is a coordination polymer that hosts a hybrid quantum well structure.
The recent advancements in the study of its tightly bound excitons (~300 meV) and photoconductive
properties makes it an interesting representative of a material platform that is an environmentally
stable alternative to 2D metal halide perovskites in terms of optoelectronic properties. To this
aim, several challenges are to be addressed, among which the lack of control over the metal-organic
reaction process in the reported synthesis of the [AgSePh] nanocrystal film (NC). This issue contributed
to cast doubts over the origin of its intra-bandgap electronic states. In this article we study all
the steps to obtain phase pure [AgSePh] NC films, from thin silver films through its oxidation and
reaction via a chemical vapor-solid with benzeneselenol, by means of UV-vis, XRD, SEM, and AFM.
Raman and FTIR spectroscopy are also employed to provide vibrational peaks assignment, for the
first time on this polymer. Our analysis supports an acid-base reaction scheme based on an acid attacking
the metal oxide precursor, generating water as byproduct of the polymeric synthesis, speeding
up the reaction by solvating the PhSeH. The reaction readily goes to completion within 30 min in a
supersaturated PhSeH / N2 atmosphere at 90 {\deg}C. Our analysis suggests the absence of precursor's
leftovers or oxidized species that could con-tribute to the intra-gap states. By tuning the reaction
parameters, we gained control on film morphology to obtain substrate-parallel oriented micro-crystals
showing different excitonic absorption intensities. Finally, centimeters size high quality
[AgSePh] NC films could be obtained, enabling exploitation of their optoelectronic properties,
such as UV photodetection, in large-area applications.
