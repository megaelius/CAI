We present a bond-operator theory (BOT) suitable for description both magnetically ordered phases
and paramagnetic phases with singlet ground states in spin-1/2 magnets. Proposed BOT provides
a regular expansion of physical quantities in powers of 1/n, where n is the maximum number of bosons
which can occupy a unit cell (physical results correspond to n=1). Two variants of BOT are suggested:
for two and for four spins in the unit cell (two-spin and four-spin BOTs, respectively). We consider
spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF) on simple square lattice bilayer by the two-spin BOT.
Ground-state energy E, staggered magnetization M, and quasiparticles spectra found within the
first order in 1/n are in good quantitative agreement with previous results both in paramagnetic
and in ordered phases not very close to the quantum critical point between the phases. By doubling
the unit cell in two directions, we discuss spin-1/2 HAF on square lattice using the suggested four-spin
BOT. Magnon spectrum, E, and M found in the first order in 1/n are in good quantitative agreement with
previous numerical and experimental results. We observe a special moderately damped spin-0 quasiparticle
("singlon" for short) whose energy is smaller than the energy of the Higgs mode in the most part of
the Brillouin zone. By considering HAF with Izing-type anisotropy, we find that both Higgs and "singlon"
modes stem from two-magnon bound states which merge with two-magnon continuum not far from the isotropic
limit. We demonstrate that "singlons" appear explicitly in "scalar" correlators one of which describes
the Raman intensity in $B_{1g}$ symmetry. The latter is expressed in the leading order in 1/n via
the "singlon" Green's function at zero momentum which shows an asymmetric peak. The position of
this peak coincides with the position of "two-magnon" peak observed experimentally in, e.g., layered
cuprates.
