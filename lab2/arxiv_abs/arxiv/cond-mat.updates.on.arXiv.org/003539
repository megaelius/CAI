Electronic and/or vibronic coherence has been found by recent ultrafast spectroscopy experiments
in many chemical, biological and material systems. This indicates that there are strong and complicated
interactions between electronic states and vibration modes in realistic chemical systems. Therefore,
simulations of quantum dynamics with a large number of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom
are highly desirable. Due to the efficient compression and localized representation of quantum
states in the matrix-product state (MPS) formulation, time-evolution methods based on the MPS
framework, which we summarily refer to as tDMRG (time-dependent density-matrix renormalization
group) methods, are considered to be promising candidates to study the quantum dynamics of realistic
chemical systems. In this work, we benchmark the performances of four different tDMRG methods,
including global Taylor, global Krylov, local one-site and two-site time-dependent variational
principle (1TDVP and 2TDVP), with a comparison to multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree
(MCTDH) and experimental results. Two typical chemical systems of internal conversion and singlet
fission are investigated, one containing strong and high-order local and non-local electron-vibration
couplings, the other exhibiting a continuous phonon bath. The comparison shows that the tDMRG methods
(particularly, the 2TDVP method) can describe the full quantum dynamics in large chemical systems
accurately and efficiently. Several key parameters in the tDMRG calculation including the truncation
error threshold, time interval and ordering of local sites were also investigated to strike the
balance between efficiency and accuracy of results.
