We discuss and qualify a previously unnoticed connection between two different phenomena in the
physics of nanoscale friction, general in nature and also met in experiments including sliding
emu- lations in optical lattices, and protein force spectroscopy. The first is thermolubricity,
designating the condition in which a dry nanosized slider can at sufficiently high temperature
and low velocity exhibit very small viscous friction f ~ v despite strong corrugations that would
commonly imply hard mechanical stick-slip f ~ log(v). The second, apparently unrelated phenomenon
present in externally forced nanosystems, is the occurrence of negative work tails ("free lunches")
in the work probabilty distribution, tails whose presence is necessary to fulfil the celebrated
Jarzynski equality of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Here we prove analytically and
demonstrate numerically in the prototypical classical overdamped one-dimensional point slider
(Prandtl-Tomlinson) model that the presence or absence of thermolubricity is exactly equivalent
to satisfaction or violation of the Jarzynski equality. The divide between the two regimes, satisfaction
of Jarzynski with ther- molubricity, and violation of both, simply coincides with the total frictional
work per cycle falling below or above kT respectively. This concept can, with due caution, be extended
to more complex sliders, thus inviting crosscheck experiments, such as searching for free lunches
in cold ion sliding as well as in forced protein unwinding, and alternatively checking for a thermolubric
regime in dragged colloid monolayers. As an important byproduct, we derive a parameter-free formula
expressing the linear velocity coefficient of frictional dissipated power in the thermolubric
viscous regime, correcting previous empirically parametrized expressions.
