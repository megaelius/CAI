We report observations of a remarkable scaling behavior with respect to concentration in the passive
microbead rheology of two highly entangled polymeric solutions, polyethylene oxide (PEO) and
hyaluronic acid (HA). This behavior was reported previously [Hill et al., PLOS ONE (2014)] for human
lung mucus, a complex biological hydrogel, motivating the current study for synthetic polymeric
solutions PEO and HA. The strategy is to identify, and focus within, a wide range of lag times ${\tau}$
for which passive micron diameter beads exhibit self-similar (fractional, power law) mean-squared-displacement
(MSD) statistics. For lung mucus, PEO at three different molecular weights (Mw), and HA at one Mw,
we find ensemble-averaged MSDs of the form ${\langle}{\Delta}r^{2}({\tau}){\rangle} = 4D_{\alpha}{\tau}^{\alpha}$,
all within a common band, [1/60 sec, 3 sec], of lag times ${\tau}$. We employ the MSD power law parameters
$(D_{\alpha},{\alpha})$ to classify each polymeric solution over a range of highly entangled
concentrations. By the generalized Stokes-Einstein relation, power law MSD implies power law
elastic $G'({\omega})$ and viscous $G''({\omega})$ moduli for frequencies $1/{\tau}$, [0.33
sec$^{-1}$, 60 sec$^{-1}$]. A natural question surrounds the polymeric properties that dictate
$D_{\alpha}$ and ${\alpha}$, e.g. polymer concentration c, Mw, and stiffness (persistence length).
In [Hill et al., PLOS ONE (2014)], we showed the MSD exponent ${\alpha}$ varies linearly, while the
pre-factor $D_{\alpha}$ varies exponentially, with concentration, i.e. the semi-log plot, $(log(D_{\alpha}),{\alpha})(c)$
of the classifier data is collinear. Here we show the same result for three distinct Mw PEO and HA at
a single Mw. Future studies are required to explore the generality of these results for polymeric
solutions, and to understand this scaling behavior with polymer concentration.
