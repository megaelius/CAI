In response to the rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), with ten thousands of deaths and intensive-care
hospitalizations, a large number of regions and countries have been put under lockdown by their
respective governments. Policy makers are confronted in this situation with the problem of balancing
public health considerations, with the economic costs of a persistent lockdown. We introduce a
modified epidemic model, the controlled-SIR model, in which the disease reproduction rates evolve
dynamically in response to political and societal reactions. Social distancing measures are triggered
by the number of infections, providing a dynamic feedback-loop which slows the spread of the virus.
We estimate the total cost of several distinct containment policies incurring over the entire path
of the endemic. Costs comprise direct medical cost for intensive care, the economic cost of social
distancing, as well as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, the total
costs are highest at a medium level of reactivity when value of life costs are omitted. Very strict
measures fare best, with a hands-off policy coming second. Our key findings are independent of the
specific parameter estimates, which are to be adjusted with the COVID-19 research status. In addition
to numerical simulations, an explicit analytical solution for the controlled continuous-time
SIR model is presented. For an uncontrolled outbreak and a reproduction factor of three, an additional
28% of the population is infected beyond the herd immunity point, reached at an infection level of
66%, which adds up to a total of 94%.
