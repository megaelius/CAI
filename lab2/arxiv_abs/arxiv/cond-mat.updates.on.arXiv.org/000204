Using density-functional theory in the restricted-orientation approximation, we analyse the
liquid-crystal patterns and phase behaviour of a fluid of hard rectangular particles confined
in a two-dimensional square nanocavity of side length $H$ composed of hard inner walls. Patterning
in the cavity is governed by surface-induced order, capillary and frustration effects, and depends
on the relative values of particle aspect ratio $\kappa\equiv L/\sigma$, with $L$ the length and
$\sigma$ the width of the rectangles ($L\ge\sigma$), and cavity size $H$. Ordering may be very different
from bulk ($H\to\infty$) behaviour when $H$ is a few times the particle length $L$ (nanocavity).
Bulk and confinement properties are obtained for the cases $\kappa=1$, 3 and 6. In the confined fluid
surface-induced frustration leads to four-fold symmetry breaking in all phases (which become
two-fold symmetric). Since no director distorsion can arise in our model by construction, frustration
in the director orientation is relaxed by the creation of domain walls (where the director changes
by $90^{\circ}$); this configuration is necessary to stabilise periodic phases. For $\kappa=1$
the crystal becomes stable with commensuration transitions taking place as $H$ is varied. In the
case $\kappa=3$ the commensuration transitions involve columnar phases with different number
of columns. Finally, in the case $\kappa=6$, the high-density region of the phase diagram is dominated
by commensuration transitions between smectic structures; at lower densities there is a symmetry-breaking
isotropic $\to$ nematic transition exhibiting non-monotonic behaviour with cavity size.
