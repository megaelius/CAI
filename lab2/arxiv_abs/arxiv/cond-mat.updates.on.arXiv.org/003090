Effective and accurate characterization and quantification of complex microstructure of a heterogeneous
material and its evolution under external stimuli are very challenging, yet crucial to achieving
reliable material performance prediction, processing optimization and advanced material design.
Here, we address this challenge by developing a set of novel hierarchical statistical microstructural
descriptors, which we call the "n-point polytope functions" Pn, for quantitative characterization,
representation and modeling of complex material microstructure and its evolution. These novel
polytope functions successively include higher-order n-point statistics of the features of interest
in the microstructure in a concise, expressive, explainable, and universal manner; and can be directly
computed from multi-modal imaging data. We develop highly efficient computational tools to directly
extract the Pn functions up to n = 8 from multi-modal imaging data. Using simple model microstructures,
we show that these novel statistical descriptors effectively "decompose" the structural features
of interest into a set of "polytope basis", allowing one to easily detect any underlying symmetry
or emerging features during the structural evolution. We apply these novel Pn functions to quantify
and model a variety of heterogeneous material systems, including particle-reinforced composites,
metal-ceramic composites, concretes, porous materials; as well as the microstructural evolution
in an aged lead-tin alloy. Our results indicate that the Pn functions can offer a practically complete
and compact set of basis for quantitative microstructure representation (QMR), for both static
3D complex microstructure and 4D microstructural evolution of a wide spectrum of heterogeneous
material systems.
