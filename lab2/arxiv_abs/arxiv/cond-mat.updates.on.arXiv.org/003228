We investigate thermodynamic behaviors of dilute Mg-Zn-Y ternary alloys to form a unique solute-enriched
stacking-fault (SESF), which is an intrinsic-II type stacking-fault (I2-SF) enriched by the Zn
and Y atoms and represents the structural-unit of the long-period stacking/order (LPSO) phase.
SESF in the hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) Mg matrix forms a local face-centered-cubic (fcc) environment,
and hence our thermodynamic analysis is based on the Gibbs energy comparison between hcp and fcc
phases over the Mg-Zn-Y ternary composition ranges, using the calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD)
method aided by the first principles calculations. Segregation behaviors of solute Zn/Y atoms
into the SESF are firstly estimated according to the Hillert's parallel tangent law, followed by
the possible disorder-order phase transformation within the SESF using the multiple-sublattice
model. We find that the Zn/Y co-segregations at the SESF provide a remarkable condition that the
fcc layers become more stable than the hcp-Mg matrix. Besides, within the SESF, the following spinodal-like
decomposition into the Mg-rich solid-solution and the Zn/Y-rich L12-type order phase causes a
significant reduction of the total Gibbs energy of the system. These thermodynamic behaviors explain
fairly well a phenomenological origin of the Zn-Y clustering with the L12-type short-range order,
which is known to occur for the LPSO phases and also confirmed for the present SESF by electron microscopy
experiments. Therefore, strong Zn-Y interactions even in dilute conditions play a key role to stabilize
firmly the SESF in the Mg-Zn-Y alloys.
