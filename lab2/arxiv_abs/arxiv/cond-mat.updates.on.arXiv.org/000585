Under high pressure conditions, Zr undergoes a phase transformation from its ambient equilibrium
$\alpha$ phase to $\omega$ phase. Upon returning to ambient conditions following this transformation,
the $\omega$ phase displays hysteretic behavior, retaining a significant amount of metastable
$\omega$ phase, with partial recovery back into the $\alpha$ phase. This study presents an in-situ
synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis of Zr samples previously shock-loaded to compressive
peak stresses of 8 and 10.5 GPa and then annealed at temperatures of 443, 463, 483, and 503K. The evolution
of the $\alpha$ phase volume fraction was tracked quantitatively, and the dislocation densities
in both phases were tracked qualitatively during annealing. Upon heating, the reverse transformation
of $\omega\to\alpha$ occurs rapidly and quickly reaches a new metastable state. The initial rate
of transformation is faster at higher temperatures. Samples shock-loaded to higher peak pressures
experienced higher initial transformation rates and more extensive transformation albeit starting
with lower $\alpha$ fractions. Dislocation content in both phases was observed to be high in the
as-shocked samples. Annealing the samples reduces the dislocation content in both phases, with
the reduction being lesser in the $\omega$ phase, leading to the postulation that transformation
from $\omega\to\alpha$ is restricted by the pinning effect of dislocation structures within the
$\omega$ phase. EBSD analysis reaffirmed that the expected $(0\;0\;0\;1)_\alpha\parallel(1\;0\;\bar{1}\;1)_\omega$
and $[1\;0\;\bar{1}\;0]_\alpha\parallel[1\;1\;\bar{2}\;\bar{3}]_\omega$ orientation
relationship is maintained during nucleation and growth of the $\alpha$ phase during the heating.
