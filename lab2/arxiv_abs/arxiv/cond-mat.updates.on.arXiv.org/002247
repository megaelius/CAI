The ground state (GS) properties of the ferrimagnetic quasi-one-dimensional $AB_{2}$ Hubbard
model are calculated taking the effects of charge and spin quantum fluctuations on equal footing.
Using a functional integral approach, combined with a perturbative expansion in the strong-coupling
regime, we derive the Lagrangian density associated with the charge (Grassmann fields) and spin
[$SU(2)$ gauge fields] degrees of freedom. In the strong-coupling regime ($U\gg t,$ where $U$ is
Coulomb repulsion and $t$ is the first-neighbor hopping amplitude), we obtain a perturbative low-energy
theory suitable to describe the ferrimagnetic phase at half filling and in the hole-doped regime.
At half filling, a perturbative spin-wave analysis allow us to find the GS energy, sublattice magnetizations,
and Lieb total spin per unit cell of the effective quantum Heisenberg model, in very good agreement
with previous results. In the challenging hole doping regime away from half filling, we derive the
corresponding $t\textrm{-}J(=4t^{2}/U)$ Hamiltonian. Under the assumption that charge and
spin quantum correlations are decoupled, the evolution of the second-order spin-wave modes in
the doped regime unveils the occurrence of spatially modulated spin structures and the emergence
of phase separation in the presence of resonating-valence-bond states. We have also calculated
the doping-dependent GS energy and total spin per unit cell, in which case it is shown that the spiral
magnetic order collapses at a critical hole concentration. Notably, our analytical results in
the doped regime are in very good agreement with recent density matrix renormalization group studies,
where our assumption of spin-charge decoupling is numerically supported by the formation of charge-density
waves in anti-phase with the modulation of the ferrimagnetic structure.
