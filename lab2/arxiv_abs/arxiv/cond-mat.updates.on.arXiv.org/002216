In different materials, orientationally-controlled assembling of building blocks results into
develops anisotropic particles. These trends are more pronounced in atoms of metallic elements
when they are in certain transition state as their monolayer assembly is vital to develop triangular-shaped
tiny particles. When triangular-shape packets of nanoshape energy are placed over the compact
monolayer assembly of such atoms, they result into bind those atoms into their own shape. Joined
triangular-shaped tiny particles developed under tuned bipolar pulse separated into two at point
of connect because of a bit perturbed exerting force for electrons of their connected regions. Atoms
of those tiny particles elongate from the centers to both sides under the exertion of surface format
forces while their resting at electronically-flat surface where each one-dimensional array of
atoms forms a structure of smooth element. A structure of smooth element is further shaped by travelling
photons along the interface. Originally, binding of such atoms is under the execution of confined
inter-state electron-dynamics when undertaking neutral state at below ground surface. Such tiny
particles pack as a one-unit under the maintenance of their immersing force at electronically-sloped
surface resulting into assemble their structures of smooth elements at a center of exerting no surface
force. Structures of smooth elements arriving from the different regions nucleate a mono-layer
of developing a certain anisotropic particle where unfilled regions are filled by the afterward
arriving ones, which is not the case when a distorted particle is developing. The mono-layer developing
an anisotropic particle deals localized gravity where structures of smooth elements bind to structures
of smooth elements in above mono-layer under clamping of unfilled energy knots to laterally-orientated
electrons of elongated atoms.
