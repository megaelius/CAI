Classical and quantum field theory of dipolar, axisymmetric quadrupolar and octupolar Bose gases
is considered within a general approach. Dipole, axisymmetric quadrupole and octupole interaction
potentials in the momentum representation are calculated. These results clearly demonstrate
attraction and repulsion areas in corresponding gases. Then the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation,
which plays a key role in the present paper, is derived from the corresponding functional. The zoology
of the form factors appearing in GP equation is studied in details. The classes of proper for the description
of spatially non-uniform condensates form factors are chosen. In the Thomas-Fermi approximation
a general solution of the GP equation with a quasilocal form factor is obtained. This solution has
an interesting form in terms of a double rapidly converging series that universally includes all
the interactions considered. An important analysis of the condensate stability, in other words
the study of condensate excitations, is also performed in this paper. In the Gaussian approximation
(from the GP functional), a functional describing the perturbations of the condensate is derived
in details. For a probe wave function in the form of a plane wave, a spectrum of Bogoliubov excitations
was obtained, from which an equation describing the threshold momentum for the emergence of instability
was derived. An important result of this paper is the dependence of the threshold on the momentum
of a stationary condensate. For completeness of the presentation, the approximating expression
in the form of a rapidly converging series is obtained for the corresponding dependence. Finally,
in the conclusion a quantum hydrodynamic theory for dipolar, axisymmetric quadrupolar and octupolar
gases is briefly presented, giving a clue to the experimental determination of the form factors.
