The ability to detect and distinguish quantum interference signatures is important for both fundamental
research and for the realization of devices including electron resonators, interferometers and
interference-based spin filters. Consistent with the principles of subwavelength optics, the
wave nature of electrons can give rise to various types of interference effects, such as Fabry-P\'erot
resonances, Fano resonances and the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Quantum-interference conductance
oscillations have indeed been predicted for multiwall carbon nanotube shuttles and telescopes,
and arise from atomic-scale displacements between the inner and outer tubes. Previous theoretical
work on graphene bilayers indicates that these systems may display similar interference features
as a function of the relative position of the two sheets. Experimental verification is, however,
still lacking. Graphene nanoconstrictions represent an ideal model system to study quantum transport
phenomena due to the electronic coherence and the transverse confinement of the carriers. Here,
we demonstrate the fabrication of bowtie-shaped nanoconstrictions with mechanically controlled
break junctions (MCBJs) made from a single layer of graphene. We find that their electrical conductance
displays pronounced oscillations at room temperature, with amplitudes that modulate over an order
of magnitude as a function of sub-nanometer displacements. Surprisingly, the oscillations exhibit
a period larger than the graphene lattice constant. Charge-transport calculations show that the
periodicity originates from a combination of quantum-interference and lattice-commensuration
effects of two graphene layers that slide across each other. Our results provide direct experimental
observation of Fabry-P\'erot-like interference of electron waves that are partially reflected/transmitted
at the edges of the graphene bilayer overlap region.
