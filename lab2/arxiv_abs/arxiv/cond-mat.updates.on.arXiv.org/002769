A normal metal exhibits a valence plasmon, which is a sound wave in its conduction electron density.
The strange metal is a mysterious metallic phase that exhibits non-Boltzmann transport and violates
most fundamental Fermi liquid scaling laws. Do strange metals have plasmons? Using momentum-resolved
inelastic electron scattering (M-EELS) we recently showed [M. Mitrano, PNAS 115, 5392 (2018)]
that the primary collective response feature of the strange metal Bi$_{2.1}$Sr$_{1.9}$Ca$_{1.0}$Cu$_{2.0}$O$_{8+x}$
(Bi-2212) is not a plasmon, but a featureless continuum exhibiting a power-law form over all measured
energy and momentum scales. Here, we present a study of how this continuum evolves across the doping
phase diagram. At $T=300$ K the continuum is unaffected by doping, retaining its featureless character
at all compositions. At low temperature the continuum becomes doping-dependent and departs from
its featureless form, showing a dramatic suppression of spectral weight below 0.5 eV in an overdoped
material and enhancement in underdoped materials. The latter suggests a tendency for underdoped
materials to form charge order. The overall result is that the spectra are featureless throughout
a fan-shaped region in the phase diagram that precisely coincides with the region usually identified
as the strange metal. This fan is reminiscent of a quantum critical point (QCP), though the spectra
are momentum-independent at all dopings which is inconsistent with the standard Hertz-Millis
picture of a quantum phase transition. The region of linear-$T$ resistivity coincides with a fine-tuned
boundary between over- and underdoped regions at which the response is temperature-independent.
Our study identifies a close connection between the existence of a featureless, momentum-independent
continuum in the density response and the perplexing transport properties of the strange metal.
