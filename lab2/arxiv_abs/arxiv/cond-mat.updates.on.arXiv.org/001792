Supercooled water exhibits remarkably slow dynamics similar to the behavior observed for various
glass-forming liquids. The local order of tetrahedral structures due to hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds)
increases with decreasing temperature. Thus, it is important to clarify the temperature dependence
of the H-bond breakage process. This was investigated here using molecular dynamics simulations
of TIP4P supercooled water. The two-dimensional (2D) potential of mean force (PMF) is presented
using combinations of intermolecular distance and angle between two water molecules. The saddle
point of the 2D PMF suggests the presence of the transition state that distinguishes between H-bond
and non H-bond states. However, we observed pathways not going through this saddle point particularly
at supercooled states, which are due to translational, rather than rotational motions of the molecules.
We quantified the characteristic time scales of rotational and translational H-bond breakages.
The time scale of translational H-bond breakage shows a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence
comparable to that of the H-bond lifetime. This time scale is relevant for the temperature dependence
of the transmission coefficient based on the transition state theory. The translational H-bond
breakage is also related to cage-jumps observed in glass-forming liquids, which mostly involve
spatially correlated molecules. Our findings warrant further exploration of an appropriate free-energy
surface or reaction coordinates beyond the geometrical variables of the water dimer to describe
a possible saddle point related to collective jump motions.
