The non-perturbative vacuum polarization effects in the field of an extended external supercritical
Coulomb source are explored for a planar Dirac-Coulomb (DC) system with strong coupling (similar
to graphene and graphene-based heterostructures). Both the induced charge density $\rho_{VP}(\vec{r})$
and the Casimir (vacuum) energy $\mathcal{E}_{VP}$ are considered. Due to a lot of calculations
the whole work is divided into two parts I and II. Taking account of results, obtained in the part I
for $\rho_{VP}(\vec{r})$, in the present part II the evaluation of the Casimir energy $\mathcal{E}_{VP}$
is presented. It is shown that the renormalization via fermionic loop turns out to be the universal
tool, which removes the divergence of the theory both in the purely perturbative and essentially
non-perturbative regimes of the vacuum polarization. The main result is that for a wide range of
the system parameters in the overcritical region $\mathcal{E}_{VP}$ turns out to be a rapidly decreasing
negative function $\sim - \eta_{eff}\, Z^3/R_0\, $ with $\eta_{eff}>0 $ and $Z\, , R_0$ being the
charge and the size of the external source. By an explicit calculation the possibility for complete
screening of the electrostatic reflection self-energy of the external source by the vacuum polarization
effects for $Z \gg Z_{cr,1}$ is demonstrated. The dependence of the induced density and Casimir
energy on the screening of the Coulomb asymptotics of the external source at some $R_1>R_0$ is also
explored in detail, and some peculiar effects in the partial channels with the lowest rotational
numbers $m_j=\pm 1/2\, , \pm3/2$ in the screened case are also discussed.
