Density functional theory (DFT) and DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) calculations
are presented on Aluminium doping in bulk TiO$_2$ and the anatase (101) surface. Particular attention
is paid to the mobility of oxygen vacancies throughout the doped TiO$_2$ lattice, as a means by which
charge compensation of trivalent dopants can occur. The effect that Al doping of TiO$_2$ electrodes
has in dye sensitised solar cells is explained as a result of this mobility and charge compensation.
Substitutional defects in which one Al3+ replaces one Ti4+ are found to introduce valence band holes,
while intrinsic oxygen vacancies are found to introduce states in the band-gap. Coupling two of
these substitutional defects with an oxygen vacancy results in exothermic defect formation which
maintain charge neutrality. Nudged elastic band calculations have been performed to investigate
the formation of these clustered defects in the (101) surface by oxygen vacancy diffusion, with
the resulting potential energy surface suggesting energetic gains with small diffusion barriers.
Efficiency in- creases observed in dye sensitised solar cells as a result of aluminium doping of
TiO$_2$ electrodes are investigated by adsorbing the tetrahydroquinoline C2-1 chromophore on
the defective surfaces. Adsorption on the clustered extrinsic Al3+ and intrinsic oxygen vacancy
defects are found to behave as if adsorbed on a clean surface, with vacancy states not present, while
adsorption on the oxygen vacancy results in a down shift of the dye localised states within the band-gap
and defect states being present below the conduction band edge. Aluminium doping therefore acts
as a benign dopant for 'cleaning' TiO$_2$ through oxygen vacancy diffusion.
