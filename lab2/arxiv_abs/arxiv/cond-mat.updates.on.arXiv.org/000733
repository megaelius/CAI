We study the role of "$\theta$ terms" in the action for three-dimensional $U(1)$ symmetric tensor
gauge theories, describing quantum phases of matter hosting gapless higher-spin gauge modes and
gapped subdimensional particle excitations, such as fractons. In Maxwell theory, the $\theta$
term is a total derivative which has no effect on the gapless photon, but has two important, closely
related consequences: attaching electric charge to magnetic monopoles (the Witten effect) and
leading to a Chern-Simons theory on the boundary. We will find that a similar story holds in the higher-spin
$U(1)$ gauge theories. These theories admit generalized $\theta$ terms which have no effect on
the gapless gauge mode, but which bind together electric and magnetic charges (both of which are
generally subdimensional) in specific combinations, in a higher-spin manifestation of the Witten
effect. We derive the corresponding Witten quantization condition. We find that, as in Maxwell
theory, imposing time-reversal invariance restricts $\theta$ to certain discrete values. We
also find that these new $\theta$ terms imply a non-trivial boundary structure. The boundaries
host fracton excitations coupled to a tensor $U(1)$ gauge field with a Chern-Simons-like action,
in both chiral and non-chiral varieties. These boundary theories open a door to the study of $U(1)$
fracton phases described by tensor Chern-Simons theories, not only on boundaries of three-dimensional
systems, but also in strictly two spatial dimensions. We explicitly work through three examples
of bulk and boundary theories, the principles of which can be readily extended to arbitrary higher-spin
theories.
