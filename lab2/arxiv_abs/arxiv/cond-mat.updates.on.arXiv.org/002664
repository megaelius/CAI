We calculate the bipartite von Neumann and second R\'enyi entanglement entropies of the ground
states of spin-1/2 dimerized Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a square lattice. Two distinct dimerization
patterns are considered: columnar and staggered. In both cases, we concentrate on the valence bond
solid (VBS) phase and describe such a phase with the bond-operator representation. Within this
formalism, the original spin Hamiltonian is mapped into an effective interacting boson model for
the triplet excitations. We study the effective Hamiltonian at the harmonic approximation and
determine the spectrum of the elementary triplet excitations. We then follow an analytical procedure,
which is based on a modified spin-wave theory for finite systems and was originally employed to calculate
the entanglement entropies of magnetic ordered phases, and calculate the entanglement entropies
of the VBS ground states. In particular, we consider one-dimensional (line) subsystems within
the square lattice, a choice that allows us to consider line subsystems with sizes up to $L' = 1000$.
We combine such a procedure with the results of the bond-operator formalism at the harmonic level
and show that, for both dimerized Heisenberg models, the entanglement entropies of the corresponding
VBS ground states obey an area law as expected for gapped phases. For both columnar-dimer and staggered-dimer
models, we also show that the entanglement entropies increase but do not diverge as the dimerization
decreases and the system approaches the N\'eel--VBS quantum phase transition. Finally, the entanglement
spectra associated with the VBS ground states are presented.
