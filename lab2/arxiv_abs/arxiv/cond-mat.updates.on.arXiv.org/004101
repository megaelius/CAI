At the heart of current information nanotechnology lies the search for ideal platforms hosting
the smallest possible magnets, i.e. single atoms with magnetic moments pointing out-of-plane,
as requested in a binary-type of memory. For this purpose, a 2D material such as graphene would be
an ideal substrate thanks to its intrinsic low electron and phonon densities, as well as its 6-fold
symmetry. Here we investigate, from first-principles, a fundamental mechanism detrimental for
the magnetic stability: the zero-point spin-fluctuations modifying the effective energy landscape
perceived by the local spin moments of 3$d$ and 4$d$ transition metal atoms deposited on a free standing
graphene. Utilizing time-dependent density functional theory and by virtue of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, these spontaneous quantum fluctuations are found to be negligible for most of the 3$d$
elements, in strong contrast to the 4$d$ atoms. Surprisingly, we find that such fluctuations can
promote the magnetic stability by switching the easy direction of the magnetic moment of Tc from
being initially in-plane to out-of-plane. The adatom-graphene complex gives rise to impurity
states settling in some cases the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy --- the quantity that defines
the energy barrier protecting the magnetic moments and, consequently, the spin-excitation behavior
detectable with inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy. A detailed analysis is provided on
the impact of electron-hole excitations, damping and lifetime of the spin-excitations on the dynamical
behavior of the adsorbed magnetic moments on graphene.
