Depositing thin and thick films by different coating technology units is the beauty of deposition
technology where every synthesis deals the chamber pressure. In hot-filaments reactor, in addition
to force, chamber pressure deals heat and photon energy settling into the available mass. Temperature
of the substrate material and hot-filaments under fixed input power vary as per residence time of
entered dissociating CH4 and H2 gases under set flow rates. Rates of dissociating entered gases
and conversion rate of gas state carbon atoms into graphitic and diamond states carbon atoms vary
largely under the varying chamber pressure which influence the deposition of their carbon films
in terms of quality and growth rate. The increase in the chamber pressure from 3.3 kPa to 14 kPa influences
the morphology of carbon films comprising tiny grains, grains and crystallites. The increase in
the chamber pressure upto 8.6 kPa increases the growth rate of a carbon film along with discernible
features of grains and crystallites. In the range of different intermediate chamber pressures,
gas state carbon atoms converted into diamond state carbon atoms at high rate. Under the range of
high chamber pressures, gas state carbon atoms converted into graphitic state carbon atoms to a
large extent where low growth rates of the films were resulted. For different chamber pressures,
typical energies of different rate involved to develop carbon films having featured grains and
crystallites where influence of the gas collisions on their development rate is also discussed.
Deposited carbon films are investigated under the investigation of original line of experimental
results providing abundant opportunities of materials research.
