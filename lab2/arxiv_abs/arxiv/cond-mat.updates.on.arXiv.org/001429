Matthew Fisher recently postulated a mechanism by which quantum phenomena could influence cognition:
Phosphorus nuclear spins may resist decoherence for long times. The spins would serve as biological
qubits. The qubits may resist decoherence longer when in Posner molecules. We imagine that Fisher
postulates correctly. How adroitly could biological systems process quantum information (QI)?
We establish a framework for answering. Additionally, we construct applications of biological
qubits to quantum error correction, quantum communication, and quantum computation. First, we
posit how the QI encoded by the spins transforms as Posner molecules form. The transformation points
to a natural computational basis for qubits in Posner molecules. From the basis, we construct a quantum
code that detects arbitrary single-qubit errors. Each molecule encodes one qutrit. Shifting from
information storage to computation, we define the model of Posner quantum computation. To illustrate
the model's quantum-communication ability, we show how it can teleport information incoherently:
A state's weights are teleported. Dephasing results from the entangling operation's simulation
of a coarse-grained Bell measurement. Whether Posner quantum computation is universal remains
an open question. However, the model's operations can efficiently prepare a Posner state usable
as a resource in universal measurement-based quantum computation. The state results from deforming
the Affleck-Lieb-Kennedy-Tasaki (AKLT) state and is a projected entangled-pair state (PEPS).
Finally, we show that entanglement can affect molecular-binding rates, boosting a binding probability
from 33.6% to 100% in an example. This work opens the door for the QI-theoretic analysis of biological
qubits and Posner molecules.
