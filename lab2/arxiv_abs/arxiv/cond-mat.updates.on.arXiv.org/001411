We study magnetization transport in anisotropic spin-$1/2$ chains governed by the integrable
XXZ model with and without integrability-breaking perturbations at high temperatures ($T\to
\infty$) using a hybrid approach that combines exact sum-rules with judiciously chosen Ans\"atze.
In the integrable XXZ model we find (i) super-diffusion at the isotropic (Heisenberg) point, with
frequency dependent conductivity $ \sigma'(\omega\to 0) \sim |\omega|^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha=-3/7$
in close numerical agreement with recent $t$-DMRG computations; (ii) a continuously drifting
exponent from $\alpha=-1^+$ in the XY limit of the model to $\alpha>0$ within the Ising regime; and
(iii) a diffusion constant saturating in the XY coupling deep in the Ising limit. We consider two
kinds of integrability breaking perturbations --- a simple next-nearest-neighbor spin-flip
term ($J_2$) and a three-spin assisted variant ($t_2$), natural in the fermion particle representation
of the spin chain. In the first case we discover a remarkable sensitivity of $\sigma'(\omega)$ to
the sign of $J_2$, with enhanced low frequency spectral weight and a pronounced upward shift in the
magnitude of $\alpha$ for $J_2>0$. Perhaps even more surprising, we find sub-diffusion ($\alpha>0$)
over a range of $J_2<0$. By contrast, the effects of the \enquote{fermionic} three-spin perturbation
are sign symmetric; this perturbation produces a clearly observable hydrodynamic relaxation.
At large strength of the integrability breaking term $J_2\to \pm \infty$ the problem is effectively
non-interacting (fermions hopping on odd and even sublattices) and we find $\alpha\to -1$ behavior
reminiscent of the XY limit of the XXZ chain. Exact diagonalization studies largely corroborate
these findings at mid-frequencies.
