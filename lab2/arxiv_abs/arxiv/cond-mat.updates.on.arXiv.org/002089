Taking into account an inner structure of the arms of the Aharonov-Bohm ring (AB ring) we have analyzed
the transport features related to the Majorana bound states (MBSs) which are induced in a superconducting
wire (a SC wire) with strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI). The SC wire acts as a bridge connecting
the arms. The in-plane magnetic-field dependence of linear-response conductance obtained using
the nonequilibrium Green's functions in the tight-binding approximation revealed the Fano resonances
(FRs) if the wire is in the topologically nontrivial phase. The effect is attributed to the presence
of bound states in continuum in the AB ring which lifetime is determined by both hopping parameters
between subsystems and the SC wire properties. The FRs minima appear at the magnetic fields corresponding
to the zero energies of the leads constituting the AB arms. It is established that the FRs shift if
the SC pairing reduces or, equivalently, the MBS transforms from the edge to bulk state. In addition,
the FR width essentially depends on the MBS spacial distribution. Finally, we demonstrated that
the MBS spacial distribution can be also probed in the T-shaped transport scheme where two out of
four leads perform as side-coupled ones. The observed possibility to distinguish between the edge-
and bulk low-energy states is additionally valuable considering current discussion about the
manifestation of Andreev and Majorana excitations in transport properties of the SC wire. The FR
properties are analytically studied for effective double-quantum-dot system in one-contact
transport regime. The influence of Coulomb interactions in the SC wire on the FR is investigated
in the mean-field regime.
