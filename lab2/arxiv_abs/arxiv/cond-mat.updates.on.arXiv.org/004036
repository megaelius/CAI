Localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in metal nanostructures have attracted much attention for their
role in generating non-equilibrium hot carriers (HCs) for photochemistry, photodetection and
photoluminescence. In addition to optical excitation, LSPs and HC dynamics can be driven electrically
via inelastic tunneling. LSP-mediated light emission in tunnel junctions commonly features photon
energies below the threshold set by the applied voltage bias. Recent work has reported photon energies
significantly above that threshold, while the underlying physical origin remains elusive. Proposed
mechanisms include higher-order electron-plasmon and electron-electron interactions, and
blackbody radiation of hot electrons. We report measurements of light emission in tunnel junctions
of different plasmonic materials and reveal that HCs generated by nonradiative decay of electrically
excited plasmons play a key role in above-threshold light emission. We observed the crossover from
above- to below-threshold light emission regime by controlling the tunneling current. There is
a giant material dependence of the photon yield, as much as four orders of magnitude, much greater
than the plasmon-enhanced radiative efficiency of the tunneling gap. The spectral features of
light emission are consistent with a proposed mechanism that incorporates the plasmonic field
enhancement and a non-equilibrium HC distribution parametrized by a bias-dependent Boltzmann
factor. The effective temperatures of HCs are found to correlate with the bias voltage, rather than
the dissipated electrical power. Electrically driven HC generation (above 2000 K under modest
voltage) and plasmon-enhanced light emission could open new strategies for chemistry, optoelectronics
and quantum optics.
