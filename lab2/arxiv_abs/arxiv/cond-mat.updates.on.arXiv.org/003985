Inspired by the possibility to experimentally manipulate and enhance chemical reactivity in helium
nanodroplets, we investigate the effective interaction and the resulting correlations between
two diatomic molecules immersed in a bath of bosons. By analogy with the bipolaron, we introduce
the \emph{biangulon} quasiparticle describing two rotating molecules that align with respect
to each other due to the effective attractive interaction mediated by the excitations of the bath.
We study this system in different parameter regimes and apply several theoretical approaches to
describe its properties. Using a Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we investigate the dependence
of the effective intermolecular interaction on the rotational state of the two molecules. In the
strong-coupling regime, a product-state ansatz shows that the molecules tend to have a strong alignment
in the ground state. To investigate the system in the weak-coupling regime, we apply a one-phonon
excitation variational ansatz, which allows us to access the energy spectrum. In comparison to
the angulon quasiparticle, the biangulon shows shifted angulon instabilities and an additional
spectral instability, where resonant angular momentum transfer between the molecules and the
bath takes place. These features are proposed as an experimentally observable signature for the
formation of the biangulon quasiparticle. Finally, by using products of single angulon and bare
impurity wave functions as basis states, we introduce a diagonalization scheme that allows us to
describe the transition from two separated angulons to a biangulon as a function of the distance
between the two molecules.
