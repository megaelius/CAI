Using newly developed quantum-classical hybrid framework, we investigate interaction between
spin-polarized conduction electrons and a single spin wave (SW) coherently excited within a metallic
ferromagnetic nanowire. When the nanowire hosting SW is attached to two normal metal (NM) leads,
with no dc bias voltage applied between them, the SW pumps chiral electronic charge and spin currents
into the leads---their direction is tied to the direction of SW propagation and they scale linearly
with the frequency of the precession. This is in contrast to: standard pumping by the uniform precession
mode with identical spin currents flowing in both directions and no accompanying charge current;
or experimentally observed [C.~Ciccarelli et al., Nat. Nanotech. 10, 50 (2014); M.~Evelt et al.,
Phys. Rev. B 95, 024408 (2017)] magnonic charge pumping which requires spin-orbit coupling spin-orbit
coupling. The mechanism behind our prediction is nonadiabaticity due to time-retardation effects---motion
of localized magnetic moment affects conduction electron spin in a retarded way, so that it takes
a finite time until the electron spin reacts to the motion of the classical vector. Upon injecting
dc spin-polarized charge current from the left NM lead, electrons interact with SW where outflowing
charge and spin current into the right NM lead are changed due to both scattering off time-dependent
potential generated by the SW and superposition with the currents pumped by the SW itself. Using
Lorentzian voltage pulse to excite leviton out of the Fermi sea, which carries one electron charge
with no accompanying electron-hole pairs and behaves as soliton-like quasiparticle, we describe
how a single electron interacts with a single SW.
