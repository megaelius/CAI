The hole doped Si(111)(2root3x2root3)R30(degrees)-Sn interface exhibits a symmetry-breaking
insulator-insulator transition below 100 K that appears to be triggered by electron tunneling
into the empty surface-state bands. No such transition is seen in electron-doped systems. To elucidate
the nature and driving force of this phenomenon, the structure of the interface must be resolved.
Here we report on an extensive experimental and theoretical study, including scanning tunneling
microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), dynamical low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) analysis,
and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to elucidate the structure of this interface.
We consider six different structure models, three of which have been proposed before, and conclude
that only two of them can account for the majority of experimental data. One of them is the model according
to Tornevik et al. [C. Tornevik et al., Phys. Rev. B 44, 13144 (1991)] with a total Sn coverage of 14/12
monolayers (ML). The other is the 'revised trimer model' with a total Sn coverage of 13/12 ML, introduced
in this work. These two models are very difficult to discriminate on the basis of DFT or LEED alone,
but STS data clearly point toward the T\"ornevik model as the most viable candidate among the models
considered here. The STS data also provide additional insights regarding the electron-injection-driven
phase transformation as well as the critical role of valence band holes in this process. Similar
processes may occur at other metal/semiconductor interfaces, provided they are non-metallic
and can be doped. This could open up a new pathway toward the creation of novel surface phases with
potentially very interesting and desirable electronic properties.
