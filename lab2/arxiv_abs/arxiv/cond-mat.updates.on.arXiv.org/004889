Disordered systems are ubiquitous in physical, biological and material sciences. Examples include
liquid and glassy states of condensed matter, colloids, granular materials, porous media, composites,
alloys, packings of cells in avian retina and tumor spheroids, to name but a few. A comprehensive
understanding of such disordered systems requires, as the first step, systematic quantification,
modeling and representation of the underlying complex configurations and microstructure, which
is generally very challenging to achieve. Recently, we introduce a set of hierarchical statistical
microstructural descriptors, i.e., the n-point polytope functions Pn, which are derived from
the standard n-point correlation functions Sn, and successively include higher-order n-point
statistics of the morphological features of interest in a concise, explainable, and expressive
manner. Here we investigate the information content of the Pn functions via optimization-based
realization rendering. This is achieved by successively incorporating higher order Pn functions
up to n = 8 and quantitatively assessing the accuracy of the reconstructed systems via un-constrained
statistical morphological descriptors (e.g., the lineal-path function). We examine a wide spectrum
of representative random systems with distinct geometrical and topological features. We find
that generally, successively incorporating higher order Pn functions, and thus, the higher-order
morphological information encoded in these descriptors, leads to superior accuracy of the reconstructions.
However, incorporating more Pn functions into the reconstruction also significantly increases
the complexity and roughness of the associated energy landscape for the underlying stochastic
optimization, making it difficult to convergence numerically.
