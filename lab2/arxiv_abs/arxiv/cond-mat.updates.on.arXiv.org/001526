BAs was predicted to have an unusually high thermal conductivity at room temperature of 2000$\,$Wm$^{-1}$$\,$K$^{-1}$,
comparable to that of diamond. However, the experimentally measured thermal conductivity of BAs
single crystals is an order of magnitude lower. To identify the origin of this large inconsistency,
we investigated the lattice structure and potential defects in BAs single crystals at atomic scale
using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Rather than finding
a large concentration As vacancies ($V_\mathrm{As}$), as widely thought to dominate the thermal
resistance in BAs crystals, our STEM results showed enhanced intensity of some B columns and reduced
intensity of some As columns, suggesting the presence of antisite defects with As$_\mathrm{B}$
(As-atom on B site) and B$_\mathrm{As}$ (B-atom on As site) with significant concentrations. Further
calculations show that the antisite pair with As$_\mathrm{B}$ next to B$_\mathrm{As}$ is preferred
energetically among the different types of point defects investigated, and confirm that such defects
lower the thermal conductivity for BAs. Using a concentration of 6.6$\pm$3$\times$10$^{20}$$\,$cm$^{-3}$
for the antisite pairs estimated from STEM images, thermal conductivity is estimated to be 65-100$\,$Wm$^{-1}$$\,$K$^{-1}$,
in reasonable agreement with our measured value. Our study suggests that As$_\mathrm{B}$-B$_\mathrm{As}$
antisite pairs are the primary lattice defects suppressing thermal conductivity of BAs. Possible
approaches are proposed for growth of high quality crystals or films with high thermal conductivity.
