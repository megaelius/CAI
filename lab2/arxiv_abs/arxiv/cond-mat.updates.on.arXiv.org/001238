Calculation of statistical properties of nuclei in a finite-temperature mean-field theory requires
projection onto good particle number, since the theory is formulated in the grand canonical ensemble.
This projection is usually carried out in a saddle-point approximation. Here we derive formulas
for an exact particle-number projection of the finite-temperature mean-field solution. We consider
both deformed nuclei, in which the pairing condensate is weak and the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation
is the appropriate mean-field theory, and nuclei with strong pairing condensates, in which the
appropriate theory is the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation, a method that explicitly
violates particle-number conservation. For the HFB approximation, we present a general projection
formula for a condensate that is time-reversal invariant and a simpler formula for the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) limit, which is realized in nuclei with spherical condensates. We apply the method to three
heavy nuclei: a typical deformed nucleus $^{162}$Dy, a typical spherical nucleus $^{148}$Sm,
and a transitional nucleus $^{150}$Sm in which the pairing condensate is deformed. We compare the
results of this projection with results from the saddle-point approximation and exact shell model
Monte Carlo calculations. We find that the approximate canonical HF entropy in the particle-number
projection decreases monotonically to zero in the limit when the temperature goes to zero. However,
in a nucleus with a strong pairing condensate, the approximate canonical HFB entropy in the particle-number
projection decreases monotonically to a negative value, reflecting the violation of particle-number
conservation. Computationally, the exact particle-number projection is more efficient than
calculating the derivatives required in the saddle-point approximation.
