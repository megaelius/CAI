Topological superconductors can support localized Majorana states at their boundaries. These
quasi-particle excitations have non-Abelian statistics that can be used to encode and manipulate
quantum information in a topologically protected manner. While signatures of Majorana bound states
have been observed in one-dimensional systems, there is an ongoing effort to find alternative platforms
that do not require fine-tuning of parameters and can be easily scalable to large numbers of states.
Here we present a novel experimental approach towards a two-dimensional architecture. Using a
Josephson junction made of HgTe quantum well coupled to thin-film aluminum, we are able to tune between
a trivial and a topological superconducting state by controlling the phase difference $\phi$ across
the junction and applying an in-plane magnetic field. We determine the topological state of the
induced superconductor by measuring the tunneling conductance at the edge of the junction. At low
magnetic fields, we observe a minimum in the tunneling spectra near zero bias, consistent with a
trivial superconductor. However, as the magnetic field increases, the tunneling conductance
develops a zero-bias peak which persists over a range of $\phi$ that expands systematically with
increasing magnetic fields. Our observations are consistent with theoretical predictions for
this system and with full quantum mechanical numerical simulations performed on model systems
with similar dimensions and parameters. Our work establishes this system as a promising platform
for realizing topological superconductivity and for creating and manipulating Majorana modes
and will therefore open new avenues for probing topological superconducting phases in two-dimensional
systems.
