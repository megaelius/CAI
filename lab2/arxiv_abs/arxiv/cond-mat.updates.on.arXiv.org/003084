In addition to the self-governing properties, tiny-sized particles of metallic colloids are the
building blocks of large-sized particles. Thus, their study has been the subject of many studies.
A tiny-sized particle developed at or inside the solution depends on the attained-dynamics of atoms
where different mechanisms of their bindings occur. When a protocol energy is supplied to transitional-state
atoms of monolayer assembly, it binds them in own shape. Atoms of one-dimensional arrays elongate
uniformly under force-exertion to electrons along opposite poles to form structures of smooth
elements of tiny particles. At solution surface, impinging electron streams at a fixed angle results
into elongate further the already elongated atoms of structures of smooth elements through gained
forced energy of carried photons. Travelling photons of different forcing energies along air-solution
interface further shape structures of smooth elements. Inside the solution or near to interface,
gold atoms also form tiny particles of different shape-structure where, in addition to their attained-dynamics,
miscellaneous factors contribute as well. Again, suitably amalgamated gold atoms when in the neutral
state, they execute confined inter-state electron-dynamics to self-generate bind energy where
they are not required to be uplifted at solution surface for binding under protocol energy. Tiny-sized
particles evolve structures in the original format instead of developing structures if localized
dynamics of atoms favor execution of electron-dynamics where they do not require nano-energy to
design structures. This study highlights the fundamental process of formation of different tiny
particles where electronic structure, phase transition and localized dynamics of gold atoms influence.
Such a tool of processing materials opens several possibilities to develop engineered materials
of specific properties.
