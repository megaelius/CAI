This thesis studies how the rudimentary attributes of graphene's charge carriers, and local moments
on its surface, can be directly manipulated and controlled with electrostatic potentials. We first
consider bilayer graphene subject to a spatially varying electrostatic potential that forms two
neighbouring regions with opposite interlayer bias. Along the boundary, 1D chiral "kink" states
emerge. We find that these 1D modes behave as a strongly interacting Luttinger liquid whose properties
can be tuned via an external gate. Next, we consider superlattices in bilayer graphene. Superlattices
are seen to have a more dramatic effect on bilayer graphene than monolayer graphene because the quasi-particles
are changed in a fundamental way; the dispersion goes from a quadratic band touching point to linearly
dispersing Dirac cones. We illustrate that a 1D superlattice of either the chemical potential or
an interlayer bias generates multiple anisotropic Dirac cones. General arguments delineate how
certain symmetries protect the Dirac points. We then map the Hamiltonian of an interlayer bias superlattice
onto a chain model comprised of "topological" modes. This is followed by another study that considers
the effect of a magnetic field on graphene superlattices. We show that magnetotransport measurements
in a weak perpendicular magnetic field probe the number of emergent Dirac points and reveal details
about the dispersion. In the case of bilayer graphene, we also discuss the properties of kink states
in an applied magnetic field. Finally, we investigate local moment formation of adatoms on bilayer
graphene using an Anderson impurity model. We identify regions where the local moments can be turned
on or off by applying a external electric fields. In addition, we compute the RKKY interaction between
local moments and show how it too can be controlled with electric fields.
