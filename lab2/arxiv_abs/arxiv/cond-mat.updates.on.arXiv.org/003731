Transport phenomena, including diffusion, mixing, spreading, and mobility, are crucial to understand
and model dynamical features of complex systems. In particular, the study of geophysical flows
attracted a lot of interest in the last decades as fluid transport has proven to play a fundamental
role in climatic and environmental research across a wide range of scales. Two theoretical frameworks
have been effectively used to investigate transport phenomena in complex systems: Dynamical Systems
Theory (DST) and Network Theory (NT). However, few explicit connections between these two different
views have been established. Here, we focus on the betweenness centrality, a widely used local measure
which characterizes transport and connectivity in NT. By linking analytically DST and NT we provide
a novel, continuous-in-time formulation of betweenness, called Lagrangian Betweenness, as a
function of Lyapunov exponents. This permits to quantitatively relate hyperbolic points and heteroclinic
connections in a given dynamical system to the main transport bottlenecks of its associated network.
Moreover, using modeled and observational velocity fields, we show that such bottlenecks are present
and surprisingly persistent in the oceanic circulation illustrating their importance in organizing
fluid motion. The link between DST and NT rooted in the definition of the Lagrangian Betweenness
has the potential to promote further theoretical developments and applications at the interface
between these two fields. Finally, the identification of such circulation hotspots provides new
crucial information about transport processes in geophysical flows and how they control the redistribution
of various tracers of climatic (e.g. heat, carbon, moisture), biological (e.g. larvae, pathogens)
and human (e.g. pollutants, plastics) interests.
