The helicity-effect problem for a single compressible flow is transformed to the pure-background-field-effect
one, reducing to the pure (compressible-version) Taylor-Proudman effect (TPE) and/or its magnetic
analogue. A chiral base flow/field (CBF) is used to mostly clearly and simply materialize the screw-and-knot
scenario for the `tightening-up' notion, raised from the statistical result of helicity-reducing-turbulence-compressibility
effect found earlier for the neutral-gas case. In the CBF, the existence of helicity nontrivially
indicates a kind of mean rotation, naturally invoking the compressible version of the TPE, with
horizontal-compressibility reduction but without direct constraint on the vertical velocity,
which serves as the genuine mechanism, \textit{i.e.}, the underlying element of the statistical
effect. The statistical fluctuations in the compressibility reduction effect may be due to that
of the variation of the vertical derivative of the vertical velocity. A minimal working model with
disorders in the CBFs bridges the single-flow and statistical arguments, completing the story.
I further argue \textit{a posteriori} that recent data, of the superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensate
model, also agree the result from my previous \textit{a priori} analysis. Statistical mechanical
analyses, of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and extended MHD for the ionized gas flows,
show that helicities may reduce compressive and density modes relevant to the compressibility,
i.e., tightening up the ionized-gas turbulence, implying the \textit{universality} of the notion.
And, a \textit{unified} view is offered, with substantial extensions of the CBF and the analogue
of the compressible TPE for a strong background magnetic field encapsulating the geometry of the
Alfv\'en theorem for the (magnetised) plasma.
