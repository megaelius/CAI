Controlled adiabatic transfer of a single electron through a chain of quantum dots has been recently
achieved in GaAs and Si/SiGe based quantum dots, opening prospects for turning stationary spin
qubits into mobile ones, and solving in this way the problem of long-distance communication between
quantum registers in a scalable quantum computing architecture based on quantum dots. We consider
theoretically the process of such an electron transfer between two tunnel-coupled quantum dots,
focusing on control by slowly varying the detuning of energy levels in the dots. We take into account
the fluctuations in detuning caused by $1/f$-type noise that is ubiquitous in semiconductor nanostructures,
and analyze their influence on probability of successful transfer of an electron in a spin eigenstate.
With numerical and analytical calculations we show that probability of electron not being transferred
due to $1/f^\beta$ noise in detuning is $\propto \sigma^2 t^{\beta-1}/v$, where $\sigma$ characterizes
the noise amplitude, $t$ is the interdot tunnel coupling, and $v$ is the detuning sweep rate. Interestingly,
this means that the noise-induced errors in charge transfer are independent of $t$ for $1/f$ noise.
For realistic parameters taken from experiments on silicon-based quantum dots, we obtain the minimal
probability of charge transfer failure between a pair of dots is limited by $1/f$ noise in detuning
to be the on order of $0.01$. This means that in order to reliably transfer charges across many quantum
dots, charge noise in the devices should be further suppressed, or tunnel couplings should be increased,
in order to allow for faster transfer (and less exposure to noise), while not triggering the deterministic
Landau-Zener excitation.
