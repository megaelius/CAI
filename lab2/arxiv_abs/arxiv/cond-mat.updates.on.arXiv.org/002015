Two-dimensional mixtures of dipolar colloidal particles with different dipole moments exhibit
extremely rich self-assembly behaviour and are relevant to a wide range of experimental systems,
including charged and super-paramagnetic colloids at liquid interfaces. However, there is a gap
in our understanding of the crystallization of these systems because existing theories such as
integral equation theory and lattice sum methods can only be used to study the high temperature fluid
phase and the zero-temperature crystal phase, respectively. In this paper we bridge this gap by
developing a density functional theory (DFT), valid at intermediate temperatures, in order to
study the crystallization of one and two-component dipolar colloidal monolayers. The theory employs
a series expansion of the excess Helmholtz free energy functional, truncated at second order in
the density, and taking as input highly accurate bulk fluid direct correlation functions from simulation.
Although truncating the free energy at second order means that we cannot determine the freezing
point accurately, our approach allows us to calculate ab initio both the density profiles of the
different species and the symmetry of the final crystal structures. Our DFT predicts hexagonal
crystal structures for one-component systems, and a variety of superlattice structures for two-component
systems, including those with hexagonal and square symmetry, in excellent agreement with known
results for these systems. The theory also provides new insights into the structure of two-component
systems in the intermediate temperature regime where the small particles remain molten but the
large particles are frozen on a regular lattice.
