Knots are one-dimensional loops embedded in three-dimensional space. Intimately connected to
Chern-Simons theory which underlies the braiding of quasiparticles, knots exhibit such rich topology
that no single topological invariant can unambiguously distinguish them. In real space, knots
are ubiquitous, being present in protein and polymer structures, optical vortices and, of course,
everyday-life ropes. In momentum space, knotted configurations of band structure crossings (nodes)
demonstrate their topological intricacies even more spectacularly, with their special "drumhead"
surface modes generalizing the Fermi arcs of ordinary nodal semimetals. Still, momentum space
knots have so far been elusive due to the requisite finely tuned long-ranged hoppings underlying
their band structure. Even if a momentum space knot were constructed, probing its intricate linkages
and drumhead states by existing methods such as momentum-resolved ARPES will be very challenging
due to the high requisite precision. In this work, we overcome these practical and technical barriers
by utilizing ordinary RLC-type circuits in devising the first-ever experimentally realistic
proposal for momentum space knots. We go beyond existing theoretical constructions, which necessarily
break reciprocity, by pairing nodal knots with their mirror image partners in a fully reciprocal
setting. Our nodal knot circuits can be systematically characterized with impedance measurements
that a) resolve their drumhead states and b) measure their 3D nodal structure. From there, one can
reconstruct the Seifert surface, and hence recover topological knot invariants such as the Alexander
polynomial.
