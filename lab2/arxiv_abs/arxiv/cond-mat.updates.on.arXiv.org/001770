The dynamical responses of XY ferromagnet driven by linearly polarised propagating and standing
magnetic field wave have been studied by Monte Carlo simulation in three dimensions. In the case
of propagating magnetic field wave (with specified amplitude, frequency and the wavelength),
the low temperature dynamical mode is a propagating spin wave and the system becomes structureless
(or random) in the high temperature. A dynamical symmetry breaking phase transition is observed
at a finite (nonzero) temperature. This symmetry breaking is confirmed by studying the statistical
distribution of the angle of the spin vector. The dynamic nonequilibrium transition temperature
was found to decrease as the amplitude of the propagating magnetic field wave increases. A comprehensive
phase boundary is drawn in the plane formed by temperature and amplitude of propagating field wave.
The phase boundary was observed to shrink (in the low temperature side) for longer wavelength of
the propagating magnetic wave. In the case of standing magnetic field wave, the low temperature
excitation is a standing spin wave which becomes structureless (or random) in the high temperature.
Here also, like the case of propagating magnetic wave, a dynamical symmetry breaking nonequilibrium
phase transition was observed. A comprehensive phase boundary is drawn. Unlike the case of propagating
magnetic wave, the phase boundary does not show any systematic variation with the wavelength of
the standing magnetic field wave. In the limit of vanishingly small amplitude of the field, the phase
boundaries approach the recent Monte Carlo estimate of equilibrium transition temperature.
