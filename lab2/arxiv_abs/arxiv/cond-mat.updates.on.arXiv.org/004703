The physical properties of rare-earth (RE) dodecaborides, characterized by a cage-glass crystal
structure with loosely bound RE ions, are reviewed. These compounds are strongly correlated electron
systems with simultaneously active charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom, which
explains the complexity of all $R\mathrm{B}_{12}$ compounds including antiferromagnetic (TbB$_{12}$-TmB$_{12}$)
and nonmagnetic (LuB$_{12}$) metals, on one side, and the so-called Kondo insulator compound YbB$_{12}$
and Yb-based Yb$_{x}R_{1-x}$B$_{12}$ solid solutions, on the other. The development of the cooperative
dynamic Jahn-Teller instability of the covalent boron network produces trigonal and tetragonal
distortions of the rigid cage and results in the symmetry lowering of the fcc lattice in the dodecaborides.
The ferrodistortive dynamics in the boron sub-lattice generates both the collective modes and
quasilocal vibrations (rattling modes) of the heavy RE ions, causing a modulation in the charge-carrier
density and the emergence of dynamic charge stripes. We consider their manifestations both in the
properties of the nonmagnetic reference compound LuB$_{12}$ and in the phase diagrams of the $R\mathrm{B}_{12}$
antiferromagnets that exhibit multiple magnetic phases with anisotropic field-angular phase
diagrams in the form of the Maltese cross. We also discuss the metal-insulator transitions in YbB$_{12}$
and Yb-based dodecaborides in terms of the instability of the Yb 4$f$-electron configuration,
which appears in addition to the Jahn-Teller instability of the boron cage, providing one more mechanism
of the charge and spin fluctuations. The experimental results challenge the established Kondo-insulator
scenario in YbB$_{12}$, providing arguments in favor of the appearance of Yb-Yb vibrationally
coupled pairs which should be considered as the main factor responsible for the charge- and spin-gap
formation.
