Recent theoretical and experimental work has demonstrated how the superconducting critical temperature
($T_c$) can be modified by rotating the magnetization of a single homogeneous ferromagnet proximity-coupled
to the superconducting layer. This occurs when the superconductor and ferromagnet are separated
by a thin heavy normal metal that provides an enhanced interfacial Rashba spin-orbit interaction.
We consider the reciprocal effect: magnetization reorientation driven by the superconducting
phase transition. We solve the tight-binding Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations on a lattice self-consistently
and find that the relative angle between the spin-orbit field and the magnetization gives rise to
a contribution in the free energy even in the normal state due to band-structure effects. For temperatures
below $T_c$, superconductivity gives rise to a competing contribution. By lowering the temperature,
in addition to reorientation of the favored magnetization direction from in-plane to out-of-plane,
a $\pi/4$ in-plane rotation for thicker ferromagnetic layers is possible. Furthermore, computation
of $T_c$ of the structure in the ballistic limit shows a dependence on the in-plane orientation of
the magnetization, in contrast to our previous result on the diffusive limit. This finding is relevant
with respect to thin-film heterostructures since these are likely to be in the ballistic regime
of transport. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of observing the magnetic anisotropy
induced by the superconducting transition when other magnetic anisotropies, such as the shape
anisotropy for a ferromagnetic film, are taken into account. Our work suggests that the superconducting
condensation energy in principle can trigger a reorientation of the magnetization of a thin-film
ferromagnet upon lowering the temperature below $T_c$, in particular for ferromagnets with weak
magnetic anisotropies.
