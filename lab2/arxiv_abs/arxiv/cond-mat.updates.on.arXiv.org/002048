ZnNi(CN)$_4$ is a framework material that combines the tetrahedral environment of Zn, seen in 3-D
cubic Zn(CN)$_2$, with the square-planar geometry of Ni, seen in 2-D layered Ni(CN)$_2$. Both the
parent compounds, Zn(CN)$_2$ and Ni(CN)$_2$, are known to exhibit 3-D and 2-D negative thermal
expansion (NTE), respectively. It was previously reported that ZnNi(CN)$_4$ has a tetragonal
structure, which, without occlusion of solvent molecules, is poorly crystalline. We performed
temperature-dependent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on ZnNi(CN)$_4$ to probe
its phonon dynamics. The measurements were underpinned by ab-initio lattice dynamical calculations.
Good agreement was found between the measured and calculated generalized phonon density-of-states,
validating our model and indicating that it represents the local order well. We went on to calculate
the compound's expansion coefficients and gain insight into the underlying microscopic mechanisms.
The calculated linear thermal expansion coefficients highlight pronounced NTE behaviour. Analysis
of the derived mode Gr\"uneisen parameters shows that the low-energy phonon modes exhibit the largest
anharmonicity and hence contribute the most to the anomalous thermal behaviour as has previously
been observed for the parent compounds Zn(CN)$_2$ and Ni(CN)$_2$. Specific anharmonic optic modes
make a significant contribution to the NTE and involve rotational motions of the [NiC$_4$] and/or
[ZnN$_4$] rigid units. Although this framework compound contains rigid unit modes, its large flexibility
results in modes with twisted, transverse motions that induce greater NTE. On the other hand, it
is likely that this lack of rigidity contributes to the instability of single crystals of the material.
Balancing the constraints with the flexibility of structure are therefore key when designing new
NTE compounds.
