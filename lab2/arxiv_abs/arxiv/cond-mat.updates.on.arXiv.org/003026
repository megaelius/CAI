Sn$_{0.97-y}$Co$_{0.03}$Ni$_{y}$O$_{2}$ (0 $\leq y \leq$ 0.04) nanocrystals, with average
crystallite size in the range of 7.3 nm ($y$=0.00) to 5.6 nm ($y$=0.04), have been synthesized using
pH-controlled chemical co-precipitation technique. The non-stoichiometric Sn related defects
and the O related stoichiometric Frenkel defects arising in the nanocrystals because of co-doping
have been identified and their effect on the structural and optical properties of the nanocrystals
have been extensively studied. It has been observed, using XPS that on increasing the Ni co-doping
concentration ($y$), the non-stoichiometric Sn defect Sn$_{\text{Sn}}^{"}$ increases in compensation
of existing defect Sn$_{i}^{....}$ for $y$ = 0.00 nanocrystals. High resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM) also confirms the existence of Sn$_{\text{Sn}}^{"}$. Regarding
the Frenkel defect, XPS results indicate that the concentration of $V_{\text{O}}$ and O$_{i}$,
manifested in the form of dangling bond related surface defect states,increases with increase
in $y$. Temperature dependent magnetisation measurement of the nanocrystals confirm the charge
state of $V_{\text{O}}$. The point defects have been found to affect the structural properties
in a way that distortion in octahedral geometry of complete Sn-O octahderon effectively reduces
whereas distortion in the trigonal planar coordination geometry of O increases. The investigation
of Urbach edge indicates an enhancement in the disorder in the nanocrystals on co-doping. The optical
band gap of the nanocrystals has been found to be red shifted upto $y$=0.02 and then a gradual blue
shift has been observed. A direct effect of the O related defect has been observed on the blue luminescence
of the nanocrystals such that the spectral contribution of blue luminescence in the total emission
intensity increases by 72% for $y$=0.04 as compared to $y$=0.00.
