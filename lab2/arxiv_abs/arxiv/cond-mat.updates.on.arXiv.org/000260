We show that the current thermodynamic measurements in the superconducting phase of $\mathrm{U}\mathrm{Ru}_2\mathrm{Si}_2$
are compatible with two distinct singlet chiral paired states $k_z(k_x \pm i k_y)$ and $(k_x \pm
i k_y)^2$. Despite possessing similar low temperature thermodynamic properties, these two pairings
are topologically distinguished by their respective orbital angular momentum projections along
the c-axis, $m=\pm 1$ and $m=\pm 2$. The point nodes of these states act as the monopoles and the anti-monopoles
of the Berry's gauge flux of charge $\pm m$, which are separated in the momentum space along the $c$
axis. As a result, the Berry's flux through the $ab$ plane equals $m$. Consequently, the point nodes
of $k_z(k_x+i k_y)$ and $(k_x \pm ik_y)^2$ states respectively realize the Weyl and the double-Weyl
fermions, with chemical potential exactly tuned at the Fermi point, due to the charge conjugation
symmetry. These topologically nontrivial point nodes, give rise to $m$ copies of protected spin
degenerate, chirally dispersing surface states on the $ca$ and the $cb$ planes, which carry surface
current, and their energies vanish at the Fermi arcs. In contrast, a line node acts as the momentum
space vortex loop, and gives rise to the zero energy, dispersionless Andreev bound states on the
surfaces parallel to the plane enclosed by the line node. The Berry's flux through the $ab$ plane
gives rise to anomalous spin Hall and thermal Hall conductivities, and various magnetoelectric
effects. A clear determination of the bulk invariant can only be achieved by probing the pairing
symmetry via a corner Josephson junction measurement, and Fourier transformed STM measurements
of the Fermi arcs. Therefore, we identify $\mathrm{U}\mathrm{Ru}_2\mathrm{Si}_2$ as a promising
material for realizing gapless topological superconductivity in three spatial dimensions.
