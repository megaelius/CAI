Understanding the nature of confinement, as well as its relation with the spontaneous breaking
of chiral symmetry, remains one of the long-standing questions in high-energy physics. The difficulty
of this task stems from the limitations of current analytical and numerical techniques to address
non-perturbative phenomena in non-Abelian gauge theories. In this work, we show how similar phenomena
emerge in simpler models, and how these can be further investigated using state-of-the-art cold-atom
quantum simulators. More specifically, we introduce the rotor Jackiw-Rebbi model, a (1+1)-dimensional
quantum field theory where interactions between Dirac fermions are mediated by quantum rotors.
Starting from a mixture of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, we show how this quantum field theory
emerges in the long-wavelength limit. For a wide and experimentally-relevant parameter regime,
the Dirac fermions acquire a dynamical mass via the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry. Moreover,
we study the effect of both quantum and thermal fluctuations, which lead to the phenomenon of chiral
symmetry restoration. Finally, we uncover a confinement-deconfinement quantum phase transition,
where meson-like fermions fractionalise into quark-like quasi-particles bound to topological
solitons of the rotor field. The proliferation of these solitons at finite chemical potentials
again serves to restore the chiral symmetry, yielding a clear analogy with the quark-gluon plasma
in quantum chromodynamics, where this symmetry coexists with the deconfined fractional charges.
Our results show how the interplay between these phenomena could be analyse in realistic atomic
experiments.
