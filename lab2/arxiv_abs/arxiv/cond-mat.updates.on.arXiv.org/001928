Recent technical progress demonstrates the possibility of stacking together virtually any combination
of atomically thin crystals of van der Waals bonded compounds to form new types of heterostructures
and interfaces. As a result, there is the need to understand at a quantitative level how the interfacial
properties are determined by the properties of the constituent 2D materials. We address this problem
by studying the transport and optoelectronic response of two different interfaces based on transition-metal
dichalcogenide monolayers, namely WSe2-MoSe2 and WSe2-MoS2. By exploiting the spectroscopic
capabilities of ionic liquid gated transistors, we show how the conduction and valence bands of
the individual monolayers determine the bands of the interface, and we establish quantitatively
(directly from the measurements) the energetic alignment of the bands in the different materials
as well as the magnitude of the interfacial band gap. Photoluminescence and photocurrent measurements
allow us to conclude that the band gap of the WSe2-MoSe2 interface is direct in k space, whereas the
gap of WSe2/MoS2 is indirect. For WSe2/MoSe2, we detect the light emitted from the decay of interlayer
excitons and determine experimentally their binding energy using the values of the interfacial
band gap extracted from transport measurements. The technique that we employed to reach this conclusion
demonstrates a rather-general strategy for characterizing quantitatively the interfacial properties
in terms of the properties of the constituent atomic layers. The results presented here further
illustrate how van der Waals interfaces of two distinct 2D semiconducting materials are composite
systems that truly behave as artificial semiconductors, the properties of which can be deterministically
defined by the selection of the appropriate constituent semiconducting monolayers.
