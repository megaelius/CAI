In the present paper, we consider two species of small spin clusters known as; two spin-1/2 Heisenberg
edge-shared tetrahedra and spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedron with the corresponding Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
terms in a longitudinal magnetic field, then we examine magnetization process and electric polarization
of the models as functions of magnetic and electric fields at Low temperature using exact numerical
diagonalization. Our exact results are in a good agreement with recent analysis carried out by J.
Stre{\v c}ka and K. Kar{\v l}ova \cite{str18b,str17a}. It is demonstrated that the polarization
behavior coincides the magnetization curves (including sequential intermediate plateaus),
also reflects the respective stepwise changes of ground-state phase transitions. We find that
the polarization has significant effects on the magnetic field dependencies of the magnetization.
Furthermore, we investigate other isothermal strategies such as cooling rate, magneticaloric
effect (MCE), as well as, electrocaloric effect(ECE) for both models. Since, new electrocaloric
materials with high performance is of great interest and importance in condensed matter physics,
here, we report on the ECE of the both aforedescribed spin-1/2 Heisenberg small clusters. We conclude
that two spin-1/2 Heisenberg edge-shared tetrahedra is a material with significant reversible
temperature change capability (giant electrocaloric effect) under an external electric field
compared with the spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedron, and can be used for cooling process. On the other
hand, our exact results obtained by studying the magnetocaloric effect and electrocaloric effect
of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedron prove that this model displays a rich electrocaloric effect
close to the relevant critical points.
