The cohesive collective motion (flocking, swarming) of autonomous agents is ubiquitously observed
and exploited in both natural and man-made settings, thus, minimal models for its description are
essential. In a model with continuous space and time we find that if two particles arrive symmetrically
in a plane at a large angle, then (i) radial repulsion and (ii) linear self-propelling toward a fixed
preferred speed are sufficient for them to depart at a smaller angle. For this local gain of momentum
explicit velocity alignment is not necessary, nor are adhesion/attraction, inelasticity or anisotropy
of the particles, or nonlinear drag. With many particles obeying these microscopic rules of motion
we find that their spatial confinement to a square with periodic boundaries (which is an indirect
form of attraction) leads to stable macroscopic ordering. As a function of the strength of added
noise we see -- at finite system sizes -- a critical slowing down close to the order-disorder boundary
and a discontinuous transition. After varying the density of particles at constant system size
and the size of the system with constant density we predict that in the infinite system size (or density)
limit the hysteresis loop disappears and the transition becomes continuous. We note that animals,
humans, drones, etc. tend to move asynchronously and are often more responsive to motion than positions.
Thus, for them velocity-based continuous models can provide higher precision than coordinate-based
models. An additional characteristic and realistic feature of the model is that convergence to
the ordered state is fastest at a finite density, which is in contrast to models applying discretized
time and (discontinuous) explicit velocity alignments. In summary, we suggest the model as a minimal
description of flocking.
