We investigate how different chemical environment influences magnetic properties of terbium(III)
(Tb)-based single-molecule magnets (SMMs), using first-principles relativistic multireference
methods. Recent experiments showed that Tb-based SMMs can have exceptionally large magnetic anisotropy
and that they can be used for experimental realization of quantum information applications, with
a judicious choice of chemical environment. Here, we perform complete active space self-consistent
field (CASSCF) calculations including relativistic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) for representative
Tb-based SMMs such as TbPc$_2$ and TbPcNc in three charge states. We calculate low-energy electronic
structure from which we compute the Tb crystal-field parameters and construct an effective pseudospin
Hamiltonian. Our calculations show that ligand type and fine points of molecular geometry do not
affect the zero-field splitting, while the latter varies weakly with oxidation number. On the other
hand, higher-energy levels have a strong dependence on all these characteristics. For neutral
TbPc$_2$ and TbPcNc molecules, the Tb magnetic moment and the ligand spin are parallel to each other
and the coupling strength between them does not depend much on ligand type and details of atomic structure.
However, ligand distortion and molecular symmetry play a crucial role in transverse crystal-field
parameters which lead to tunnel splitting. The tunnel splitting induces quantum tunneling of magnetization
by itself or by combining with other processes. Our results provide insight into mechanisms of magnetization
relaxation in the representative Tb-based SMMs.
