The application of the muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) technique for studying type-I
superconductivity is discussed. In the intermediate state, i.e. when a type-I superconducting
sample with non-zero demagnetization factor $N$ is separated into normal state and Meissner state
(superconducting) domains, the $\mu$SR technique allows to determine with very high precision
the value of the thermodynamic critical field $B_{\rm c}$, as well as the volume of the sample in the
normal and the superconducting state. Due to the microscopic nature of $\mu$SR technique, the $B_{\rm
c}$ values are determined directly via measurements of the internal field inside the normal state
domains. No assumptions or introduction of any type of measurement criteria are needed. Experiments
performed on a 'classical' type-I superconductor, a cylindrically shaped $\beta-$Sn sample,
allowed to reconstruct the full $B-T$ phase diagram. The zero-temperature value of the thermodynamic
critical field $B_{\rm c}(0)=30.578(6)$ mT and the transition temperature $T_{\rm c}=3.717(3)$
K were determined and found to be in a good agreement with the literature data. An experimentally
obtained demagnetization factor is in very good agreement with theoretical calculations of the
demagnetization factor of a finite cylinder. The analysis of $B_{\rm c}(T)$ dependence within
the framework of the phenomenological $\alpha-$model allow to obtain the value of the superconducting
energy gap $\Delta=0.59(1)$ meV, of the electronic specific heat $\gamma_e=1.781(3)$ ${\rm mJ}/{\rm
mol}\; {\rm K}^2$ and of the jump in the heat capacity ${\Delta C(T_c)}/{\gamma T_{\rm c}}=1.55(2)$.
