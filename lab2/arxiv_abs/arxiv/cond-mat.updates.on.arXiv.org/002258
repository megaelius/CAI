Adsorption of CO2 on a semiconductor surface is prerequisite for its photocatalytic reduction.
Owing to superior photo-corrosion resistance, non-toxicity and suitable band edge positions,
TiO2 is considered to be the most efficient photocatalyst for facilitating the redox reactions.
However, due to the absence of adequate understanding on the mechanism of adsorption, CO2 conversion
efficiency on TiO2 surface has not been maximized. While anatase TiO2 (101) is the most stable facet,
(001) surface is more reactive and it has been experimentally shown that the stability can be reversed
and a larger percentage (up to ~ 89%) (001) facet can be synthesized in the presence of fluorine ions.
Therefore, through density functional calculations we have investigated the CO2 adsorption on
TiO2 (001) surface. We have developed a three state quantum mechanical model that explains the mechanism
of chemisorption leading to the formation of a tridentate carbonate complex. The electronic structure
analysis reveals that the CO2-TiO2 interaction at the surface is uniaxial and long ranged, which
gives rise to anisotropy in binding energy (BE). It negates the widely perceived one-to-one correspondence
between coverage and BE and infers that the spatial distribution of CO2 primarily determines the
BE. A conceptual experiment is devised where the CO2 concentration and flow direction can be controlled
to tune the BE within a large window of ~ 1.5 eV. The experiment also reveals that a maximum of 50% coverage
can be achieved for chemisorption. In the presence of water, the activated carbonate complex forms
a bicarbonate complex by overcoming a potential barrier of ~0.9 eV.
