In Ref. [1] the author has recently established sharp large deviation principles for cumulative
rewards associated with a discrete-time renewal model, supposing that each renewal involves a
broad-sense reward taking values in a separable Banach space. The renewal model has been there identified
with constrained and non-constrained pinning models of polymers, which amount to Gibbs changes
of measure of a classical renewal process. In this paper we show that the constrained pinning model
is the common mathematical structure to the Poland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation and to some
relevant one-dimensional lattice models of Statistical Mechanics, such as the Fisher-Felderhof
model of fluids, the Wako-Sait\^o-Mu\~noz-Eaton model of protein folding, and the Tokar-Dreyss\'e
model of strained epitaxy. Then, in the framework of the constrained pinning model, we develop a
general analytical large deviation theory for cumulative rewards corresponding to multivariate
deterministic rewards that are uniquely determined by, and at most of the order of magnitude of,
the time elapsed between consecutive renewals. In particular, we outline the explicit calculation
of the rate functions and successively we identify the conditions that prevent them from being analytic
and that underlie affine stretches in their graphs. Finally, we apply the general theory to the number
of renewals. From the point of view of Equilibrium Statistical Physics and Statistical Mechanics,
cumulative rewards of the above type are the extensive observables that enter the thermodynamic
description of the system. The number of renewals, which turns out to be the commonly adopted order
parameter for the Poland-Scheraga model and for also the renewal models of Statistical Mechanics,
is one of these observables.
