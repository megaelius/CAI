Static, dynamic, and topological properties of hollow systems differ from those that are fully
filled as a result of the presence of a boundary associated with an inner surface. Hollow Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) naturally occur in various ultracold atomic systems and possibly within neutron
stars but have hitherto not been experimentally realized in isolation on Earth because of gravitational
sag. Motivated by the expected first realization of fully closed BEC shells in the microgravity
conditions of the Cold Atomic Laboratory aboard the International Space Station, we present a comprehensive
study of spherically symmetric hollow BECs as well as the hollowing transition from a filled sphere
BEC into a thin shell through central density depletion. We employ complementary analytic and numerical
techniques in order to study equilibrium density profiles and the collective mode structures of
condensate shells hosted by a range of trapping potentials. We identify concrete and robust signatures
of the evolution from filled to hollow structures and the effects of the emergence of an inner boundary,
inclusive of a dip in breathing-mode-type collective mode frequencies and a restructuring of surface
mode structure across the transition. By extending our analysis to a two-dimensional transition
of a disk to a ring, we show that the collective mode signatures are an essential feature of hollowing,
independent of the specific geometry. Finally, we relate our work to past and ongoing experimental
efforts and consider the influence of gravity on thin condensate shells. We identify the conditions
under which gravitational sag is highly destructive and study the mode-mixing effects of microgravity
on the collective modes of these shells.
