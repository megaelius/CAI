In this work we developed a method for simulating polar species in the dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) method. The main idea behind the method is to treat each bead as a dumb-bell, i.e. two sub-beads
(the sub-beads can bear charges) kept at a fixed distance, instead of a point-like particle. It was
shown that at small enough separations the composite beads act essentially as conventional point-like
beads. Next, the relation between the bead dipole moment and the bulk dielectric permittivity was
obtained. The interaction of single charges in polar liquid showed that the observed dielectric
permittivity is somewhat smaller than that obtained for the bulk case at large separation between
the charges; at distances comparable to the bead size the solvation shells of the charges start to
interfere and oscillations in the observed permittivity occur. Such oriented molecules effectively
have smaller polarizability compared to the bulk liquid, so the field of one charge in the vicinity
of another charge is reduced not as strong as in the bulk. Finally, we showed why it is necessary to
treat the polar species in DPD explicitly instead of implicitly by calculating the local polarizability
based on the local species concentrations: the latter leads to the violation of the Newton's third
law resulting in simulation artifacts. We investigated the behavior of a charged colloidal particle
at an interface of polar and non-polar liquids. We obtained that when the polar molecules are treated
explicitly, the charged colloidal particle moved into the polar liquid since it is energetically
more favorable for the charged molecules to be immersed in a polar medium; however, within the "implicit
polarity" method the colloidal particle is found on top of a "bump" formed by the molecules of the
non-polar liquid, which increases the interface area between the liquids instead of decreasing
it.
