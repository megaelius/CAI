External magnetic field, temperature, and spin-polarized current are usually employed to create
and control nanoscale vortex-like spin configurations such as magnetic skyrmions. Although these
methods have proven successful, they are not energy-efficient due to high power consumption and
dissipation. Coupling between magnetic properties and mechanical deformation, the magnetoelastic
(MEL) effect, offers a novel approach to energy-efficient control of magnetism at the nanoscale.
It is of great interest in the context of ever-decreasing length scales of electronic and spintronic
devices. Therefore, it is desirable to establish a comprehensive framework capable of predicting
the effects of mechanical stress and enabling deterministic control of magnetic textures and skyrmions.
In this work, using an advanced scheme of multiscale simulations and Lorentz transmission electron
microscopy measurements we demonstrate deterministic control of topological magnetic textures
and skyrmion creation in thin films and racetracks of chiral magnets. Our investigation considers
not only uniaxial but also biaxial stress, which is ubiquitous in thin-film devices. The biaxial
stress, rather than the uniaxial one, was shown to be more efficient to create or annihilate skyrmions
when the MEL coefficient and strain have the same or opposite signs, respectively. It was also demonstrated
to be a viable way to stabilize skyrmions and to control their current-induced motion in racetrack
memory. Our results open prospects for deployment of mechanical stress to create novel topological
spin textures, including merons, and in control and optimization of skyrmion-based devices.
