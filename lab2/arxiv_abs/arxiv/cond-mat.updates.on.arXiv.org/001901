Heusler compounds form a numerous class of intermetallics, which include two families of compositions
ABC and AB2C, usually referred to as half- and full-Heusler compounds, respectively. Given their
tunable electronic properties, made possible by adjusting the chemical composition, these materials
are currently considered for the possible use in sustainable technologies such as solar energy
and thermoelectric conversion. According to theoretical predictions, Sb substitution in the
TiFe2Sn full-Heusler compound is thought to yield band structure modifications that should enhance
the thermoelectric power factor. In this work we tested the phase stability and the structural and
microstructural properties of such heavily-doped compounds. We synthesized polycrystalline
TiFe2Sn1-xSbx samples (x=0,0.1,0.2 and 1.0) by arc melting, followed annealing. The structural
characterization, performed by x-ray powder diffraction and microscopy analyses, confirmed
the formation of the Heusler AB2C structure (cF16, Fm-3m, prototype: MnCu2Al) in all samples, with
only few percent amounts of secondary phases and only slight deviations from nominal stoichiometry.
With increasing Sb substitution we found a steady decrease of the lattice parameter, confirming
that the replacement takes place at the Sn site. Quite unusually, the as cast samples exhibited a
higher lattice contraction than the annealed ones. The fully substituted x=1.0 compound, again
adopting the MnCu2Al structure, does not form as stoichiometric phase and turned out to be strongly
Fe deficient.The physical behavior at room temperature indicated that annealing with increasing
temperature is beneficial for electrical and thermoelectrical transport. Moreover, we measured
a slight improvement of electrical and thermoelectrical properties in the x=0.1 sample and a suppression
in the x=0.2 sample, as compared to the undoped x=0 sample.
