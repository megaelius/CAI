Solvation of gold nanoparticles passivated with end group functionalized alkylthiols, namely
CH$_3$, NH$_2$ or COOH is studied in solvents of varying degrees of repulsion-dispersion and electrostatic
interactions ranging from strongly polar SPC/E water to modified hybrid water models, where the
Lennard-Jones contribution to the potential energy is enhanced relative to SPC/E to completely
non-polar, decane. The effects due to solvent reorganization around the nanoparticle as a function
of the ligand and solvent chemistry are monitored using the nanoparticle-solvent pair correlation
functions and tetrahedral order parameter. The solvent penetration inside the ligand shell is
maximum for decane, indicating better solute-solvent interaction in decane compared to other
solvents. The COOH end group functionalized nanoparticle breaks the tetrahedral structure of
water molecules more as compared to other nanoparticles used in this study. The ligand reorganization
and its effect on solvation are monitored using radial density profiles (RDPs), radius of gyration
($R_g$) and ligand asymmetry parameter ($\langle \Delta \rangle$). RDP and $R_g$ values show significant
stretching of ligands in decane than in model waters, which is also consistent with $\langle \Delta
\rangle$. The ligand shell anisotropy for all nanoparticles is maximum in SPC/E water and minimum
in decane. The isotropic potential of mean force ($V_{PMF}(r)$) between two identical end group
functionalized nanoparticles have been calculated in vacuum, SPC/E water and H3.00 modified hybrid
water, which consistently shows attractive well depth. Distance-dependent fluctuation driven
anisotropy has also been examined. The implications for self-assembly of passivated gold nanoparticles
from aqueous dispersions as well as the dependence of calculated quantities on ligand and solvent
chemistry are highlighted.
