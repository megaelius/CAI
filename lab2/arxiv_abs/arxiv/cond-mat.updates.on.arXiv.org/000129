Barchan dunes --- crescent-shaped dunes that form in areas of unidirectional winds and low sand
availability --- commonly display an asymmetric shape, with one limb extended downwind. Several
factors have been identified as potential causes for barchan dune asymmetry on Earth and Mars: asymmetric
bimodal wind regime, topography, influx asymmetry and dune collision. However, the dynamics and
potential range of barchan morphologies emerging under each specific scenario that leads to dune
asymmetry are far from being understood. In the present work, we use dune modeling in order to investigate
the formation and evolution of asymmetric barchans. We find that a bimodal wind regime causes limb
extension when the divergence angle between primary and secondary winds is larger than $90^{\circ}$,
whereas the extended limb evolves into a seif dune if the ratio between secondary and primary transport
rates is larger than 25%. Calculations of dune formation on an inclined surface under constant wind
direction also lead to barchan asymmetry, however no seif dune is obtained from surface tilting
alone. Asymmetric barchans migrating along a tilted surface move laterally, with transverse migration
velocity proportional to the slope of the terrain. Limb elongation induced by topography can occur
when a barchan crosses a topographic rise. Furthermore, transient asymmetric barchan shapes with
extended limb also emerge during collisions between dunes or due to an asymmetric influx. Our findings
can be useful for making quantitative inference on local wind regimes or spatial heterogeneities
in transport conditions of planetary dune fields hosting asymmetric barchans.
