Doping bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) with elements such as copper and strontium (Sr) can induce superconductivity,
making the doped materials interesting candidates to explore potential topological superconducting
behaviors. It was thought that the superconductivity of doped Bi2Se3 was induced by dopant atoms
intercalated in van der Waals gaps. However, several experiments have shown that the intercalation
of dopant atoms may not necessarily make doped Bi2Se3 superconducting. Thus, the structural origin
of superconductivity in doped Bi2Se3 remains an open question. Herein, we combined material synthesis
and characterization, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and first-principles
calculations to study the doping structure of Sr-doped Bi2Se3. We found that the emergence of superconductivity
is strongly related with n-type dopant atoms. Atomic-level energy-dispersive X-ray mapping revealed
various n-type Sr dopants that occupy intercalated and interstitial positions. First-principles
calculations showed that the formation energy of a specific interstitial Sr doping position depends
strongly on Sr doping level. This site changes from a metastable position at low Sr doping level to
a stable position at high Sr doping level. The calculation results explain why quenching is necessary
to obtain superconducting samples when the Sr doping level is low and also why slow furnace cooling
can yield superconducting samples when the Sr doping level is high. Our findings suggest that Sr
atoms doped at interstitial locations, instead of those intercalated in van der Waals gaps, are
most likely to be responsible for the emergence of superconductivity in Sr-doped Bi2Se3.
