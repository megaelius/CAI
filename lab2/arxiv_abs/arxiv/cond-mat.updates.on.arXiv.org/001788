Elastic network models, simple structure-based representations of biomolecules where atoms
interact via short-range harmonic potentials, provide great insight into a molecule's internal
dynamics and mechanical properties at extremely low computational cost. Their efficiency and
effectiveness have made them a pivotal instrument in the computer-aided study of proteins and,
since a few years, also of nucleic acids. In general, the coarse-grained sites, i.e. those effective
force centres onto which the all-atom structure is mapped, are constructed based on intuitive rules:
a typical choice for proteins is to retain only the C$_\alpha$ atoms of each amino acid. However,
a mapping strategy relying only on the atom type and not the local properties of its embedding can
be suboptimal compared to a more careful selection. Here we present a strategy in which the subset
of atoms that constitute the coarse-grained sites of the model is selected in a stochastic search
aimed at optimising a cost function. The latter is taken to be a simple measure of the consistency
between the harmonic approximation of an elastic network model and the harmonic model obtained
through exact integration of the discarded degrees of freedom. The method is applied to two representatives
of structurally very different types of biomolecules: the protein Adenylate kinase and the RNA
molecule adenine riboswitch. Our analysis quantifies the substantial impact that an algorithm-driven
selection of coarse-grained sites can have on a model's properties. In particular, we provide independent
support for the empirical observation that RNAs pose a significantly bigger challenge for coarse
graining than proteins.
