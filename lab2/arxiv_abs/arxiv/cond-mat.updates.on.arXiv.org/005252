The minimum parameterization of the wave function is derived for the time-independent many-body
problem. In this parameterization all electrons and electron pairs are indistinguishable which
eliminates the exponential scaling with the number of particles plaguing all other correlation
methods. An exponential scaling shown to stem from the expansion of the wave function in one-particle
basis sets. It is demonstrated that using a geminal basis with a skew-symmetric orthogonal coefficient
matrix, which fulfill a Lie algebra, the parameterization of the exact wave function becomes independent
of the number of particles and only scale quadratic with the number of basis functions in the optimized
basis and quartic in an arbitrary basis. The resulting antisymmetrized geminal power wave function
is shown to fulfill the necessary and sufficient conditions for the exact wave function, treat all
electrons and electron pairs as indistinguishable and be the most compact representation of the
exact wave function possible. The number of parameters in the antisymmetrized geminal power wave
function is exactly the same number of parameters as in the two-particle reduced density matrix
thereby showing that these representations are equivalent just like the representations for a
one-particle Hamiltonian. A detailed discussion of how the most compact wave function can be derived
in general is also presented along with different geminal ans\"atze and sufficient closure relations.
Due to the breaking of the scaling wall for the exact wave function it is expected that, if a general
set of constraints can be found, even systems of biological relevance can be treated exactly in the
future.
