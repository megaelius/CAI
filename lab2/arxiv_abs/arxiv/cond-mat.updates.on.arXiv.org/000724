In order to inquire the microscopic origin of observed disparate time scales of relaxation in protein
hydration layer (PHL), we carry out several computer experiments using atomistic molecular dynamics
simulations. We mutate the charges of the AASC in the neighbourhood of natural probes in Lysozyme,
Myoglobin and Monellin, and also freeze the sidechain motions. In subsequent analyses, we decompose
the total solvation energy response in terms of various contributions present in the system to capture
the interplay among different self and cross-energy correlation terms. We establish the existence
of a significant slow component in the contribution from the water molecules present within the
PHL. Both charged amino acid side chain (AASC) residues and the water molecules in the PHL contribute
to the slow response measured. AASCs contribute with time scales of ~100-300 ps while water contributes
in ~30-100 ps range. Moreover, these motions are coupled. Freezing protein motion removes the slowest
component but a part remains due to water. In earlier studies, slowness that arises from PHL was missed
because of a large contribution from the bulk water to solvation energy. ~80% of the ultrafast decay
results from the bulk water molecules. This is in agreement with earlier theoretical observations.
The origin of the coupling between water molecules in the PHL and AASC can be partly attributed to
the presence of charges in the AASC around a probe. The charge enforces a structural ordering of nearby
water molecules and helps forming long-lived hydrogen bonded network. Removal of the charges and
protein motions allows a faster relaxation, although a slow component (~30-80 ps) remains in solvation.
We rationalise these facts with the help of a molecular hydrodynamic theory that was developed using
classical time dependent density functional theory in a semi quantitative manner.
