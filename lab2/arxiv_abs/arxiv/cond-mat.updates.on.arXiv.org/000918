In this paper, we study the extreme statistics in the complex Ginibre ensemble of $N \times N$ random
matrices with complex Gaussian entries, but with no other symmetries. All the $N$ eigenvalues are
complex random variables and their joint distribution can be interpreted as a $2d$ Coulomb gas with
a logarithmic repulsion between any pair of particles and in presence of a confining harmonic potential
$v(r) \propto r^2$. We study the statistics of the eigenvalue with the largest modulus $r_{\max}$
in the complex plane. The typical and large fluctuations of $r_{\max}$ around its mean had been studied
before, and they match smoothly to the right of the mean. However, it remained a puzzle to understand
why the large and typical fluctuations to the left of the mean did not match. In this paper, we show
that there is indeed an intermediate fluctuation regime that interpolates smoothly between the
large and the typical fluctuations to the left of the mean. Moreover, we compute explicitly this
"intermediate deviation function" (IDF) and show that it is universal, i.e. independent of the
confining potential $v(r)$ as long as it is spherically symmetric and increases faster than $\ln
r^2$ for large $r$ with an unbounded support. If the confining potential $v(r)$ has a finite support,
i.e. becomes infinite beyond a finite radius, we show via explicit computation that the corresponding
IDF is different. Interestingly, in the borderline case where the confining potential grows very
slowly as $v(r) \sim \ln r^2$ for $r \gg 1$ with an unbounded support, the intermediate regime disappears
and there is a smooth matching between the central part and the left large deviation regime.
