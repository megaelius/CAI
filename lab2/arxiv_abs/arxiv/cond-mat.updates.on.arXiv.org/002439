Yttrium (Y) substituted Mg-Zn ferrites with the compositions of Mg0.5Zn0.5YxFe2-xO4 (0 x 0.05)
have been synthesized by conventional standard ceramic technique. The prepared samples have been
studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and dielectric
measurement. The effect of Y3+ substitution on the structural, electrical and dielectric properties
of Mg-Zn ferrites has also been studied. The single phase of spinel structure with a very tiny secondary
phase of YFeO3for higher Y contents has been detected. The variation in lattice constant is explained
with proper formalism. The lattice constant has also been calculated theoretically and compared
with measured experimental lattice constant. The bulk density, X-ray density and porosity have
been calculated. The completion of solid state reaction and formation of spinel structure has been
confirmed from the bands 1 and 2 in the FTIR spectra. Frequency dependence of conductivity is studied
and a significant increase in resistivity (an order) has been observed due to Y substitution. Frequency
dependence of dielectric constants and dielectric loss tangent (tand) are also studied and the
lowering of dielectric constant with the increase of Y content is noted. The abnormal behavior of
tand has been successfully explained. Dielectric relaxation phenomena are studied in terms of
electric modulus and the calculated relaxation time are found be in the range between 15 to 31 nano
seconds for different Y contents. Finally, the impedance spectroscopy is used to study the contribution
from bulk grains and grains boundary resistance. The values of electrical resistivity and dielectric
constants suggest the suitability of Y substituted Mg-Zn ferrites in microwave device applications.
