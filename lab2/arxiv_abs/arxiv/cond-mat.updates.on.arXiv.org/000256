In spin-glass systems, frustration can be adjusted continuously and considerably, without changing
the antiferromagnetic bond probability p, by using locally correlated quenched randomness, as
we demonstrate here on hypercubic lattices and hierarchical lattices. Such overfrustrated and
underfrustrated Ising systems on hierarchical lattices in d=3 and 2 are studied. With the removal
of just 51 % of frustration, a spin-glass phase occurs in d=2. With the addition of just 33 % frustration,
the spin-glass phase disappears in d=3. Sequences of 18 different phase diagrams for different
levels of frustration are calculated in both dimensions. In general, frustration lowers the spin-glass
ordering temperature. At low temperatures, increased frustration favors the spin-glass phase
(before it disappears) over the ferromagnetic phase and symmetrically the antiferromagnetic
phase. When any amount, including infinitesimal, frustration is introduced, the chaotic rescaling
of local interactions occurs in the spin-glass phase. Chaos increases with increasing frustration,
as seen from the increased positive value of the calculated Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, starting
from $\lambda =0$ when frustration is absent. The calculated runaway exponent $y_R$ of the renormalization-group
flows decreases with increasing frustration to $y_R=0$ when the spin-glass phase disappears.
From our calculations of entropy and specific heat curves in d=3, it is seen that frustration lowers
in temperature the onset of both long- and short-range order in spin-glass phases, but is more effective
on the former. From calculations of the entropy as a function of antiferromagnetic bond concentration
p, it is seen that the ground-state and low-temperature entropy already mostly sets in within the
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, before the spin-glass phase is reached.
