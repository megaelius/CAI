When a superconductor is heated above its critical temperature $T_c$, macroscopic coherence vanishes,
leaving behind droplets of thermally fluctuating Cooper pair. This superconducting fluctuation
effect above $T_c$ has been investigated for many decades and its influence on the transport, thermoelectric
and thermodynamic quantities in most superconductors is well understood by the standard Gaussian
fluctuation theories. The transverse thermoelectric (Nernst) effect is particularly sensitive
to the fluctuations, and the large Nernst signal found in the pseudogap regime of the underdoped
high-$T_c$ cuprates has raised much debate on its connection to the origin of superconductivity.
Here we report on the observation of a colossal Nernst signal due to the superconducting fluctuations
in the heavy-fermion superconductor URu$_2$Si$_2$. The Nernst coefficient is enhanced by as large
as one million times over the theoretically expected value within the standard framework of superconducting
fluctuations. This, for the first time in any known material, results in a sizeable thermomagnetic
figure of merit approaching unity. Moreover, contrary to the conventional wisdom, the enhancement
in the Nernst signal is more significant with the reduction of the impurity scattering rate. This
anomalous Nernst effect intimately reflects the highly unusual superconducting state embedded
in the so-called hidden-order phase of URu$_2$Si$_2$. The results invoke possible chiral or Berry-phase
fluctuations originated from the topological aspect of this superconductor, which are associated
with the effective magnetic field intrinsically induced by broken time-reversal symmetry of the
superconducting order parameter.
