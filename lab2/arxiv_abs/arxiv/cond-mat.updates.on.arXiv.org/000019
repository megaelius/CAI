The orthorhombic perovskite NaOsO3 undergoes a continuous metal-insulator transition (MIT),
accompanied by antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at T_N=410 K, suggested to be an example of the rare
Slater (itinerant) MIT. We study this system using ab initio and related methods, focusing on the
origin and nature of magnetic ordering and the MIT. The rotation and tilting of OsO6 octahedra in
the GdFeO3 structure result in moderate narrowing the band width of the t_{2g} manifold, but sufficient
to induce flattening of bands and AFM order within the local spin density approximation (LSDA),
where it remains metallic but with a deep pseudogap. Including on-site Coulomb repulsion U, at U_c
~2 eV a MIT occurs only in the AFM state. Effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the band structure
seem minor as expected for a half-filled $t_{2g}^{3}$ shell, but SOC doubles the critical value
U_c necessary to open a gap and also leads to large magnetocrystalline energy differences in spite
of normal orbital moments no greater than 0.1$\mu_B$. Our results are consistent with a Slater MIT
driven by magnetic order, induced by a combination of structurally-induced band narrowing and
moderate Coulomb repulsion, with SOC necessary for a full picture. Strong p-d hybridization reduces
the moment, and when bootstrapped by the reduced Hund's rule coupling (proportional to the moment)
gives a calculated moment of ~1 $\mu_B$, consistent with the observed moment and only a third of the
formal $d^3$ value. We raise and discuss one important question: since this AFM ordering is at q=0
(in the 20 atom cell) where nesting is a moot issue, what is the microscopic driving force for ordering
and the accompanying MIT?
