The critical behavior of dc magnetization in the uranium ferromagnet URhAl with the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type
crystal structure has been studied around the ferromagnetic transition temperature T_C. The critical
exponent beta for the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization below T_C, gamma
for the magnetic susceptibility, and delta for the magnetic isotherm at T_C have been obtained with
a modified Arrott plot, a Kouvel-Fisher plot, the critical isotherm analysis and the scaling analysis.
We have determined the critical exponents as beta = 0.287 +- 0.005, gamma = 1.47 +- 0.02, and delta
= 6.08 +- 0.04 by the scaling analysis and the critical isotherm analysis. These critical exponents
satisfy the Widom scaling law delta=1+gamma/beta. URhAl has strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy,
similar to its isostructural UCoAl that has been regarded as a three-dimensional (3D) Ising system
in previous studies. However, the universality class of the critical phenomenon in URhAl does not
belong to the 3D Ising model (beta = 0.325, gamma = 1.241, and delta = 4.82) with short-range exchange
interactions between magnetic moments. The determined exponents can be explained with the results
of the renormalization group approach for a two-dimensional (2D) Ising system coupled with long-range
interactions decaying as J(r)~r^-(d+sigma) with sigma = 1.44. We suggest that the strong hybridization
between the uranium 5f and rhodium 4d electrons in the U-Rh_I layer in the hexagonal crystal structure
is a source of the low dimensional magnetic property. The present result is contrary to current understandings
of the physical properties in a series of isostructural UTX uranium ferromagnets (T: transition
metals, X: p-block elements) based on the 3D Ising model.
