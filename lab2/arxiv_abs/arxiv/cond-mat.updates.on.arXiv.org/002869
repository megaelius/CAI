Diffusion in crystals and on their surfaces is fundamental to control crystal growth, surface structure,
and surface morphology. Point defects such as self-interstitials and vacancies in the bulk and
adsorbed atoms (adatoms) and surface vacancies (advacancies) at the surface determine the atomic
mechanisms of self- and foreign atom diffusion. With the development of the high-resolution electron
and probe microscopy techniques that allow surfaces to be investigated at the atomic scale, it has
become possible to obtain the detailed information about atomic mechanisms of the mass-transfer
and the interaction of adatoms and advacancies with atomic steps, which are the main sources and
sinks for surface point defects. However, despite the fact that there is no doubt that the bulk point
defect concentrations are controlled by surfaces, atomic mechanisms of the diffusion and reactions
of the self-interstitials and vacancies in the vicinity of free surfaces and interfaces are still
subject to controversy, especially at high temperatures. Here, we show that the creation and annihilation
of self-interstitials and vacancies at crystal surfaces can be described by introducing a diffusive
layer of the bulk point defects adsorbed just below the surface. Atomic mechanism of the bulk and
surface point defect generation and annihilation on surface sinks is considered theoretically
on the base of the Burton, Cabrera and Frank model. We analyze the effect of the surface permeability
on the atomic step rate advance and show that the surface permeability, as well as the supersaturation
of point defects in both gas and bulk phases, control the dynamic of the crystal surface morphology.
