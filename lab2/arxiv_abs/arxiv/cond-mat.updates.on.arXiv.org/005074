Motivated by the precedent study of Ordenes-Huanca and Velazquez [JSTAT \textbf{093303} (2016)],
we address the study of a simple model of a pure non-neutral plasma: a system of identical non-relativistic
charged particles confined under an external harmonic field with frequency $\omega$. We perform
the equilibrium thermo-statistical analysis in the framework of continuum approximation. This
study reveals the existence of two asymptotic limits: the known Brillouin steady state at zero temperature,
and the gas of harmonic oscillators in the limit of high temperatures. The non-extensive character
of this model is evidenced by the associated thermodynamic limit, $N\rightarrow+\infty: U/N^{7/3}=const$,
which coincides with the thermodynamic limit of a self-gravitating system of non-relativistic
point particles in presence of Newtonian gravitation. Afterwards, the dynamics of this model is
analyzed through numerical simulations. It is verified the agreement of thermo-statistical estimations
and the temporal expectation values of the same macroscopic observables. The system chaoticity
is addressed via numerical computation of Lyapunov exponents in the framework of the known \emph{tangent
dynamics}. The temperature dependence of Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ approaches to zero in the
two asymptotic limits of this model, reaching its maximum during the transit between them. The chaos
of the present model is very strong, since its rate is faster than the characteristic timescale of
the microscopic dynamics $\tau_{dyn}=1/\omega$. A qualitative analysis suggests that such a
strong chaoticity cannot be explained in terms of collision events because of their respective
characteristic timescales are quite different, $\tau_{ch}\propto \tau_{dyn}/N^{1/4}$ and
$\tau_{coll}\propto \tau_{dyn}$.
