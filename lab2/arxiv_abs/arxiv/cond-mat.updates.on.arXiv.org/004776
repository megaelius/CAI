The nature of the magnetic transition, critical scaling of magnetization, and magnetocaloric
effect in Mn$_{1+x}$Fe$_{4-x}$Si$_{3}$ ($ x =$ 0 to 1) are studied in detail. Our measurements show
no thermal hysteresis across the magnetic transition for the parent compound which is in contrast
with the previous report and corroborate the second order nature of the transition. The magnetic
transition could be tuned continuously with Mn substitution at the Fe site. The Mn substitution
leads to a linear increase in the unit cell volume and a slight reduction in the effective moment.
A detailed critical analysis of the magnetization data for $x = 0.0$ and 0.2 is performed in the critical
regime using the modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fisher plot, universal curve scaling, and scaling
analysis of magnetocaloric effect. The magnetization isotherms follow modified Arrott plots
with critical exponent ($\beta \simeq 0.308$, $\gamma \simeq 1.448$, and $\delta \simeq 5.64$)
for the parent compound ($x=0.0$) and ($\beta \simeq 0.304$, $\gamma \simeq 1.445$, and $\delta
\simeq 5.64$) for $x = 0.2$. The Kouvel-Fisher and universal scaling plots of the magnetization
isotherms further confirm the reliability of our critical analysis and values of the exponents.
These values of the critical exponents are found to be same for both the parent and doped samples which
do not fall under any of the standard universality classes. A reasonable magnetocaloric effect
$\Delta S_{\rm m}\simeq-6.67$~J/Kg-K and -5.84~J/Kg-K for $x= 0.0$ and 0.2 compounds, respectively,
with a huge relative cooling power ($RCP \sim 700$~J/Kg) for 9~T field change is observed. The universal
scaling of magnetocaloric effect further mimics the second order character of the magnetic transition.
The obtained critical exponents from the critical analysis of magnetocaloric effect agree with
the values deduced from the magnetic isotherm analysis.
