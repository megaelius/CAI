Motivated by the rich physics of honeycomb magnetic materials, we obtain the phase diagram and analyze
magnetic properties of the spin-1/2 and spin-1 J1-J2-J3 Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice.
Based on the SU(2) and SU(3) symmetry representations of the Schwinger boson approach, which treats
disordered spin liquids and magnetically ordered phases on an equal footing, we obtain the complete
phase diagrams in the (J2,J3)plane. This is achieved using a fully unrestricted approach which
does not assume any pre-defined Ansatze. For S=1/2, we find a quantum spin liquid (QSL) stabilized
between the N\'eel, spiral and collinear antiferromagnetic phases in agreement with previous
theoretical work. However, by increasing S from 1/2 to 1, the QSL is quickly destroyed due to the weakening
of quantum fluctuations indicating that the model already behaves as a quasi-classical system.
The dynamical structure factors and temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility are
obtained in order to characterize all phases in the phase diagrams. Moreover, motivated by the relevance
of the single-ion anisotropy, D, to various S=1 honeycomb compounds, we have analyzed the destruction
of magnetic order based on a SU(3) representation of the Schwinger bosons. Our analysis provides
a unified understanding of the magnetic properties of honeycomb materials realizing the J1-J2-J3
Heisenberg model from the strong quantum spin regime at S=1/2 to the S=1 case. Neutron scattering
and magnetic susceptibility experiments can be used to test the destruction of the QSL phase when
replacing S=1/2 by S=1 localized moments in certain honeycomb compounds.
