We study the operators in the large $N$ tensor models, focusing mostly on the fermionic quantum mechanics
with $O(N)^3$ symmetry which may be either global or gauged. In the model with global symmetry we
study the spectra of bilinear operators, which are in either the symmetric traceless or the antisymmetric
representation of one of the $O(N)$ groups. In the symmetric traceless case, the spectrum of scaling
dimensions is the same as in the SYK model with real fermions; it includes the $h=2$ zero-mode. For
the operators anti-symmetric in the two indices, the scaling dimensions are the same as in the additional
sector found in the complex tensor and SYK models; the lowest $h=0$ eigenvalue corresponds to the
conserved $O(N)$ charges. A class of singlet operators may be constructed from contracted combinations
of $m$ symmetric traceless or antisymmetric two-particle operators. Their two-point functions
receive contributions from $m$ melonic ladders. Such multiple ladders are a new phenomenon in the
tensor model, which does not seem to be present in the SYK model. The more typical $2k$-particle operators
do not receive any ladder corrections and have quantized large $N$ scaling dimensions $k/2$. We
construct pictorial representations of various singlet operators with low $k$. For larger $k$
we use available techniques to count the operators and show that their number grows as $2^k k!$. As
a consequence, the theory has a Hagedorn phase transition at the temperature which approaches zero
in the large $N$ limit. We also study the large $N$ spectrum of low-lying operators in the Gurau-Witten
model, which has $O(N)^6$ symmetry. We argue that it corresponds to one of the generalized SYK models
constructed by Gross and Rosenhaus. Our paper also includes studies of the invariants in large $N$
tensor integrals with various symmetries.
