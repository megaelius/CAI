Graphene, a two-dimensional (2D) promising emergent photocatalyst consisting of earth-abundant
elements. This study evaluated the potential of graphene oxide (GO) towards photocatalytic degradation
of a novel organic dye, Methylene Blue (MB). In this work, photocatalytic activity of graphene oxide
(GO), graphene oxide (GO) along with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were tested by photodegrading Methylene
Blue (MB) in aqueous solution. The resulted GO nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray powder
diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy and Fourier Transform
Infrared Ray Spectroscopy. The XRD data confirms the sharp peak centered at 2Theta=10.44 degree
corresponding to (002) reflection of GO. Based on our results, it was found that the resulted GO nanoparticles
along with H2O2 achieved ~92% photodecolorization of MB compared to ~63% for H2O2 under natural
sunlight irradiation at pH~7 in 60 min. The influences of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on
the degradation of MB during sunlight/GO process were investigated. Experimental results indicated
that oxygen was a determining parameter for promoting the photocatalytic degradation. The rate
constant of degradation (k1) increased from 0.019 to 0.042 per minute when direct photocatalysis
(MB/GO) and H2O2-assisted photocatalysis (MB/H2O2/GO) were used. Owing to the fact that H2O2 acted
as an electron and hydroxyl radicals scavenger, the addition of H2O2 should in a proper dosage to
enhance the degradation of MB. Moreover, as the initial concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO)
was increased from 2.8 to 3.9 mg/L, the rate constant of degradation (k1) increased from 0.035 to
0.062 per minute. The mechanism of photodegradation and kinetics were also studied for both direct
photocatalysis and H2O2-assisted photocatalysis.
