Determining phase diagrams and phase transitions semi-automatically using machine learning
has received a lot of attention recently, with results in good agreement with more conventional
approaches in most cases. When it comes to more quantitative predictions, such as the identification
of universality class or precise determination of critical points, the task is more challenging.
As an exacting test-bed, we study the Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain in a random external field that is
known to display a transition from a many-body localized to a thermalizing regime, which nature
is not entirely characterized. We introduce different neural network structures and dataset setups
to achieve a finite-size scaling analysis with the least possible physical bias (no assumed knowledge
on the phase transition and directly inputing wave-function coefficients), using state-of-the-art
input data simulating chains of sizes up to L=24. In particular, we use domain adversarial techniques
to ensure that the network learns scale-invariant features. We find a variability of the output
results with respect to network and training parameters, resulting in relatively large uncertainties
on final estimates of critical point and correlation length exponent which tend to be larger than
the values obtained from conventional approaches. We put the emphasis on interpretability throughout
the paper and discuss what the network appears to learn for the various used architectures. Our findings
show that a it quantitative analysis of phase transitions of unknown nature remains a difficult
task with neural networks when using the minimally engineered physical input.
