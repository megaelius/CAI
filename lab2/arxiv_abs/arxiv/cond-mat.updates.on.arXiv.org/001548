The behavior of glass-forming liquids presents complex features of both dynamic and thermodynamic
nature. Some studies indicate the presence of thermodynamic anomalies and crossovers in the dynamic
properties, but their origin and degree of universality is difficult to assess. Moreover, conventional
simulations are barely able to cover the range of temperatures at which these crossovers usually
occur. To address these issues, we simulate the Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones mixture using efficient
protocols that make use of either multi-CPU or multi-GPU parallel tempering and hence allow us to
extend appreciably the range in which thermodynamic and dynamic measurements can be done in equilibrium.
Thanks to the more efficient exploration of configuration space, we can equilibrate the liquid
well below the critical temperature of mode-coupling theory, $T_{MCT} = 0.435$. We find that below
$T=0.4$ the analysis is hampered by partial crystallization of the metastable liquid, which nucleates
extended regions populated by large particles arranged in an fcc structure. By filtering out crystalline
samples, we reveal that the specific heat grows in a regular manner down to about $T=0.37$. Possible
thermodynamic anomalies suggested by previous studies can thus occur only in a region of the phase
diagram where the system is highly metastable. Using the equilibrium configurations obtained
from the parallel tempering simulations, we perform molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations
to probe the equilibrium dynamics in the regime down to $T=0.4$. A temperature-derivative analysis
of the relaxation time and diffusion data allows us to assess different dynamic scenarios around
$T_{MCT}$. Hints of a dynamic crossover come from analysis of the four-point dynamic susceptibility.
Finally, we discuss possible future numerical strategies to clarify the nature of crossover phenomena
in glass-forming liquids.
