Using density functional theory, we investigate the interplay between the stacking order and sequence
of bilayers composed of an Fe and a Rh layer on the Re(0001) and their magnetic properties. We find
that fcc/ffc stacked bilayers are energetically very unfavorable, while all other combinations
of hcp and fcc stacking are energetically close. The magnetic interactions are evaluated by mapping
the DFT total energies onto a spin model, which contains Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and higher-order exchange interactions.
We find that the stacking sequence of the bilayer significantly modifies the magnetic interactions.
As a result, we find a DMI driven cycloidal spin spiral ground state with a period of 11~nm for hcp-Fe/hcp-Rh.
For fcc-Fe/hcp-Rh and hcp-Fe/fcc-Rh, we obtain a ferromagnetic ground state. The spin spiral energy
dispersion of hcp-Fe/hcp-Rh including spin-orbit coupling suggests that isolated skyrmions
can be stabilized in the field-polarized ferromagnetic background at external magnetic fields.
If the Fe layer is sandwiched between the Rh overlayer and the Re(0001) substrate, there is a competition
between the ferromagnetic coupling preferred by the Rh-Fe hybridization and the antiferromagnetic
coupling induced by the Fe-Re hybridization. Due to the Fe/Re interface the DMI can become very large.
For fcc-Rh/hcp-Fe, we obtain a cycloidal spin spiral with a period of 1.7~nm which is induced by frustration
of exchange interactions and further stabilized by the DMI. For hcp-Rh/hcp-Fe, we find a DMI driven
cycloidal spin spiral with a period of 4~nm and locally nearly antiparallel magnetic moments due
to antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor exchange. The higher-order exchange constants can be
significant in the considered films, however, they do not stabilize multi-$Q$ states.
