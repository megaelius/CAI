It is well known that today two main and well studied methods for alignment of liquid crystals has
been used, namely: rubbing and photoalignment technologies, that lead to the change of anisotropic
properties of aligning layers and long-range interaction of the liquid crystal molecules in a mesophase.
In this manuscript, we propose the usage of the nonlinear laser lithography technique, which was
recently presented as a fast, relatively low-cost method for a large area micro- and nanogrooves
fabrication based on laser-induced periodic surface structuring, as a new perspective method
of the alignment of nematic liquid crystals. 920 nm periodic grooves were formed on a Ti layer processed
by means of the nonlinear laser lithography and studied as an aligning layer. Aligning properties
of the periodic structures of Ti layers were examined by using a combined twist LC cell. In addition,
the layer of the microstructured Ti was coated with an oxidianiline-polyimide film with annealing
of the polymer film followed without any further processing. The dependence of the twist angle of
LC cells on a scanning speed and power of laser beam during processing of the Ti layer was studied.
The azimuthal anchoring energy of Ti layers with a periodic microstructure was calculated. The
maximum azimuthal anchoring energy for the microstructured Ti layer was about 4.6*10-6 J/m2, which
is comparable to the photoalignment technology. It was found that after the deposition of a polyimide
film on the periodic microstructured Ti layer, the gain effect of the azimuthal anchoring energy
to ~ 1*10-4 J/m2 is observed. Also, AFM study of aligning surfaces was carried out.
