Quantum chaos is a key feature for understanding the mechanism of relaxation in quantum many-body
systems. Recently, scrambling (i.e., delocalization of quantum information) has attracted much
attention, as it sheds light on yet another aspect of quantum chaos than the conventional one. Scrambling
is characterized by the decay of the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). The scale invariance,
which appears near the quantum critical region in condensed matter physics, is considered to be
important for the fast decay of the OTOC. In this paper, we focus on the one-dimensional spin-1/2
XXZ model, which exhibits quantum criticality in a certain parameter region, and investigate the
relationship between scrambling and the scale invariance. We quantify scrambling by the averaged
OTOC over the Pauli operator basis, which is related to the operator space entanglement entropy
(OSEE). Using the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) method, we numerically calculate
time dependence of the OSEE in the early time region in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the averaged
OTOC decays faster in the gapless region than in the gapped region. In the gapless region, the averaged
OTOC behaves in the same manner regardless of the anisotropy parameter. This result is consistent
with the fact that the low energy excitations of the gapless region belong to the same universality
class as the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the central charge c = 1. Furthermore, we estimate c
by fitting the numerical data of the OSEE with an analytical result of the two-dimensional conformal
field theory, and confirmed that c is close to unity. Thus, our numerical results suggest that the
scale invariance is crucial for the universal behavior of the OTOC.
