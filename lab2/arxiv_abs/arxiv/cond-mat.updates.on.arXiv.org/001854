Shift current---a photocurrent induced by light irradiating noncentrosymmetric materials in
the absence of any bias voltage or built-in electric field---is one of the mechanisms of the so-called
bulk photovoltaic effect. It has been traditionally described as a nonlinear optical response
of periodic solids to continuous wave light using a perturbative formula, which is linear in the
intensity of light and which involves Berry connection describing the shift in the center of mass
position of the Wannier wave function associated with the transition between the valence and conduction
bands. We analyze realistic two-terminal devices, where paradigmatic Rice-Mele model is sandwiched
between two metallic electrodes, using recently developed time-dependent nonequilibrium Green
function algorithms scaling linearly in the number of time steps and capable of treating nonperturbative
effects in the amplitude of external time-dependent fields. This unveils novel features: superballistic
transport, signified by time dependence of the displacement, $\sim t^\nu$ with $\nu > 1$, of the
photoexcited charge carriers from the region where the femtosecond light pulse is applied toward
the electrodes; and photocurrent quadratic in light intensity at subgap frequencies of light due
to two-photon absorption processes that were missed in previous perturbative analyses. Furthermore,
frequency dependence of the DC component of the photocurrent reveals shift currents as a realization
of nonadiabatic quantum charge pumping enabled by breaking of left-right symmetry of the device
structure. This demonstrates that a much wider class of systems, than the usually considered polar
noncentrosymmetric bulk materials, can be exploited to generate nonzero DC component of photocurrent
in response to unpolarized light and optimize shift-current-based solar cells and optoelectronic
devices.
