We study the solution of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for the stochastic growth of an
interface of height $h(x,t)$ on the positive half line, equivalently the free energy of the continuum
directed polymer in a half space with a wall at $x=0$. The boundary condition $\partial_x h(x,t)|_{x=0}=A$
corresponds to an attractive wall for $A<0$, and leads to the binding of the polymer to the wall below
the critical value $A=-1/2$. Here we choose the initial condition $h(x,0)$ to be a Brownian motion
in $x>0$ with drift $-(B+1/2)$. When $A+B \to -1$, the solution is stationary, i.e. $h(\cdot,t)$
remains at all times a Brownian motion with the same drift, up to a global height shift $h(0,t)$. We
show that the distribution of this height shift is invariant under the exchange of parameters $A$
and $B$. For any $A,B > - 1/2$, we provide an exact formula characterizing the distribution of $h(0,t)$
at any time $t$, using two methods: the replica Bethe ansatz and a discretization called the log-gamma
polymer, for which moment formulae were obtained. We analyze its large time asymptotics for various
ranges of parameters $A,B$. In particular, when $(A,B) \to (-1/2,-1/2)$, the critical stationary
case, the fluctuations of the interface are governed by a universal distribution that we express
in terms of a simple Fredholm determinant, equivalently in terms of the Painlev\'e II transcendent,
akin to the Baik-Rains distribution arising in stationary growth on the full-line. This provides
an analog for the KPZ equation, of some of the results recently obtained by Betea-Ferrari-Occelli
in the context of stationary half-space last-passage-percolation. From universality, we expect
that limiting distributions found in both models can be shown to coincide.
