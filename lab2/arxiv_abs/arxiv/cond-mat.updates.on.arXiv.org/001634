The interplay between superconductivity and structural phase transition has attracted enormous
interests in recent years. For example, in Fe-pnictide high temperature superconductors, quantum
fluctuations in association with structural phase transition have been proposed to lead to many
novel physical properties and even the superconductivity itself. Here we report a finding that
the quasi-skutterudite superconductors (Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$)$_{3}$Ir$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$ ($x$
= 0, 0.5, 1) and Ca$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$ show some unusual properties similar to the Fe-pnictides,
through $^{119}$Sn nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. In (Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$)$_{3}$Ir$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$,
the NMR linewidth increases below a temperature $T^*$ that is higher than the structural phase transition
temperature $T_{\rm s}$. The spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) divided by temperature ($T$),
$1/T_1T$, and the Knight shift $K$ increase with decreasing $T$ down to $T^*$, but start to decrease
below $T^*$ and followed by more distinct changes at $T_{\rm s}$. In contrast, none of the anomalies
was observed in Ca$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$ that does not undergo a structural phase transition.
The precursory phenomenon above structural phase transition resembles that occurs in Fe-pnictides.
In the superconducting state of Ca$_{3}$Ir$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$, $1/T_{1}$ decays as ${\rm exp}(-\Delta/k_{\rm
B}T)$ with a large gap $\Delta = 2.21 k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$, yet without a Hebel-Slichter coherence
peak, which indicate strong-coupling superconductivity. Our results provide new insight into
the relationship between superconductivity and the electronic-structure change associated
with structural phase transition.
