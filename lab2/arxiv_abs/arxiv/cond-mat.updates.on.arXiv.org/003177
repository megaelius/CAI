Brownian motion is widely used as a paradigmatic model of diffusion in equilibrium media throughout
the physical, chemical, and biological sciences. However, many real world systems, particularly
biological ones, are intrinsically out-of-equilibrium due to the energy-dissipating active
processes underlying their mechanical and dynamical features. The diffusion process followed
by a passive tracer in prototypical active media such as suspensions of active colloids or swimming
microorganisms indeed differs significantly from Brownian motion, manifest in a greatly enhanced
diffusion coefficient, non-Gaussian tails of the displacement statistics, and crossover phenomena
from non-Gaussian to Gaussian scaling. While such characteristic features have been extensively
observed in experiments, there is so far no comprehensive theory explaining how they emerge from
the microscopic active dynamics. Here we present a theoretical framework of the enhanced tracer
diffusion in an active medium from its microscopic dynamics by coarse-graining the hydrodynamic
interactions between the tracer and the active particles as a stochastic process. The tracer is
shown to follow a non-Markovian coloured Poisson process that accounts quantitatively for all
empirical observations. The theory predicts in particular a long-lived L\'evy flight regime of
the tracer motion with a non-monotonic crossover between two different power-law exponents. The
duration of this regime can be tuned by the swimmer density, thus suggesting that the optimal foraging
strategy of swimming microorganisms might crucially depend on the density in order to exploit the
L\'evy flights of nutrients. Our framework provides the first validation of the celebrated L\'evy
flight model from a physical microscopic dynamics.
