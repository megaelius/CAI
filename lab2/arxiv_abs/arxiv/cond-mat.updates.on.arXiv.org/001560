The nature of edge state transport in quantum Hall systems has been studied intensely ever since
Halperin [1] noted its importance for the quantization of the Hall conductance. Since then, there
have been many developments in the study of edge states in the quantum Hall effect, including the
prediction of multiple counter-propagating modes in the fractional quantum Hall regime, the prediction
of edge mode renormalization due to disorder, and studies of how the sample confining potential
affects the edge state structure (edge reconstruction), among others. In this paper, we study edge
transport for the $\nu_{\text{bulk}}=2/3$ edge in the disordered, fully incoherent transport
regime. To do so, we use a hydrodynamic approximation for the calculation of voltage and temperature
profiles along the edge of the sample. Within this formalism, we study two different bare mode structures
with tunneling: the original edge structure predicted by Wen [2] and MacDonald [3], and the more
complicated edge structure proposed by Meir [4], whose renormalization and transport characteristics
were discussed by Wang, Meir and Gefen (WMG) [5]. We find that in the fully incoherent regime, the
topological characteristics of transport (quantized electrical and heat conductance) are intact,
with finite size corrections which are determined by the extent of equilibration. In particular,
our calculation of conductance for the WMG model in a double QPC geometry reproduce conductance
results of a recent experiment by R. Sabo, et al. [17], which are inconsistent with the model of MacDonald.
Our results can be explained in the charge/neutral mode picture, with incoherent analogues of the
renormalization fixed points of Ref. [5]. Additionally, we find diffusive $(\sim1/L)$ conductivity
corrections to the heat conductance in the fully incoherent regime for both models of the edge.
