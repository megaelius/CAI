Singlet fission is a spin-allowed exciton multiplication process in organic semiconductors that
converts one spin-singlet exciton to two triplet excitons. It offers the potential to enhance solar
energy conversion by circumventing the Shockley-Queisser limit on efficiency. Recently, the
mechanism of the primary singlet fission process in pentacene and its derivatives have been extensively
investigated, however, the nature of the primary ultrafast process in singlet fission is still
a matter of debate. Here, we study the singlet fission process in a pentacene film by employing a combination
of transient-grating (TG) and two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy complemented by
quantum chemical and nonadiabatic dynamics calculations. The high sensitivity of heterodyne
detected TG spectroscopy enabled us to capture the vibrational coherence and to show that it mediates
the transition from the singlet excited electronic state to the triplet-pair state. This coherent
process is further examined by 2D electronic spectroscopy. Detailed analysis of the experimental
data reveals that significant vibronic couplings of a few key modes in the low- and high-frequency
region connect the excited singlet and triplet-pair states. Based on quantum chemical calculations,
we identify these key intermolecular rocking modes along the longitudinal molecular axis between
the pentacene molecules. They play the essential role of an electronic bridge between the singlet
and triplet-pair states. Along with high-frequency local vibrations acting as tuning modes, these
rocking motions drive the ultrafast dynamics at the multidimensional conical intersection in
the singlet fission process.
