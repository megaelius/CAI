The van der Waals (vdW) theory of fluids is the first and simplest theory that takes into account interactions
between the particles of a system that result in a phase transition versus temperature. Combined
with Maxwell's construction, this mean-field theory predicts the conditions for equilibrium
coexistence between the gas and liquid phases and the first-order transition between them. However,
important properties of the vdW fluid have not been systematically investigated. Here we report
a comprehensive study of these properties. Ambiguities about the physical interpretation of the
Boyle temperature and the influence of the vdW molecular interactions on the pressure of the vdW
gas are resolved. Thermodynamic variables and properties are formulated in reduced units that
allow all properties to be expressed as laws of corresponding states that apply to all vdW fluids.
Lekner's parametric solution for the vdW gas-liquid coexistence curve in the pressure-temperature
plane and related thermodynamic properties [Am. J. Phys. 50, 161 (1982)] is explained and significantly
extended. Hysteresis in the first-order transition temperature on heating and cooling is examined
and the maximum degrees of superheating and supercooling determined. The latent heat of vaporization
and the entropy change on crossing the coexistence curve are investigated. The temperature dependences
of the isothermal compressibility, thermal expansion coefficient and heat capacity at constant
pressure for a range of pressures above, at and below the critical pressure are systematically studied
from numerical calculations including their critical behaviors and their discontinuities on
crossing the coexistence curve. Joule-Thomson expansion of the vdW gas is investigated in detail
and the pressure and temperature conditions for liquifying a vdW gas on passing through the throttle
are determined.
