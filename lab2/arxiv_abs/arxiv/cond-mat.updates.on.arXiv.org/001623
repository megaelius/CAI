We introduce a multiscale framework which combines time-dependent nonequilibrium Green function
(TD-NEGF) algorithms, scaling linearly in the number of time steps and describing quantum-mechanically
conduction electrons in the presence of time-dependent fields of arbitrary strength or frequency,
with classical time evolution of local magnetic moments described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
(LLG) equation. Our TD-NEGF+LLG framework can be applied to a variety of problems where current-driven
spin torque induces dynamics of magnetic moments as the key resource for next generation spintronics.
Previous approaches to such nonequilibrium many-body system have neglected noncommutativity
of a quantum Hamiltonian of conduction electrons at different times and, therefore, the impact
of time-dependent magnetic moments on electrons which induce pumping of spin and charge currents
that, in turn, can self-consistently affect the dynamics of magnetic moments themselves. Using
magnetic domain wall (DW) as an example, we predict that its motion will pump time-dependent spin
and charge currents (on the top of unpolarized DC charge current injected through normal metal leads
to drive the DW motion), where the latter can be viewed as a realization of nonadiabatic quantum charge
pumping due to time-dependence of the Hamiltonian and left-right symmetry breaking of the two-terminal
device structure. The conversion of AC components of spin current, whose amplitude increases (decreases)
as the DW approaches (distances from) the normal metal lead, into AC voltage via the inverse spin
Hall effect offers a tool to precisely track the DW position along magnetic nanowire. We also quantify
the DW transient inertial displacement due to its acceleration and deceleration by pulse current
and the entailed spin and charge pumping.
