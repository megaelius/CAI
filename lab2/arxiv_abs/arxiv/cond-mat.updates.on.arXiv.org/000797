The study of photonic crystals, artificial materials whose dielectric properties can be tailored
according to the stacking of its constituents, remains an attractive research area. In this article
we have employed a transfer matrix treatment to study the propagation of light waves in Fibonacci
quasiperiodic dieletric multilayers with graphene embedded. We calculated their dispersion
and transmission spectra in order to investigate the effects of the graphene monolayers and quasiperiodic
disorder on the system physical behavior. The quasiperiodic dieletric multilayer is composed
of two building blocks, silicon dioxide (building block A = SiO2) and titanium dioxide (building
block B = TiO2). Our numerical results show that the presence of graphene monolayers reduces the
transmissivity on the whole range of frequency and induces a transmission gap in the low frequency
region. Regarding the polarization of the light wave, we found that the transmission coefficient
is higher for the transverse magnetic (TM) case than for the transverse electric (TE) one. We also
conclude from our numerical results that the graphene induced photonic bandgaps (GIPBGs) do not
depend on the polarization (TE or TM) of the light wave nor on the Fibonacci generation index n. Moreover,
the GIPBGs are omnidirectional photonic band gaps, therefore light cannot propagate in this structures
for frequencies lower than a certain value, whatever the incidence angle. Finally, a plot of the
transmission spectra versus chemical potential shows that one can, in principle, adjust the width
of the photonic band gap by tuning the chemical potential via a gate voltage.
