The renormalization of the electrons in the bilayer cuprate superconductors is investigated within
the kinetic-energy driven superconductivity. It is shown that the quasiparticle excitation spectrum
is split into its bonding and antibonding components due to the presence of the bilayer coupling,
with each component that is independent. In the underdoped regime, two electron Fermi surface (EFS)
contours deriving from the bonding and antibonding layers are reconstructed to form the bonding
and antibonding Fermi pockets around the nodal region. However, the bonding and antibonding Fermi
pockets are almost degenerate, leading to that only single Fermi pocket can be observed in each quarter
of the Brillouin zone. In particular, the strongest intensity points on the bonding (antibonding)
Fermi arcs reach exactly the tips of the bonding (antibonding) Fermi arcs, which in this case coincide
with the bonding (antibonding) hot spots. These hot spots connected by the scattering wave vectors
${\bf q}_i$ construct an octet scattering model, and then the enhancement of the quasiparticle
scattering processes with the wave vectors ${\bf q}_i$ is confirmed via the result of the autocorrelation
of the ARPES spectral intensities. Moreover, the peak-dip-hump (PDH) structure developed in each
component along the corresponding EFS sheet is related with the peak structure in the quasiparticle
scattering rate except for at the hot spots, where the PDH structure is caused by the bilayer coupling.
Although the kink in the dispersion is present all around the EFS sheet, when the momentum moves away
from the node to the antinode, the kink energy smoothly decreases, while the dispersion kink becomes
more pronounced, and in particular, near the antinodal cut, develops into a break separating of
the fasting dispersing high-energy part of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum from the slower
dispersing low-energy part.
