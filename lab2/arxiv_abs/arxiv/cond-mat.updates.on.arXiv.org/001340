The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) has recently been reported to emerge in magnetically-doped
topological insulators. Although its general phenomenology is well established, the microscopic
origin is far from being properly understood and controlled. Here we report on a detailed and systematic
investigation of transition-metal (TM)-doped Sb$_2$Te$_3$. By combining density functional
theory (DFT) calculations with complementary experimental techniques, i.e., scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM), resonant photoemission (resPES), and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD),
we provide a complete spectroscopic characterization of both electronic and magnetic properties.
Our results reveal that the TM dopants not only affect the magnetic state of the host material, but
also significantly alter the electronic structure by generating impurity-derived energy bands.
Our findings demonstrate the existence of a delicate interplay between electronic and magnetic
properties in TM-doped TIs. In particular, we find that the fate of the topological surface states
critically depends on the specific character of the TM impurity: while V- and Fe-doped Sb$_2$Te$_3$
display resonant impurity states in the vicinity of the Dirac point, Cr and Mn impurities leave the
energy gap unaffected. The single-ion magnetic anisotropy energy and easy axis, which control
the magnetic gap opening and its stability, are also found to be strongly TM impurity-dependent
and can vary from in-plane to out-of-plane depending on the impurity and its distance from the surface.
Overall, our results provide general guidelines for the realization of a robust QAHE in TM-doped
Sb$_2$Te$_3$ in the ferromagnetic state.
