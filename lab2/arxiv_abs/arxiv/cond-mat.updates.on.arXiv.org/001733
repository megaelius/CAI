Topological phases of matter arise in distinct fermionic and bosonic flavors. The fundamental
differences between them are encapsulated in their rotational symmetries - the spin. Although
spin quantization is routinely encountered in fermionic topological edge states, analogous quantization
for bosons has proven elusive. To this end, we develop the complete electromagnetic continuum theory
characterizing 2+1D topological bosons, taking into account their intrinsic spin and orbital
angular momentum degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that spatiotemporal dispersion (momentum
and frequency dependence of linear response) captures the matter-mediated interactions between
bosons and is a necessary ingredient for topological phases. We prove that the bulk topology of these
2+1D phases is manifested in transverse spin-1 quantization of the photon. From this revelation,
we predict two unique bosonic phases - one with even parity $C=\pm 2$ and one with odd $C=\pm 1$. To
understand the even parity phase $C=\pm 2$, we introduce an exactly solvable model utilizing non-local
optical Hall conductivity and reveal a single gapless photon at the edge. This unidirectional photon
is spin-1 helically quantized, immune to backscattering, defects, and exists at the boundary of
any interface - even vacuum. The contrasting phenomena of transverse quantization in the bulk,
but longitudinal (helical) quantization on the edge is addressed as the quantum gyrotropic effect
(QGE). We also validate our bosonic Maxwell theory by direct comparison with the supersymmetric
Dirac theory of fermions. To accelerate the discovery of such bosonic phases, we suggest two new
probes of topological matter with broken time-reversal symmetry: momentum-resolved electron
energy loss spectroscopy and cold atom near-field measurement of non-local optical Hall conductivity.
