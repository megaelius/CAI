at cryogenic temperatures we study both the spectral diffusion as well as the diffusion of the decay
rates of the fluorescence emission of core/shell CdSe/CdS dot/rod nanoparticles. A special analysis
of the measurements allow for a correlation of data for single neutral excitons only, undisturbed
by the possible emission of other excitonic complexes. We find a nearly linear dependency of the
fluorescence decay rate on the emission energy. The experimental data is compared to self-consistent
model calculations within the effective-mass approximation, in which migrating point charges
set onto the surface of the nanoparticles have been assumed to cause the temporal changes of optical
properties. These calculations reveal a nearly linear relationship between the squared electron-hole
wave function overlap, which is linked to the experimentally determined fluorescence rate, and
the exciton emission energy. Within our model single migrating surface charges are not sufficient
to fully explain the measured rather broad ranges of emission rates and energies, while two -- and
in particular negative -- surface charges close to the core of the DR induce large enough shifts.
Importantly, for our nanoparticle system, the surface charges more strongly affect the hole wave
function than the electron wave function and both wave functions are still localized within the
dot-like core of the nanoparticle, showing that the type-I character of the band alignment between
core and shell is preserved.
