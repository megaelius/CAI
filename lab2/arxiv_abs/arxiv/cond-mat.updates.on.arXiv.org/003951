The thermalization of non-equilibrium charge carriers is at the heart of thermoelectric energy
conversion. In nanoscale systems, the equilibration length can be on the order of the system size,
leading to a situation where thermoelectric effects need to be considered as spatially distributed,
rather than localized at junctions. The energy exchange between charge carriers and phonons is
of fundamental scientific and technological interest, but their assessment poses significant
experimental challenges. We addressed these challenges by imaging the temperature change induced
by Peltier effects in crystal phase engineered InAs nanowire (NW) devices. Using high-resolution
scanning thermal microscopy (SThM), we have studied current-carrying InAs NWs, which feature
a barrier segment of wurtzite (WZ) of varying length in a NW of otherwise zincblende (ZB) crystal
phase. The energy barrier acts as a filter for electron transport around the Fermi energy, giving
rise to a thermoelectric effect. We find that thermalization through electron-phonon heat exchange
extends over the entire device. We analyze the temperature profile along a nanowire by comparing
it to spatially dependent heat diffusion and electron thermalization models. We are able to extract
the governing properties of the system, including the electron thermalization length of $223 \pm
9$\,nm, Peltier coefficient and Seebeck coefficient introduced by the barrier of $39 \pm 7$\,mV
and $89 \pm 21$\,$\mu$V/K, respectively, and a thermal conductivity along the wire axis of $8.9
\pm 0.5$\,W/m/K. Finally, we compare two ways to extract the elusive thermal boundary conductance
between NW and underlying substrate.
