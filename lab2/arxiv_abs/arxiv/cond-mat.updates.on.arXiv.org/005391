We develop a stochastic theory that treats time-dependent exciton-exciton $s$-wave scattering
and that accounts for dynamic Coulomb screening, which we describe within a mean-field limit. With
this theory, we model excitation-induced dephasing effects on time-resolved two-dimensional
coherent optical lineshapes and we identify a number of features that can be attributed to the many-body
dynamics occurring in the background of the exciton, including dynamic line narrowing, mixing
of real and imaginary spectral components, and multi-quantum states. We test the model by means
of multidimensional coherent spectroscopy on a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor
that hosts tightly bound excitons and biexcitons that feature strong polaronic character. We find
that the exciton nonlinear coherent lineshape reflects many-body correlations that give rise
to excitation-induced dephasing. Furthermore, we observe that the exciton lineshape evolves
with population time over time windows in which the population itself is static, in a manner that
reveals the evolution of the multi-exciton many-body couplings. Specifically, the dephasing
dynamics slow down with time, at a rate that is governed by the strength of exciton many-body interactions
and on the dynamic Coulomb screening potential. The real part of the coherent optical lineshape
displays strong dispersive character at zero time, which transforms to an absorptive lineshape
on the dissipation timescale of excitation-induced dephasing effects, while the imaginary part
displays converse behavior. Our microscopic theoretical approach is sufficiently flexible to
allow for a wide exploration of how system-bath dynamics contribute to linear and non-linear time-resolved
spectral behavior.
