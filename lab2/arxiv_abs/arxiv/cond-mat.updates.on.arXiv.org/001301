We review recent progress in understanding the different spatial broken symmetries that occur
in the normal states of the family of charge-transfer solids (CTS) that exhibit superconductivity
(SC), and discuss how this knowledge gives insight to the mechanism of the unconventional SC in these
systems. We show that a unified theory of the diverse broken symmetry states necessarily requires
explicit incorporation of strong electron-electron interactions and lattice discreteness,
and most importantly, the correct bandfilling of one-quarter. Uniquely in the quarter-filled
band, there is a very strong tendency to form nearest neighbor spin-singlets, in both one and two
dimensions. The tendency to spin-singlets, a quantum effect, drives a commensurate charge-order
in the correlated quarter-filled band. This charge-ordered spin-singlet, which we label as a paired-electron
crystal (PEC), is different from and competes with both the antiferromagnetic state and the Wigner
crystal of single electrons. Further, unlike these classical broken symmetries, the PEC is characterized
by a spin gap. The tendency to the PEC in two dimensions is enhanced by lattice frustration. Following
this characterization of the spatial broken symmetries, we critically reexamine spin-fluctuation
and resonating valence bond theories of frustration-driven SC within half-filled band Hubbard
and Hubbard-Heisenberg Hamiltonians for the superconducting CTS. We develop a valence-bond theory
of SC within which the superconducting state is reached by the destabilization of the PEC by additional
pressure-induced lattice frustration that makes the spin-singlets mobile. Our proposed mechanism
for SC is the same for CTS in which the proximate semiconducting state is antiferromagnetic instead
of charge-ordered, with the only difference that SC in the former is generated via a fluctuating
spin-singlet state as opposed to static PEC.
