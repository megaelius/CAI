Graphene p-n junctions offer a potentially powerful approach towards controlling electron trajectories
via collimation and focusing in ballistic solid-state devices. The ability of p-n junctions to
control electron trajectories depends crucially on the doping profile and roughness of the junction.
Here, we use four-probe scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) to characterize
two state-of-the-art graphene p-n junction geometries at the atomic scale, one with CMOS polySi
gates and another with naturally cleaved graphite gates. Using spectroscopic imaging, we characterize
the local doping profile across and along the p-n junctions. We find that realistic junctions exhibit
non-ideality both in their geometry as well as in the doping profile across the junction. We show
that the geometry of the junction can be improved by using the cleaved edge of van der Waals metals
such as graphite to define the junction. We quantify the geometric roughness and doping profiles
of junctions experimentally and use these parameters in Nonequilibrium Green's Function based
simulations of focusing and collimation in these realistic junctions. We find that for realizing
Veselago focusing, it is crucial to minimize lateral interface roughness which only natural graphite
gates achieve, and to reduce junction width, in which both devices under investigation underperform.
We also find that carrier collimation is currently limited by the non-linearity of the doping profile
across the junction. Our work provides benchmarks of the current graphene p-n junction quality
and provides guidance for future improvements.
