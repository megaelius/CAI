The ballistic motion of electrons in graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) promises
exciting opportunities for electron-optics devices. A narrow electron beam is desired, with both
the mean free path and coherence length exceeding the device size. One can form a collimating contact
in graphene by adding zigzag contacts on either side of the electron emitter that absorb stray electrons
to form a collimated electron beam [23]. Here we provide images of electron flow from a collimating
contact that directly show the width and shape of the electron beam, obtained using a Scanning Gate
Microscope (SGM) cooled to 4.2 K. The device is a hBN-encapsulated graphene hall bar with narrow
side contacts on either side of the channel that have an electron emitter at the end and absorbing
zig-zag contacts at both side. To form an image of electron flow, the SGM tip is raster scanned at a
constant height above the sample surface while the transmission to a receiving contact on opposite
sides of the channel is measured. By displaying the change {\Delta}T vs. tip position, an image of
ballistic flow is obtained. The angular width of the electron beam leaving the collimating contact
is found by applying a perpendicular magnetic field B that bends electron paths into cyclotron orbits.
SGM images reveal that electron flow from a collimating contact disappears quickly at B = 0.05T while
the flow from a non-collimating contact persists up to B = 0.19 T. Ray tracing simulations agree well
with the experimental images over a range of B and electron density n. By fitting the half-width at
half-max (HWHM) of the magnitude of electron flow in the experimental SGM images, we find a narrow
half angular width {\Delta}{\theta} = 9.2{\deg} for the electron flow from the collimating contact,
compared with a wide flow {\Delta}{\theta} = 54{\deg} from the non-collimating contact.
