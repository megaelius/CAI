In their original formulation of superconductivity, the London brothers predicted more than eighty
years ago the exponential suppression of an electrostatic field inside a superconductor over the
so-called London penetration depth, $\lambda_L$, in analogy to the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect.
$\lambda_L$ ranges from a few tens to a few hundreds of nanometers for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) superconductors. A superconducting body smaller than $\lambda_L$ is thereby expected to
be entirely penetrated and, in principle, affected by electrostatic fields. Yet, the lack of any
proof has led to the general belief that superconductors behave like normal metals expelling electrostatic
fields over the sub-atomic Thomas-Fermi screening length ($\sim 0.5${\AA}). Despite a few experiments
suggesting hints of penetration, no clue has been provided so far on the possibility to manipulate
conventional superconductors via field effect. Here we report the evidence of electrostatic field
penetration leading to full field-effect control of the supercurrent in $all$-metallic transistors
made of a BCS superconductor. At low temperature, our titanium field-effect transistors (FETs)
show a monotonic decay of the critical current under increasing electrostatic field up to total
quenching for gate voltage values as large as $\pm 40$V. The field effect persists up to $\sim 85\%$
of the critical temperature ($\sim 0.41$K), and in the presence of sizable magnetic fields. A similar
behavior, though less pronounced, was observed in aluminum FETs. An $ad\,hoc$ phenomenological
theory based on the Ginzburg-Landau formalism accounts for our observations and proves the truthfulness
of London's original hypothesis. Besides shedding light on a fundamental milestone in physics,
our results represent a groundbreaking asset for the realization of an all-metallic superconducting
field-effect electronics.
