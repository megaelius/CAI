Phase diagrams are an invaluable tool for material synthesis and provide information on the phases
of the material at any given thermodynamic condition. Conventional phase diagram generation involves
experimentation to provide an initial estimate of thermodynamically accessible phases, followed
by use of phenomenological models to interpolate between the available experimental data points
and extrapolate to inaccessible regions. Such an approach, combined with first-principles calculations
and data-mining techniques, has led to exhaustive thermodynamic databases albeit at distinct
thermodynamic equilibria. In contrast, materials during their synthesis, operation, or processing,
may not reach their thermodynamic equilibrium state but, instead, remain trapped in a local free
energy minimum, that may exhibit desirable properties. Mapping these metastable phases and their
thermodynamic behavior is highly desirable but currently lacking. Here, we introduce an automated
workflow that integrates first principles physics and atomistic simulations with machine learning
(ML), and high-performance computing to allow rapid exploration of the metastable phases of a given
elemental composition. Using a representative material, carbon, with a vast number of metastable
phases without parent in equilibrium, we demonstrate automatic mapping of hundreds of metastable
states ranging from near equilibrium to those far-from-equilibrium. Moreover, we incorporate
the free energy calculations into a neural-network-based learning of the equations of state that
allows for construction of metastable phase diagrams. High temperature high pressure experiments
using a diamond anvil cell on graphite sample coupled with high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy are used to validate our metastable phase predictions. Our introduced approach is general
and broadly applicable to single and multi-component systems.
