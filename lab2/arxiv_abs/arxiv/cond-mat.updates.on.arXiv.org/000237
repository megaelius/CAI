We probe the real space electronic response to a local magnetic impurity in isovalent and heterovalent
doped BaFe2As2 (122) using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The local moments carried by Mn impurities
doped into Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2(Co-122) and BaFe(As1-xPx)2(P-122) at optimal doping induce a spin
polarization in the vicinity of the impurity. The amplitude, shape and extension of this polarisation
is given by the real part of the susceptibility chi'(r) of FeAs layers, and is consequently related
to the nature and strength of the electronic correlations present in the system. We study this polarisation
using 75As NMR in Co-122 and both 75As and 31P NMR in P-122. The NMR spectra of Mn-doped materials is
made of two essential features. First is a satellite line associated with nuclei located as nearest
neighbor of Mn impurities. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the shift of this satellite
line shows that Mn local moments behave as isolated Curie moments. The second feature is a temperature
dependent broadening of the central line. We show that the broadening of the central line follows
the susceptibility of Mn local moments, as expected from typical RKKY-like interactions. This
demonstrates that the susceptibility chi'(r) of FeAs layers does not make significant contribution
to the temperature dependent broadening of the central line. chi'(r) is consequently only weakly
temperature dependent in optimally doped Co-122 and P-122. This behaviour is in contrast with that
of strongly correlated materials such as underdoped cuprate high-Tc superconductors where the
central line broadens faster than the impurity susceptibility grows, because of the development
of strong magnetic correlations when T is lowered. Moreover, the FeAs layer susceptibility is found
quantitatively similar in both heterovalent doped and isolvalent doped BaFe2As2.
