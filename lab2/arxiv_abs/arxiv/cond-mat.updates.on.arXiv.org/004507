The existence or not of Landau poles is one of the oldest open questions in non-asymptotic quantum
field theories. We investigate the Landau pole issue in two condensed matter systems whose long-wavelength
physics is described by appropriate quantum field theories: the critical quantum magnet and Dirac
fermions in graphene with long-range Coulomb interactions. The critical quantum magnet provides
a classic example of a quantum phase transition, and it is well described by the $\phi^4$ theory.
We find that the irrelevant but symmetry-allowed couplings, such as the $\phi^6$ potential, can
significantly change the fate of the Landau pole in the $\phi^4$ theory. We obtain the coupled beta
functions of a $\phi^4 + \phi^6$ potential at both small and large orders. Already from the 1-loop
calculation, the Landau pole is replaced by an ultraviolet fixed point. A Lipatov analysis at large
orders reveals that the inclusion of a $\phi^6$ term also has important repercussions for the high-order
expansion of the beta functions. We also investigate the role of the Landau pole in 2+1 dimensional
Dirac fermions with Coulomb interactions, e.g., graphene. Both the weak-coupling perturbation
theory up to 2 loops and a low-order large-N calculation show the absence of a Landau pole. Furthermore,
we calculate the asymptotic expansion coefficients of the beta function. We find that the asymptotic
coefficient is bounded by that of a $\phi^4$ theory, so graphene is free from Landau poles if the $\phi^4$
theory does not manifest a Landau pole. We briefly discuss possible experiments that could potentially
probe the existence of a Landau pole in these systems. Studying Landau poles in suitable condensed
matter systems is of considerable fundamental importance since the relevant Landau pole energy
scales in particle physics, whether it is quantum electrodynamics or Higgs physics, are completely
unattainable.
