The structural and magnetic properties of Y1-xErxFe2 intermetallic compounds and their hydrides
and deuterides Y1-xErxFe2H(D)4.2 have been investigated using X-ray diffraction and magnetic
measurements under static and pulsed magnetic field up to 60 T. The intermetallics crystallize
in the C15 cubic structure , whereas corresponding hydrides and deuterides crystallize in a monoclinic
structure. All compounds display a linear decrease of the unit cell volume versus Er concentration;
the hydrides have a 0.8% larger cell volume compared to the deuterides with same Er content. They
are ferrimagnetic at low field and temperature with a compensation point at x = 0.33 for the intermetallics
and x = 0.57 for the hydrides and deuterides. A sharp first order ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic
(FM-AFM) transition is observed upon heating at TFM-AFM for both hydrides and deuterides. These
compounds show two different types of field induced transitions, which have different physical
origin. At low temperature (T < 50 K), a forced ferri-ferromagnetic metamagnetic transition with
Btrans1 = 8 T, related to the change of the Er moments orientation from antiparallel to parallel Fe
moment, is observed. Btrans1 is not sensitive to Er concentration, temperature and isotope effect.
A second metamagnetic transition resulting from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic state is
also observed. The transition field Btrans2 increases linearly versus temperature and relates
to the itinerant electron metamagnetic behavior of the Fe sublattice. An onset temperature TM0
is obtained by extrapolating TFM-AFM (B) at zero field. TM0 decreases linearly versus the Er content
and is 45(5) K higher for the hydrides compared to the corresponding deuteride. The evolution of
TM0 versus cell volume shows that it cannot be attributed exclusively to a pure volume effect and
that electronic effects should also be considered.
