Different peak trends of tiny grains carbon film have been observed under the investigations of
Raman spectroscopy and energy loss spectroscopy. Carbon films known in nanocrystalline and ultra-nanocrystalline
diamond films are synthesized by employing microwave-based vapor deposition system. Carbon atoms
exhibit several state behaviors depending on the incurred positions of their electrons. Different
morphology of tiny grains under different chamber pressure is related to different rate of arriving
typical energies at/near substrate surface. Those tiny grains of carbon film which evolved in graphitic
state atoms are converted to structure of smooth elements where elongation of atoms of one-dimensional
arrays is as per exerting surface format forces along opposite poles from their centers. Such tiny
grains in the film are the cause of v1 peak under the investigation of the Raman spectrum because of
the enhanced propagation of input laser signals through channelized inter-state electron gaps
of elongated graphitic state atoms. Those tiny grains of carbon film which evolved in fullerene
state are the cause of v2 peak. The tiny grains related to v1 peak possess a low intensity as compared
to the ones which comprised atoms having state behaviors known in their exceptional hardness. Tiny
grains representing v1 peak in the Raman spectrum are also the cause of field emission characteristic
of a carbon film. Different peak recordings were made for the Raman at defined positions indicating
a different state of carbon atoms for a different phase of deposited tiny grains, which is in line
to their energy loss spectroscopy.
