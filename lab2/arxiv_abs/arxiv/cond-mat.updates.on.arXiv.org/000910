In the first two papers of this series, we characterized the structure of maximally random jammed
(MRJ) sphere packings across length scales, including a variety of different correlation functions,
spectral functions, hole probabilities and local density fluctuations. From the remarkable structural
features of the MRJ packings, especially its disordered hyperuniformity, exceptional physical
properties can be expected. In the present paper, we employ structural descriptors from the second
paper of this series to estimate effective transport and electromagnetic properties via rigorous
bounds, exact expansions and accurate analytical approximation formulas. We estimate the mean
survival time and principal relaxation time associated with Brownian motion, fluid permeability,
and the effective complex dielectric constant for the propagation of electromagnetic waves in
the long-wavelength limit. We study the interfacial bounds as well as universal scaling laws for
the mean survival time and the fluid permeability. For the propagation of electromagnetic waves
in the long-wavelength limit, we show that a dispersion of dielectric MRJ spheres within a matrix
of another dielectric material forms, to a very good approximation, a dissipationless disordered
and isotropic two-phase medium for any phase dielectric contrast ratio. We compare the effective
properties of the MRJ sphere packings to those of overlapping and equilibrium spheres as well as
lattice packings. The analytic bounds predict qualitative trends between these structures, providing
guidance to more time-consuming simulations and experiments. Moreover, we generalize results
to micro- and macroscopically anisotropic packings of spheroids with tensorial effective properties.
Our prediction of physical properties of MRJ sphere packings motivates new experiments to design
materials with unique bulk properties resulting from hyperuniformity.
