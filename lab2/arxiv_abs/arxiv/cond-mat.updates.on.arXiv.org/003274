The chiral magnetic effect is a one of the exotic bulk transport properties of the Weyl semimetals.
Because of the Nielsen-Ninomiya "no-go theorem", the total chiral magnetic current is absent in
the equilibrium state. One of the mechanisms for generating this current is the chiral anomaly.
This phenomenon is the anomalous nonconservation of chiral charge for massless relativistic particles.
It can be realized by parallel magnetic and electric fields, and it leads to such new transport phenomenon
as the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. Using a simple theory (we consider both linearized
and lattice model), we have shown, that in Weyl metals with tilted dispersion another mechanism
of the chiral magnetic current is possible. It is not associated with the chiral anomaly. The new
transport mechanism is based on the relativistic effect of electric field on Landau levels. This
effect is that an electric field changes the distance between the Landau levels, and also changes
the effective velocity along magnetic field. At presence of a tilt in the spectrum, this velocity
renormalization is differ for different Weyl points. This leads to a non-zero resulting drift velocity.
As a consequence, an electrical current arises along the magnetic field. The induced by this mechanism
the electric current is proportional to the pseudoscalar product of the fields and directed along
the magnetic field, that differs it from the Hall current. At the same time, the conductivity corresponding
to this transport mechanism does not depend on the scattering time like the Hall conductivity. Thus,
we have proposed a new anomalous transport mechanism in the Weyl semimetal, which is not associated
with the chiral anomaly.
