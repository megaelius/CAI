In addition to the self-governing properties, tiny-sized particles of metallic colloids are the
building blocks of large-sized particles. Thus, their study has been the subject of many studies.
A tiny-sized particle developed at solution surface or inside the solution depends on the attained
dynamics of atoms where different mechanisms of their bindings are involved. When a protocol energy
is placed over their monolayer assembly, it results into scheme atoms in own shape. Atoms of one-dimensional
arrays of such tiny-sized particle elongate uniformly under the exertion of force, thus, convert
into structures of smooth elements. At solution surface, impinging electron streams at a fixed
angle results into elongate further the already elongated atoms of structures of smooth elements
through gained forced energy of carried photons. Travelling photons along interface further shape
their structures of smooth elements. Amalgamated gold atoms when in neutral state, they execute
confined inter-state electron-dynamics to self-generate bind energy where they are not required
to be uplifted at solution surface for binding under protocol energy. Inside the solution or near
to interface, gold atoms develop different shape-structure tiny-sized particles, which depend
on the miscellaneous factors in addition to attained dynamics. Tiny-sized particles develop structure
in the original format if localized dynamics or attained dynamics of amalgamated atoms are remained
in natural sort of way where they do not involve the frustration and protocol of energy. This study
highlights the fundamental process of developing different tiny particles where electronic structure
of atoms is altered because of experiencing different behaviors of force-energy, so, they deal
a phase transition. Such a tool of processing materials opens several possibilities to develop
engineered materials of specific properties.
