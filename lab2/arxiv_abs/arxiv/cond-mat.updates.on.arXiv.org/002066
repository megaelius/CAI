We study the phase diagram and the total polarization distribution of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model with nearest neighbor interaction in one dimension at half-filling. To obtain the ground
state wave-function, we extend the Baeriswyl variational wave function to account for alternating
hopping parameters. The ground state energies of the variational wave functions compare well to
exact diagonalization results. For the case of uniform hopping for all bonds, where it is known that
an ideal conductor to insulator transition takes place at finite interaction, we also find a transition
at an interaction strength somewhat lower than the known value. The ideal conductor phase is a Fermi
sea. The phase diagram in the whole parameter range shows a resemblance to the phase diagram of the
Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. We also calculate the gauge invariant cumulants corresponding to the
polarization (Zak phase) and use these to reconstruct the distribution of the polarization. We
calculate the reconstructed polarization distribution along a path in parameter space which connects
two points with opposite polarization in two ways. In one case we cross the metallic phase line, in
the other, we go through only insulating states. In the former case, the average polarization changes
discontinuously after passing through the metallic phase line, while in the latter the distribution
"walks across" smoothly from one polarization to its opposite. This state of affairs suggests that
the correlation acts to break the chiral symmetry of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, in the same
way as it happens when a Rice-Mele onsite potential is turned on.
