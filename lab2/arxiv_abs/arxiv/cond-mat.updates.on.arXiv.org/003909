Relaxor ferroelectrics, which can exhibit exceptional electromechanical coupling are some of
the most important functional materials with applications ranging from ultrasound imaging to
actuators and sensors in microelectromechanical devices. Since their discovery nearly 60 years
ago, the complexity of nanoscale chemical and structural heterogeneity in these systems has made
understanding the origins of their unique electromechanical properties a seemingly intractable
problem. A full accounting of the mechanisms that connect local structure and chemistry with nanoscale
fluctuations in polarization has, however, remained a need and a challenge. Here, we employ aberration-corrected
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to quantify various types of nanoscale heterogeneity
and their connection to local polarization in the prototypical relaxor ferroelectric system Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$-PbTiO3
(PMN-PT). We identify three main contributions that each depend on Ti content: chemical order,
oxygen octahedral tilt, and oxygen octahedral distortion. These heterogeneities are found to
be spatially correlated with low angle polar domain walls, indicating their role in disrupting
long-range polarization. Specifically, these heterogeneities lead to nanoscale domain formation
and the relaxor response. We further locate nanoscale regions of monoclinic distortion that correlate
directly with Ti content and the electromechanical performance. Through this approach, the elusive
connection between chemical heterogeneity, structural heterogeneity and local polarization
is revealed, and the results validate models needed to develop the next generation of relaxor ferroelectric
materials.
