Green algae of the $Volvocine$ lineage, spanning from unicellular $Chlamydomonas$ to vastly larger
$Volvox$, are models for the study of the evolution of multicellularity, flagellar dynamics, and
developmental processes. Phototactic steering in these organisms occurs without a central nervous
system, driven solely by the response of individual cells. All such algae spin about a body-fixed
axis as they swim; directional photosensors on each cell thus receive periodic signals when that
axis is not aligned with the light. The flagella of $Chlamydomonas$ and $Volvox$ both exhibit an
adaptive response to such signals in a manner that allows for accurate phototaxis, but in the former
the two flagella have distinct responses, while the thousands of flagella on the surface of spherical
$Volvox$ colonies have essentially identical behaviour. The planar 16-cell species $Gonium~pectorale$
thus presents a conundrum, for its central 4 cells have a $Chlamydomonas$-like beat that provide
propulsion normal to the plane, while its 12 peripheral cells generate rotation around the normal
through a $Volvox$-like beat. Here, we combine experiment, theory, and computations to reveal
how $Gonium$, perhaps the simplest differentiated colonial organism, achieves phototaxis. High-resolution
cell tracking, particle image velocimetry of flagellar driven flows, and high-speed imaging of
flagella on micropipette-held colonies show how, in the context of a recently introduced model
for $Chlamydomonas$ phototaxis, an adaptive response of the peripheral cells alone leads to photo-reorientation
of the entire colony. The analysis also highlights the importance of local variations in flagellar
beat dynamics within a given colony, which can lead to enhanced reorientation dynamics.
