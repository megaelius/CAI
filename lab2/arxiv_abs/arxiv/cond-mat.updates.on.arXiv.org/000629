Despite the industrial importance of dense suspensions of hard particles, few constitutive models
for them have been proposed or tested. Most of these are effectively "fabric evolution models" (FEMs)
based on a stress rule connecting the bulk stress to a rank-2 microstructural fabric tensor Q and
a closed time-evolution equation for Q. In dense suspensions most of the stress comes from short-ranged
pairwise steric or lubrication interactions at near-contacts, so a natural choice for Q is the deviatoric
2nd moment of the distribution P(p) of the near-contact orientations p. Here we test directly whether
a closed time-evolution equation for such a Q can exist for inertialess non-Brownian hard spheres
in a Newtonian solvent. We perform extensive numerical simulations for the evolution of P(p) under
shear reversal, providing a stringent test for FEMs. We consider a generic class of these as defined
by Hand (1962) constrained only by frame indifference. Motivated by the small microstructural
anisotropy in the dense regime, we start with linear models and successively consider increasingly
nonlinear ones. Based on these results we suggest that no closed FEM properly describes the dynamics
of Q under reversal. We attribute this to the fact that Q gives a poor description of the microstructure
during large parts of the microstructural evolution following shear reversal. Specifically,
the truncation of P(p) at 2nd spherical harmonic level describes two-lobed distributions of near-contact
orientations, whereas on reversal we observe distributions that are markedly four-lobed; moreover
dP/dt (p) has oblique axes, not collinear with those of Q in the shear plane. This structure likely
precludes any adequate closure at second-rank level. Instead, our numerical data suggest that
closures involving the coupled evolution of both a fabric tensor and a fourth-rank tensor might
be reasonably accurate.
