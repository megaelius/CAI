Successful doping of single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) remains a formidable
barrier to their incorporation into a range of technologies. We use density functional theory to
study doping of molybdenum and tungsten dichalcogenides with a large fraction of the periodic table.
An automated analysis of the energetics, atomic and electronic structure of thousands of calculations
results in insightful trends across the periodic table and points out promising dopants to be pursued
experimentally. Beyond previously studied cases, our predictions suggest promising substitutional
dopants that result in p-type transport and reveal interesting physics behind the substitution
of the metal site. Doping with early transition metals (TMs) leads to tensile strain and a significant
reduction in the bandgap. The bandgap increases and strain is reduced as the d-states are filled
into the mid TMs; these trends reverse are we move into the late TMs. Additionally, the Fermi energy
increases monotonously as the d-shell is filled from the early to mid TMs and we observe few to no gap
states indicating the possibility of both p- (early TMs) and n- (mid TMs) type doping. Quite surprisingly,
the simulations indicate the possibility of interstitial doping of TMDs; the energetics reveal
that a significant number of dopants, increasing in number from molybdenum disulfide to diselenide
and to ditelluride, favor the interstitial sites over adsorbed ones. Furthermore, calculations
of the activation energy associated with capturing the dopants into the interstitial site indicate
that the process is kinetically possible. This suggets that interstitial impurities in TMDs are
more common than thought to date and we propose a series of potential interstitial dopants for TMDs
relevant for application in nanoelectronics based on a detailed analysis of the predicted electronic
structures.
