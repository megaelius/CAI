The interaction between superconductivity and band topology can lead to various unconventional
superconducting (SC) states, and represents a new frontier in condensed matter physics research.
Recently, the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) system 2M-WS2 has been identified as a Dirac
semimetal exhibiting both superconductivity with the highest Tc = 8.5 K among all the TMD materials
and topological surface states with a single Dirac cone. Here we report on muon spin rotation (muSR)
and density functional theory studies of microscopic SC properties and the electronic structure
in 2M-WS2 at ambient and under hydrostatic pressures (p_max = 1.9 GPa). The SC order parameter in
2M-WS2 is determined to have single-gap s-wave symmetry. We further show a strong negative pressure
effect on Tc and on the SC gap. This may be partly caused by the pressure induced reduction of the size
of the electron pocket around the Gamma-point, at which a band inversion appears up to the highest
applied pressure. We also find that the superfluid density ns is very weakly affected by pressure.
The absence of a strong pressure effect on the superfluid density and the absence of a correlation
between ns and Tc in 2M-WS2, in contrast to the other SC TMDs Td-MoTe2 and 2H-NbSe2, is explained in
terms of its location in the optimal (ambient pressure) and above the optimal (under pressure) superconducting
regions of the phase diagram and its large distance to the other possible competing or cooperating
orders. These results hint towards a complex nature of the superconductivity in TMDs, despite the
observed s-wave order parameter.
