The study of organoids, artificially grown cell aggregates with the functionality and small-scale
anatomy of real organs, is one of the most active areas of research in biology and biophysics. The
genetic foundation underlying targeted growth and the production of various types of organoids
has been intensively studied, but the basic physical origins of their different morphologies remain
poorly understood. Here we propose a mechanistic theory of small-organoid morphologies in both
stationary and growing organoids. Using a 3D vertex model of single-cell-thick epithelial shells,
we reproduce many of the characteristic shapes, ranging from branched and budded structures to
invaginated shapes reminiscent of optic cup organoids. Our model includes cell rearrangements
that arise due to active noise at the level of the adherens junctions. We find that the formation of
branched morphologies relies strongly on a high degree of junctional activity, enabling temporary
aggregations of topological defects in cell packing (i.e. of cells with more or fewer than six neighbors)
to establish a non-trivial distribution of the Gaussian curvature. To elucidate our numerical
results, we also develop an effective elasticity theory, which features a local curvature-thickness
coupling. The strength of this coupling is related to the apico-basal differential surface tension,
which allows one to estimate the apico-basal polarity from the organoid-scale modulation of cell
height. Together, our results provide a generic interpretation of the observed small-organoid
morphologies and they highlight the role of physical factors, such as the differential surface
tension, cell rearrangements, and tissue growth. Importantly, since these mechanisms are sufficient
for the formation of complex shapes, cell differentiation may play a secondary role in establishing
the overall shape of small organoids.
