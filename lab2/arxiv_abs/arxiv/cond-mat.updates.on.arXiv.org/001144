This study deals the formation process of tiny particles when gold atoms are in transition state
under the getup of monolayer assembly at solution surface following by elongation and packing to
develop particles of extended shapes at different processing time of solution. A double-packet
nano shape energy when placed over certain transition state atoms of monolayer assembly results
into crop in tiny particle of its own shape if distribution of atoms is as per accord. It is observed
that the developing rate of extended shapes, not more than millisecond time, depends on size of individual
particle. Diffusing electrons of atoms of tiny particle under the stretching of clamping energy
knots reveal the origin of adjacent diffusion. Tiny particles cropping at surface regions near
the zero-force axis elongate less. So, in this case, particles shape like rod and bar are developed.
Tiny particles where they elongate more, they develop particles shape like hexagon and triangle
revealing the less width of structure of smooth elements along with inter-spacing distance as compared
to rod and bar shape particles. Different widths of structure of smooth elements of one-dimensional
and three-dimensional shaped particles are measured from their patterns resulted from reflected
photons at respective surface giving the same value as in the case of their high-resolution images.
When atoms of one-dimensionally elongated arrays are placed dealing force other than surface format
resulting into bind two regular structure of smooth elements where lateral diffusion of electrons
prevail under expansion and contraction behaviors of clamping energy knots, thus, giving the double
width. These discoveries open multiple routes to design materials and explore underlying science.
