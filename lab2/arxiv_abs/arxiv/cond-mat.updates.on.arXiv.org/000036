We report on the valence fluctuation of Ce in CeMo$_{2}$Si$_{2}$C as studied by means of magnetic
susceptibility $\chi(T)$, specific heat $C(T)$, electrical resistivity $\rho(T)$ and x-ray
absorption spectroscopy. Powder x-ray diffraction revealed that CeMo$_{2}$Si$_{2}$C crystallizes
in CeCr$_{2}$Si$_{2}$C-type layered tetragonal crystal structure (space group \textit{P4/mmm}).
The unit cell volume of CeMo$_{2}$Si$_{2}$C deviates from the expected lanthanide contraction,
indicating non-trivalent state of Ce ions in this compound. The observed weak temperature dependence
of the magnetic susceptibility and its low value indicate that Ce ions are in valence fluctuating
state. The formal $L_{III}$ Ce valence in CeMo$_{2}$Si$_{2}$C $<$$\widetilde{\nu}$$>$
= 3.11 as determined from x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurement is well bellow the value $<$$\widetilde{\nu}$$>
\simeq$ 3.4 in tetravalent Ce compound CeO$_{2}$. The temperature dependence of specific heat
does not show any anomaly down to 1.8 K which rules out any magnetic ordering in the system. The Sommerfeld
coefficient obtained from the specific heat data is $\gamma$ = 23.4 mJ/mol\,K$^{2}$. The electrical
resistivity follows the $T{^2}$ behavior in the low temperature range below 35 K confirming a Fermi
liquid behavior. Accordingly both the Kadowaki Wood ratio $A/\gamma^{2}$ and the Sommerfeld Wilson
ratio $\chi(0)/\gamma$ are in the range expected for Fermi-liquid systems. In order to get some
information on the electronic states, we calculated the band structure within the density functional
theory, eventhough this approach is not able to treat 4f electrons accurately. The non-$f$ electron
states crossing the Fermi level have mostly Mo 4d character. They provide the states with which the
4f sates are strongly hybridized, leading to the intermediate valent state.
