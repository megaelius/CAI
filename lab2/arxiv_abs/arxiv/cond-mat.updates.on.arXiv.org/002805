Purpose: The purpose of this work is to apply a recently proposed constitutive model for mechanically
induced martensitic transformations to the prediction of transformation loci. Additionally,
this study aims to elucidate if a stress-assisted criterion can account for transformations in
the so-called strain-induced regime. Design/methodology/approach: The model is derived by generalising
the stress-based criterion of Patel and Cohen (1953), relying on lattice information obtained
using the Phenomenological Theory of Martensite Crystallography. Transformation multipliers
(cf. plastic multipliers) are introduced, from which the martensite volume fraction evolution
ensues. The associated transformation functions provide a variant selection mechanism. Austenite
plasticity follows a classical single crystal formulation, to account for transformations in
the strain-induced regime. The resulting model is incorporated into a fully-implicit RVE-based
computational homogenisation finite element code. Findings: Results show good agreement with
experimental data for a meta-stable austenitic stainless steel. In particular, the transformation
locus is well reproduced, even in a material with considerable slip plasticity at the martensite
onset, corroborating the hypothesis that an energy-based criterion can account for transformations
in both stress-assisted and strain-induced regimes. Originality/value: A recently developed
constitutive model for mechanically induced martensitic transformations is further assessed
and validated. Its formulation is fundamentally based on a physical metallurgical mechanism and
derived in a thermodynamically consistent way, inheriting a consistent mechanical dissipation.
This model draws on a reduced number of phenomenological elements and is a step towards the fully
predictive modelling of materials that exhibit such phenomena.
