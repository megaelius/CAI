The dipole ordering in Sn(Pb)$_2$P$_2$S(Se)$_6$ materials may be tuned by chemical substitution
realizing a ferroelectric quantum phase transition and quantum glassy or relaxor type phenomena
on different parts of the phase diagram. The introduction of Ge impurity increases the temperature
of the phase transitions and initiates a more pronounced Ising type critical anomaly in Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$
crystal, does not shift the coordinate of the Lifshitz point $x_{\textrm {LP}}$ in Sn$_2$P$_2$(Se$_x$S$_{1-x}$)$_6$
mixed crystals, induces the appearance of a ferroelectric phase transition in quantum paraelectrics
Pb$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ and inhomogeneous polar ordering in (Pb$_{0.7}$Sn$_{0.3}$)$_2$P$_2$S(Se)$_6$
crystals. For Pb$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ crystal, the real part of the dielectric susceptibility in the
quantum critical regime varies as $1/T^2$ instead of the expected $1/T^3$ behavior for uniaxial
materials. This can be partially explained by a screening phenomenon in the semiconductor materials
of the Sn(Pb)$_2$P$_2$S(Se)$_6$ system, which weakens the long range electric dipole interactions,
and also provides, at high temperatures, a critical behavior near the Lifshitz point (studied by
thermal diffusivity) similar to the one predicted in the case of systems with short range interactions.
At low temperatures, a quantum critical behavior in Pb$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ crystal can be established
by the nonlinear coupling between polar and antipolar fluctuations. An increase in thermal conductivity
is induced by Ge impurity in Pb$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ crystal, which is explained through the weakening
of the acoustic phonons resonance scattering by soft optic phonons because of the appearance of
ferroelectric phase polar clusters.
