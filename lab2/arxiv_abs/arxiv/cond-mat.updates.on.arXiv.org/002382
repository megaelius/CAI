In this paper we study the ground state properties of a ladder Hamiltonian with chiral $SU(2)$-invariant
spin interactions, a possible first step towards the construction of truly two dimensional non-trivial
systems with chiral properties starting from quasi-one dimensional ones. Our analysis uses a recent
implementation by us of $SU(2)$ symmetry in tensor network algorithms, specifically for infinite
Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG). After a preliminary analysis with Kadanoff coarse-graining
and exact diagonalization for a small size system, we discuss its bosonization and the continuum
limit of the model and show that it corresponds to a conformal field theory, in agreement with our
numerical findings. In particular, the scaling of the entanglement entropy as well as finite-entanglement
scaling data show that the ground state properties match those of the universality class of a $c =
1$ conformal field theory (CFT) in $(1+1)$ dimensions. We also study the algebraic decay of spin-spin
and dimer-dimer correlation functions, as well as the algebraic convergence of the ground state
energy with the bond dimension, and the entanglement spectrum of half an infinite chain. Our results
for the entanglement spectrum are remarkably similar to those of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain,
which we take as an indication that both systems are described by the same CFT at low energies, i.e.,
an $SU(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten theory. In our numerical study we arrive up to total bond dimension
$\chi \sim 1200$. Moreover, we explain in detail how to construct Matrix Product Operators for $SU(2)$-invariant
three-spin interactions, something that had not been addressed with sufficient depth in the literature.
