Arylazopyrazoles (AAPs) as substitutes for azo derivatives have gained considerable attention
due to their superior properties offering E/Z photo-isomerization with high yield. In order to
compare and quantify their performance, azobenzene tetraethylammonium (Azo-TB) and arylazopyrazole
tetraethylammonium (AAP-TB) bromides were synthesized and characterized in the bulk (water)
using NMR spectroscopy. At the air-water interface complementary information from vibrational
sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and neutron reflectometry (NR) has revealed the
effects of E/Z isomerization in great detail. In bulk water the photostationary states of >89% for
E/Z switching in both directions were very similar for the surfactants, while their interfacial
behavior was substantially different. In particular, the surface excess $\Gamma$ of the surfactants
changed drastically between E/Z isomers for AAP-TB (maximum change of $\Gamma$: 2.15 $\mu$mol/m$^2$);
for Azo-TB the change was only moderate (maximum change of $\Gamma$: 1.02 $\mu$mol/m$^2$). Analysis
of SFG spectra revealed that strong non-resonant contributions that heterodyned the resonant
vibrational bands were proportional to $\Gamma$, enabling the aromatic C-H band to be interpreted
as an indicator for changes in interfacial molecular order. Close comparison of $\Gamma$ from NR
with the SFG amplitude from the aromatic C-H stretch as a function of concentrations and E/Z conformation
revealed substantial molecular order changes for AAP-TB. In contrast, only $\Gamma$ and not the
molecular order varied for Azo-TB. These differences in interfacial properties are attributed
to the molecular structure of the AAP center that enables favorable lateral interactions at the
air-water interface, causing closed-packed interfacial layers and substantial changes during
E/Z photo-isomerization.
