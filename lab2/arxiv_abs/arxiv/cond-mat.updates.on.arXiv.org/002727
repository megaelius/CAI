The detailed account of the local atomic structure and structural disorder at 5~K across the phase
diagram of K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$ $(0 \leq z \leq 2)$ high temperature superconductor
is obtained from neutron total scattering and associated atomic pair distribution function (PDF)
approach. Various model independent and model dependent aspects of the analysis reveal a high level
of structural complexity on the nanometer length-scale. Evidence is found for considerable disorder
in the $c$-axis stacking of the FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ slabs, presumably associated with substoichiometric
potassium intercalation. The faulting does not exhibit any noticeable S-content dependence.
In contrast to non-intercalated FeSe parent superconductor, substantial Fe-vacancies are present
in K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$, deemed detrimental for superconductivity when ordered.
Our study suggests that distribution of vacancies significantly modifies the effective interatomic
potentials which, in turn, affect the nearest neighbor environment, in agreement with observed
evolution of the PDF signal. Complementary aspects of the data analysis imply existence of a cross-over
like transition at around $z=1$ from predominantly vacancy-disordered state at the selenium end
to more vacancy-ordered state closer to the sulfur end of the diagram. The S-content dependent measures
of the local structure are found to correlate with the electronic state, suggesting that local structure
may play an important role in the observed electronic properties. The local structural measures
do not evolve across the superconducting T$_C$ in the Se endmember, and exhibit distinct behavior
with S-content for z<1 and z>1. This behavior appears to be anti-correlated with the evolution of
the Fe-vacancy distribution with S content, reinforcing the idea of the relationship of Fe vacancies
to the local structure and observed properties.
