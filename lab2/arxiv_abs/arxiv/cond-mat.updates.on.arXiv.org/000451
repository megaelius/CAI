Amorphous solids, or glasses, are distinguished from crystalline solids by their lack of long-range
structural order. At the level of two-body structural correlations, glassformers show no qualitative
change upon vitrifying from a supercooled liquid. Nonetheless the dynamical properties of a glass
are so much slower that it appears to take on the properties of a solid. While many theories of the glass
transition focus on dynamical quantities, a solid's resistance to flow is often viewed as a consequence
of its structure. Here we address the viewpoint that this remains the case for a glass. Recent developments
using higher-order measures show a clear emergence of structure upon dynamical arrest in a variety
of glass formers and offer the tantalising hope of a structural mechanism for arrest. However a rigorous
fundamental identification of such a causal link between structure and arrest remains elusive.
We undertake a critical survey of this work in experiments, computer simulation and theory and discuss
what might strengthen the link between structure and dynamical arrest. We move on to highlight the
relationship between crystallisation and glass-forming ability made possible by this deeper
understanding of the structure of the liquid state, and emphasize the potential to design materials
with optimal glassforming and crystallisation ability, for applications such as phase-change
memory. We then consider aspects of the phenomenology of glassy systems where structural measures
have yet to make a large impact, such as polyamorphism (the existence of multiple liquid states),
aging (the time-evolution of non-equilibrium materials below their glass transition) and the
response of glassy materials to external fields such as shear.
