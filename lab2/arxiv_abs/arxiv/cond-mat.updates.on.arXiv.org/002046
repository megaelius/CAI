Despite almost 40 years of research, the origin of heavy-fermion superconductivity is still strongly
debated. Especially, the pressure-induced enhancement of superconductivity in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$
away from the magnetic breakdown is not sufficiently taken into consideration. As recently reported
in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ and several related compounds, optimal superconductivity occurs at the pressure
of a valence crossover, which arises from a virtual critical end point at negative temperature $T_{\rm
cr}$. In this context, we did a meticulous analysis of a vast set of top-quality high-pressure electrical
resistivity data of several Ce-based heavy fermion compounds. The key novelty is the salient correlation
between the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ and the valence instability parameter
$T_{\rm cr}$, which is in line with theory of enhanced valence fluctuations. Moreover, it is found
that, in the pressure region of superconductivity, electrical resistivity is governed by the valence
crossover, which most often manifests in scaling behavior. We develop the new idea that the optimum
superconducting $T_{\rm c}$ of a given sample is mainly controlled by the compound's $T_{\rm cr}$
and limited by non-magnetic disorder. In this regard, the present study provides compelling evidence
for the crucial role of critical valence fluctuations in the formation of Cooper pairs in Ce-based
heavy fermion superconductors besides the contribution of spin fluctuations near magnetic quantum
critical points, and corroborates a plausible superconducting mechanism in strongly correlated
electron systems in general.
