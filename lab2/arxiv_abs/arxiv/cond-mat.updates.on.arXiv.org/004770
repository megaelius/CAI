A numerical model is proposed to compute the eigenmodes and the forced response of multilayered
elastic spheres. The main idea is to describe analytically the problem along the angular coordinates
with spherical harmonics and to discretize the radial direction with one-dimensional finite elements.
The proper test function must be carefully chosen so that both vector and tensor spherical harmonics
orthogonality relationships can be used. The proposed approach yields a general one-dimensional
formulation with a fully analytical description of the angular behaviour, suitable for any interpolating
technique. A linear eigenvalue problem, simple and fast to solve, is then obtained. The eigensolutions
are the spheroidal and torsional modes. They are favourably compared with literature results for
a homogeneous sphere. The eigensolutions are superposed to compute explicitly the forced response.
The latter is used to reconstruct the propagation of surfaces waves. In particular, the collimation
of a Rayleigh wave (non-diffracted surface wave propagating with a quasi-constant width) excited
by a line source in a homogeneous sphere is recovered with the model. Based on the vibration eigenmodes,
a modal analysis shows that such a wave is a superposition of fundamental spheroidal modes with a
displacement confined at the equator of the sphere. These modes are the so-called Rayleigh modes,
of sectoral type and high polar wavenumbers. When a thin viscoelastic coating is added to the sphere,
the Rayleigh mode behaviour is recovered in a limited frequency range, allowing the generation
of a collimating wave at the interface between the sphere and the coating.
