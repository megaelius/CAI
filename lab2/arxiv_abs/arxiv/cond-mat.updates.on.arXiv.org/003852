In magnetic topological insulators (TIs), the interplay between magnetic order and nontrivial
topology can induce fascinating topological quantum phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous
Hall effect, chiral Majorana fermions and axion electrodynamics. Recently, a great deal of attention
has been focused on the intrinsic magnetic TIs, where disorder effects can be eliminated to a large
extent, which is expected to facilitate the emergence of topological quantum phenomena. In despite
of intensive efforts, experimental evidence of the topological surface states (SSs) remains elusive.
Here, by combining first-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) experiments, we have revealed that EuSn2As2 is an antiferromagnetic TI with observation
of Dirac SSs consistent with our prediction. We also observe nearly gapless Dirac SSs in antiferromagnetic
TIs MnBi2nTe3n+1 (n = 1 and 2), which were absent in previous ARPES results. These results provide
clear evidence for nontrivial topology of these intrinsic magnetic TIs. Furthermore, we find that
the topological SSs show no observable changes across the magnetic transition within the experimental
resolution, indicating that the magnetic order has quite small effect on the topological SSs, which
can be attributed to weak hybridization between the localized magnetic moments, from either 4f
or 3d orbitals, and the topological electronic states. This provides insights for further research
that the correlations between magnetism and topological states need to be strengthened to induce
larger gaps in the topological SSs, which will facilitate the realization of topological quantum
phenomena at higher temperatures.
