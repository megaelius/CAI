Semiconductor quantum dots in photonic cavities are strongly coupled light-matter systems with
prospective applications in optoelectronic devices and quantum information processing. Here
we present a theoretical study of the coupled exciton--light field dynamics of a planar quantum
dot ensemble, treated as two-level systems, embedded in a photonic cavity modeled by Maxwell's
equations. When excited by coupling an external short laser pulse into the cavity, we find an exciton-polariton-like
behavior for weak excitation and Rabi oscillations for strong excitation with a sharp transition
between these regimes. In the transition region we find highly non-linear dynamics involving high
harmonics of the fundamental oscillation. We perform a numerical study based on the Finite-Difference-Time-Domain
method for the solution of Maxwell's equations coupled to Bloch equations for the quantum dots and
also derive an analytical model to describe the coupled cavity-quantum dot system, which allows
us to describe the light field dynamics in terms of a Newton-like dynamics in an effective anharmonic
potential. From the shape of this potential combined with the initial conditions the transition
can be well understood. The model is then extended to a broadened ensemble of quantum dots. For weak
excitation the polariton spectrum broadens and the lines slightly shift, however, the sharp transition
to the Rabi oscillation regime is still present. Furthermore, we find a second, lower threshold
with additional lines in the spectra which can be traced back to Rabi oscillations driven by the polariton
modes. Our approach provides new insights in the dynamics of both quantum dot and light field in the
photonic structure.
