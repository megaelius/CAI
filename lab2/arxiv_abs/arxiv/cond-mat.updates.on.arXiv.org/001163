Hybridized magnonic-photonic systems are key components for future information processing technologies
such as storage, manipulation or conversion of data both in the classical (mostly at room temperature)
and quantum (cryogenic) regime. In this work, we investigate a YIG sphere coupled strongly to a microwave
cavity over the full temperature range from $290\,\mathrm{K}$ down to $30\,\mathrm{mK}$. The
cavity-magnon polaritons are studied from the classical to the quantum regime where the thermal
energy is less than one resonant microwave quanta, i.e. at temperatures below $1\,\mathrm{K}$.
We compare the temperature dependence of the coupling strength $g_{\rm{eff}}(T)$, describing
the strength of coherent energy exchange between spin ensemble and cavity photon, to the temperature
behavior of the saturation magnetization evolution $M_{\rm{s}}(T)$ and find strong deviations
at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of magnonic disspation is governed at intermediate
temperatures by rare earth impurity scattering leading to a strong peak at $40\,$K. The linewidth
$\kappa_{\rm{m}}$ decreases to $1.2\,$MHz at $30\,$mK, making this system suitable as a building
block for quantum electrodynamics experiments. We achieve an electromagnonic cooperativity
in excess of $20$ over the entire temperature range, with values beyond $100$ in the milliKelvin
regime as well as at room temperature. With our measurements, spectroscopy on strongly coupled
magnon-photon systems is demonstrated as versatile tool for spin material studies over large temperature
ranges. Key parameters are provided in a single measurement, thus simplifying investigations
significantly.
