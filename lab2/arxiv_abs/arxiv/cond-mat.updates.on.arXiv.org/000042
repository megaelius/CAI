We study various transitions in dilaton holography, including those associated with the spontaneous
breaking of a global (superfluid case) or local (superconductor case) U(1) symmetry in diverse
dimensions d. By analyzing the thermodynamics of the dilaton-gravity system we find that scale
invariance is broken at low temperatures, as shown by a nontrivial hyperscaling violation exponent
in the infrared; increasing the temperature we recover scale symmetry in a d dependent way: while
for d=2+1 a phase transition is found, for d=3+1 the transition is rather a crossover (as expected
in QCD). When the U(1) is preserved and at low temperatures, the system is insulating for arbitrary
d if the dilaton is appropriately coupled to the gauge field; for other couplings we also find a linear
in temperature resistivity. We then determine the prediction of these models for several quantities
in the superconducting phase: the DC and AC conductivity, the gap for charged excitations, the superfluid
density, the vortex profiles, the coherence length, the penetration depth and the critical magnetic
fields. We show that at low temperatures some of these quantities differ qualitatively compared
with the corresponding models without the dilaton, although the superconductor is robustly of
Type II. The ratio of the gap over the critical temperature of the superconductor is studied in detail
varying d and the couplings of the dilaton and then compared with the BCS value. A holographic renormalization
is required in d>2+1 to compute some quantities (such as the AC conductivity and the penetration
depth) and we explain in detail how to perform it.
