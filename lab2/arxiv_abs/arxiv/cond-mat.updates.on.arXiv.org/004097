Collective tunneling is a ubiquitous phenomenon in finite-size spin clusters that shows up in systems
as diverse as molecular magnets or spin clusters adsorbed at surfaces. The problem we explore is
to understand how small flipping terms can cooperate to flip a large spin to the opposite direction
or a cluster of interacting elementary Ising spins into the time-reversed state. These high order
processes will involve at least two channels, a single spin-flip channel due to a transverse field
and a two-spin flip channel due to exchange or due to single-ion anisotropies. In the present paper,
we show that high-order perturbation theory can be formulated and evaluated with the help of simple
recurrence relations, leading to a compact theory of tunnelling in macroscopic spins, in one-dimensional
clusters, as well as in small higher-dimensional clusters. This is demonstrated explicitly in
the case of the Ising model with a transverse field and transverse exchange, and in the case of macroscopic
spins with uniaxial anisotropy. Our approach provides a transparent theory of level crossings,
where the tunneling between time reversed configurations vanishes as a function of the external
field. The crossings result from destructive quantum interferences between competing flipping
channels. Our theory consistently predicts N crossings in chains of N Ising spins, 2S crossings
in single spins of magnitude S, and yields explicit analytical formulae for the level crossings
of open chains and macroscopic spins. Disorder can be easily implemented in this perturbative formalism.
Leading disorder effects can be treated analytically for spin rings. At the smallest transverse
field crossing, the suppression of tunneling is most robust with respect to disorder. We briefly
discuss the implications of our findings for the use of realistic spin clusters on surfaces to store
information.
