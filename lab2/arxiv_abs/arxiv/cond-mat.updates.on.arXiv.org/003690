Ionic microgel particles in a good solvent swell to an equilibrium size determined by a balance of
electrostatic and elastic forces. When crowded, ionic microgels deswell owing to a redistribution
of microions inside and outside the particles. The concentration-dependent deswelling affects
the interactions between the microgels, and consequently the suspension properties. We present
a comprehensive theoretical study of crowding effects on thermodynamic, structural, and dynamic
properties of weakly cross-linked ionic microgels in a good solvent. The microgels are modeled
as microion- and solvent-permeable colloidal spheres with fixed charge uniformly distributed
over the polymer gel backbone, whose elastic and solvent-interaction free energies are described
using Flory-Rehner theory. Two mean-field methods for calculating the crowding-dependent microgel
radius are investigated, and combined with calculations of the net microgel charge characterizing
the electrostatic part of an effective microgel pair potential, with charge renormalization accounted
for. Using this effective pair potential, thermodynamic and static suspension properties are
calculated including the osmotic pressure and microgel pair distribution function. The latter
is used in our calculations of dynamic suspension properties, where we account for hydrodynamic
interactions. Results for diffusion and rheological properties are presented over ranges of microgel
concentration and charge. We show that deswelling mildly enhances self- and collective diffusion
and the osmotic pressure, lowers the suspension viscosity, and significantly shifts the suspension
crystallization point to higher concentrations. The paper presents a bottom-up approach to efficiently
computing suspension properties of crowded ionic microgels using single-particle characteristics.
