Metal halide perovskites are attracting tremendous interest for a variety of optoelectronic applications.
The ability to tune the perovskite bandgap by tweaking the chemical compositions opens up new applications
as coloured emitters and as components of tandem photovoltaics. Nevertheless, non-radiative
losses are still limiting performance, with luminescence yields in state-of-the-art perovskite
solar cells still far from 100% under solar illumination conditions. Furthermore, in mixed halide
perovskite systems designed for continuous bandgap tunability (bandgaps ~1.7-1.9 eV), photo-induced
ion segregation leads to bandgap instabilities. Here, we substantially mitigate both non-radiative
losses and photo-induced ion migration in perovskite structures by decorating the surfaces and
grain boundaries with passivating potassium-halide interlayers. We demonstrate external photo-luminescence
quantum yields of 66%, translating to internal yields exceeding 95%. The high luminescence yields
are achieved while maintaining high mobilities over 40 cm2V-1s-1, giving the elusive combination
of both high luminescence and excellent charge transport. We find that the external luminescence
yield when interfaced with electrodes in a solar cell device stack, a quantity that must be maximized
to approach the efficiency limits, remains as high as 15%, indicating very clean interfaces. We
also demonstrate the inhibition of photo-induced ion migration processes across a wide range of
mixed halide perovskite bandgaps that otherwise show bandgap instabilities. We validate these
results in full operating solar cells, highlighting the importance of stabilising luminescence
in device structures. Our work represents a critical breakthrough in the construction of tunable
halide perovskite films and interfaces that can approach the efficiency limits in tandem solar
cells and coloured LEDs.
