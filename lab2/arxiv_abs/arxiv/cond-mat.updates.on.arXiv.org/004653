Nonlinear optical (NLO) processes have revolutionized laser technology, chemical sensing, and
telecommunications. Emerging 2D semiconductors and multiple-quantum-well structures have
redefined the state of the art for NLO performance through large second-order susceptibilities
${\chi}^{2}$. However, the largest ${\chi}^{2}$ values are limited to the mid-infrared and cryogenic
temperatures, precluding implementation at visible and near-infrared (NIR) frequencies essential
to telecommunications. Here, we report room-temperature NIR ${\chi}^{2}$ approaching 10 nm/V
from a heterostructure of crystalline, atomically thin group-IIIa metal films that are epitaxial
to a SiC substrate and capped with graphene. The surprising ${\chi}^{2}$ values are the result of
intrinsic axial symmetry breaking unique to the heterostructure; the individual components are
not expected to yield second-order responses due to their inversion symmetry. Metal bonding character
transitions from covalent at the SiC interface to metallic to non-bonded at the graphene interface,
with variation in the atomic spacing and an electrostatic gradient over 2-3 atomic layers. This
leads to a theoretically predicted axial dipole that is confirmed by angle-dependent second harmonic
generation (SHG) measurements, verifying that these are 2D polar metals (2D-PMets). Polarization-dependent
SHG resolves structural influences of the substrate that are persistent into the metals, which
adopt the hexagonal symmetry of the substrate. DFT calculations predict ${\chi}^{2}$ consistent
with experiment, as well as electronic inter-band resonances, which may be leveraged to further
amplify the nonlinear response. The exceptional nonlinear response of 2D-PMets, along with their
electronic properties, environmental stability, and applicability to many metals, lays a foundation
for further breakthroughs in vis/NIR NLO technology.
