Using the generalized Boltzmann equation, we have investigated the impact of impurity scattering
on charge carrier transport in an anisotropic Dirac system. As a case study, we have studied the thermoelectric
performance of borophane, a new monoelemental monolayer with a tilted and anisotropic Dirac cone,
in the diffusive transport regime. Finding the exact solution to the linear-response Boltzmann
equation, the electrical conductivity and thermoelectric properties of borophane in the presence
of the short-range, long-range charged impurity and the electromagnetic impurities is studied.
Contrary to the electron-hole asymmetry in borophane, its electron-hole conductivity is symmetric.
We explain the effect of the chemical potential, on the thermoelectric properties of borophane.
We demonstrate that, regardless of the type of impurities, the electric conductivity of borophane
is highly anisotropic, while the Seebeck coefficient and figure of merit ($ZT$) are isotropic.
The anisotropy ratio of the conductivities ($\sigma_{xx}/\sigma_{yy}$) for both long-range
and short-range magnetic impurity are constant values of around $7.67$ and $9.27$, respectively.
Along with ambipolar nature of borophane thermopower, we predict that borophane has a high figure
of merit with the optimal values ${\it ZT}=2.75$ at the low temperature and ${\it ZT}=1$, and room
temperature. More importantly, borophane attains its maximum value of the figure of merit at low
chemical potentials, in the vicinity of the charge neutrality point. In comparison to phosphorene
(a highly unique anisotropic 2D material) borophane with a high anisotropy ratio of about $10$,
is an unprecedented anisotropic material. This high anisotropy ratio together with the large figure
of merit, suggest that borophane is promising for the thermoelectric applications and transport
switching in the Dirac transport channels.
