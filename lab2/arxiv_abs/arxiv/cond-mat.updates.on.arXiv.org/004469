Optical parametric oscillations (OPOs) - a non-linear process involving the coherent coupling
of an optically excited two particle pump state to a signal and an idler states with different energies
- is a relevant mechanism for optical amplification as well as for the generation of correlated photons.
OPOs require states with well-defined symmetries and energies: the fine-tuning of material properties
and structural dimensions to create these states remains a challenge for the realization of scalable
OPO-based functionalities in semiconductor nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate a pathway towards
this goal based on the control of confined microcavity exciton-polaritons modulated by the spatially
and time varying dynamical potentials produced by a surface acoustic waves (SAW). The exciton-polariton
are confined in um-sized intra-cavity traps fabricated by structuring a planar semiconductor
microcavity during the epitaxial growth process. OPOs in these structures benefit from the enhanced
non-linearities of confined systems. We show that SAW fields induce state-dependent and time-varying
energy shifts, which enable the energy alignment of the confined levels with the appropriate symmetry
for OPO triggering. Furthermore, the dynamic acoustic tuning, which is fully described by a theoretical
model for the modulation of the confined polaritons by the acoustic field, compensates for fluctuations
in symmetry and dimensions of the confinement potential thus enabling a variety of dynamic OPO regimes.
The robustness of the acoustic tuning is demonstrated by the synchronous excitation of an array
of confined OPOs using a single acoustic beam, thus opening the way for the realization of scalable
non-linear on-chip systems.
