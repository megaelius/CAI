We have studied the low-temperature electrical transport properties of Pb$_x$(SiO$_2$)$_{1-x}$
($x$ being the Pb volume fraction) nanogranular films with thicknesses of $\sim$1000 nm and $x$
spanning the dielectric, transitional, and metallic regions. It is found that the percolation
threshold $x_c$ lies between 0.57 and 0.60. For films with $x$$\lesssim$0.50, the resistivities
$\rho$ as functions of temperature $T$ obey $\rho\propto\exp(\Delta/k_BT)$ relation ($\Delta$
being the local superconducting gap and the $k_B$ Boltzmann constant) below the superconducting
transition temperature $T_c$ ($\sim$7 K) of Pb granules. The value of the gap obtained via this expression
is almost identical to that by single electron tunneling spectra measurement. The magnetoresistance
is negative below $T_c$ and its absolute value is far larger than that above $T_c$ at a certain field.
These observations indicate that single electron hopping (or tunneling), rather than Cooper pair
hopping (or tunneling) governs the transport processes below $T_c$. The temperature dependence
of resistivities shows reentrant behavior for the 0.50$<$$x$$<$0.57 films. It is found that single
electron hopping (or tunneling) also dominates the low-temperature transport process for these
films. The reduction of the single electron concentration leads to an enhancement of the resisivity
at sufficiently low temperature. For the 0.60$\lesssim$$x$$\lesssim$0.72 films, the resistivities
sharply decrease with decreasing temperature just below $T_c$, and then show dissipation effect
with further decreasing temperature. Treating the conducting paths composed of Pb particles as
nanowires, we have found that the $R(T)$ data below $T_c$ can be well explained by a model that includes
both thermally activated phase slips and quantum phase slips.
