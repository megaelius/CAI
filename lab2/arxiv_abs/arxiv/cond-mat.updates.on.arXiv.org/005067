We present an ab initio study of the structural and electronic transport properties of tetrahedrite,
Cu$_{12}$Sb$_4$S$_{13}$, in its high-temperature phase. We show how this complex compound can
be seen as the outcome of an ordered arrangement of S-vacancies in a semiconducting fematinite-like
structure (Cu3SbS4). Our calculations confirm that the S-vacancies are the natural doping mechanism
in this thermoelectric compound and reveal a similar local chemical environment around crystallographically
inequivalent Cu atoms, shedding light on the debate on XPS measurements in this compound. To access
the electrical transport properties as a function of temperature we use the Kubo-Greenwood formula
applied to snapshots of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. This approach is essential
to effectively account for the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations in such a complex
crystal structure where a strong anharmonicity plays a key role in stabilising the high-temperature
phase. Our results show that the Seebeck coeffcient is in good agreement with experiments and the
phonon-limited electrical resistivity displays a temperature trend that compares well with a
wide range of experimental data. The predicted lower bound for the resistivity turns out to be remarkably
low for a pristine mineral in the Cu-Sb-S system but not too far from the lowest experimental data
reported in literature. The Lorenz number turns out to be substantially lower than what expected
from the free-electron value in the Wiedemann-Franz law, thus providing an accurate way to estimate
the electronic and lattice contributions to the thermal conductivity in experiments, of great
significance in this very low thermal conductivity crystalline material.
