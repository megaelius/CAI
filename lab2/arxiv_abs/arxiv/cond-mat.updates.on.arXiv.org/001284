We present an extensive set of surface and chemisorption energies calculated using state of the
art many-body perturbation theory. In the first part of the paper we consider ten surface reactions
in the low coverage regime where experimental data is available. Here the random phase approximation
(RPA) is found to yield high accuracy for both adsorption and surface energies. In contrast all the
considered density functionals fail to describe both quantities accurately. This establishes
the RPA as a universally accurate method for surface science. In the second part, we use the RPA to
construct a database of 200 high quality adsorption energies for reactions involving OH, CH, NO,
CO, N$_2$, N, O and H over a wide range of 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals. Due to the significant computational
demand, these results are obtained in the high coverage regime where adsorbate-adsorbate interactions
can be significant. RPA is compared to the more advanced renormalised adiabatic LDA (rALDA) method
for a subset of the reactions and they are found to describe the adsorbate-metal bond as well as adsorbate-adsorbate
interactions similarly. The RPA results are compared to a range of standard density functional
theory methods typically employed for surface reactions representing the various rungs on Jacob's
ladder. The deviations are found to be highly functional, surface and reaction dependent. Our work
establishes the RPA and rALDA methods as universally accurate full ab-initio methods for surface
science where accurate experimental data is scarce. The database is freely available via the Computational
Materials Repository (CMR).
