The bulk-boundary correspondence, being a question of intensive research interest over the past
decades, provides for one of the most quintessential ideas in the topological classification of
matter. However, the bulk-boundary correspondence has never been proven in all generality and
has in certain scenarios even been shown to fail to hold, depending on boundary profiles of the terminated
system. In this regard we here develop bulk numbers describing the exact number of in-gap modes without
any of such subtleties in one spatial dimension. Similarly, based on the 1D bulk numbers, we find
a new 2D winding number, called the pole winding number, that specifies the amount of robust metallic
surface bands in the gap as well as their topological character. The underlying general methodology
relies on a simple continuous extrapolation from the bulk to the boundary, while tracking the evolution
of Green's function's poles in the vicinity of the bulk band edges. As a main result we find that all
the obtained numbers can be applied to the known insulating phases in a unified manner regardless
of the specific symmetries. Additionally, from a computational point of view, these numbers can
be effectively evaluated without any gauge fixing problems. In particular, we directly apply our
bulk-boundary correspondence construction to various systems, including counterexamples in
1D where there is no bulk-boundary correspondence, and predict the existence of boundary modes
on various kinds of experimentally studied graphene edges, such as open boundaries and grain boundaries.
Finally, we sketch the 3D generalization of the pole winding number by revisiting topological insulators.
