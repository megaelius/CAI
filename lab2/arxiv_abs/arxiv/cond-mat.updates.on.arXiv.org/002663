The so-called negative electron compressibility refers to the lowering of the chemical potential
of a metallic system when the carrier density increases. This effect has often been invoked in the
past to explain the enhancement of the capacitance beyond the classical limits in capacitors with
two-dimensional electron gases as electrodes. Based on experiments on strongly confined semiconductor
quantum wells (QWs), it has been traditionally ascribed to the electron exchange energy as the main
driving force. Recent research, however, has revealed that analogous effects can occur in other
classes of materials systems, such as polar oxide interfaces, whose characteristics drastically
depart from those of the previously considered cases. To rationalize these new results, it is necessary
to revisit the established theory of confined electron gases, and test whether its conclusions
are valid beyond the specifics of semiconductor-based QWs. Here we find, based on first-principles
calculations of jellium slabs, that one must indeed be very careful when extrapolating existing
results to other realistic physical systems. In particular, we identify a number of additional,
previously overlooked mechanisms (e.g., related to the displacement of the electronic cloud and
to the multiband structure of the delocalized gas), that enter into play and become new sources of
negative capacitance in the weak-confinement regime. Our detailed analysis of these emerging
contributions, supported by analytic models and multiple test cases, will provide a useful guidance
in the ongoing quest for nanometric capacitors with enhanced performance.
