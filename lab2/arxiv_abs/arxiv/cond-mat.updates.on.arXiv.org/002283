Since the early 1960s, alloys are commonly grouped into two classes, featuring bound states in the
bandgap (I) or additional, non-discrete band states (II). Microscopic material parameters for
class I alloys can directly be extracted from photoluminescence (PL) spectra, whereas any conclusions
drawn for class II alloys usually remain indirect and limited to macroscopic assertions. Nonetheless,
here, we present a spectroscopic study on exciton localization in a so-called mixed crystal alloy
(class II) that allows us to access microscopic alloy parameters. We study bulk In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N
epilayers at the onset of alloy formation (0 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 2.4%) in order to understand the material's
particular robustness to defects. Based on an in-depth PL analysis it is demonstrated how different
excitonic complexes (free, bound, and complex bound excitons) can serve as a probe to monitor the
dilute limit of class II alloys. From an $x$-dependent linewidth analysis we extract the length
scales at which excitons become increasingly localized, meaning that they convert from a free to
a bound particle upon alloy formation. Already at x = 2.4% the average exciton diffusion length is
reduced to 5.7 $\pm$ 1.3 nm at a temperature of 12 K, thus, detrimental exciton transfer mechanisms
towards non-radiative defects are suppressed. In addition, the associated low temperature PL
data suggests that a single indium atom does not suffice in order to permanently capture an exciton.
Micro-PL spectra even give access to a forthright probing of silicon bound excitons embedded in
a particular environment of indium atoms, thanks to the emergence of a hierarchy of individual,
energetically sharp emission lines (full width at half maximum $\approx$ 300 $\mu$eV). Consequently,
the present study allows us to extract first microscopic alloy properties formerly only accessible
for class I alloys.
