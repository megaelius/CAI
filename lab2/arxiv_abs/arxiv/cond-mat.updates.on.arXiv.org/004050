Noncollinear antiferromagnets with a D0$_{19}$ (space group = 194, P6$_{3}$/mmc) hexagonal structure
have garnered much attention for their potential applications in topological spintronics. Here,
we report the deposition of continuous epitaxial thin films of such a material, Mn$_{3}$Sn, and
characterize their crystal structure using a combination of x-ray diffraction and transmission
electron microscopy. Growth of Mn$_{3}$Sn films with both (0001) c-axis orientation and (40$\bar{4}$3)
texture is achieved. In the latter case, the thin films exhibit a small uncompensated Mn moment in
the basal plane, quantified via magnetometry and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism experiments.
This cannot account for the large anomalous Hall effect simultaneously observed in these films,
even at room temperature, with magnitude $\sigma_{\mathrm{xy}}$ ($\mu_{0}H$ = 0 T) = 21 $\mathrm{\Omega}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$
and coercive field $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{C}}$ = 1.3 T. We attribute the origin of this anomalous Hall
effect to momentum-space Berry curvature arising from the symmetry-breaking inverse triangular
spin structure of Mn$_{3}$Sn. Upon cooling through the transition to a glassy ferromagnetic state
at around 50 K, a peak in the Hall resistivity close to the coercive field indicates the onset of a topological
Hall effect contribution, due to the emergence of a scalar spin chirality generating a real-space
Berry phase. We demonstrate that the polarity of this topological Hall effect, and hence the chiral-nature
of the noncoplanar magnetic structure driving it, can be controlled using different field cooling
conditions.
