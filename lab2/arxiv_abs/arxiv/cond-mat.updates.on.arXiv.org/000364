Understanding how foreign chemical species bond to atomic vacancies in graphene layers can advance
our ability to tailor the electronic and magnetic properties of defective graphenic materials.
Here we use ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (UHV-STM) and density functional
theory to identify the precise structure of hydrogenated single atomic vacancies in a topmost graphene
layer of graphite and establish a connection between the details of hydrogen passivation and the
electronic properties of a single atomic vacancy. Monovacancy-hydrogen complexes are prepared
by sputtering of the graphite surface layer with low energy ions and then exposing it briefly to an
atomic hydrogen environment. High-resolution experimental UHV-STM imaging allows us to determine
unambiguously the positions of single missing atoms in the defective graphene lattice and, in combination
with the ab initio calculations, provides detailed information about the distribution of low-energy
electronic states on the periphery of the monovacancy-hydrogen complexes. We found that a single
atomic vacancy where each sigma-dangling bond is passivated with one hydrogen atom shows a well-defined
signal from the non-bonding pi-state which penetrates into the bulk with a (\sqrt 3 \times \sqrt
3)R30^ \circ periodicity. However, a single atomic vacancy with full hydrogen termination of sigma-dangling
bonds and additional hydrogen passivation of the extended pi-state at one of the vacancy's monohydrogenated
carbon atoms is characterized by complete quenching of low-energy localized states. In addition,
we discuss the migration of hydrogen atoms at the periphery of the monovacancy-hydrogen complexes
which dramatically change the vacancy's low-energy electronic properties, as observed in our
low-bias high-resolution STM imaging.
