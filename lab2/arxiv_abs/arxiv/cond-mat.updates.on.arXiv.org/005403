Insect swarms are a model system for understanding collective behavior where the collective motion
appears in disorder. To initiate and maintain a swarm in place, flying insects often use a visual
external cue called a marker. In mosquitoes, understanding the swarming behavior and its relation
to the marker has an additional medical relevance since swarming often precedes mating in the wild,
thus constituting an important stage to intercept for controlling mosquito population. In this
paper, we conduct preliminary experiments to characterize the visual coupling between a swarm
of mosquitoes and a marker. A laboratory microcosm with artificial lighting was built to stimulate
consistent swarming in the malarial mosquito Anopheles stephensi. The experimental setup was
used to film a mosquito swarm with a stereo camera system as a marker was moved back-and-forth with
different frequencies. System identification analysis of the frequency response shows that the
relationship between the swarm and the marker can be described by delayed second order dynamics
in a feedback loop. Further, the length of the internal time delay appears to correlate with the number
of mosquitoes swarming on the marker indicating that such a delay may be able capture social interactions
within swarming systems. For insect swarms, model fitting of trajectory data provides a way to numerically
compare swarming behaviors of different species with respect to marker characteristics. These
preliminary results motivate investigating linear dynamic system in feedback as a framework for
modeling insect swarms and set the stage for future studies.
