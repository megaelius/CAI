We investigate the signal reconstruction performance of sparse linear regression in the presence
of noise when piecewise continuous nonconvex penalties are used. Among such penalties, we focus
on the SCAD penalty. The contributions of this study are three-fold: We first present a theoretical
analysis of a typical reconstruction performance, using the replica method, under the assumption
that each component of the design matrix is given as an independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) Gaussian variable. This clarifies the superiority of the SCAD estimator compared with
$\ell_1$ in a wide parameter range, although the nonconvex nature of the penalty tends to lead to
solution multiplicity in certain regions. This multiplicity is shown to be connected to replica
symmetry breaking in the spin-glass theory. We also show that the global minimum of the mean square
error between the estimator and the true signal is located in the replica symmetric phase. Second,
we develop an approximate formula efficiently computing the cross-validation error without actually
conducting the cross-validation, which is also applicable to the non-i.i.d. design matrices.
It is shown that this formula is only applicable to the unique solution region and tends to be unstable
in the multiple solution region. We implement instability detection procedures, which allows
the approximate formula to stand alone and resultantly enables us to draw phase diagrams for any
specific dataset. Third, we propose an annealing procedure, called nonconvexity annealing, to
obtain the solution path efficiently. Numerical simulations are conducted on simulated datasets
to examine these results to verify the theoretical results consistency and the approximate formula
efficiency. Another numerical experiment on a real-world dataset is conducted; its results are
consistent with those of earlier studies using the $\ell_0$ formulation.
