We report a high-pressure study of tetragonal scheelite-type CaMoO4 up to 29 GPa. In order to characterize
its high-pressure behavior, we have combined Raman and optical-absorption measurements with
density-functional theory calculations. We have found evidence of a pressure-induced phase transition
near 15 GPa. Experiments and calculations agree in assigning the high-pressure phase to a monoclinic
fergusonite-type structure. The reported results are consistent with previous powder x-ray-diffraction
experiments, but are in contradiction with the conclusions obtained from earlier Raman measurements,
which support the existence of more than one phase transition in the pressure range covered by our
studies. The observed scheelite-fergusonite transition induces significant changes in the electronic
band gap and phonon spectrum of CaMoO4. We have determined the pressure evolution of the band gap
for the low- and high-pressure phases as well as the frequencies and pressure dependences of the
Raman-active and infrared-active modes. In addition, based upon calculations of the phonon dispersion
of the scheelite phase, carried out at a pressure higher than the transition pressure, we propose
a possible mechanism for the reported phase transition. Furthermore, from the calculations we
determined the pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters and atomic positions of the different
phases and their room-temperature equations of state. These results are compared with previous
experiments showing a very good agreement. Finally, information on bond compressibility is reported
and correlated with the macroscopic compressibility of CaMoO4. The reported results are of interest
for the many technological applications of this oxide.
