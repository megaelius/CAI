Generating polarization entangled photon pairs from semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is a desired
feature for advanced quantum applications integrated with semiconductor technology, such as
quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation, but has remained a technically challenging task
for a long time, due to the inevitable and hardly controlled fine structure splitting (FSS) between
the single-exciton doublets of QDs. Till recently, a conceptual and technological break- through
was made by Trotta et al. to successfully remove the FSSs of QDs in an universal and deterministic
manner, which points out the necessity of using at least two generic fields as tuning knobs for the
FSS-elimination. Inspired by the progress, currently more attempt is to develop the quantum light
emitting devices with versatile functionalities, such as electrical trigger of photon- pair emission
or tunability of light-wavelength. In the sense, the use of two tuning knobs yet in turn impose a restriction
to the versatility of devices that needs also additional tuning knobs for the functional operations.
In this study, we carry out a theoretical and computation investigation of the excitonic FSSs of
droplet-epitaxial (DE) GaAs/AlGaAs QDs controlled by piezoelectricity actuators. As a main of
this work, we find that the number of the required tuning knobs for a deterministic generation of
EPPs from asymmetric QDs actually can be reduced to be only one as long as the crystal symmetries of
QD material and piezoelectricity actuator are compatible. As a feasible example, we show that the
FSSs of asymmetric GaAs QDs can be certainly eliminated with a single bi-axial stress generated
by (001) PMN-PT actuator that is, in the sense of symmetry, in coincidence with the zinc-blende crystal
structure of QD.
