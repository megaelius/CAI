Several approaches have been used to investigate the impact of Nitrogen (N) on the electronic structure
of GaAs$_{1-x}$N$_{x}$ alloys, however, there is no agreement between theory and experiments
about the importance of the different N interstitial defects in these alloys, and their nature is
still unknown. Here we analyze the impact of five different N defects on the electronic structure
of GaAs$_{1-x}$N$_{x}$ alloys, using density-functional methods: we calculate electronic states,
formation energies and charge transition levels. The studied defects include N$_{As}$, As$_{Ga}$,
As$_{Ga}$-N$_{As}$ substitutional defects, and (N-N)$_{As}$, (N-As)$_{As}$ split-interstitial
complex defects. Our calculated defect formation energies agree with those reported by S.B. Zhang
et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 1789 (2001)], who predicted these defects. Among the interstitial defects,
we found that (N-As)$_{As}$ emerges as the lowest energy configuration in comparison with (N-N)$_{As}$,
agreeing with recent experiments [T. Jen, et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 107, 221904 (2015)]. We also
calculated the levels induced in the electronic structure due to each of these defects: defect states
may occur as deep levels in the gap, shallow levels close to the band edges, and as levels between bulk
states. We find that the largest changes in the band structure are produced by an isolated N atom in
GaAs, which is resonant with the conduction band, exhibiting a strong hybridization between N and
GaAs states. Deeper levels in the bandgap are obtained with (N-N)$_{As}$ split-interstitial defects.
Our results confirm the formation of highly localized states around the N sites, which is convenient
for photovoltaics and photoluminescence applications.
