The yet virtually unexplored class of soft colloidal rods with small aspect ratio is investigated
and shown to exhibit a very rich phase and dynamic behavior, spanning from liquid to nearly melt state.
Instead of nematic order, these short and soft nanocylinders alter their organization with increasing
concentration from isotropic liquid with random orientation to one with preferred local orientation
and eventually a multi-domain arrangement with local orientational order. The latter gives rise
to a kinetically suppressed state akin to structural glass with detectable terminal relaxation,
which, on increasing concentration reveals features of hexagonally packed order as in ordered
block copolymers. The respective dynamic response comprises four regimes, all above the overlapping
concentration of 0.02 g/ml: I) from 0.03 to 0.1 g/mol the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid like
transition with a structural relaxation time that grows by four orders of magnitude. II) from 0.1
to 0.2 g/ml a dramatic slowing-down is observed and is accompanied by an evolution from isotropic
to multi-domain structure. III) between 0.2 and 0.6 g/mol the suspensions exhibit signatures of
shell interpenetration and jamming, with the colloidal plateau modulus depending linearly on
concentration. IV) at 0.74 g/ml in the densely jammed state, the viscoelastic signature of hexagonally
packed cylinders from microphase-separated block copolymers is detected. These properties set
short and soft nanocylinders apart from long colloidal rods (with large aspect ratio) and provide
insights for fundamentally understanding the physics in this intermediate soft colloidal regime,
as well as and for tailoring the flow properties of non-spherical soft colloids.
