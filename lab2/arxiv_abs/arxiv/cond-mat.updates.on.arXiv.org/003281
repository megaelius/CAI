Non-collinear, multi-q spin textures can give rise to exotic, topologically protected spin structures
such as skyrmions, but the reason for their formation over simple single-q structures is not well
understood. While lattice frustration and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are known to
produce non-collinear spin textures, the role of electron itinerancy in multi-q formation is much
less studied. Here we investigated the non-collinear, helical spin structures in epitaxial films
of the perovskite oxides SrFeO3 and CaFeO3 using magnetotransport and resonant soft x-ray magnetic
diffraction. Metallic SrFeO3 exhibits features in its magnetoresistance that are consistent
with its recently proposed multi-q structure. Additionally, the magnetic Bragg peak of SrFeO3
measured at the Fe L edge resonance energy asymmetrically broadens with decreasing temperature
in its multi-q state. In contrast, insulating CaFeO3 has a symmetric scattering peak with an intensity
10x weaker than SrFeO3. Enhanced magnetic scattering at O K edge prepeak energies demonstrates
the role of a negative charge transfer energy and the resulting oxygen ligand holes in the magnetic
ordering of these ferrates. By measuring magnetic diffraction of CaFeO3/SrFeO3 superlattices
with thick CaFeO3 layers, we find that the CaFeO3 helical ordering is coherent across 1 unit cell-thick
SrFeO3 layers but not 6 unit cell-thick layers. We conclude that insulating CaFeO3 supports only
a simple single-q helical structure in contrast to metallic SrFeO3 that hosts multi-q structures.
Our results provide important insight into the role of electron itinerancy in the formation of multi-q
spin structures.
