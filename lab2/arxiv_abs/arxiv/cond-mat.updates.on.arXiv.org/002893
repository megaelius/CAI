Recent computer simulations have uncovered the striking difference between the jamming transition
of spherical and non-spherical particles. While systems of spherical particles are isostatic
at the jamming point, systems of nonspherical particles are not: the contact number and shear modulus
of the former exhibit a square root singularity near jamming, while those of the latter are linearly
proportional to the distance from jamming. Furthermore, while our theoretical understanding
of jamming of spherical particles is well developed, the same is not true for nonspherical particles.
In this work we investigate a mean-field model to understand jamming of non-spherical particles.
We extend the perceptron model, whose SAT/UNSAT transition belongs to the same universality class
of jamming of spherical particles, to include additional variables accounting for the rotational
degrees of freedom of nonspherical particles. Using the replica method, we analytically investigate
the scaling behavior of the model near the jamming transition point. We find that the gap distribution
remains finite and regular even at the jamming transition point, where instead the corresponding
distribution for spherical particles exhibits a power law scaling. The regularity of the gap distribution
significantly affects the scaling behavior: even infinitesimal asphericity alters the critical
exponents of the contact number, shear modulus, and cage size, sufficiently near the jamming transition
point. Finally, we compute analytically the vibrational density of states of the model, showing
that it is made of three well-separated bands, whose asymptotic behavior is consistent with previous
results found in numerical simulations of ellipsoids.
