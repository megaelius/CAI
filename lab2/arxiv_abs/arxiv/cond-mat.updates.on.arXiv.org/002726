While most models of randomly connected networks assume nodes with simple dynamics, nodes in realistic
highly connected networks, such as neurons in the brain, exhibit intrinsic dynamics over multiple
timescales. We analyze how the dynamical properties of nodes (such as single neurons) and recurrent
connections interact to shape the effective dynamics in large randomly connected networks. A novel
dynamical mean-field theory for strongly connected networks of multi-dimensional rate units
shows that the power spectrum of the network activity in the chaotic phase emerges from a nonlinear
sharpening of the frequency response function of single units. For the case of two-dimensional
rate units with strong adaptation, we find that the network exhibits a state of "resonant chaos",
characterized by robust, narrow-band stochastic oscillations. The coherence of stochastic oscillations
is maximal at the onset of chaos and their correlation time scales with the adaptation timescale
of single units. Surprisingly, the resonance frequency can be predicted from the properties of
isolated units, even in the presence of heterogeneity in the adaptation parameters. In the presence
of these internally-generated chaotic fluctuations, the transmission of weak, low-frequency
signals is strongly enhanced by adaptation, whereas signal transmission is not influenced by adaptation
in the non-chaotic regime. Our theoretical framework can be applied to other mechanisms at the level
of single nodes, such as synaptic filtering, refractoriness or spike synchronization. These results
advance our understanding of the interaction between the dynamics of single units and recurrent
connectivity, which is a fundamental step toward the description of biologically realistic network
models in the brain, or, more generally, networks of other physical or man-made complex dynamical
units.
