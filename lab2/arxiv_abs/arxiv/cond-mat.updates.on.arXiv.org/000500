One of the enticing features common to most of the two-dimensional electronic systems that are currently
at the forefront of materials science research is the ability to easily introduce a combination
of planar deformations and bending in the system. Since the electronic properties are ultimately
determined by the details of atomic orbital overlap, such mechanical manipulations translate
into modified electronic properties. Here, we present a general-purpose optimization framework
for tailoring physical properties of two-dimensional electronic systems by manipulating the
state of local strain, allowing a one-step route from their design to experimental implementation.
A definite example, chosen for its relevance in light of current experiments in graphene nanostructures,
is the optimization of the experimental parameters that generate a prescribed spatial profile
of pseudomagnetic fields in graphene. But the method is general enough to accommodate a multitude
of possible experimental parameters and conditions whereby deformations can be imparted to the
graphene lattice, and complies, by design, with graphene's elastic equilibrium and elastic compatibility
constraints. As a result, it efficiently answers the inverse problem of determining the optimal
values of a set of external or control parameters that result in a graphene deformation whose associated
pseudomagnetic field profile best matches a prescribed target. The ability to address this inverse
problem in an expedited way is one key step for practical implementations of the concept of two-dimensional
systems with electronic properties strain-engineered to order. The general-purpose nature of
this calculation strategy means that it can be easily applied to the optimization of other relevant
physical quantities which directly depend on the local strain field, not just in graphene but in
other two-dimensional electronic membranes.
