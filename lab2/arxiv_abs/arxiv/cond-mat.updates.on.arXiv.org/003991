Long-range effective methods are ubiquitous in physics and in quantum theory, in particular. Furthermore,
the reliability of such methods is higher when the nature of short-ranged interactions need not
be modeled explicitly. This may be necessary for two reasons: (1) there are interactions that occur
over a short range that cannot be accurately modeled with a potential function and/or (2) the entire
Hamiltonian loses its reliability when applied at short distances. This work is an investigation
of the utility and consequences of omitting a finite region of space from quantum mechanical analysis,
accomplished by imposition of an artificial boundary behind which obscured short-ranged physical
effects may operate. With this method, a free function of integration that depends on momentum is
interpreted as a function encoding information needed to match a long-distance wavefunction to
an appropriate state function on the other side of the boundary. Omitting part of the space from analysis
implies that the strict unitarity requirement of quantum mechanics must be relaxed, since particles
can actually propagate beyond the boundary. Strict orthogonality of eigenmodes and hermiticity
of the Hamiltonian must also be relaxed in this method; however, all of these canonical relations
are obeyed when averaged over sufficiently long times. What is achieved, therefore, appears to
be an effective long-wavelength theory, at least for stationary systems. As examples, the quantum
defect theory of the one-dimensional Coulomb interaction is recovered, as well as a new perspective
of the inverse-square potential and the free particle, as well as the Wigner time delay associated
with contact interactions. Potential applications of this method may include three-dimensional
atomic systems and two-dimensional systems, such as graphene.
