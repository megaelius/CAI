We propose a model based on extreme value statistics (EVS) and combine it with different models for
single asperity contact, including adhesive and elasto-plastic contacts, to derive a relation
between the applied load and the friction force on a rough interface. We find that when the summit
distribution is Gumbel, and the contact model is Hertzian we have the closest conformity with Amontons
law. The range over which Gumbel distribution mimics Amontons law is wider than the Greenwood-Williamson
Model. However exact conformity with Amonton's law does not seem for any of the well-known EVS distributions.
On the other hand plastic deformations in contact area reduce the relative change of pressure slightly
with Gumbel distribution. Elastic-plastic contact mixes with Gumbel distribution for summits.
it shows the best conformity with Amonton`s law. Other extreme value statistics are also studied,
and results presented. We combine Gumbel distribution with GW-Mc Cool model which is an improved
case of GW model, it takes into account a bandwidth for wavelengths of {\alpha}. Comparison of this
model with original GW-Mc Cool model and other simplified versions of BGT reveals that Gumbel distribution
has a better conformity with Amonton`s law for all values of {\alpha}. When adhesive contact model
is used, the main observation is that for zero or even negative applied load, there is some friction.
Asperities with height even less than the separation of two surfaces are in contact. For a small value
of adhesion parameter, a better conformity with Amontons law is observed. Relative pressure increases
for stronger adhesion which means that adhesion controlled friction dominated by load controlled
friction. We also observe that adhesion increases on a surface with a lower value of roughness.
