The coil-stretch transition in extensional flows of viscoelastic dilute polymer solutions is
known to be associated with a strong hysteresis in molecular conformations and rheo-optical properties.
At infinite dilution, hysteresis is caused by the large difference in frictional drag coefficient
between undeformed isotropic polymer coils and highly stretched conformations. At the low extension
rates in the hysteresis regime, stretched molecules pervade larger volumes than equilibrium coils
since the flow is too weak to suppress transverse fluctuations. The onset of intermolecular overlap
occurs for such stretched conformations at polymer concentrations much smaller than c*, the conventional
critical overlap concentration for equilibrium coils. Therefore, for a range of concentrations
c < c*, intramolecular hydrodynamic interactions may be significantly screened in stretched
conformations. Scaling arguments based on "blob" concepts are used here to argue that the stretched
state drag coefficient can grow strongly with concentration in the dilute regime. A dumbbell model
with conformation-dependent drag model is used to predict a concomitant strong enhancement of
coil-stretch hysteresis with increasing concentration in the dilute regime. This extensional
flow induced self-concentration leads to a maximum in hysteretic effects around c*, which progressively
diminish in the semi-dilute regime where screening in isotropic coils reduces the difference in
drag coefficient between stretched and coiled states. It is shown that the concentration dependence
observed by Clasen et al. (2006) of capillary-thinning dynamics in liquid bridges of polymer solutions
provides direct evidence of coil-stretch hysteresis enhancement by self-concentration.
