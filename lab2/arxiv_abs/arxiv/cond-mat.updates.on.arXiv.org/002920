Numerous physical properties of CaPd3Ti4O12 (CPTO) and CaPd3V4O12 (CPVO) double perovskites
have been explored based on density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters
fairly agree with the experimental data to confirm their stability. The mechanical stability of
these two compounds was clearly observed by the Born stability criteria. To rationalize the mechanical
behavior, we investigate elastic constants, bulk, shear and Young's modulus, Pugh's ratio, Poisson's
ratio and elastic anisotropy index. The ductility index confirms that both materials are ductile
in nature. The electronic band structure of CPTO and CPVO reveals the direct band gap semiconducting
in nature and metallic characteristics, respectively. The calculated partial density of states
indicates the strong hybridization between Pd 4d and O 2p orbital electrons for CPTO and Pd 4d and
V 3d O 2p for CPVO. The study of electronic charge density map confirms the coexistence of covalent,
ionic and metallic bonding for both compounds. Fermi surface calculation of CPVO ensures both electron
and hole like surfaces indicating the multiple band nature. In the midst of optical properties,
photoconductivity and absorption coefficient of both compounds reveal well qualitative compliance
with consequences of band structure computations. Among the thermodynamic properties, the Debye
temperature has been calculated to correlate its topical features including thermoelectric behavior.
The studied thermoelectric transport properties of CPTO yielded the Seebeck coefficient (186
microVK-1), power factor (11.9 microWcm-1K-2) and figure of merit (ZT) value of about 0.8 at 800
K indicate that this material could be a promising candidate for thermoelectric device application.
