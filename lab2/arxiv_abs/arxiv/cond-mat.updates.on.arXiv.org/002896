Coherent wave effects of thermal phonons hold promise of transformative opportunities in thermal
transport control but remain largely unexplored due to the small wavelength of thermal phonons,
typically below a few nanometers. This small length scale indicates that, instead of artificial
phononic crystals, a more promising direction is to examine the coherent phonon effects in natural
materials with hierarchical superstructures matching the thermal phonon wavelength. In this
work, we use first-principles simulations to characterize the previously unstudied thermal properties
of D-graphene and T-graphene, two-dimensional carbon allotropes based upon the traditional graphene
structure but containing a secondary, in-plane periodicity. We find that despite very similar
atomic structure and bonding strength, D-graphene and T-graphene possess significantly different
thermal properties than that of pristine graphene. At room temperature, the calculated thermal
conductivity of D-graphene and T-graphene is 600 Wm-1K-1 and 800 Wm-1K-1 compared to over 3000 Wm-1K-1
for graphene. We attribute these distinct properties to the presence of naturally occurring, low
frequency optical phonon modes that display characteristics of phonon coherence and arise from
a folding of the acoustic modes and the associated frequency gap opening, a phenomenon also found
in superlattices where an out of plane periodicity is introduced. Furthermore, we observe significantly
enhanced Umklapp scatterings in D- and T-graphene that largely suppress the hydrodynamic phonon
transport in pristine graphene. Our study presents D-graphene and T-graphene as ideal model systems
to explore the coherent phonon effects in 2D and demonstrates the potential of using coherent phonon
effects to significantly modify thermal transport of 2D materials without making drastic changes
to their fundamental compositions.
