Statistical models for families of evolutionary related proteins have recently gained interest:
in particular pairwise Potts models, as those inferred by the Direct-Coupling Analysis, have been
able to extract information about the three-dimensional structure of folded proteins, and about
the effect of amino-acid substitutions in proteins. These models are typically requested to reproduce
the one- and two-point statistics of the amino-acid usage in these protein families, i.e. ~the so-called
residue conservation and covariation statistics. Pairwise Potts models are the maximum-entropy
models achieving this. While being successful, these models depend on huge numbers of ad hoc introduced
parameters, which have to be estimated from finite amount of data and whose biophysical interpretation
remains unclear. Here we propose an approach to parameter reduction, which is based on collective-variable
selection. It naturally leads to the formulation of statistical sequence models in terms of Hopfield-Potts
models, with the Hopfield patterns being the collective variables. These models can be accurately
inferred using a mapping to restricted Boltzmann machines and persistent contrastive divergence.
We show that, when applied to protein data, even 20-40 patterns are sufficient to obtain statistically
generative models. The Hopfield patterns are interpretable in terms of sequence motifs and may
be used to clusterize amino-acid sequences into functional sub-families. However, the distributed
collective nature of these motifs intrinsically limits the ability of Hopfield-Potts models in
predicting contact maps, showing the necessity of developing models going beyond the Hopfield-Potts
models discussed here.
