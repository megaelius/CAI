The interplay between lattice topology, frustration, and spin quantum number, $s$, is explored
for the Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAFM) on the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices
(square, honeycomb, CaVO, SHD, SrCuBO, triangle, bounce, trellis, maple-leaf, star, and kagome).
We show the CCM provides consistently accurate results when compared to the results of other approximate
methods. The $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ model state provides lower ground-state energies than
those of the $q=0$ model state for the kagome and star lattices for most values of $s$. The $q=0$ model
state provides lower ground-state energies only for $s=1/2$ for the kagome lattice and $s=1/2$
and $s=1$ for the star lattice. The kagome and star lattices demonstrate the least amount of magnetic
ordering and the unfrustrated lattices (square, honeycomb, SHD, and CaVO) demonstrate the most
magnetic ordering for all values of $s$. The SrCuBO and triangular lattices also demonstrate high
levels of magnetic ordering, while the remaining lattices (bounce, maple-leaf, and trellis) tend
to lie between these extremes, again for all values of $s$. These results also clearly reflect the
strong increase in magnetic order with increasing spin quantum number $s$ for all lattices. The
ground-state energy, $E_g/(NJs^2)$, scales with $s^{-1}$ to first order, as expected from spin-wave
theory, although the order parameter, $M/s$, scales with $s^{-1}$ for most of the lattices only.
Self-consistent spin-wave theory calculations indicated previously that $M/s$ scales with $s^{-2/3}$
for the kagome lattice HAFM, whereas previous CCM results (replicated here also) suggested that
$M/s$ scales with $s^{-1/2}$. By using similar arguments, we find here also that $M/s$ scales with
$s^{-1/3}$ on the star lattice and with $s^{-2/3}$ on the SrCuBO lattice.
