While isotropic in-plane swelling problems for thin elastic sheets have been studied extensively
in recent years, many shape-programmable materials, including nematic solids and 3D-printed
structures, are anisotropic, as are most industrial sheet materials. In this theoretical work,
we consider central swelling and shrinkage of plates of aspect ratio and material properties relevant
to the manufacture of engineered wood composite panels in which both in-plane swelling and material
stiffness are highly orthotropic, leading to multiple separations in energy scales. With transverse
swelling in the soft direction, and gradients in the stiff direction, the warped plates adopt two
distinct types of configurations, axisymmetric and twisted, which we illustrate with toy models.
We employ a two-parameter family of isometries to embed the metric programmed by the swelling, thus
reducing the problem to one of minimizing bending energy alone. A simple argument is seen to closely
predict averaged axisymmetric curvatures. While purely cylindrical shapes are unobtainable
by pure in-plane swelling, they can be closely approximated in a highly anisotropic system. However,
anisotropy can favor twisting, and breaks a degenerate soft deformation mode associated with minimal
surfaces in isotropic materials. Bifurcations from axisymmetric to twisted shapes can be induced
by anisotropy or by certain attributes of a central shrinkage profile. Finally, we note how our findings
indicate practical limitations on the diagnosis of moisture inhomogeneities in manufactured
panels by observation of warped conformations, due to the sensitivity of the qualitative response
to specifics of the profile.
