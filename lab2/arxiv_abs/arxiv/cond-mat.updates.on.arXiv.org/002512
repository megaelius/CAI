Tin-chalcogenides SnX (X = Te, Se and S) have been arousing research interest due to their thermoelectric
physical properties. The two-dimensional (2D) counterparts, which are expected to enhance the
property, nevertheless, have not been fully explored because of many possible structures. Generating
variable composition of 2D Sn$_{1-x}$X$_{x}$ systems (X = Te, Se and S) has been performed using
global searching method based on evolutionary algorithm combining with density functional calculations.
A new hexagonal phase named by $\beta'$-SnX is found by Universal Structure Predictor Evolutionary
Xtallography (USPEX), and the structural stability has been further checked by phonon dispersion
calculation and the elasticity criteria. The $\beta'$-SnTe is the most stable among all possible
2D phases of SnTe including those experimentally available phases. Further, $\beta'$ phases of
SnSe and SnS are also found energetically close to the most stable phases. High thermoelectronic
(TE) performance has been achieved in the $\beta'$-SnX phases, which have dimensionless figure
of merit (ZT) as high as $\sim$0.96 to 3.81 for SnTe, $\sim$0.93 to 2.51 for SnSe and $\sim$1.19 to
3.18 for SnS at temperature ranging from 300 K to 900 K with practically attainable carrier concentration
of 5$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. The high TE performance is resulted from a high power factor which
is attributed to the quantum confinement of 2D materials and the band convergence near Fermi level,
as well as low thermal conductivity mainly from both low elastic constants due to weak inter-Sn bonding
strength and strong lattice anharmonicity.
