Coalescence of tiny-sized particles into large-sized particles has been an overlooked phenomenon
since long. This study discusses developing large-sized particles under the coalescence of tiny-sized
particles while varying concentration of gold precursor in custom-built setup namely, pulse-based
electron-photon-solution interface process. Under the fixed ratio of pulse OFF to ON time and other
parameters, tiny-sized particles of different sizes develop depending on the amount of gold precursor.
Double-packets of nanoshape energy bind atoms into their own shape when dealing below compact gold
monolayer assembly forming at solution surface. Between precursor concentration 0.07 mM to 0.90
mM, many tiny-sized particles are developed in a joined triangular-shape, they are in the large
number at 0.30 mM and at 0.60 mM. On dividing joined triangular-shaped tiny particle block into two
tiny-shaped particles under the certain mechanism, each of them has the shape of an equilateral
triangular-shape. Their atoms of each one-dimensional array elongate under the exerting force
along the opposite poles converting them into a structure of smooth element. Such tiny-sized particles
pack to assemble structures of smooth elements for developing their different geometric anisotropic
shapes at the center point of light glow where no more surface format force remains exerting. At 0.05
mM and 1.20 mM, tiny-sized particles do not develop in a triangular-shape largely where their packings
do not deal exertion of forces in uniform manner resulting into develop distorted particles. Photons
reflected at the surface of anisotropic particles indicate different structure to distorted ones.
Under different argon flow rate, particles possess the identical shapes but may alter the structure
of elongated atoms and size. This study clarifies that under what concentration of gold, certain
size and shape particle develops.
