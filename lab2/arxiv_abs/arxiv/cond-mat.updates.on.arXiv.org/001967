Yttria stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) pellets with different crystallite sizes were irradiated with
80 MeV Ag$^{6+}$ ions at room temperature and 1000 K to understand the role of crystallite size/material
microstructure and irradiation temperature on the radiation tolerance against high electronic
energy loss (S$_e$). X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal that, irrespective
of the irradiation temperature, the nano-crystalline samples suffered more damage as compared
to the bulk-like sample. A reduction in the irradiation damage i.e. improvement in the radiation
tolerance, was observed for all the samples irradiated at 1000 K. The reduction in the damage, however,
was remarkably higher for the two nano-crystalline samples compared to the bulk-like sample, and
hence the difference in the damage between the bulk-like and nano-crystalline samples was also
significantly lower at 1000 K than that at room temperature. The irradiation damage, against S$_e$,
was thus found to be critically dependent on the interplay between the irradiation temperature
and crystallite size. These results are explained with the help of detailed theoretical calculations/simulations
based on the 'in-elastic thermal spike' model by taking into consideration the combined effect
of crystallite size and environmental (irradiation) temperature on the electron-phonon coupling
factor and lattice thermal conductivity (and hence on the resulting thermal spike). Our results
are crucial from the fundamental perspective of comprehending the size and temperature dependent
radiation damage against S$_e$ ; and also for a number of applications, in various radiation environments,
where nano-materials are being envisioned for use.
