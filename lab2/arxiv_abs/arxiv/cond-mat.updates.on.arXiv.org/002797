We discuss the approximate phenomenological description of the motion of a single second-class
particle in a two-species totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on a 1D lattice.
Initially, the second class particle is located at the origin and to its left, all sites are occupied
with first class particles while to its right, all sites are vacant. Ferrari and Kipnis proved that
in any particular realization, the average velocity of the second class particle tends to a constant,
but this mean value has a wide variation in different histories. We discuss this phenomena, here
called the TASEP Speed Process, in an approximate effective medium description, in which the second
class particle moves in a random background of the space-time dependent average density of the first
class particles. We do this in three different approximations of increasing accuracy, treating
the motion of the second-class particle first as a simple biassed random walk in a continuum Langevin
equation, then as a biased Markovian random walk with space and time dependent jump rates, and finally
as a Non-Markovian biassed walk with a non-exponential distribution of waiting times between jumps.
We find that, when the displacement at time $T$ is $x_0$, the conditional expectation of displacement,
at time $zT$ ($z>1$) is $zx_0$, and the variance of the displacement only varies as $z(z-1)T$. We
extend this approach to describe the trajectories of a tagged particle in the case of a \emph{finite}
lattice, where there are $L$ classes of particles on an $L$-site line, initially placed in the order
of increasing class number. Lastly, we discuss a variant of the problem in which the exchanges between
adjacent particles happened at rates proportional to the difference in their labels.
