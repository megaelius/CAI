Due to critical environmental and technological issues, there is a pressing need to switch from
current refrigeration methods based on compression of gases to novel solid-state cooling technologies.
Solid-state cooling is based on the thermal response of materials to external magnetic, electric,
or mechanic fields, the so-called caloric effect. The electrocaloric (EC) effect, which is caused
by electric fields and typically occurs in polar materials, is particularly promising from a technological
point of view owing to its good scalability and natural implementation in circuitry. Simulation
of EC effects represents an efficient and physically insightful strategy for advancing the field
of solid-state cooling by complementing, and in some cases guiding, experiments. Theoretical
estimation of EC effects can be achieved with different approaches ranging from computationally
inexpensive but physically insightful phenomenological free-energy models to computationally
very demanding and quantitatively accurate first-principles methods. In this Chapter, we review
EC simulation approaches that rely on first-principles methods. In this category, we include ab
initio quasi-harmonic methods, bond-valence and classical interatomic potentials and effective
Hamiltonians. In analogy to the experiments, these simulation approaches can be used to estimate
EC effects either directly or indirectly and we review here well-established protocols that can
be followed for each case. The Chapter finalises with a collection of representative examples in
which first-principles based approaches have been used to predict and understand original EC effects.
