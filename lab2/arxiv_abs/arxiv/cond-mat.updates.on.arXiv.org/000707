We classify the band degeneracies in 3D crystals with screw symmetry $n_m$ and broken $\mathcal
P*\mathcal T$ symmetry, where $\mathcal P$ stands for spatial inversion and $\mathcal T$ for time
reversal. The generic degeneracies along symmetry lines are Weyl nodes: Chiral contact points
between pairs of bands. They can be single nodes with a chiral charge of magnitude $|\chi|=1$ or composite
nodes with $|\chi|=2$ or $3$, and the possible $\chi$ values only depend on the order $n$ of the axis,
not on the pitch $m/n$ of the screw. Double Weyl nodes require $n=4$ or 6, and triple nodes require
$n=6$. In all cases the bands split linearly along the axis, and for composite nodes the splitting
is quadratic on the orthogonal plane. This is true for triple as well as double nodes, due to the presence
in the effective two-band Hamiltonian of a nonchiral quadratic term that masks the chiral cubic
dispersion. If $\mathcal T$ symmetry is present and $\mathcal P$ is broken there may exist on some
symmetry lines Weyl nodes pinned to $\mathcal T$-invariant momenta, which in some cases are unavoidable.
In the absence of other symmetries their classification depends on $n$, $m$, and the type of $\mathcal
T$ symmetry. With spinless $\mathcal T$ such $\mathcal T$-invariant Weyl nodes are always double
nodes, while with spinful $\mathcal T$ they can be single or triple nodes. $\mathcal T$-invariant
triples nodes can occur not only on 6-fold axes but also on 3-fold ones, and their in-plane band splitting
is cubic, not quadratic as in the case of generic triple nodes. These rules are illustrated by means
of first-principles calculations for hcp cobalt, a $\mathcal T$-broken, $\mathcal P$-invariant
crystal with $6_3$ symmetry, and for trigonal tellurium and hexagonal NbSi$_2$, which are $\mathcal
T$-invariant, $\mathcal P$-broken crystals with 3-fold and 6-fold screw symmetry respectively.
