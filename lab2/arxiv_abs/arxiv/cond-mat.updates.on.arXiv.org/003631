An important task in quantum physics is the estimation of local quantities for ground states of local
Hamiltonians. Recently, [Ambainis, CCC 2014] defined the complexity class P^QMA[log], and motivated
its study by showing that the physical task of estimating the expectation value of a local observable
against the ground state of a local Hamiltonian is P^QMA[log]-complete. In this paper, we continue
the study of P^QMA[log], obtaining the following lower and upper bounds. Lower bounds (hardness
results): (1) The P^QMA[log]-completeness result of [Ambainis, CCC 2014] requires O(log n)-local
observables and Hamiltonians. We show that simulating even a single qubit measurement on ground
states of 5-local Hamiltonians is P^QMA[log]-complete, resolving an open question of Ambainis.
(2) We formalize the complexity theoretic study of estimating two-point correlation functions
against ground states, and show that this task is similarly P^QMA[log]-complete. (3) We identify
a flaw in [Ambainis, CCC 2014] regarding a P^UQMA[log]-hardness proof for estimating spectral
gaps of local Hamiltonians. By introducing a "query validation" technique, we build on [Ambainis,
CCC 2014] to obtain P^UQMA[log]-hardness for estimating spectral gaps under polynomial-time
Turing reductions. Upper bounds (containment in complexity classes): P^QMA[log] is thought of
as "slightly harder" than QMA. We justify this formally by exploiting the hierarchical voting technique
of [Beigel, Hemachandra, Wechsung, SCT 1989] to show P^QMA[log] is in PP. This improves the containment
QMA is in PP [Kitaev, Watrous, STOC 2000]. This work contributes a rigorous treatment of the subtlety
involved in studying oracle classes in which the oracle solves a promise problem. This is particularly
relevant for quantum complexity theory, where most natural classes such as BQP and QMA are defined
as promise classes.
