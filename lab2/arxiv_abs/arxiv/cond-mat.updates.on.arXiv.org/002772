A condensate of pairs in an isolated, homogeneous, unpolarised, finite-size spin 1/2 Fermi gas
at low nonzero temperature T, undergoes with time a phase change with a random component, due to coupling
to the gas thermal phonons. With the quantum second Josephson relation relating the derivative
of the condensate phase operator to the phonon occupation numbers, and linearised kinetic equations
giving the evolution of occupation number fluctuations, we access the behaviour of the phase change
variance at times much longer than the phonon collision time. The case of a convex phonon branch is
similar to the Bose gas case: the leading collisional processes are the Beliaev-Landau 3-phonons
processes, and the variance is the sum of a ballistic term and of a delayed diffusive term, whose analytical
expressions are given in the thermodynamic limit. The concave case is more exotic. It is analysed
at time scales $T^{-9}$, allowing one to restrict to 2 phonons $\rightarrow$ 2 phonons small-angle
Landau-Khalatnikov processes. The total number of phonons is conserved and the phonon mean occupation
numbers at equilibrium can exhibit a negative chemical potential, assumed isotropic. The phase
change variance is then the sum of a ballistic term, of a diffusive term, of exotic subsubleading
terms and of a constant term. The analytic expression of some of the corresponding coefficients
is obtained, as well as the diverging leading behavior of the other ones when the phonon chemical
potential tends to 0. When this chemical potential is 0, the variance sub-ballistic part becomes
superdiffusive, with an exponent 5/3 and an exactly-known coefficient. For a nonzero infinitesimal
phonon chemical potential, a law is found, interpolating between superdiffusive and diffusive
phase spreading. Also new results are obtained on the phonon Landau-Khalatnikov damping rate,
in particular at negative phonon chemical potential.
