We outline a kinetic theory of non-thermal fixed points for the example of a dilute Bose gas, partially
reviewing results obtained earlier, thereby extending, complementing, generalizing and straightening
them out. We study universal dynamics after a cooling quench, focusing on situations where the time
evolution represents a pure rescaling of spatial correlations, with time defining the scale parameter.
The non-equilibrium initial condition set by the quench induces a redistribution of particles
in momentum space. Depending on conservation laws, this can take the form of a wave-turbulent flux
or of a more general self-similar evolution, signaling the critically slowed approach to a non-thermal
fixed point. We identify such fixed points using a non-perturbative kinetic theory of collective
scattering between highly occupied long-wavelength modes. In contrast, a wave-turbulent flux,
possible in the perturbative Boltzmann regime, builds up in a critically accelerated self-similar
manner. A key result is the simple analytical universal scaling form of the non-perturbative many-body
scattering matrix, for which we lay out the concrete conditions under which it applies. We derive
the scaling exponents for the time evolution as well as for the power-law tail of the momentum distribution
function, for a general dynamical critical exponent $z$ and an anomalous scaling dimension $\eta$.
The approach of the non-thermal fixed point is, in particular, found to involve a rescaling of momenta
in time $t$ by $t^{\beta}$, with $\beta=1/z$, within our kinetic approach independent of $\eta$.
We confirm our analytical predictions by numerically evaluating the kinetic scattering integral
as well as the non-perturbative many-body coupling function. As a side result we obtain a possible
finite-size interpretation of wave-turbulent scaling recently measured by Navon et al.
