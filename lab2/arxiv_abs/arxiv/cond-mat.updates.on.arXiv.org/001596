The first-passage (resp. first-return) distribution measures the probability for the time a stochastic
variable needs to go from one region to another (the same) region. Each model in which these times
are computed possesses its own peculiarities but, in spite of the effort of dealing individually
with each of them, one can still look for common characteristics. We present here an analytical framework
to study the first-passage and first-return distributions for the broad family of models described
by the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in finite domains. When the diffusion coefficient
is positive and the drift term is bounded, like the random walk, both distributions obey a universal
law that exhibits a power-law decay of exponent -3/2 for intermediate times. We also discuss the
influence of absorbing states in the dynamics. Remarkably, the random walk exponent is still found,
as far as the departure and arrival regions are far enough from the absorbing state, but the range
of times where the power law is observed becomes narrow. Close enough to the absorbing point, though,
new universal laws emerge, their particular properties depending on the behavior of the diffusion
and drift. We focus on the case of a diffusion term vanishing linearly. In this case, FP and FR distributions
show the universality of the voter model, characterized by the eventual presence of a power law with
exponent -2. As an illustration of the general theory, we compare it with exact analytical solutions
and extensive numerical simulations of a two-parameter voter-like family models. Thus, we study
the behavior of the first-passage and first-return distributions by tuning the importance of the
absorbing points throughout changes of the parameters. Finally, the possibility of inferring
relevant information about the steady-sate probability distribution of a model from the FR and
FR distributions is addressed.
