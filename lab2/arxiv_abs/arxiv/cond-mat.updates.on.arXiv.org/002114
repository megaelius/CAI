Various angle-dependent measurements in hole-doped cuprates suggested that Non-Fermi liquid
(NFL) and Fermi-liquid (FL) self-energies coexist in the Brillouin zone. Moreover, it is also found
that NFL self-energies survive up to the overdoped region where the resistivity features a global
FL-behavior. To address this problem, here we compute the momentum dependent self-energy from
a single band Hubbard model. The self-energy is calculated self-consistently by using a momentum-dependent
density-fluctuation (MRDF) method. One of our main result is that the computed self-energy exhibits
a NFL-like frequency dependence only in the antinodal region, and FL-like behavior elsewhere,
and retains its analytic form at all momenta and dopings. The dominant source of NFL self-energy
in the antinodal region stems from the self-energy-dressed fluctuations between the itinerant
and localized densities as self-consistency is invoked. We also calculate the DC conductivity
by including the full momentum dependent self-energy. We find that the resistivity-temperature
exponent n becomes 1 near the optimal doping, while the NFL self-energy occupies largest momentum-space
volume. Surprisingly, even in the NFL state near the optimal doping, the nodal region contains FL-like
self-energies; while in the under- and over-dopings (n ~ 2), the antinodal region remains NFL-like.
These results highlight the non-local correlation physics in cuprates and in other similar intermediately
correlated materials, where a direct link between the microscopic single-particle spectral properties
and the macroscopic transport behavior can not be well established.
