This study investigates the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation on a cation-doped surface (Bi$_{x}$M$_{y}$)$_2$MoO$_6$
where (M = Fe, La, Yb) in both the orthorhombic and monoclinic configurations using a density functional
theory (DFT) approach with experimentally validated model inputs. The proceeding discussion
focuses on the Heyrovsky-type reactions for both the associative and dissociative reaction pathway
related to nitrogen reduction. Key fundamental insight in the reduction mechanism is discussed
that relates the material properties of the substitutional ions to the nitrogen and hydrogen affinities.
Physical insight is gathered through interpretation of bound electronic states at the surface.
Compositional phases of higher Fe and Yb concentrations resulted in decreased Mo-O binding and
increased affinity between Mo and the N and H species on the surface. The modulation of the Mo-O binding
is induced by strain as Yb and Fe are implemented, this, in turn, shifts energy levels and modulates
the band gap energy by approximately 0.2 eV. This modification of Mo-O bond as substitution occurs
is a result of the orbital hybridization of M-O (M = Fe, Yb) that causes a strong orbital interaction
that shifts states. The optimal composition was predicted to be an orthorhombic configuration
of (Bi$_{0.75}$Fe$_{0.25}$)$_2$MoO$_6$ with a predicted maximum thermodynamic energy barrier
of 1.4 eV. This composition demonstrates effective nitrogen and hydrogen affinity that follows
the associative or biological nitrogen fixation pathway. Also, the same composition proved ideal
for the dissociative pathway that resulted in 3.2 eV for predicted maximum thermodynamic energy
barrier.
