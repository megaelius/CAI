A search for new topological quantum systems is challenging due to the requirement of non{trivial
band connectivity that leads to protected surface states of electrons. A progress in this field
was primarily due to a realization of band inversion mechanism between even and odd parity states
that was proven to be very useful in both predicting many of such systems and our understanding their
topological properties. Despite many proposed materials assume the band inversion between s and
p (or p/d, d/f) electrons, here, we explore a different mechanism where the occupied d states subjected
to a tetrahedral crystal field produce an active t2g manifold behaving as a state with an effective
orbital momentum equal to negative one, and pushing jeff = 1=2 doublet at a higher energy. Via hybridization
with nearest neighbor orbitals realizable, e.g., in a zincblende structural environment, this
allows a formation of odd parity state whose subsequent band inversion with an unoccupied s band
becomes possible, prompting us to look for the compounds with Cu+1 ionic state. Chemical valence
arguments coupled to a search in materials database lead us to systematically investigate electronic
structures and topological properties of CuY (Y=F, Cl, Br, I) and CuXO (X=Li, Na, K, Rb) families
of compounds. Our theoretical results show that CuF displays a behavior characteristic of an ideal
Weyl semimetal with 24 Weyl nodes at the bulk Brillouin Zone. We also find that another compounds
CuNaO and CuLiO are the s-d inversion type topological insulators. Results for their electronic
structures and corresponding surfaces states are presented and discussed in the context of their
topological properties.
