The microstructural features and high-temperature oxidation resistance of hybrid (TiC+TiB)
networks reinforced Ti-6Al-4V composites were investigated after fabricated with reaction hot
pressing technique. The inhomogeneous distribution of hybrid reinforcers resulted in a sort of
stress-induced grain refinement for {\alpha}-Ti matrix phase, which was further facilitated
by heterogeneous nucleation upon additive interfaces. HRTEM analyses revealed the crystallographic
orientation relation between TiB and alpha-Ti phases as (201)TiB//(-1100)alpha-Ti plus [11-2]//[0001]
alpha-Ti, while TiC and {\alpha}-Ti phases maintained the interrelation of (-200)TiC//(-2110)
{\alpha}-Ti and [001]TiC//[01-10] alpha-Ti. The hybridly reinforced Ti-6Al-4V/(TiC+TiB) composites
displayed superior oxidation resistance to both the sintered matrix alloy and the two composites
reinforced solely with TiC or TiB addition during the cyclic oxidation at 873, 973 and 1073 K respectively
for 100 h. The hybrid reinforcers volume fraction was a more influential factor to improve oxidation
resistance than the matrix alloy powder size. As temperature rose from 873 to 1073 K, the oxidation
kinetics transferred from the nearly parabolic type through qusilinear tendency into the finally
linear mode. This corresponded to the morphological transition of oxide scales from a continuous
protective film to a partially damaged layer and ended up with the complete spallation of alternating
alumina and rutile multilayers. A phenomenological model was proposed to elucidate the growth
process of oxides scales. The release of thermal stress, the suppression of oxygen diffusion and
the fastening of oxide adherence were found as the three major mechanisms to enhance the oxidation
resistance of hybrid reinforced composites.
