The functional consequences of convenient size of subcellular structures have been analysed in
the past and currently the questions regarding the underlying physical mechanisms for their genesis,
the sensing of their size by the cell and maintenance of their convenient size in the steady state
are receiving much attention. Long cell protrusions, which are effectively one-dimensional,
are highly dynamic subcellular structures and their length keep fluctuating about the mean length
even in the the steady state. For optimal functioning, particularly as sensors, the length of a specific
protrusion must not cross a narrow band bounded by two thresholds. However, fluctuations may drive
the length beyond these thresholds. We study generic stochastic models of length control of long
cell protrusions; the special cases of this model correspond to specific examples of different
types of cell appendages. Exploiting the techniques of level crossings developed for random excursions
of stochastic process, we have derived analytical expressions of passage times for hitting various
thresholds, sojourn times of random excursions beyond the threshold and the extreme lengths attained
during the lifetime of these protrusions. As a concrete example, we apply our general formulae to
flagella (also called cilia) of eukaryotic cells thereby getting estimates of the typical length
scales and time scales associated with the various aspects of random fluctuations. Since most of
the earlier works investigated only the mean length of cell protrusions, our study of the fluctuations
opens a new horizon in the field of subcellular size control.
