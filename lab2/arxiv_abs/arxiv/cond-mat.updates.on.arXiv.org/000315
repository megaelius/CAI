We consider the corrugated monolayer graphene membrane electromagnetic (from both valleys) response
in terahertz range. We study the generated in irradiated graphene total current for the first time
taking into account both the synthetic electric fields arising due to the (inevitable) presence
in graphene of inherent out-of-plane nanodeformations and the double-valleys energy spectrum
of Dirac charge particles. Our approach is based on atomistic quantum mechanics used for the description
of valence ${\pi}-{\sigma}$ bonds changes generated by activating external periodic electric
field and also for mechanism of Dirac electron interaction with this time-dependent perturbation.
We consider the problem in the framework of the model of noninteracting Dirac electrons. Assuming
surface corrugations not to be very rough we obtain for weak fields the formula for the total current
induced in graphene membrane. Our formula describes the curved current lines in the linear in $E^{ext}(t)$
approximation for the given graphene surface form. We show that the local direction of current lines
is determined by synthetic electric field whose direction may essentially differ from the one of
the external field and depends on the local curvature of the graphene membrane. We also demonstrate
that valley currents generated by the external field have nonzero elliptic polarization angles
depending on the point (x,y). Valley currents are shown to rotate in opposite directions in different
valleys. The results obtained below can be applied to the analysis of different devices in terahertz
optics and optoelectronics and the imaging experiments at the Dirac point.
