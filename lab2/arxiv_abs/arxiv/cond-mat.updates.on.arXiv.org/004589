The concept of jamming has attracted great research interest due to its broad relevance in soft matter
such as liquids, glasses, colloids, foams, and granular materials, and its deep connection to the
sphere packing problem and optimization problems. Here we show that the domain of amorphous jammed
states of frictionless spheres can be significantly extended, from the well-known jamming-point
at a fixed density, to a jamming-plane that spans the density and shear strain axes. We explore the
jamming-plane, via athermal and thermal simulations of compression and shear jamming, with a help
of an efficient swap algorithm to prepare initial equilibrium configurations. The jamming-plane
can be divided into reversible-jamming and irreversible-jamming regimes, based on the reversibility
of the route from the initial configuration to jamming. Our results suggest that the irreversible-jamming
behavior reflects an escape from the meta-stable glass basin to which the initial configuration
belongs to, or the absence of such basins. All jammed states, either compression or shear jammed,
are isostatic, and exhibit jamming criticality of the same universality class. However, the anisotropy
of contact networks non-trivially depends on the jamming density and strain. Among all state points
on the jamming-plane, the jamming-point is a unique one with the minimum jamming density and the
maximum randomness. For lattice packings, the jamming-plane shrinks into a single shear jamming-line
that is independent of initial configurations. Our study paves the way for solving the long-standing
random close packing problem, and provides a more complete framework to understand jamming.
