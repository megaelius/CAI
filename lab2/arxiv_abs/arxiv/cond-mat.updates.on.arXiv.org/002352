In the present paper, a new model of the collision term, of the Boltzmann Kinetic equation dealing
with binary gas mixture affected by a centrifugal field, is introduced. The new model is representing
a modification of the BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) model of the Boltzmann kinetic equation to be
suitable for studying the influence of centrifugal field affected on gases mixture. The scientific
achievement of the new model is that it is a very simple model without any mathematical complexity;
but without any loss of generality. We shed light upon that the new model is satisfied the conservation
of energy, conservation of mass, and conservation of momentum laws, the second law of thermodynamic,
and the principle of maximum entropy production that is like the BGK model itself. Complete mathematical
model for a centrifugal field, used in Uranium enrichment process affected on gases mixture between
two coaxial circular porous rotating cylinders, is presented which is an important application
for our new model. We also, introduced the complete irreversible thermodynamics properties of
the system for the first time at all, for the best of our knowledge. The entropy, entropy flux, entropy
production, thermodynamic forces, kinetic coefficients are presented for our model system. The
ratios between the different contributions of the internal energy changes are predicted via the
extended Gibbs equation. The main important implementation of the model is the uranium enrichment
that is used in nuclear energy generation or nuclear weapons, many medical applications and various
industrial amazing applications. The flow of a binary gases mixture of UF6, and N2 between rotating
cylinders is the first important suggested problem enforcement of the new model.
