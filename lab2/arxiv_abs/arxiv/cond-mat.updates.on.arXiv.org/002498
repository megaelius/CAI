We first review, following our earlier studies, the critical behavior of quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
(SK) model at finite as well as at zero temperatures. Through the analysis of Binder cumulant we determine
the entire phase diagram of the model and from the scaling analysis of the numerical data we obtained
the correlation length exponent. For both the critical Binder cumulant and the correlation length
exponent, we observed a crossover from classical to quantum fluctuation dominated values at finite
a temperature. We studied the behavior of order parameter distribution of the model in the glass
phase (at finite and zero temperatures). Along with classical fluctuation dominated nonergodic
region (where the replica symmetry is broken), we also find a quantum fluctuation dominated low
temperature ergodic region in the spin glass phase. In this quantum fluctuation dominated region,
the order parameter distribution gets narrowly peaked about its most probable value and eventually
becoming a delta function in the infinite system size limit (indicating replica symmetry restoration
or ergodicity in the system). We also found that the annealing time (to reach a very low energy level
of the classical SK model) becomes practically system size independent, when the annealing paths
pass through this ergodic region. In contrast, when the such paths pass through the nonergodic region,
the convergence time grows strongly with the system size. We present a new study of the auto-correlation
of the spins in both ergodic and nonergodic regions. We find significant increase in the relaxation
time (also change in the relaxation behavior) in the classical fluctuation dominated (nonergodic)
region, compared to that in the quantum fluctuation dominated (ergodic) region of the spin glass
phase.
