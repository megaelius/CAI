We present a density functional study of Lennard-Jones liquids in contact with a nano-corrugated
wall. The corresponding substrate potential is taken to exhibit a repulsive hard core and a van der
Waals attraction. The corrugation is modeled by a periodic array of square nano-pits. We have used
the modified Rosenfeld density functional in order to study the interfacial structure of these
liquids which with respect to their thermodynamic bulk state are considered to be deep inside their
liquid phase. We find that already considerably below the packing fraction of bulk freezing of these
liquids, inside the nanopits a three-dimensional-like density localization sets in. If the sizes
of the pits are commensurate with the packing requirements, we observe high density spots separated
from each other in all spatial directions by liquid of comparatively very low density. The number,
shape, size, and density of these high density spots depend sensitively on the depth and width of
the pits. Outside the pits, only layering is observed; above the pit openings these layers are distorted
with the distortion reaching up to a few molecular diameters. We discuss quantitatively how this
density localization is affected by the geometrical features of the pits and how it evolves upon
increasing the bulk packing fraction. Our results are transferable to colloidal systems and pit
dimensions corresponding to several diameters of the colloidal particles. For such systems the
predicted unfolding of these structural changes can be studied experimentally on much larger length
scales and more directly (e.g., optically) than for molecular fluids which typically call for sophisticated
X-ray scattering.
