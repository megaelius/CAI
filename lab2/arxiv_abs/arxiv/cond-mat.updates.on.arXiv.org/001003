Matthew Fisher recently postulated a mechanism by which quantum phenomena could influence cognition:
Phosphorus nuclear spins may resist decoherence for long times. The spins would serve as biological
qubits. The qubits may resist decoherence longer when in Posner molecules. We imagine that Fisher
postulates correctly. How adroitly could biological systems process quantum information (QI)?
We establish a framework for answering. Additionally, we apply biological qubits in quantum error
correction, quantum communication, and quantum computation. First, we posit how the QI encoded
by the spins transforms as Posner molecules form. The transformation points to a natural computational
basis for qubits in Posner molecules. From the basis, we construct a quantum code that detects arbitrary
single-qubit errors. Each molecule encodes one qutrit. Shifting from information storage to computation,
we define the model of Posner quantum computation. To illustrate the model's quantum-communication
ability, we show how it can teleport information incoherently: A state's weights are teleported;
the coherences are not. The dephasing results from the entangling operation's simulation of a coarse-grained
Bell measurement. Whether Posner quantum computation is universal remains an open question. However,
the model's operations can efficiently prepare a Posner state usable as a resource in universal
measurement-based quantum computation. The state results from deforming the Affleck-Lieb-Kennedy-Tasaki
(AKLT) state and is a projected entangled-pair state (PEPS). Finally, we show that entanglement
can affect molecular-binding rates (by 0.6% in an example). This work opens the door for the QI-theoretic
analysis of biological qubits and Posner molecules.
