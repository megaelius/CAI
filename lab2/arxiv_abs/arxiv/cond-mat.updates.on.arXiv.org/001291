We use first-principles methods to study oxygen-octahedra rotations in ABO3 perovskite oxides.
We focus on the short-period, perfectly antiphase or in-phase, tilt patterns that characterize
most compounds and control their physical (e.g., conductive, magnetic) properties. Based on an
analytical form of the relevant potential energy surface, we discuss the conditions for the stability
of polymorphs presenting different tilt patterns, and obtain numerical results for a collection
of thirty-five representative materials. Our results reveal the mechanisms responsible for the
frequent occurrence of a particular structure that combines antiphase and in-phase rotations,
i.e., the orthorhombic Pbnm phase displayed by about half of all perovskite oxides and by many non-oxidic
perovskites. The Pbnm phase benefits from the simultaneous occurrence of antiphase and in-phase
tilt patterns that compete with each other, but not as strongly as to be mutually exclusive. We also
find that secondary antipolar modes, involving the A cations, contribute to weaken the competition
between different tilts and play a key role in their coexistence. Our results thus confirm and better
explain previous observations for particular compounds. Interestingly, we also find that strain
effects, which are known to be a major factor governing phase competition in related (e.g., ferroelectric)
perovskite oxides, play no essential role as regards the relative stability of different rotational
polymorphs. Further, we discuss why the Pbnm structure stops being the ground state in two opposite
limits, for large and small A cations, showing that very different effects become relevant in each
case. Our work thus provides a comprehensive discussion on these all-important and abundant materials,
which will be useful to better understand existing compounds as well as to identify new strategies
for materials engineering.
