Predictability of a certain effect or phenomenon is often equated with the knowledge of relevant
physical laws, typically understood as a functional or numerically-derived relationship between
the observations and known states of the system. Correspondingly, observations inconsistent
with prior knowledge can be used to derive new knowledge on the nature of the system or indicate the
presence of yet unknown mechanisms. Here we explore the applicability of Gaussian Processing (GP)
to establish predictability and uncertainty of local behaviors from multimodal observations,
providing an alternative to this classical paradigm. Using atomic-resolution Scanning Transmission
Electron Microscopy (STEM) of multiferroic Sm-doped BiFeO3 across a broad composition range,
we directly visualize the atomic structure and structural, physical, and chemical order parameter
fields for the material. GP regression is used to establish the predictability of the local polarization
field from different groups of parameters, including the adjacent polarization values and several
combinations of physical and chemical descriptors, including lattice parameters, column intensities,
etc. We observe that certain elements of materials domain structure including charged and uncharged
domain walls and interfaces with the substrate are best predicted with specific combinations of
descriptors, and this predictability and their associated uncertainties are consistent across
the composition series. The associated generative physical mechanisms are discussed. We argue
that predictability and uncertainty in observational data offers a new pathway to probe the physics
of condensed matter systems from multimodal local observations.
