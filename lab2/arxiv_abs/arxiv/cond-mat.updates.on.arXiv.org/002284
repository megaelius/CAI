The AIII-BV semiconductors, due to their unique properties, are considered for decades as a promising
material to overcome the limitations of the silicone semiconductor devices. One of the important
aspects in the AIII-BV semiconductor technology is gold-semiconductor interactions at the nanoscale,
since gold is widely used to catalyze the growth of AIII-BV structures and it is also an important
material for the electronic device mainly used as electrodes. Here, we report, by investigation
of the nanostructures formed in the process of thermally induced Au self-assembly on various AIII-BV
semiconductor surfaces (InSb(001), InAs(001), InP(001), GaSb(001), GaAs(001), GaP(001)),
how Au interacts with each material at atomic scale as provided by the atomically resolved aberration
corrected HAADF STEM measurements. The Au diffusion into bulk AIII-BV crystal lattice was seen
only for InSb crystal, and investigated at atomic level experimentally by Machine Learning HAADF
image quantification and theoretically by detailed DFT calculations. Our studies uncovered also
that independently of the interaction between Au and AIII-BV semiconductors the formation of the
nanostructures is driven by the surface diffusion and nucleation of adatoms, produced by Au induced
chemical reactions of AIII-BV bounds breaking on the semiconductor surfaces. We show that the type
of the Au-rich phase, which forms the developed nanostructures, depends on the AIII-BV semiconductor
binding energy. From the reaction stoichiometry we were able to estimate the number of AIII-BV bounds
broken due to the interaction of single Au atoms on the surface. It has been found also a difference
in the Au interaction between In- and Ga-based AIII-BV semiconductors as confirmed by Machine Learning
methods. Our comprehensive studies uncover the details of Au on AIII-BV surface interaction at
the atomic level with chemical sensitivity.
