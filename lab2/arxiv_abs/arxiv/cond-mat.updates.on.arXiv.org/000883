We extend the theory of ground states of classical Heisenberg spin systems previously published
to the case where the interaction with an external magnetic field is described by a Zeeman term. The
ground state problem for the Heisenberg-Zeeman Hamiltonian can be reduced first to the relative
ground state problem, and, in a second step, to the absolute ground state problem for pure Heisenberg
Hamiltonians depending on an additional Lagrange parameter. We distinguish between continuous
and discontinuous reduction. Moreover, there are various general statements about Heisenberg-Zeeman
systems that will be proven under most general assumptions. One topic is the connection between
the minimal energy functions $E_{min}$ for the Heisenberg energy and $H_{min}$ for the Heisenberg-Zeeman
energy which turn out to be essentially mutual Legendre-Fenchel transforms. This generalization
of the traditional Legendre transform is especially suited to cope with situations where the function
$E_{min}$ is not convex and consequently there is a magnetization jump at a critical field. Another
topic is magnetization and the occurrence of threshold fields $B_{thr}$ and saturation fields
$B_{sat}$, where we provide a general formula for the latter. We suggest a distinction between ferromagnetic
and anti-ferromagnetic systems based on the vanishing of $B_{sat}$ for the former ones. Parabolic
systems are defined in such a way that $E_{min}$ and $H_{min}$ have a particularly simple form and
studied in detail. For a large class of parabolic systems the relative ground states can be constructed
from the absolute ground state by means of a so-called umbrella family. Finally we provide a counter-example
of a parabolic system where this construction is not possible.
