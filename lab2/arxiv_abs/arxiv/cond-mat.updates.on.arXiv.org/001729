Perovskite materials have become ubiquitous in many technologically relevant applications,
ranging from catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells to light absorbing layers in solar photovoltaics.
The thermodynamic phase stability is a key parameter that broadly governs whether the material
is expected to be synthesizable, and whether it may degrade under certain operating conditions.
Phase stability can be calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT), but the significant computational
cost makes such calculation potentially prohibitive when screening large numbers of possible
compounds. In this work, we developed machine learning models to predict the thermodynamic phase
stability of perovskite oxides using a dataset of more than 1900 DFT-calculated perovskite oxide
energies. The phase stability was determined using convex hull analysis, with the energy above
the convex hull (Ehull) providing a direct measure of the stability. We generated a set of 791 features
based on elemental property data to correlate with the Ehull value of each perovskite compound.
For classification, the extra trees algorithm achieved the best prediction accuracy of 0.93 (+/-
0.02), with an F1 score of 0.88 (+/- 0.03). For regression, leave-out 20% cross-validation tests
with kernel ridge regression achieved the minimal root mean square error (RMSE) of 28.5 (+/- 7.5)
meV/atom between cross-validation predicted Ehull values and DFT calculations, with the mean
absolute error (MAE) in cross-validation energies of 16.7 (+/- 2.3) meV/atom. We further validated
our model by predicting the stability of compounds not present in the training set and demonstrated
our machine learning models are a fast and effective means of obtaining qualitatively useful guidance
for a wide-range of perovskite oxide stability, potentially impacting materials design choices
in a variety of technological applications.
