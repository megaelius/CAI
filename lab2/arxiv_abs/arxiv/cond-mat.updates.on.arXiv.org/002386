The discovery of superconductivity at 203 K in H3S brought attention back to conventional superconductors
whose properties can be described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and the Migdal-Eliashberg
theories. These theories predict that high, and even room temperature superconductivity (RTSC)
is possible in metals possessing certain favorable parameters such as lattice vibrations at high
frequencies. However, these general theories do not suffice to predict real superconductors.
New superconducting materials can be predicted now with the aid of first principles calculations
based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). In particular, the calculations suggested a new family
of hydrides possessing a clathrate structure, where the host atom (Ca, Y, La) is at the center of the
cage formed by hydrogen atoms. For LaH10 and YH10 superconductivity, with critical temperatures
Tc ranging between 240 and 320 K is predicted at megabar pressures. Here, we report superconductivity
with a record Tc ~ 250 K within the Fm-3m structure of LaH10 at a pressure P ~ 170 GPa. We proved the existence
of superconductivity at 250 K through the observation of zero-resistance, isotope effect, and
the decrease of Tc under an external magnetic field, which suggests an upper critical magnetic field
of 120 T at zero-temperature. The pressure dependence of the transition temperatures Tc (P) has
a maximum of 250-252 K at the pressure of about 170 GPa. This leap, by ~ 50 K, from the previous Tc record
of 203 K indicates the real possibility of achieving RTSC (that is at 273 K) in the near future at high
pressures and the perspective of conventional superconductivity at ambient pressure.
