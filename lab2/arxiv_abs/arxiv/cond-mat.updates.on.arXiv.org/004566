The uptake and sorption of charged molecules by responsive polymer membranes and hydrogels in aqueous
solutions is of key importance for the development of soft functional materials. Here we investigate
the partitioning of simple monoatomic (Na$^+$, K$^+$, Cs$^+$, Cl$^-$, I$^-$) and one molecular
ion (4-nitrophenolate; NP$^-$) within a dense, electroneutral poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide)
membrane using explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations. Inside the predominantly hydrophobic
environment water distributes in a network of polydisperse water nanoclusters. The average cluster
size determines the mean electrostatic self-energy of the simple ions, which preferably reside
deeply inside them; we therefore find substantially larger partition ratios $K\simeq\>$10$^{-1}$
than expected from a simple Born picture using a uniform dielectric constant. Despite their irregular
shapes we observe that the water clusters possess a universal negative electrostatic potential
with respect to their surrounding, as is known for aqueous liquid-vapor interfaces. This potential,
which we find concealed in cases of symmetric monoatomic salts, can dramatically impact the transfer
free energies of larger charged molecules because of their weak hydration and increased affinity
to interfaces. Consequently, and in stark contrast to the simple ions, the molecular ion NP$^-$
can have a partition ratio much larger than unity, $K\simeq\>$10-30 (depending on the cation type)
or even $10^3$ in excess of monovalent salt, which explains recent observations of enhanced reaction
kinetics of NP$^-$ reduction catalyzed within dense polymer networks. These results also suggest
that ionizing a molecule can even enhance the partitioning in a collapsed, rather hydrophobic gel,
which strongly challenges the traditional simplistic reasoning.
