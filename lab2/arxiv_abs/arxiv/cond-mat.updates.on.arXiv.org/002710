We consider a Brownian particle which, in addition to being in contact with a thermal bath, is driven
by fluctuating forces which stem from active processes in the system, such as self-propulsion or
collisions with other active particles. These active fluctuations do not fulfill a fluctuation-dissipation
relation and therefore play the role of a non-equilibrium environment, which keeps the system permanently
out of thermal equilibrium even in the absence of external forces. We investigate how the out-of-equilibrium
character of the active matter system and the associated irreversibility is reflected in the trajectories
of the Brownian particle. Specifically, we analyze the log-ratio of path probabilities for observing
a certain particle trajectory forward in time versus observing its time-reversed twin trajectory.
For passive Brownian motion, it is well-known that this path probability ratio quantifies irreversibility
in terms of entropy production. For active Brownian motion, we show that in addition to the usual
entropy produced in the thermal environment the path probability ratio contains a contribution
to irreversibility from mutual information production between the particle trajectory and the
history of the non-equilibrium environment. The resulting irreversibility measure fulfills
an integral fluctuation theorem and a second-law like relation. When deriving and discussing these
relations, we keep in mind that the active fluctuations can occur either due to a suspension of active
particles pushing around a passive colloid or due to active self-propulsion of the particle itself;
we point out the similarities and differences between these two situations. We obtain explicit
expressions for active fluctuations modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Finally, we illustrate
our general results by analyzing a Brownian particle which is trapped in a static or moving harmonic
potential.
