The recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) magnetic insulator CrI$_3$ is an intriguing case
for basic research and spintronic applications since it is a ferromagnet in the bulk, but an antiferromagnet
in bilayer form, with its magnetic ordering amenable to external manipulations. Using first-principles
quantum transport approach, we predict that injecting unpolarized charge current parallel to
the interface of bilayer-CrI$_3$/monolayer-TaSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure will induce
spin-orbit torque (SOT) and thereby driven dynamics of magnetization on the first monolayer of
CrI$_3$ in direct contact with TaSe$_2$. By combining calculated complex angular dependence of
SOT with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for classical dynamics of magnetization, we demonstrate
that current pulses can switch the direction of magnetization on the first monolayer to become parallel
to that of the second monolayer, thereby converting CrI$_3$ from antiferromagnet to ferromagnet
while not requiring any external magnetic field. We explain the mechanism of this reversible current-driven
nonequilibrium phase transition by showing that first monolayer of CrI$_3$ carries current due
to evanescent wavefunctions injected by metallic transition metal dichalcogenide TaSe$_2$,
while concurrently acquiring strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) via such proximity effect, whereas
the second monolayer of CrI$_3$ remains insulating. The transition can be detected by passing vertical
read current through the vdW heterostructure, encapsulated by bilayer of hexagonal boron nitride
and sandwiched between graphite electrodes, where we find tunneling magnetoresistance of $\simeq
240$%.
