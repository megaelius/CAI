Coupled colloidal quantum dot molecules composed of two fused CdSe/CdS core/shell sphere monomers
were recently presented. Upon fusion, the potential energy landscape is changing into two quantum
dots separated by a pre-tuned potential barrier with energetics dictated by the conduction and
valence band offsets of the core/shell semiconductors, and width controlled by the shell thickness
and the fusion reaction conditions. In close proximity of the two nanocrystals, orbital hybridization
occurs, forming bonding and anti-bonding states in analogy to the hydrogen molecule. In this study,
we examine theoretically the electronic and optical signatures of such a quantum dot dimer compared
to its monomer core/shell building blocks. We examine the effects of different core sizes, barrier
widths, different band offsets and neck sizes at the interface of the fused facets, on the system
wave-functions and energetics. Due to the higher effective mass of the hole and the large valence
band offset, the hole still essentially resides in either of the cores breaking the symmetry of the
potential for the electron as well. We found that the dimer signature is well expressed in a redshift
of the bandgap both in absorption and emission, in slower radiative lifetimes and in an absorption
cross-section which is significantly enhanced relative to the monomers at energies above the shell
absorption onset, while remains essentially at the same level near the band-edge. This study provides
essential guidance to pre-design of coupled quantum dot molecules with specific attributes which
can be utilized for various new optoelectronic applications.
