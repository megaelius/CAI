Systems involving nematic liquid crystals subjected to magnetic fields or electric fields are
modeled using the Oseen-Frank macroscopic continuum theory, and general criteria are developed
to assess the local stability of equilibrium solutions. The criteria take into account the inhomogeneity
of the electric field and the mutual influence of the electric field and the liquid-crystal director
field on each other. The criteria show that formulas for the instability thresholds of electric-field
Freedericksz transitions cannot in all cases be obtained from those for the analogous magnetic-field
transitions by simply replacing the magnetic parameters by the corresponding electric parameters,
contrary to claims in standard references. This finding is consistent with [Arakelyan, Karayan,
Chilingaryan, Sov. Phys. Dokl., 29 (1984) 202-204]. A simple analytical test is provided to determine
when an electric-field-induced instability can differ qualitatively from the analogous magnetic
field-induced instability. For the systems we study, it is found that taking into account the full
coupling between the electric field and the director field can either elevate or leave unchanged
an instability threshold (never lower it), compared to the threshold provided by the magnetic-field
analogy. The physical mechanism that underlies the effect of elevating an instability threshold
is the added free energy associated with a first-order change in the ground-state electric field
caused by a perturbation of the ground-state director field. Examples are given that involve classical
Freedericksz transitions and also periodic instabilities. The inclusion of flexoelectric terms
in the theory is studied, and it is found that these terms are not capable of altering the instability
thresholds of any of the classical Freedericksz transitions, consistent with known results for
splay transitions.
