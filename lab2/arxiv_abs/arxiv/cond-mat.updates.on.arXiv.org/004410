We develop a theory of quantum $T = 0$ phase transition (q-SMT) between metal and superconducting
ground states in a two-dimensional metal with frozen-in spatial fluctuations $\delta\lambda(r)$
of the Cooper attraction constant. When strength of fluctuations $\delta\lambda(r)$ exceeds
some critical magnitude, usual mean-field-like scenario of the q-SMT breaks down due to spontaneous
formation of local droplets of superconducting phase. The density of these droplets grows exponentially
with the increase of average attraction constant $\lambda$. Interaction between the droplet's
order parameters is due to proximity effect via normal metal and scales with distance $\propto 1/r^\beta$
, with $2 < \beta \le 3$. We account for this interaction by means of a real-space strong-disorder
renormalization group (RG). Near the q-SMT the RG flow is, formally, a dual equivalent of the Kosterlitz-Thouless
RG. The corresponding line of fixed points describes a Griffiths phase of a metal with large fractal
clusters of superconducting islands. Typical number of islands in a cluster grows as $N_\delta
\sim 1/\delta$, where $0 < \delta \ll 1 $ is the distance to the critical point. Superconducting side
is described by a runaway of RG trajectories into the strong-coupling region. Close to the transition
point on the SC side, $0<-\delta \ll 1$, RG trajectories possess an extremum as function of the RG
parameter $|\delta|^{1/2} \ln(1/T\tau)$. It results in a wide temperature range where physical
properties are nearly $T$-independent. This observation may be relevant to the understanding
of a \emph{strange metal} state frequently observed near q-SMT.
