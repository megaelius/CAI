While it is known that the nature and the arrangement of defects in complex oxides have an impact on
the material functionalities little is known on control of superconductivity by oxygen interstitial
organization in cuprates. Here we report direct compelling evidence for the control of Tc, by manipulation
of the superconducting granular networks of nanoscale puddles, made of ordered oxygen stripes,
in a single crystal of YBa2Cu3O6.5+y with average formal hole doping p close to 1/8. Upon thermal
treatments we were able to switch from a first network of oxygen defects striped puddles with OVIII
modulation (qOVIII(a*)=(h+3/8,k,0) and qOVIII(a*)=(h+5/8,k,0)), to second network characterized
by OXVI modulation (qOXVI(a*)=(h+7/16,k,0) and qOXVI(a*)=(h+9/16,k,0)), and finally to a third
network with puddles of OV periodicity (qOV(a*)=(4/10,1,0) and qOV(a*)=(6/10,1,0)). We map the
microscopic spatial evolution of the out of plane OVIII, OXVI and OV puddles nano-size distribution
via scanning micro-diffraction measurements. In particular, we calculated the number of oxygen
chains (n) and the charge density (holes concentration p) inside each puddle, analyzing areas of
160x80 {\mu}m2, and recording 12800 diffraction patterns to reconstruct each spatial map. The
high spatial inhomogeneity shown by all the reconstructed spatial maps reflects the intrinsic
granular structure that characterizes cuprates and iron-chalcogenides, disclosing the presence
of several complex networks of coexisting superconducting domains with different lattice modulations,
charge density and different gaps like in the proposed multi-gaps scenario called superstripes.
