In this work we consider a numerically solvable model of a two-electron diatomic molecule to study
a recently proposed approximation based on the density-functional theory of so-called strictly
correlated electrons (SCE). We map out the full two-particle wave function for a wide range of bond
distances and interaction strengths and obtain analytic results for the two-particle states and
eigenenergies in various limits of strong and weak interactions, and in the limit of large bond distance.
We then study the so-called Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) kernel of time-dependent density
functional theory which is a key ingredient in calculating excitation energies. We study an approximation
based on adiabatic SCE (ASCE) theory which was shown to display a particular feature of the exact
Hxc-kernel, namely a spatial divergence as function of the bond distance. This makes the ASCE kernel
a candidate for correcting a notorious failure of the commonly used adiabatic local density approximation
(ALDA) in the calculation of excitation energies of dissociating molecules. Unlike the ALDA, we
obtain non-zero excitation energies from the ASCE kernel in the dissociation regime but they do
not correspond to those of the true spectrum unless the interaction strength is taken to be very large
such that the SCE theory has the right regime of validity, in which case the excitation energies become
exact and represent the so-called zero point oscillations of the strictly correlated electrons.
The commonly studied physical dissociation regime, namely large molecular separation at intermediate
interaction strength, therefore remains a challenge for density functional approximations based
on SCE theory.
