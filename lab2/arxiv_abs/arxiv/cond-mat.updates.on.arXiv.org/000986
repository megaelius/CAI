When a mobile impurity interacts with a surrounding bath of bosons, it forms a polaron. Numerous
methods have been developed to calculate how the energy and the effective mass of the polaron are
renormalized by the medium for equilibrium situations. Here we address the much less studied non-equilibrium
regime and investigate how polarons form dynamically in time. To this end, we develop a time-dependent
renormalization group approach which allows calculations of all dynamical properties of the system
and takes into account the effects of quantum fluctuations in the polaron cloud. We apply this method
to calculate trajectories of polarons following a sudden quench of the impurity-boson interaction
strength, revealing how the polaronic cloud around the impurity forms in time. Such trajectories
provide additional information about the polaron's properties which are challenging to extract
directly from the spectral function measured experimentally using ultracold atoms. At strong
couplings, our calculations predict the appearance of trajectories where the impurity wavers
back at intermediate times as a result of quantum fluctuations. Our method is applicable to a broader
class of non-equilibrium problems. We also apply it to calculate the spectral function and find
good agreement with experimental results. At very strong couplings, we predict that quantum fluctuations
lead to the appearance of a dark continuum with strongly suppressed spectral weight at low energies.
While our calculations start from an effective Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian describing impurities
in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, we also calculate the effects of additional
terms in the Hamiltonian beyond the Fr\"ohlich paradigm. We demonstrate that the main effect of
these additional terms on the attractive side of a Feshbach resonance is to renormalize the coupling
strength of the effective Fr\"ohlich model.
