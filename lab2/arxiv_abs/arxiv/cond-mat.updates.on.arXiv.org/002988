We present a symmetry-adapted real-space formulation of Kohn-Sham density functional theory
for cylindrical geometries and apply it to the study of large X (X=C, Si, Ge, Sn) nanotubes. Specifically,
starting from the Kohn-Sham equations posed on all of space, we reduce the problem to the fundamental
domain by incorporating cyclic and periodic symmetries present in the angular and axial directions
of the cylinder, respectively. We develop a real-space parallel implementation of this formulation,
and verify its accuracy against established codes. Using this implementation, we study the band
structure and bending properties of X nanotubes and Xene sheets, respectively. Specifically,
we first show that zigzag and armchair X nanotubes with radii in the range $1$ to $5$ nm are semiconducting.
We find an inverse linear dependence of the bandgap with respect to radius for all nanotubes other
than the armchair and zigzag type III carbon variants, for which we find an inverse quadratic dependence.
Next, we exploit the connection between cyclic symmetry and uniform bending deformations to calculate
the bending moduli of Xene sheets in both zigzag and armchair directions. We find Kirchhoff-Love
type bending behavior, with graphene and stanene possessing the largest and smallest moduli, respectively.
In addition, other than graphene, the sheets demonstrate significant anisotropy, with larger
bending moduli along the armchair direction. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach
has very good parallel scaling and is highly efficient, enabling ab initio simulations of unprecedented
size for systems with a high degree of cyclic symmetry. In particular, we show that even micron-sized
nanotubes can be simulated with modest effort. Overall, the current work opens an avenue for the
ab-initio study of 1D nanostructures with large radii as well as 2D nanostructures under uniform
bending.
