We study the spin dynamics in the presence of impurity and electron-electron (e-e) scattering in
a III-V semiconductor quantum well with arbitrary spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength and symmetry
at finite temperature. We derive the coupled spin-charge dynamic equations in the presence of inelastic
scattering and provide a new formalism that describes the spin relaxation and dynamics in both the
weak and the strong SOC regime in a unified way. In the weak SOC regime, as expected, our theory reproduces
all previous zero-temperature results, most of which have focused on impurity-scattering induced
spin-charge dynamics. In the regime where the strength of the Rashba and linear Dresselhaus SOC
match, known as the SU(2) symmetry point, experiments have observed the spin-helix mode with a large
spin-lifetime whose unexplained non-monotonic temperature dependence peaks at around 75 K. As
a key test of our theory, we are able to naturally explain quantitatively this non-monotonic dependence
and show that it arises as a competition between the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism, suppressed at the
SU(2) point, and the Elliott-Yafet mechanism. In the strong SOC regime, we show that our theory directly
reproduces the only previous known analytical result at the SU(2) symmetry point in the ballistic
regime. It also explains, as we have shown previously, the rise of damped oscillating dynamics when
the electron scattering time is larger than half of the spin precession time due to the SOC. Hence,
we provide a unified theory of the spin-dynamics in two dimensional electron gases in the full phase
diagram experimentally accessible.
