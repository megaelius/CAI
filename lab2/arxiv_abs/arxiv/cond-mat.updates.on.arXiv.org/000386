We present a computational investigation of the mechanism governing size-based particle separation
in microfluidic pinched flow fractionation. We study the behavior of particles moving through
a pinching gap (i.e., a constriction in the aperture of a channel) in the Stokes regime as a function
of particle size. The constriction aperture is created by a plane wall and spherical obstacle, and
emulates the pinching segment in pinched flow fractionation devices. The simulation results show
that the distance of closest approach between the particle and obstacle surfaces (along a trajectory)
decreases with increasing particle size. We then use the distance of closest approach to investigate
the effect of short-range repulsive non-hydrodynamic interactions (e.g., solid-solid contact).
We define a critical trajectory as the one in which the minimum particle-obstacle separation is
equal to the range of the non-hydrodynamic interactions. The results further show that the initial
offset of the critical trajectory (defined as the critical offset) increases with particle size.
We interpret the variation of the critical offset with particle size as the basis for size-based
microfluidic separation in pinched flow fractionation. We also compare the effect of different
driving fields on the particle trajectories; we simulate a constant force driving the particles
in a quiescent fluid as well as a freely suspended particles in a pressure-driven flow. We observe
that the particles driven by a constant force approach closer to the obstacle than those suspended
in a flow (for the same initial offset). On the other hand, the increment in the critical offset (as
a function of particle size) is larger in the pressure-driven case than in the force-driven case.
Thus, pressure-driven particle separation using pinched flow fractionation would prove more
effective than its force-driven counterpart.
