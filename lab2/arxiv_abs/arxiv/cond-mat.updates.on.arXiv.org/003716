Characterizing the material properties of soft materials sheets through bulge testing relies
on accurate measurement of deformation, which is experimentally challenging. To avoid having
to measure the deformation, we propose a hydrodynamic bulge test for characterizing the material
properties of thick, pre-stressed elastic sheets via their fluid--structure interaction with
a steady viscous fluid flow. Specifically, the hydrodynamic bulge test relies on a pressure drop
measurement across a rectangular microchannel with a deformable top wall. We develop a mathematical
model using first-order shear-deformation theory of plates with stretching, and the lubrication
approximation for Newtonian fluid flow at low Reynolds number. Specifically, a relationship is
derived between the imposed flow rate and the total pressure drop. Then, this relationship is inverted
numerically to yield estimates of the Young's modulus (given the Poisson ratio), if the pressure
drop is measured (given the steady flow rate). Direct numerical simulations of two-way-coupled
fluid--structure interaction are carried out in ANSYS to determine the cross-sectional membrane
deformation and the pressure distribution in a flow-rate-controlled set-up. Taking the simulations
as ``ground truth,'' a hydrodynamic bulge test is performed using the simulation data to ascertain
the accuracy and validity of the proposed methodology for estimating material properties. An error
propagation analysis is performed via Monte Carlo simulation to characterize the susceptibility
of the hydrodynamic bulge test estimates to noise. We find that, while a hydrodynamic bulge test
is less accurate in characterizing material properties, it is less susceptible to noise, than a
hydrostatic bulge test, in the input (measured) variable.
