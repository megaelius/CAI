Depositing thin and thick films by different coating technology units is the beauty of deposition
technology where every synthesis deals chamber pressure. In hot-filament reactor, in addition
to force, chamber pressure deals heat and photon energy settling into the available mass per unit
area or volume. Temperature of substrate material and filaments under fixed input power vary as
per residence time under the set pressure of entered dissociating CH4 and H2 gases. Rates of dissociating
entered gases and conversion rate of gas state carbon atoms into graphitic and diamond states vary
largely under varying chamber pressure which influence the deposition of carbon films in terms
of their content-specific growth and growth rate. The increase in the chamber pressure from 3.3
kPa to 14 kPa influences morphology of films comprised tiny grains, grains and crystallites. The
increase in the chamber pressure upto 8.6 kPa increases the growth rate of carbon film along with
discernible morphology of grains and crystallites. In the range of intermediate chamber pressures,
gas state carbon atoms converted into diamond state at high rate. Under the range of high chamber
pressures, gas state carbon atoms converted into graphitic state and other ones where low growth
rate of the films was resulted. Typical energies involved in the formation of particles at different
chamber pressures along with the influence of gas collisions on their formation rate are discussed,
also. Deposited carbon films are investigated under the investigation of original line of experimental
results opening abundant avenues of materials research.
