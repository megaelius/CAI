We couple a free solute diffusion model to a model of crystal surface growth represented by, but not
limited to, a (2 + 1)-dimensional solid-on-solid (SOS) model confined by a flat surface. We use kinetic
Monte Carlo (KMC) with dissolution rates based on nearest-neighbor interactions to solve the Master
equation for the surface dynamics, and we use an offlattice random walk to model the Fickian diffusion
of the solute particles. The two solvers are coupled directly through deposition rates of the free
particles calculated using the mean first passage time (MFPT) of deposition that is found to scale
as $r^{-4}$. Two variants are studied: ignoring (radial) and not ignoring the line of sight (pathfinding).
Reference models such as uniform concentration (random deposition) and lattice diffusion (crystal
lattice extended into the liquid) are used for comparison. We find that the macroscopic limit of
the surface dynamics is reproduced by all models. The free diffusion models produce a lower equilibrium
roughness and a smaller height autocorrelation length than the reference models, and are found
to behave very well in tight confinements. It is also demonstrated that lattice diffusion does not
work well in tight confinements. The two MFPT models behave very similarly close to equilibrium
and for dissolution, but becomes increasingly different with increasing surface growth speed.
The model is put to use by simulating a cavity with a flux boundary condition at one side. The conclusion
is that the new model excels in confinement, and line of sight can in practice be ignored since the
dominant deposition sites likely are in line of sight, which minimizes the CPU-time needed in the
coupling.
