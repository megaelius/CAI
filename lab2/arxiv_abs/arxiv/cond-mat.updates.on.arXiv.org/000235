In modern Nb3Sn wires there is a fundamental compromise to be made between optimizing the intrinsic
properties associated with the superfluid density (e.g. Tc, Hc, Hc2, all of which are composition
dependent), and the extrinsic critical current density, Jc, determined by the grain boundary density
and its associated vortex pinning strength. Jc is also determined by the quantity of A15 that can
be formed from a given mix of Nb, Sn and Cu, and by the composition gradients within each filament.
Here we study how these factors vary in a Ta-alloyed Restacked-Rod-Process (RRP) strand with ~70
microns diameter sub-elements using extensive microstructural, microchemical and specific
heat analysis, supplemented by the usual critical current evaluations. We find that optimum reaction
for Jc(12 T) is determined primarily by preventing A15 grain growth so as to ensure the maximum density
of vortex pinning centers, rather than by optimizing the superfluid density. In wires optimized
for 12 T, 4.2 K performance, about 60% of the non-Cu cross-section is A15, 35% residual Cu and Sn core,
and 5% residual Nb7.5wt.%Ta diffusion barrier. The specific heat and chemical analyses show that
there is a wide range of Tc and chemical composition in this 60% A15 fraction. These gradients do diminish
for higher heat treatment temperatures, which, however, are not practical, since the higher temperatures
cause significant barrier breakdown and degradation of copper RRR. Because RRR degradation occurs
by the A15 reaction front reaching the Cu interface, development of better barriers is an essential
step to allowing higher temperature reactions with better intrinsic A15 properties, even though
vortex pinning would be degraded by such high temperature reactions for all fields below about 15
T. This intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation shows how synergistically linked are the key desired properties
of the strand, ...
