Ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors (FERSC) have recently emerged as a promising class of spintronics
materials. The peculiar coupling between spin and polar degrees of freedom responsible for several
exceptional properties, including ferroelectric switching of Rashba spin texture, suggests
that the electron's spin could be controlled by using only electric fields. In this regard, recent
experimental studies revealing charge-to-spin interconversion phenomena in two prototypical
FERSC, GeTe and SnTe, appear extremely relevant. Here, by employing density functional theory
calculations, we investigate spin Hall effect (SHE) in these materials and show that it can be large
either in ferroelectric or paraelectric structure. We further explore the compatibility between
doping required for the practical realization of SHE in semiconductors and polar distortions which
determine Rashba-related phenomena in FERSC, but which could be suppressed by free charge carriers.
Based on the analysis of the lone pairs which drive ferroelectricity in these materials, we have
found that the polar displacements in GeTe can be sustained up to a critical hole concentration of
over $\sim 10^{21}$/cm$^{3}$, while the tiny distortions in SnTe vanish at a minimal level of doping.
Finally, we have estimated spin Hall angles for doped structures and demonstrated that the spin
Hall effect could be indeed achieved in a polar phase. We believe that the confirmation of spin Hall
effect, Rashba spin textures and ferroelectricity coexisting in one material will be helpful for
design of novel multifunctional spintronics devices operating without magnetic fields.
