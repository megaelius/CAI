We study systems in which both long-ranged van der Waals and critical Casimir interactions are present.
We study the interplay between these forces, as well as the {\it total} force (TF) between a spherical
colloid particle and a thick planar slab, and between two spherical colloid particles. We do that
using general scaling arguments and mean-field type calculations utilizing the Derjaguin and
the surface integration approaches. They both are based on data of the forces between two parallel
slabs separated at a distance $L$ from each other, confining the fluctuating fluid medium characterized
by its temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. The surfaces of the colloid particles and the
slab are coated by thin layers exerting strong preference to the liquid phase of the fluid, or one
of the components of the mixture, modeled by strong adsorbing local surface potentials, ensuring
the so-called $(+,+)$ boundary conditions. On the other hand, the core region of the slab and the
particles, influence the fluid by long-ranged competing dispersion potentials. We demonstrate
that for a suitable set of colloids-fluid, slab-fluid, and fluid-fluid coupling parameters the
competition between the effects due to the coatings and the core regions of the objects involved
result, when one changes $T$, $\mu$ or $L$, in {\it sign change} of the Casimir force (CF) {\it and}
the TF acting between the colloid and the slab, as well as between the colloids. This can be used for
governing the behavior of objects, say colloidal particles, at small distances, say in colloid
suspensions for preventing flocculation. It can also provide a strategy for solving problems with
handling, feeding, trapping and fixing of microparts in nanotechnology. Data for specific substances
in support of the experimental feasibility of the theoretically predicted behavior of the CF and
TF have been also presented.
