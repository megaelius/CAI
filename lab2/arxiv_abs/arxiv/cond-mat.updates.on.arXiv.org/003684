Fragility is an empirical property that describes how abruptly a glass-forming material solidifies
upon supercooling. The degree of fragility carries important implications for the functionality
and processability of a material, as well as for our fundamental understanding of the glass transition.
However, the microstructural properties underlying fragility still remain poorly understood.
Here, we explain the microstructure-fragility link in vitrimeric networks, a novel type of high-performance
polymers with unique bond-swapping functionality and unusual glass-forming behavior. Our results
are gained from coarse-grained computer simulations and first-principles Mode-Coupling Theory
(MCT) of star-polymer vitrimers. We first demonstrate that the vitrimer fragility can be tuned
over an unprecedentedly broad range, from fragile to strong and even superstrong behavior, by decreasing
the bulk density. Remarkably, this entire phenomenology can be reproduced by microscopic MCT,
thus challenging the conventional belief that existing first-principles theories cannot account
for non-fragile behaviors. Our MCT analysis allows us to rationally identify the microstructural
origin of the fragile-to-superstrong crossover, which is rooted in the sensitivity of the static
structure factor to temperature variations. On the molecular scale, this behavior stems from a
change in dominant length scales, switching from repulsive excluded-volume interactions to intrachain
attractions as the vitrimer density decreases. Finally, we develop a simplified schematic MCT
model which corroborates our microscopically-founded conclusions and which unites our findings
with earlier MCT studies. Our work sheds new light on the elusive structure-fragility link in glass-forming
matter, and provides a first-principles-based platform for designing novel amorphous materials
with an on-demand dynamic response.
