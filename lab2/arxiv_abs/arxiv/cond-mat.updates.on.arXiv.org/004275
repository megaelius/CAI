The splitting of quasi-Fermi levels (QFLs) represents a key concept utilized to describe finite-bias
operations of semiconductor devices, but its atomic-scale characterization remains a significant
challenge. Herein, the non-equilibrium QFL or electrochemical potential profiles within single-molecule
junctions obtained from the newly developed first-principles multi-space constrained-search
density functional formalism are presented. Benchmarking the standard non-equilibrium Green's
function calculation results, it is first established that algorithmically the notion of separate
electrode-originated nonlocal QFLs should be maintained within the channel region during self-consistent
finite-bias electronic structure calculations. For the insulating hexandithiolate junction,
the QFL profiles exhibit discontinuities at the left and right electrode interfaces and across
the molecule the accompanying electrostatic potential drops linearly and Landauer residual-resistivity
dipoles are uniformly distributed. For the conducting hexatrienedithiolate junction, on the
other hand, the electrode QFLs penetrate into the channel region and produce split QFLs. With the
highest occupied molecular orbital entering the bias window and becoming a good transport channel,
the split QFLs are also accompanied by the nonlinear electrostatic potential drop and asymmetric
Landauer residua-resistivity dipole formation. Our findings underscore the importance of the
first-principles extraction of QFLs in nanoscale junctions and point to a new direction for the
computational design of next-generation electronic, optoelectronic, and electrochemical devices.
