Large scale modelling of fluid flow coupled with solid failure in geothermal reservoirs or in hydrocarbon
extraction from reservoir rocks usually involves behaviours at two scales: lower scale of the inelastic
localization zone, and larger scale of the bulk continuum where elastic behavior can be reasonably
assumed. The hydraulic conductivities corresponding to the mechanical properties at these two
scales are different. In the bulk elastic host rock, the hydraulic conductivity does not vary much
with the deformation, while it significantly changes in the lower scale of the localization zone
due to inelastic deformation. Increase of permeability due to fracture and/or dilation, or reduction
of permeability due to compaction can take place inside this zone. The challenge is to predict the
evolution of hydraulic conductivities coupled with the mechanical behaviour of the material in
all stages of the deformation process. In the early stage of diffuse deformation, the permeability
of the material can be reasonably assumed to be homogenous over the whole RVE where stress, strain
and other internal variables are defined. However, localized failure with the occurrence of a localization
band dominates the late stage of the failure, resulting in significant changes in the hydraulic
conductivity of the RVE: the localization band can enhance, or reduce the flow properties. This
paper establishes a general framework and corresponding field equations to describe the hydro-mechanical
coupling in both diffuse and localized stages of deformation in rocks. Preliminary results are
presented which demonstrate the promising features of this new approach to large-scale modelling
of hydro-mechanical coupling in geomaterials.
