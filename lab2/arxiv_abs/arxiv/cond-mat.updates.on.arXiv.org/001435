Pollen grains are known for their impressive variety of species-specific, microscale surface
patterning. Despite having similar biological developmental steps, pollen grain surface features
are remarkably geometrically varied. Previous work suggests that a physical process may drive
this pattern formation and that the observed diversity of patterns can be explained by viewing pollen
pattern development as a phase transition to a spatially modulated phase. Several studies have
shown that the polysaccharide material of plant cell walls undergoes phase separation in the absence
of cross-linking stabilizers of the mixed phase. Here we show experimental evidence of a change
in density of the extracellular polysaccharide material (primexine) during pollen cell development
leads to a spatially modulated phase. The spatial pattern of this phase-separated primexine is
also mechanically coupled to the undulation of the pollen cell membrane. The resulting patterned
pools of denser primexine form the negative template of the ultimate sites of sporopollenin deposition,
leading to the final micropattern observed in the mature pollen. We then present a general physical
model of pattern formation via modulated phases. Using analytical and numerical techniques, we
find that most of the pollen micropatterns observed in biological evolution could result from a
physical process of modulated phases. However, an analysis of the relative rates of transitions
from states that are equilibrated to or from states that are not equilibrated suggests that while
equilibrium states of this process have occurred throughout evolutionary history, there has been
no particular evolutionary selection for distinctly patterned equilibrated states.
