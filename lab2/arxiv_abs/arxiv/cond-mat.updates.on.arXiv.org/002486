In different materials, orientationally-controlled assembling of building blocks results into
develops different anisotropic particles. These trends are more pronounced in atoms of metallic
elements when in certain transition state. Their monolayer assembly is vital as it develops tiny
particles of monolayer. When triangular-shape packets of nano-energy are placed over the compact
monolayer assembly, atoms of monolayer assembly bind to form their shape. Joined triangle-shaped
tiny particles developed under tuned bipolar pulse where they separated into two at point of connection
because of a bit perturbed exerting force for electrons of connected regions. Atoms of tiny particles
elongate from the centers to both sides under the exertion of force in surface-format at controlled
electronically-flat surface, thus, convert or modify their one-dimensional arrays into structures
of smooth elements. Such structures of smooth elements flatten further by the travelling photons
along the interface. Originally, binding of solid atoms should be under the execution of confined
inter-state electron-dynamics where forces exert in grounded-format. Tiny-shaped particles
of such structures of smooth elements pack as a one-unit for their assembling under exertion of force
in immersing-format at controlled electronically decreasing-level surface. Structures of smooth
elements arriving from different regions nucleate mono-layers of developing a certain shape particle
where unfilled regions are filled by the afterward arriving ones, which is not the case when a distorted
particle is developing. Each mono-layer of developing particle of anisotropic shape deals localized
gravity where its structures of smooth elements bind to the structures of smooth elements of the
above one and in the repetition manner under clamping of unfilled energy knots to laterally-orientated
electrons of elongated atoms.
