We discuss recent investigations of the interaction of polyelectrolytes with proteins. In particular,
we review our recent studies on the interaction of simple proteins such as human serum albumin (HSA)
or lysozyme with linear polyelectrolytes, charged dendrimers, charged networks, and polyelectrolyte
brushes. In all cases discussed here we combined experimental work with molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations and mean-field theories. In particular, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
has been employed to obtain the respective binding constants Kb and the Gibbs free energy of binding.
MD-simulations with explicit counterions but implicit water demonstrate that counterion release
is the main driving force for the binding of proteins to strongly charged polyelectrolytes: Patches
of positive charges located on the surface of the protein become a multivalent counterion of the
polyelectrolyte thereby releasing a number of counterions condensed on the polyelectrolyte.
The binding Gibbs free energy due to counterion release is predicted to scale with the logarithm
of the salt concentration in the system which is verified both by simulations and experiment. In
several cases, namely for the interaction of proteins with linear polyelectrolytes and highly
charged hydrophilic dendrimers the binding constant could be calculated from simulations in very
good approximation. This finding demonstrated that in these cases explicit hydration effects
do not contribute to the Gibbs free energy of binding. The Gibbs free energy can also be used to predict
the kinetics of protein uptake by microgels for a given system by applying dynamic density functional
theory.
