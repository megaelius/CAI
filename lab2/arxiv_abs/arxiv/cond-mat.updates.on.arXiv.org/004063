Correlations in topological states of matter provide a rich phenomenology, including a reduction
in the topological classification of the interacting system compared to its non-interacting counterpart.
This happens when two phases that are topologically distinct on the non-interacting level become
adiabatically connected once interactions are included. We use a quantum Monte Carlo method to
study such a reduction. We consider a 2D charge-conserving analog of the Levin-Gu superconductor
whose classification is reduced from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_4$. We may expect any symmetry-preserving
interaction that leads to a symmetric gapped ground state at strong coupling, and consequently
a gapped symmetric surface, to be sufficient for such reduction. Here, we provide a counter example
by considering an interaction which (i) leads to a symmetric gapped ground state at sufficient strength
and (ii) does not allow for any adiabatic path connecting the trivial phase to the topological phase
with $w=4$. The latter is established by numerically mapping the phase diagram as a function of the
interaction strength and a parameter tuning the topological invariant. Instead of the adiabatic
connection, the system exhibits an extended region of spontaneous symmetry breaking separating
the topological sectors. Frustration reduces the size of this long-range ordered region until
it gives way to a first order phase transition. Within the investigated range of parameters, there
is no adiabatic path deforming the formerly distinct free fermion states into each other. We conclude
that an interaction which trivializes the surface of a gapped topological phase is necessary but
not sufficient to establish an adiabatic path within the reduced classification. In other words,
the class of interactions which trivializes the surface is different from the class which establishes
an adiabatic connection in the bulk.
