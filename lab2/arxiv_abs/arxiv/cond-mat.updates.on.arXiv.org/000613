We analyze sound waves (phonons, Bogoliubov excitations) propagating on continuous wave (cw)
solutions of repulsive $F=1$ spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), such as $^{23}$Na (which
is antiferromagnetic or polar) and $^{87}$Rb (which is ferromagnetic). Zeeman splitting by a uniform
magnetic field is included. All cw solutions to ferromagnetic BECs with vanishing $M_F=0$ particle
density and non-zero components in both $M_F=\pm 1$ fields are subject to modulational instability
(MI). MI increases with increasing particle density. MI also increases with differences in the
components' wavenumbers; this effect is larger at lower densities but becomes insignificant at
higher particle densities. CW solutions to antiferromagnetic (polar) BECS with vanishing $M_F=0$
particle density and non-zero components in both $M_F=\pm 1$ fields do not suffer MI if the wavenumbers
of the components are the same. If there is a wavenumber difference, MI initially increases with
increasing particle density, then peaks before dropping to zero beyond a given particle density.
The cw solutions with particles in both $M_F=\pm 1$ components and nonvanishing $M_F=0$ components
do not have MI if the wavenumbers of the components are the same, but do exhibit MI when the wavenumbers
are different. Direct numerical simulations of a cw with weak white noise confirm that weak noise
grows fastest at wavenumbers with the largest MI, and shows some of the results beyond small amplitude
perturbations. Phonon dispersion curves are computed numerically; we find analytic solutions
for the phonon dispersion in a variety of limiting cases.
