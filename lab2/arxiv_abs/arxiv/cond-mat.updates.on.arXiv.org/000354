Understanding the superconducting proximity effect on the surface of a topological insulator
is of critical importance in realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions in
solid state settings. We fabricate delicate heterostructure samples between topological insulator
(TI) Bi2Se3 thin film and high temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ (Tc ~ 91 K). Using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we probe the electronic structure and the possible existence of superconducting
gap on the top surface of Bi2Se3 thin films. Our systematic data show no significant proximity-induced
superconducting gap in the topological surface states with sample temperature down to 10 K (<<91
K) and with a confidence level of sub 5 meV, much smaller than what have been claimed previously, which
indicates the near absence of the proximity-induced superconductivity on the TI surface. Our momentum
space imaging provides evidence for the coexistence of two crystalline phases in Bi2Se3/Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+
samples, which we argue to be due to the strong mismatch of lattice crystalline symmetries. Our data
identify the major contributors in reducing the proximity-induced superconducting gap below
the meV range, including the lack of momentum space overlap between the Bi2Se3 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+
Fermi surfaces, the strong mismatch of lattice crystalline symmetries and superconducting pairing
symmetries, as well as the very short superconducting coherence length in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+. Our
ARPES studies not only provide critical momentum space insights into the Bi2Se3/Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+
heterostructure, but also set an upper bound on the proximity induced gap for realizing a Majorana
fermion condition in this system, which may be further destabilized by the d-wave nodes dominated
in a cuprate superconductor.
