We introduce time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) as a fully quantum framework
for spin-transfer torque (STT), and apply it to understand if recently discovered quantum STT in
spin valves at ultralow temperature can lead to magnetization reversal. The conventional Slonczewski-Berger
STT---where the magnetization is viewed as a classical vector described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation---occurs only when spin-polarization of injected electrons and localized spins are
noncollinear. Conversely, quantum STT occurs when these vectors are collinear but antiparallel,
thereby requiring a fully quantum treatment of both electrons and localized spins. Using tDMRG,
we simulate time evolution of a many-body quantum state of electrons and localized spins, where
the former are injected as spin-polarized current pulse from fermionic leads while the latter comprise
a quantum Heisenberg ferromagnetic metallic (FM) spin-1/2 XXZ chain that can also be viewed as a
Kondo-Heisenberg chain. The quantum STT reverses the direction of localized spins, but without
rotatation from the initial orientation, when the number of injected electrons exceeds the number
of localized spins. Such nonclassical reversal is highly inhomogeneous across the FM chain and
accompanied by reduction of the magnetization associated with localized spins, even to zero at
specific locations. This is because quantum STT driven nonequilibrium dynamics generates highly
entangled nonequilibrium many-body state of all flowing and localized spins, despite starting
from initially separable quantum state of a mundane FM, thereby leading to true decoherence of each
localized spin subsystem. The global entanglement growth differentiates between quantum and
conventional STT since in the former case it nearly reaches the maximum possible value.
