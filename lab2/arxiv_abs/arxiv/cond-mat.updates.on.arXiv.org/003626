The experimental observation of superconductivity in doped semimetals and semiconductors, where
the Fermi energy is comparable to or smaller than the characteristic phonon frequencies, is not
captured by the conventional theory. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for superconductivity
in ultralow-density three-dimensional Dirac materials based on the proximity to a ferroelectric
quantum critical point. We derive a low-energy theory that takes into account both the strong Coulomb
interaction and the direct coupling between the electrons and the soft phonon modes. We show that
the Coulomb repulsion is strongly screened by the lattice polarization near the critical point
even in the case of vanishing carrier density. Using a renormalization group analysis, we demonstrate
that the effective electron-electron interaction is dominantly mediated by the transverse phonon
mode. We find that the system generically flows towards strong electron-phonon coupling. Hence,
we propose a new mechanism to simultaneously produce an attractive interaction and suppress strong
Coulomb repulsion, which does not require retardation. For comparison, we perform same analysis
for covalent crystals, where lattice polarization is negligible. We obtain qualitatively similar
results, though the screening of the Coulomb repulsion is much weaker. We then apply our results
to study superconductivity in the low-density limit. We find strong enhancement of the transition
temperature upon approaching the quantum critical point. Finally, we also discuss scenarios to
realize a topological $p$-wave superconducting state in covalent crystals close to the critical
point.
