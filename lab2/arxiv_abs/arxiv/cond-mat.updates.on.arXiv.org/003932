As a fast-growing family of 2D materials, MXenes are rising into the limelight due to their attractive
properties that leading to applications in energy storage, catalysis, microwave attenuation,
etc. As their precursors, MAX phases are a family of layered, hexagonal-structure ternary carbides
and nitrides. The exploration of novel MAX phases would largely expand the candidates for future
MXenes with various component elements and microstructures. Meanwhile, apart from their indispensable
role in Top-down synthesis of MXenes, MAX phase materials show remarkable combination of characteristics
of metals and ceramics, endowing them great interest as both structural and functional materials.
Up to now, there are more than 100 MAX compositions synthesized to date; and discoveries of new MAX
phases (Ti3AuC2, Ti3IrC2, Ti2ZnC, Nb2CuC et al.) are continuously being reported by experimental
scientists. To increase the efficiency in the successful search for novel MAX phases, a general
guideline should be set up to direct experiment through an information-prediction system incorporating
all MAX phases' databases and high-quality regularities. In this work, we introduce the structure
mapping methodology, which has shown its viability of being an effective guideline in design of
MAX phases, and also provide simple principles for experimental scientists in the search for novel
MAX phases. In fact, above-mentioned new MAX phases are falling into structure-stability regime
that predicted by this structure mapping methodology. These new MAX phases, whatever experimentally
reported or theoretically predicted, will largely enrich the structure-modification and property-tuning
of derived MXenes.
