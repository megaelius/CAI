In this work, the strain modulation of electronic structure and magnetic interaction in monolayer
nanoribbons of B$_2$S, a recently realized monolayer system, is investigated. In the first part
of our study, we focus on how the electronic structure of monolayer nanoribbons of B$_2$S is modified
under uniaxial strains, then employing a tight-binding framework together with the conventional
theory of elasticity, we discuss how strain-induced local deformations can be used as a means to
affect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in zigzag nanoribbons of B$_2$S. We
show that breaking inversion symmetry in zigzag B$_2$S nanoribbons (ZBSNR), e.g., by introducing
staggered sublattice potentials, play a key role in the modulation of their electronic properties.
More interestingly, for the ZBSNRs belong to the group $M=4p$, with $M$ the width of the ZBSNR and
$p$ an integer number, one can see that a band gap, in which a pair of near-midgap bands completely
detached from the bulk bands is always observed. As a key feature, the position of the midgap bands
in the energy diagram of ZBSNRs can be shifted by applying the in-plane strains $\varepsilon_x$
and $\varepsilon_y$. Moreover, the near-midgap bandwidth monotonically decreases with increasing
strength of the strain and increases with the width of the ZBSNR. The energy gap of the ZBSNRs decreased
with increasing the applied strain and ribbon width. The spatial and strain dependency of the exchange
interaction in various configurations of the magnetic impurities are also evaluated. The magnetic
interactions between adsorbed magnetic impurities in B$_2$S nanoribbons can be manipulated by
careful strain engineering of such systems. Our results suggest that these tunable electronic
and magnetic properties of ZBSNRs mean they may find applications in spintronics and pseudospin
electronics based on monolayer B$_2$S nanoribbons.
