We report on the dynamics of electron spins in n-doped CdTe layers that differs significantly from
the expected response derived from the studies dedicated to electron spin relaxation in n-GaAs.
At zero magnetic field, the electron spin noise spectra exhibit a two-peak structure - a zero-frequency
line and a satellite - that we attribute to the electron spin precession in a frozen random nuclear
spin distribution. This implies a surprisingly long electron spin correlation time whatever the
doping level, even above the Mott transition. Using spatiotemporal spin noise spectroscopy, we
demonstrate that the observation of a satellite in the spin noise spectra and a fast spin diffusion
are mutually exclusive. This is consistent with a shortening of the electron spin correlation time
due to hopping between donors. We interpret our data via a model assuming that the low temperature
spin relaxation is due to hopping between donors in presence of hyperfine and anisotropic exchange
interactions. Most of our results can be interpreted in this framework. First, a transition from
inhomogeneous to homogeneous broadening of the spin noise peaks and the disappearance of the satellite
are observed when the hopping rate becomes larger than the Larmor period induced by the local nuclear
fields. In the regime of homogeneous broadening the ratio between the spin diffusion constant and
the spin relaxation rate has a value in good agreement with the Dresselhaus constant. In the regime
of inhomogeneous broadening, most of the samples exhibit a broadening consistent with the distribution
of local nuclear fields. We obtain a new estimate of the hyperfine constants in CdTe and a value of
0.10 Tesla for the maximum nuclear field. Finally, our study also reveals a puzzle as our samples
behave as if the active donor concentration was reduced by several orders of magnitudes with respect
to the nominal values.
