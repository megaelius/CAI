We report a comprehensive small-angle neutron scattering~(SANS) study of magnetic correlations
in Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$Si at zero magnetic field. To delineate changes of magneto-crystalline
anisotropies (MCAs) from effects due to defects and disorder, we recorded complementary susceptibility
and high-resolution specific heat data, and investigated selected compositions of Mn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si.
For all systems studied the helimagnetic transition temperature and magnetic phase diagrams evolve
monotonically with composition consistent with literature. The SANS intensity patterns of the
spontaneous magnetic order recorded under zero-field cooling, which were systematically tracked
over forty angular positions, display strong changes of the directions of the intensity maxima
and smeared out intensity distributions as a function of composition. We show that cubic MCAs account
for the complex evolution of the SANS patterns, where for increasing $x$ the character of the MCAs
shifts from terms that are fourth-order to terms that are sixth order in spin--orbit coupling. The
magnetic field dependence of the susceptibility and SANS establishes that the helix reorientation
under doping is dominated by pinning due to defects and disorder. The presence of well-defined thermodynamic
anomalies of the specific heat at the phase boundaries of the skyrmion lattice phase establishes
that the pinning due to defects and disorder remains, however, comparatively weak. The observation
that MCAs, that are sixth order in spin-orbit coupling, play an important role for the spontaneous
order in Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$Si and Mn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si offer a fresh perspective for a wide range
of topics in cubic chiral magnets such as the generic magnetic phase diagram, the morphology of topological
spin textures, the paramagnetic-to-helical transition, and quantum phase transitions.
