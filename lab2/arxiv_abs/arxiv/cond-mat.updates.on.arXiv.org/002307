We study from first principles the luminescence of Lu$_2$SiO$_5$:Ce$^{3+}$ (LSO:Ce), a scintillator
widely used in medical imaging applications, and establish the crucial role of oxygen vacancies
(V$_O$) in the generated spectrum. The excitation energy, emission energy and Stokes shift of its
luminescent centers are simulated through a constrained density-functional theory method coupled
with a ${\Delta}$SCF analysis of total energies, and compared with experimental spectra. We show
that the high-energy emission band comes from a single Ce-based luminescent center, while the large
experimental spread of the low-energy emission band originates from a whole set of different Ce-V$_O$
complexes together with the other Ce-based luminescent center. Further, the luminescence thermal
quenching behavior is analyzed. The $4f-5d$ crossover mechanism is found to be very unlikely, with
a large crossing energy barrier (E$_{fd}$) in the one-dimensional model. The alternative mechanism
usually considered, namely the electron auto-ionization, is also shown to be unlikely. In this
respect, we introduce a new methodology in which the time-consuming accurate computation of the
band gap for such models is bypassed. We emphasize the usually overlooked role of the differing geometry
relaxation in the excited neutral electronic state Ce$^{3+,*}$ and in the ionized electronic state
Ce$^{4+}$. The results indicate that such electron auto-ionization cannot explain the thermal
stability difference between the high- and low-energy emission bands. Finally, a hole auto-ionization
process is proposed as a plausible alternative. With the already well-established excited state
characterization methodology, the approach to color center identification and thermal quenching
analysis proposed here can be applied to other luminescent materials in the presence of intrinsic
defects.
