We determine the electronic density of states for computationally-generated bulk samples of amorphous
chalcogenide alloys As$_{x}$Se$_{100-x}$. The samples were generated using a structure-building
algorithm reported recently by us ({J. Chem. Phys.} ${\bf 147}$, 114505). Several key features
of the calculated density of states are in good agreement with experiment: The trend of the mobility
gap with arsenic content is reproduced. The sample-to-sample variation in the energies of states
near the mobility gap is quantitatively consistent with the width of the Urbach tail in the optical
edge observed in experiment. Most importantly, our samples consistently exhibit very deep-lying
midgap electronic states that are delocalized significantly more than what would be expected for
a deep impurity or defect state; the delocalization is highly anisotropic. These properties are
consistent with those of the topological midgap electronic states that have been proposed by Zhugayevych
and Lubchenko as an explanation for several puzzling opto-electronic anomalies observed in the
chalcogenides, including light-induced midgap absorption and ESR signal, and anomalous photoluminescence.
In a complement to the traditional view of the Urbach states as a generic consequence of disorder
in atomic positions, the present results suggest these states can be also thought of as intimate
pairs of topological midgap states that cannot recombine because of disorder. Finally, samples
with an odd number of electrons exhibit neutral, spin $1/2$ midgap states as well as polaron-like
configurations that consist of a charge carrier bound to an intimate pair of midgap states; the polaron's
identity---electron or hole---depends on the preparation protocol of the sample.
