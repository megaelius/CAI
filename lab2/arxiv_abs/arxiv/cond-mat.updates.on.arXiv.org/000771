The textbook thermophoretic force which acts on a body in a fluid is proportional to the local temperature
gradient. The same is expected to hold for the macroscopic drift behavior of a diffusive cluster
or molecule physisorbed on a solid surface. The question we explore here is whether that is still
valid on a 2D membrane such as graphene at short sheet length. By means of a non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics study of a test system -- a gold nanocluster adsorbed on free-standing graphene clamped
between two temperatures $\Delta T$ apart -- we find a phoretic force which for submicron sheet lengths
is parallel to, but basically independent of, the local gradient magnitude. This identifies a thermophoretic
regime that is ballistic rather than diffusive, persisting up to and beyond a hundred nanometer
sheet length. Analysis shows that the phoretic force is due to the flexural phonons, whose flow is
known to be ballistic and distance-independent up to relatively long mean-free paths. Yet, ordinary
harmonic phonons should only carry crystal momentum and, while impinging on the cluster, should
not be able to impress real momentum. We show that graphene, and other membrane-like monolayers,
support a specific anharmonic connection between the flexural corrugation and longitudinal phonons
whose fast escape leaves behind a 2D-projected mass density increase endowing the flexural phonons,
as they move with their group velocity, with real momentum, part of which is transmitted to the adsorbate
through scattering. The resulting distance-independent ballistic thermophoretic force is not
unlikely to possess practical applications.
