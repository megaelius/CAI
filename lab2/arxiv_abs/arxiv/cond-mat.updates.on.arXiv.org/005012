We develop a biophysical model for predicting self-organization and reshaping of artificial tissue
due to the microscopic active forces between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), which we
solve using simulated annealing, obtaining close agreement with experiment. The feedback between
active forces generated by cells, and the extracellular matrix within which they exist, is a process
central to the macroscopic self-organization and reshaping of tissues. There is a need to: (1) construct
biophysical models, that can simulate these processes for the very large number of cells found in
artificial tissues, (2) validate and calibrate those models against experimental data, (3) understand
the active feedback between cells and the extracellular matrix, and its relationship to macroscopic
self-organization and reshaping of tissues, to develop better design techniques for artificial
biological tissues. The biophysical model that we develop to understand this active feedback consists
of a contractile network representing the ECM, that interacts with a sufficiently large number
of cells to describe macroscopic self-organization and reshaping of tissue. We solve the model
using simulated annealing, validating our simulations against artificial neural tissue grown
in a range of molds, and show how model parameters can be calibrated using untethered tissue grown
in multiwell plates. We conclude that symmetry is a key factor in the active forces that drive complex,
yet predictable, macroscopic self-organization and reshaping of tissue. We discuss important
applications of the biophysical model to simulation and rational design of artificial tissues
that could be used in pharmaceutical testing and regenerative medicine.
