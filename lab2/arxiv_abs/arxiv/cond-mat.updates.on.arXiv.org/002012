We show that a scaling approach successfully characterizes clustering and intermittency in space
and time, in systems of noninteracting particles driven by fluctuating surfaces. We study both
the steady state and the approach to it, for passive particles sliding on one-dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson
or Kardar-Parisi-Zhang surfaces, with particles moving either along or against the growth direction
in the latter case. Extensive numerical simulations are supplemented by analytical results for
a sticky slider model in which particles coalesce when they meet. Results for single particle displacement
versus time show to what extent particle dynamics is slaved to the surface, while scaling properties
of the probability distribution of the separation of two particles have important implications
for replica symmetry breaking for a pair of trajectories. For the many-particle system, clustering
in steady state is studied via moments of particle number fluctuations in a single stretch, revealing
different degrees of spatial multiscaling with different driving. Temporal intermittency in
steady state is established by showing that the scaled flatness diverges. Finally we consider the
approach to the steady state, and study both the flatness and the evolution of equal-time correlation
functions, as in coarsening of phase ordering systems. Our studies give clear evidence for a simple
scaling description of the approach to steady state, with a diverging length scale. An investigation
of aging properties reveals that flatness is nonmonotonic in time with two distinct branches, and
that a scaling description holds for each one.
