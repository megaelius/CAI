Spatially extended population dynamics models that incorporate intrinsic noise serve as case
studies for the role of fluctuations and correlations in biological systems. Including spatial
structure and stochastic noise in predator-prey competition invalidates the deterministic Lotka-Volterra
picture of neutral population cycles. Stochastic models yield long-lived erratic population
oscillations stemming from a resonant amplification mechanism. In spatially extended predator-prey
systems, one observes noise-stabilized activity and persistent correlations. Fluctuation-induced
renormalizations of the oscillation parameters can be analyzed perturbatively. The critical
dynamics and the non-equilibrium relaxation kinetics at the predator extinction threshold are
characterized by the directed percolation universality class. Spatial or environmental variability
results in more localized patches which enhances both species densities. Affixing variable rates
to individual particles and allowing for trait inheritance subject to mutations induces fast evolutionary
dynamics for the rate distributions. Stochastic spatial variants of cyclic competition with rock-paper-scissors
interactions illustrate connections between population dynamics and evolutionary game theory,
and demonstrate how space can help maintain diversity. In two dimensions, three-species cyclic
competition models of the May-Leonard type are characterized by the emergence of spiral patterns
whose properties are elucidated by a mapping onto a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Extensions
to general food networks can be classified on the mean-field level, which provides both a fundamental
understanding of ensuing cooperativity and emergence of alliances. Novel space-time patterns
emerge as a result of the formation of competing alliances, such as coarsening domains that each
incorporate rock-paper-scissors competition games.
