We propose the existence of a lower bound on the energy of pure neutron matter (PNM) on the basis of
unitary-gas considerations. We discuss its justification from experimental studies of cold atoms
as well as from theoretical studies of neutron matter. We demonstrate that this bound results in
limits to the density-dependent symmetry energy, which is the difference between the energies
of symmetric nuclear matter and PNM. In particular, this bound leads to a lower limit to the volume
symmetry energy parameter $S_0$. In addition, for assumed values of $S_0$ above this minimum, this
bound implies both upper and lower limits to the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$, which describes
the lowest-order density dependence of the symmetry energy. A lower bound on the neutron-matter
incompressibility is also obtained. These bounds are found to be consistent with both recent calculations
of the energies of PNM and constraints from nuclear experiments. Our results are significant because
several equations of state that are currently used in astrophysical simulations of supernovae
and neutron star mergers, as well as in nuclear physics simulations of heavy-ion collisions, have
symmetry energy parameters that violate these bounds. Furthermore, below the nuclear saturation
density, the bound on neutron-matter energies leads to a lower limit to the density-dependent symmetry
energy, which leads to upper limits to the nuclear surface symmetry parameter and the neutron-star
crust-core boundary. We also obtain a lower limit to the neutron-skin thicknesses of neutron-rich
nuclei. Above the nuclear saturation density, the bound on neutron-matter energies also leads
to an upper limit to the symmetry energy, with implications for neutron-star cooling via the direct
Urca process.
