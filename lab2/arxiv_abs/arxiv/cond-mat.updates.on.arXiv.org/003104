We use a simple yet Earth-like atmospheric model to propose a new framework for understanding the
mathematics of blocking events. Analysing error growth rates along a very long model trajectory,
we show that blockings are associated with conditions of anomalously high instability of the atmosphere.
Additionally, the lifetime of a blocking is positively correlated with the intensity of such an
anomaly, against intuition. In the case of Atlantic blockings, predictability is especially reduced
at the onset and decay of the blocking, while a relative increase of predictability is found in the
mature phase, while the opposite holds for Pacific blockings, for which predictability is lowest
in the mature phase. We associate blockings to a specific class of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs),
natural modes of variability that cover the attractor of the system. The UPOs differ substantially
in terms of instability, which explains the diversity of the atmosphere in terms predictability.
The UPOs associated to blockings are indeed anomalously unstable, which leads to them being rarely
visited. The onset of a blocking takes place when the trajectory of the system hops into the neighbourhood
of one of these special UPOs. The decay takes place when the trajectory hops back to the neighbourhood
of usual, less unstable UPOs associated with zonal flow. This justifies the classical Markov chains-based
analysis of transitions between weather regimes. The existence of UPOs differing in the dimensionality
of their unstable manifold indicates a very strong violation of hyperbolicity in the model, which
leads to a lack of structural stability. We propose that this is could be a generic feature of atmospheric
models and might be a fundamental cause behind difficulties in representing blockings for the current
climate and uncertainties in predicting how their statistics will change as a result of climate
change.
