In this paper, based on the effective intermolecular potential with well separated density and
configuration contributions and the definition of the isothermal bulk modulus, we derive two similar
equations of state dedicated to describe volumetric data of supercooled liquids studied in the
extremely wide pressure range related to the extremely wide density range. Both the equations comply
with the generalized density scaling law of molecular dynamics versus $h(\rho ) / T$ at different
densities $\rho $ and temperatures $T$, where the scaling exponent can be in general only a density
function $\gamma(\rho ) = \it{d} \rm{ln} \it{h / d} \rm{ln}\rho $ as recently argued by the theory
of isomorphs. We successfully verify these equations of state by using data obtained from molecular
dynamics simulations of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones liquid. As a very important result,
we find that the one-parameter density function $h(\rho )$ analytically formulated in the case
of this prototypical model of supercooled liquid, which implies the one-parameter density function
$\gamma(\rho )$, is able to scale the structural relaxation times with the value of this function
parameter determined by fitting the volumetric simulation data to the equations of state. We also
show that these equations of state properly describe the pressure dependences of the isothermal
bulk modulus and the configurational isothermal bulk modulus in the extremely wide pressure range
investigated by the computer simulations. Moreover, we discuss the possible forms of the density
functions $h(\rho )$ and $\gamma(\rho )$ for real glass formers, which are suggested to be different
from those valid for the model of supercooled liquid based on the Lennard-Jones intermolecular
potential.
