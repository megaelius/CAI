Coalescence of tiny-sized particles into large-sized particles has been an overlooked phenomenon
for a long time. This study focuses on the development of gold particles under varying precursor
concentration in a custom-built setup. Under the tuned ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time, tiny
particles of different size and shape develop depending on the amount of gold precursor. Nano-energy
of pulse packets bind gold atoms into own shape when they morph in compact monolayer assembly at solution
surface. Between precursor concentration 0.07 mM to 0.90 mM, developing of tiny particles are both
in triangular-shape and non-triangular-shape. Tiny particles of triangular-shape develop in
a large number at precursor concentration 0.30 mM and 0.60 mM. Prior to develop anisotropic particles,
joined triangular-shape tiny particles separated into two triangle-shaped tiny particles under
the application of force in surface-format. Prior to assemble, atoms of one-dimensional arrays
of such tiny particles elongate to modify for structures of smooth elements. Structures of smooth
elements assemble to develop different anisotropic particles at the point where exerting force
in surface-format is ended. When the precursor concentration was 0.05 mM and 1.20 mM, tiny-sized
particles do not develop in a triangular-shape and their packing under the mixed-behavior of forces
is largely developed into particles of distorted shapes. Anisotropic particles show different
structure than the distorted particles. At 50 sccm Argon flow rate, particles get developed in the
same shapes as for the case of 100 sccm Argon flow rate but colors of their solutions indicate a bit
different elongation rate of atoms forming structures of smooth elements. This study clarifies
the necessary concentration of gold precursor to develop particles of different size and shape.
