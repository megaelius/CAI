We construct an effective field theory, a two-dimensional two-component metallic system described
by a model with two Fermi surfaces ("pockets"). This model describes a translationally invariant
metallic system with two types of fermions, each with its own Fermi surface, with forward scattering
interactions. This model, in addition to the $O(2)$ rotational invariance, has a $U(1) \times U(1)$
symmetry of separate charge conservation for each Fermi surface. For sufficiently attractive
interactions in the $d$-wave (quadrupolar) channel this model has an interesting phase diagram
that includes a spontaneously generated anomalous Hall metal phase. We derive the Landau-Ginzburg
effective action of quadrupolar order parameter fields which enjoys an $O(2)\times U(1)$ global
symmetry associated to spatial isotropy and the internal $U(1)$ relative phase symmetries respectively.
We show that the order parameter theory is dynamically local with a dynamical scaling of $z=2$ and
perform a one-loop renormalization group analysis of the Landau-Ginzburg theory. The electronic
liquid crystal phases that result from spontaneous symmetry breaking are studied and we show the
presence of Landau damped Nambu-Goldstone modes at low momenta that is a signature of non-Fermi
liquid behavior. Electromagnetic linear response is also analyzed in both the normal and symmetry
broken phases from the point of view of the order parameter theory. The nature of the coupling of electromagnetism
to the order parameter fields in the normal phase is non-minimal and decidedly contains a precursor
to the anomalous Hall response in the form of a order-parameter-dependent Chern-Simons term in
the effective action.
