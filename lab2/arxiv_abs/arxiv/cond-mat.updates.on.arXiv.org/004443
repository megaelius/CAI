We report on the experimental and theoretical investigation of magnetic-field-induced second
harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon absorption (TPA) of excited exciton states ($n \geq 3$)
of the yellow series in Cu$_2$O. In this centrosymmetric material, SHG can occur due to constructive
interplay of electric dipole and electric quadrupole/magnetic dipole transitions for light propagating
along the low-symmetry directions [111] or [112]. By application of a magnetic field in Voigt configuration,
SHG gets also allowed for excitation along the [110]-axis and even the high-symmetry cubic direction
[001]. Combining a symmetry analysis and a microscopic theory, we uncover the two key contributions
to the magnetic-field-induced SHG: the Zeeman effect and the magneto-Stark effect. We demonstrate
systematic dependencies of the SHG intensity on the linear polarization angles of the ingoing fundamental
laser and the outgoing SHG beam. In general, the resulting contour plots in combination with a symmetry
analysis allow one to determine uniquely the character of involved transitions. Moreover, we can
separate in magnetic field the Zeeman and the magneto-Stark effect through appropriate choice
of the experimental geometry and polarization configuration. We present a microscopic theory
of the second harmonic generation of excitons in a centrosymmetric cubic semiconductor taking
into account the symmetry and the band structure of cuprous oxide. Based on the developed microscopic
theory we identify the main contributions to the second-order nonlinear susceptibility of $S$-,
$P$- and $D$-excitons. We analyze the redistribution of SHG intensities between the excitonic
states both in the absence and presence of the magnetic field and show good agreement with the experimental
data. With increasing exciton principal quantum number the magneto-Stark effect overpowers the
influence of the Zeeman effect.
