The wide bandgap, high-breakdown electric field, and high carrier mobility makes GaN an ideal material
for high-power and high-frequency electronics applications such as wireless communication and
radar systems. However, the performance and reliability of GaN-based HEMTs are limited by the high
channel temperature induced by Joule-heating in the device channel. High thermal conductivity
substrates integrated with GaN can improve the extraction of heat from GaN based HEMTs and lower
the device operating temperature. However, heterogeneous integration of GaN with diamond substrates
is not trivial and presents technical challenges to maximize the heat dissipation potential brought
by the diamond substrate. In this work, two modified room temperature surface activated bonding
techniques are used to bond GaN and single crystal diamond with different interlayer thicknesses.
TDTR is used to measure the thermal properties from room temperature to 480 K. A relatively large
TBC of the GaN-diamond interfaces with a 4nm interlayer was observed and material characterization
was performed to link the structure of the interface to the TBC. Device modeling shows that the measured
GaN-diamond TBC values obtained from bonding can enable high power GaN devices by taking the full
advantage of the high thermal conductivity of single crystal diamond and achieve excellent cooling
effect. Furthermore, the room-temperature bonding process in this work do not induce stress problem
due to different coefficient of thermal expansion in other high temperature integration processes
in previous studies. Our work sheds light on the potential for room-temperature heterogeneous
integration of semiconductors with diamond for applications of electronics cooling especially
for GaN-on-diamond devices.
