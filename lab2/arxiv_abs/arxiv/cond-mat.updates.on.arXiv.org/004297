For a wide class of noninteracting tight-binding models in one dimension we present an analytical
solution for all scattering and edge states on a half-infinite system. Without assuming any symmetry
constraints we consider models with nearest-neighbor hoppings and one orbital per site but arbitrary
size of the unit cell and generic modulations of on-site potentials and hoppings. The solutions
are parametrized by determinants which can be calculated from recursion relations. This representation
allows for an elegant analytic continuation to complex quasimomentum consistent with previous
treatments for continuum models. Two important analytical results are obtained: (1) An explicit
proof of the surface charge theorem is presented including a unique relationship between the boundary
charge $Q_B^{(\alpha)}$ of a single band $\alpha$ and the bulk polarization in terms of the Zak-Berry
phase with no unknown integer left. This establishes a precise form of a bulk-boundary correspondence
relating the {\it boundary charge of a single band} to bulk properties. (2) We derive a topological
constraint for the phase-dependence of the edge state energies, where the phase variable describes
a continuous shift of the lattice towards the boundary. The topological constraint is shown to be
equivalent to the quantization of a topological index $I=\Delta Q_B-\bar{\rho}\in \{-1,0\}$
introduced in an accompanying letter [arXiv:1911.06890]. Here $\Delta Q_B$ is the change of the
boundary charge $Q_B$ for a given chemical potential in the insulating regime when the lattice is
shifted by one site towards the boundary, and $\bar{\rho}$ is the average charge per site (both in
units of the elementary charge $e=1$). This establishes an interesting link between universal
properties of the boundary charge and edge state physics discussed within the field of topological
insulators.
