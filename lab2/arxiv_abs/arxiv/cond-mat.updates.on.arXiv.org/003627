Effects of green tea tannin epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) on thermal-stress-induced amyloid
fibril formation of reduced carboxymethylated bovine milk protein $\kappa$-casein (RCMK) were
studied by dynamical light scattering (DLS) and small angle x-rays scattering (SAXS). Two populations
of aggregates, micelles and fibrils, dominated the time evolution of light scattering intensity
and of effective hydrodynamic diameter. SAXS experiments allowed to resolve micelles and fibrils
so that the time dependence of scattering profile revealed structural evolution of the two populations.
The low-Q scattering intensity prior to an expected increase with time due to fibril growth, shows
an intriguing rapid decrease which is interpreted as the release of monomers from micelles. This
phenomenon, observed both in the absence and in the presence of EGCG, indicates that under thermal
stress free native monomers are converted to amyloid-prone monomers that do not form micelles.
The consumption of free native monomers results in a release of native monomers from micelles, because
only native protein participate in micelle-monomer (quasi-)equilibrium. This release is reversible,
indicating also that native-to-amyloid-prone monomers conversion is reversible as well. We show
that EGCG does not bind to protein in fibrils, neither does it affect/prevent the pro-amyloid conversion
of monomers. EGCG hinders the addition of monomers to growing fibrils. These facts allowed us to
propose kinetics model for EGCG-controlled amyloid aggregation of micellar proteins. Therein,
we introduced the growth-rate inhibition function which quantitatively accounts for the effect
of EGCG on the fibril growth at any degree of thermal stress.
