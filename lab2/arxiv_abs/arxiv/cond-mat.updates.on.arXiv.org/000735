Projective measurement is used as a fundamental axiom in quantum mechanics, even though it is discontinuous
and cannot predict which measured operator eigenstate will be observed in which experimental run.
The probabilistic Born rule gives it an ensemble interpretation, predicting proportions of various
outcomes over many experimental runs. Understanding gradual weak measurements requires replacing
this scenario with a dynamical evolution equation for the collapse of the quantum state in individual
experimental runs. We revisit the quantum trajectory framework that models quantum measurement
as a continuous nonlinear stochastic process. We describe the ensemble of quantum trajectories
as noise fluctuations on top of geodesics that attract the quantum state towards the measured operator
eigenstates. Investigation of the restrictions needed on the ensemble of quantum trajectories,
so as to reproduce projective measurement in the appropriate limit, shows that the Born rule follows
when the magnitudes of the noise and the attraction are precisely related, in a manner reminiscent
of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. That implies that both the noise and the attraction have
a common origin in the measurement interaction between the system and the apparatus. We analyse
the quantum trajectory ensemble for the scenarios of quantum diffusion and binary quantum jump,
and show that the ensemble distribution is completely determined in terms of a single evolution
parameter. This trajectory ensemble distribution can be tested in weak measurement experiments.
We also comment on how the required noise may arise in the measuring apparatus.
