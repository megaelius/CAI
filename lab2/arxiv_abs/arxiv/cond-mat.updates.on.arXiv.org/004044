The prediction of the melting curve of metals by extrapolation to high pressures and temperatures
based on the Lindemann-Gilvarry criterion (LG) assuming harmonic Debye solid is presented. The
LG formulation uses the bulk modulus B and its pressure derivative B' as fit parameters deduced directly
from the equation of state, however, the results are not unique and strongly depends on the chosen
equation of state (EOS). By introducing a constraint that the bulk moduli parameters B and B' must
simultaneously obey the Lindemann-Gilvarry criterion (LG) and the EOS, consistent bulk moduli
are derived. The cold pressure Pc and the cold melting curve are obtained by introducing an effective
Gr\"uneisen parameter ($\gamma$eff) to the LG approximated equation together with the above constraint.
It is claimed that isochoric condition exists in diamond anvil cells (DAC), thus upon raising the
temperature and approaching the melt constant volume is maintained. Isochoric condition in the
DAC means that the developed thermal pressure (Pth) should be accounted in the LG formulation. Therefor,
the actual pressure (Pc+Pth) sensed by the sample confined in the DAC should be inserted to the LG
melting formula. This brings along the demand that the shock waves Hugoniot melting data should
serve as anchor for deriving the correct melting curves of metals where the Gr\"uneisen parameter
$\gamma$ at ambient conditions ($\gamma$ o) is directly determined. The melting curves up to ultra
high pressures of Al, Cu, U and Fe metals are presented and discussed. In this manner, special attention
is given to $\epsilon$-Fe as isobaric condition in the DAC has been claimed. Utilizing the present
approach we obtain the melting temperature of iron in the earth inner core boundary (ICB, 330GPa)
is 5900$\pm$100K.
