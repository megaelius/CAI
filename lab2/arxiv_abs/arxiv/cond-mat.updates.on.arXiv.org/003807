We present a general quantum kinetic theory that accounts for the interplay between a temperature
gradient, momentum-space Berry curvatures of Bloch electrons, and Bloch-state scattering. Using
a theory that incorporates the presence of a temperature gradient by introducing a "thermal vector
potential", we derive a quantum kinetic equation for Bloch electrons in the presence of disorder
and a temperature gradient. Taking also into account the presence of electric and magnetic fields,
the quantum kinetic equation we derive makes it possible to compute transport coefficients at arbitrary
orders of electric-field $\vec{E}$, magnetic-field $\vec{B}$, and temperature-gradient $\nabla
T$ strengths $|\vec{E}|^a |\vec{B}|^b |\nabla T|^c$. Our theory enables a systematic calculation
of magnetothermoelectric and magnetothermal conductivities of systems with momentum-space
Berry curvatures. As an illustration, we derive from a general microscopic electron model a general
expression for the rate of pumping of electrons between valleys in parallel temperature gradient
and magnetic field. From this expression we find a relation, which is analogous to the Mott relation,
between the rate of pumping due to a temperature gradient and that due to an electric field. We also
apply our theory to a two-band model for Weyl semimetals to study thermoelectric and thermal transport
in a magnetic field. We show that the Mott relation is satisfied in the chiral-anomaly induced thermoelectric
conductivity, and that the Wiedemann-Franz law is violated in the chiral-anomaly induced thermal
conductivity, which are both consistent with the results obtained by invoking semiclassical wave-packet
dynamics.
