We reconsider the long-explored problem that the magnitude of the measured Casimir force between
an Au sphere and an indium tin oxide (ITO) film decreases significantly with no respective changes
in the ITO dielectric permittivity required by the Lifshitz theory. Two plausible resolutions
of this conundrum are discussed: the phase transition of an ITO film from metallic to dielectric
state and the modification of a film surface under the action of UV light. To exclude the latter option,
we propose an improvement in the experimental scheme by adding a graphene sheet on top of an ITO film.
The formalism is developed allowing precise calculation of the Casimir force between an Au sphere
and a graphene sheet on top of ITO film deposited on a quartz substrate. In doing so Au, ITO, and quartz
are described by the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivities and real graphene sheet with
nonzero mass-gap parameter and chemical potential by the polarization tensor at nonzero temperature.
Numerical computations performed both before and after the phase transition resulting from the
UV treatment show that the presence of graphene leads to only a minor decrease in the drop of the Casimir
force which remains quite measurable. At the same time, in the presence of graphene the guess that
an observed drop originates from the modification of an ITO surface by the UV light breaks down. Similar
results are obtained for the configuration of two parallel plates consisting of a graphene sheet,
an ITO film and a quartz substrate. The proposed experiments involving additional graphene sheets
may help in resolution of the problems arising in application of the Lifshitz theory to real materials.
