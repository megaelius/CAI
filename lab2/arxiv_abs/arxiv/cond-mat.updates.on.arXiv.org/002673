The Enskog kinetic theory for moderately dense granular suspensions is considered as a model to
determine the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients. The influence of the interstitial gas on
solid particles is modeled by a viscous drag force term plus a stochastic Langevin-like term. The
suspension model is solved by means of the Chapman--Enskog method conveniently adapted to dissipative
dynamics. As in previous studies on driven granular fluids, since the cooling terms (arising from
collisional dissipation and viscous friction) cannot be compensated for by the energy gained by
grains due to collisions with the interstitial gas, the reference distribution $f^{(0)}$ (zeroth-order
approximation of the Chapman--Enskog solution) depends on time through its dependence on temperature.
On the other hand, to simplify the analysis and given that we are interested in computing transport
properties in the first order of deviations from the reference state, the steady-state conditions
are considered. This simplification allows us to get explicit expressions for the Navier--Stokes
transport coefficients. As expected, the transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions
of a set of coupled linear integral equations. Explicit forms for these coefficients are obtained
by considering the leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion. The results show that the dependence
of the transport coefficients on both inelasticity and density is clearly different from that found
in its granular counterpart (no gas phase). Finally, a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic
equations with respect to the homogeneous steady state is performed. In contrast to the granular
case (no gas-phase), no instabilities are found and hence, the homogeneous steady state is (linearly)
stable.
