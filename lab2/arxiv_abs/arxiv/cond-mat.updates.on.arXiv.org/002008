In this paper the low-temperature properties of two isostructural canonical heavy-fermion compounds
are contrasted with regards to the interplay between antiferromagnetic (AF) quantum criticality
and superconductivity. For CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, fully-gapped d-wave superconductivity forms in
the vicinity of an itinerant three-dimensional heavy-fermion spin-density-wave (SDW) quantum
critical point (QCP). Inelastic neutron scattering results highlight that both quantum critical
SDW fluctuations as well as Mott-type fluctuations of local magnetic moments contribute to the
formation of Cooper pairs in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$. In YbRh$_2$Si$_2$, superconductivity appears to
be suppressed at $T\gtrsim~10$ mK by AF order ($T_N$ = 70 mK). Ultra-low temperature measurements
reveal a hybrid order between nuclear and 4f-electronic spins, which is dominated by the Yb-derived
nuclear spins, to develop at $T_A$ slightly above 2 mK. The hybrid order turns out to strongly compete
with the primary 4f-electronic order and to push the material towards its QCP. Apparently, this
paves the way for heavy-fermion superconductivity to form at $T_c$ = 2 mK. Like the pressure - induced
QCP in CeRhIn$_5$, the magnetic field - induced one in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ is of the local Kondo-destroying
variety which corresponds to a Mott-type transition at zero temperature. Therefore, these materials
form the link between the large family of about fifty low-$T$ unconventional heavy - fermion superconductors
and other families of unconventional superconductors with higher $T_c$s, notably the doped Mott
insulators of the cuprates, organic charge-transfer salts and some of the Fe-based superconductors.
Our study suggests that heavy-fermion superconductivity near an AF QCP is a robust phenomenon.
