Pursuing complementary field-theoretic and numerical methods, we here paint the global phase
diagram of a three-dimensional dirty Weyl system. The generalized Harris criterion, augmented
by a perturbative renormalization-group (RG) analysis shows that weak disorder is an irrelevant
perturbation at the Weyl semimetal(WSM)-insulator quantum critical point (QCP). But, a metallic
phase sets in through a quantum phase transition (QPT) at strong disorder across a multicritical
point (MCP). The field theoretic predictions for the correlation length exponent $\nu=2$ and dynamic
scaling exponent $z=5/4$ at this MCP are in good agreement with the ones extracted numerically,
yielding $\nu=1.98 \pm 0.10$ and $z=1.26 \pm 0.05$, from the scaling of the average density of states
(DOS). Deep inside the WSM phase, generic disorder is also an irrelevant perturbation, while a metallic
phase appears at strong disorder through a QPT. We here demonstrate that in the presence of generic,
but strong disorder the WSM-metal QPT is ultimately always characterized by the exponents $\nu=1$
and $z=3/2$ (to one-loop order), originating from intra-node or chiral symmetric (e.g., regular
and axial potential) disorder. We here anchor such emergent \emph{chiral superuniversality}
through complementary RG calculations, controlled via $\epsilon$-expansions, and numerical
analysis of average DOS across WSM-metal QPT. In addition, we also discuss a subsequent QPT (at even
stronger disorder) of a Weyl metal into an Anderson insulator by numerically computing the typical
DOS at zero energy. The scaling behavior of various physical observables, such as residue of quasiparticle
pole, dynamic conductivity, specific heat, Gr$\ddot{\mbox{u}}$neisen ratio, inside various
phases as well as across various QPTs in the global phase diagram of a dirty Weyl liquid are discussed.
