Abstract Applications of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond in quantum technology have
attracted considerable attention in recent years. Deterministic generation of ensembles of NV
centers can advance the research on quantum sensing, many-body quantum systems, multipartite
entanglement and so on. Here we report the complete process of controlled generation of NV centers
in diamond as well as their characterisation: growing diamond films through chemical vapor deposition
(CVD), ion implantation and spectroscopic characterization of the defect centers using a confocal
microscope. A microwave-assisted CVD set-up is presented which we constructed for the preparation
of single-crystalline homoepitaxial diamond films. The films were prepared with minimized nitrogen
concentration, which is confirmed through photoluminescence measurements. We demonstrate an
in situ ultra high vacuum (UHV) implantation and heating process for creation of NV centers using
a novel experimental set-up. For the first time hot implantation has been shown which prevents surface
charging effects. We do not observe graphitization due to UHV heating. By optimizing the implantation
parameters it has been possible to implant NV centers in a precise way. We present large area mapping
of the samples to determine the distribution of the centers and describe the characterization of
the centers by spectroscopic techniques. Reducing the decoherence caused by environmental noise
is of primary importance for many applications in quantum technology. We demonstrate improvement
on coherence time T_{2} of the NV spins by suppression of their interaction with the surrounding
spin-bath using robust dynamical decoupling sequences.
