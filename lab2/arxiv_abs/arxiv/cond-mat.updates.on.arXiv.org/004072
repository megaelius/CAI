Understanding the causes and effects of spatial patterns of vegetation is a fundamental problem
in ecology, especially because these can be used as early predictors of catastrophic shifts such
as desertification processes. Empirical studies of the vegetation cover of drylands and semiarid
regions have revealed the existence of vegetation patches of broadly diverse sizes, such that the
probability distribution of their sizes can be fitted by a power law, i.e. vegetation patches are
approximately scale free. Different explanatory mechanisms, such as plant-plant interactions
and plant-water feedback loops have been proposed to justify such a finding, yet a full understanding
has not been reached. Using a simple individual-based model for vegetation dynamics, we show that
environmental variability --a well-recognized characteristic feature of semiarid environments--
promotes the emergence of power-law vegetation patches in a robust way (i.e. for a broad range of
parameter values). Furthermore, these are related to a percolation phenomenon that occurs in an
intermittent or fluctuating way. The model also reveals that the emerging power-law exponents
depend on the overall vegetation-cover density exhibiting the same trend as empirical data and,
remarkably, the fitted exponents agree reasonably well with the ones measured in well-known empirical
studies. We conclude that environmental variability plays a key role in the formation of such vegetation
patterns. From a practical viewpoint, this may be of importance to predict the effects that changes
in environmental conditions may have in real ecosystems. From a theoretical side our study shed
new light on intermittent percolation phenomena occurring under fluctuating conditions.
