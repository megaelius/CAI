A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) describes a state of matter in which identical particles with
integer angular momentum (bosons) occupy a collective quantum state. Its magnetic analogue, the
magnon BEC, is particularly appealing for applications, as it can emerge at room temperature and
in solid-state environments. The BEC state is a prerequisite for dissipationless transport phenomena
such as superconductivity and superfluidity. Hence, magnon BECs should enable dissipationless
magnon transport. However, transport phenomena within a magnon condensate or the generation of
a critical magnon density by DC charge currents have only been considered theoretically. Here,
we demonstrate the realization of a magnon BEC using a DC magnetotransport scheme and study its room
temperature magnon conductivity. To this end, we utilize two platinum electrodes to electrically
inject and detect magnons in an adjacent yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. We control the magnon density
in the YIG by sourcing a DC charge current through a third Pt electrode. Above a critical DC current,
the magnon conductivity increases by almost two orders of magnitude. Our experimental findings
strongly suggest dissipationless magnon transport, i.e. the realization of spin superfluidity.
Within the magnon BEC, we identify two distinct regimes: the continuous condensation of magnons
into the ground state and the full compensation of the effective magnon damping. Our results demonstrate
an all-electrical approach for the investigation of the transport properties in a magnon BEC. The
regime of dissipationless magnon transport paves the way for phenomena equivalent to the Josephson
effects in superconductivity and will be of key relevance for future (quantum) magnonic devices.
