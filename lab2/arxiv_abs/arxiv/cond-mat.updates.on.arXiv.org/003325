The strong bending of polymers is poorly understood. We propose a general quantitative framework
of polymer bending that includes both the weak and strong bending regimes on the same footing, based
on a single general physical principle. As the bending deformation increases beyond a certain (polymer-specific)
point, the change in the convexity properties of the effective bending energy of the polymer makes
the harmonic deformation energetically unfavorable: in this strong bending regime the energy
of the polymer varies linearly with the average bending angle as the system follows the convex hull
of the deformation energy function. For double-stranded DNA, the effective bending deformation
energy becomes non-convex for bends greater than about 2 degrees per base-pair, equivalent to the
curvature of a closed circular loop of about 160 base pairs. A simple equation is derived for the polymer
loop energy that covers both the weak and strong bending regimes. The theory shows quantitative
agreement with recent DNA cyclization experiments on short DNA fragments, while maintaining the
expected agreement with experiment in the weak bending regime. Counter-intuitively, cyclization
probability (j-factor) of very short DNA loops is predicted to increase with decreasing loop length;
the j-factor reaches its minimum for loops of 45 base pairs. Atomistic simulations reveal that the
attractive component of the short-range Lennard-Jones interaction between the backbone atoms
can explain the underlying non-convexity of the DNA effective bending energy, leading to the linear
bending regime. Applicability of the theory to protein-DNA complexes, including the nucleosome,
is discussed.
