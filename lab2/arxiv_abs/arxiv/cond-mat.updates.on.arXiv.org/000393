This article describes the Fermi surface properties of CeRu$_2$Si$_2$ and its alloy systems CeRu$_2$(Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)$_2$
and Ce$_x$La$_{1-x}$Ru$_2$Si$_2$ studied by the de Haas - van Alphen (dHvA) effect. We pay particular
attention to how the Fermi surface properties and the f electron state change with magnetic properties,
in particular how they change associated with metamagnetic transition and quantum phase transition.
After summarizing the important physical properties of CeRu$_2$Si$_2$, we present the magnetic
phase diagrams of CeRu$_2$(Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)$_2$ and Ce$_x$La$_{1-x}$Ru$_2$Si$_2$ as a function
of temperature, magnetic field and concentration $x$. From the characteristic features of the
magnetic phase diagram, we argue that the ferromagnetic interaction in addition to the anitferromagnetic
interaction and the Kondo effect is responsible for the magnetic properties and that the metamagnetic
transitions in these systems are relevant to the ferromagnetic interaction. We summarize the Fermi
surface properties of CeRu$_2$Si$_2$ in fields below the metamagnetic transition where the f electron
state is now well understood theoretically as well as experimentally. We present experimental
results in fields above the metamagnetic transitions in CeRu$_2$(Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)$_2$ and
Ce$_x$La$_{1-x}$Ru$_2$Si$_2$ as well as CeRu$_2$Si$_2$ to show that the Fermi surface properties
above the metamagnetic transitions are significantly different from those below in many important
aspects. We argue that the Fermi surface properties above the metamagnetic transitions are not
appropriately described in terms of either itinerant or localized f electron. The experimental
results in fields below the metamagnetic transitions in CeRu$_2$(Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)$_2$ and
Ce$_x$La$_{1-x}$Ru$_2$Si$_2$ are presented to discuss the f electron state in the ground state.
