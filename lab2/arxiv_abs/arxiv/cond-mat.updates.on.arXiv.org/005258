The transport of bio-particles in viscous flows exhibits a rich variety of dynamical behaviour,
such as morphological transitions, complex orientation dynamics or deformations. Characterising
such complex behaviour under well controlled flows is key to understanding the microscopic mechanical
properties of biological particles as well as the rheological properties of their suspensions.
While generating regions of simple shear flow in microfluidic devices is relatively straightforward,
generating straining flows in which the strain rate is maintained constant for a sufficiently long
time to observe the objects' morphologic evolution is far from trivial. In this work, we propose
an innovative approach based on optimised design of microfluidic converging-diverging channels
coupled with a microscope-based tracking method to characterise the dynamic behaviour of individual
bio-particles under homogeneous straining flow. The tracking algorithm, combining a motorised
stage and microscopy imaging system controlled by external signals, allows us to follow individual
bio-particles transported over long-distances with high-quality images. We demonstrate experimentally
the ability of the numerically optimised microchannels to provide linear velocity streamwise
gradients along the centreline of the device, allowing for extended consecutive regions of homogeneous
elongation and compression. We selected three test cases (DNA, actin filaments and protein aggregates)
to highlight the ability of our approach for investigating the dynamics of objects with a wide range
of sizes, characteristics and behaviours of relevance in the biological world.
