Experiments reveal that DNA solvation dynamics (SD) is characterized by multiple time scales ranging
from a few ps to hundreds of ns and in some cases even up to microseconds. The last part of decay is slow
and is characterized by a power law (PL). The microscopic origin of this PL is not yet clearly understood.
Here we present a theoretical study based on time dependent statistical mechanics and computer
simulations. Our investigations show that the primary candidates responsible for this exotic
nature of SD are the counterions and ions from the buffer solution. We employ the model developed
by Oosawa for polyelectrolyte solution that includes effects of counterion fluctuations to construct
a frequency dependent dielectric function. We use it in the continuum model of Bagchi, Fleming and
Oxtoby only to find that it fails to explain the slow PL decay of DNA solvation dynamics. We then extend
the model by employing the continuous time random walk technique developed by Scher-Montroll-Lax.
This approach can explain the long time PL decay, in terms of the collective response of the counter
ions. From MD simulations we find frequent occurrence of random walk of tagged counter ions along
the phosphate backbone. We propose a generalized random walk model for counterion hopping and carry
out kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to show that the nonexponential contribution to solvation
dynamics can indeed arise from dynamics of such ions. We also employ a Mode Coupling Theory analysis
to understand the slow relaxation that originates from ions in solution. Explicit evaluation suggests
that buffer ion contribution could explain logarithmic time dependence in the ns time scale, but
not a power law. From MD simulations we find log-normal distributions of relaxation times of water
dynamics inside the grooves. This is responsible for the initial faster multiexponential decay
of SD.
