The effects of contact geometry and ideality on InGaAs and Si nano-scale n-channel FinFET performance
are studied using a quantum-corrected semi-classical Monte Carlo method. Illustrative end, saddle/slot,
and raised source/drain contacts were modeled, and with ideal transmissivity and reduced transmissivity
more consistent with experimental contact resistivities. Far-from-equilibrium degenerate
statistics, quantum-confinement effects on carrier distributions in real-space and among energy
valleys, quasi-ballistic transport inaccessible through drift-diffusion and hydrodynamic
simulations, and scattering mechanisms and contact geometries not readily accessible through
non-equilibrium Green's function simulation are addressed. Silicon $\langle \hbox{110} \rangle$
channel devices, Si $\langle \hbox{100} \rangle$ channel devices, multi-valley (MV) InGaAs devices
with conventionally-reported energy valley offsets, and idealized $\Gamma$-valley only $\left(
\Gamma \right)$ InGaAs devices are modeled. Simulated silicon devices exhibited relatively limited
degradation in performance due to non-ideal contact transmissivities, more limited sensitivity
to contact geometry with non-ideal contact transmissivities, and some contact-related advantage
for Si $\langle \hbox{110} \rangle$ channel devices. In contrast, simulated InGaAs devices were
highly sensitive to contact geometry and ideality and the peripheral valley's energy offset. It
is illustrative of this latter sensitivity that simulated $\Gamma$-InGaAs device outperformed
all others by a factor of two or more in terms of peak transconductance with perfectly transmitting
reference end contacts, while silicon devices outperformed $\Gamma$-InGaAs for all contact geometries
with non-ideal transmissivities, and MV-InGaAs devices performed the poorest under all simulation
scenarios.
