The (mean field based) BCS theory is considered one of the most successful theories in condensed
matter physics. It is justified in ordinary metal superconductors the coherence length $\xi$ is
large, with two important features: the order parameter (OP) and excitation gap (EG) are identical,
and the pair formation and their Bose condensation take place at the same temperature Tc. It fails
to explain the underdoped cuprate superconductivity: EG is finite at Tc and thus distinct from OP.
Since these superconductors belong to a large class of small $\xi$ materials, this failure has the
potential for widespread impact. Here we have extended BCS theory in a natural way to short $\xi$
superconductors, based on a BCS--BEC crossover scenario, and arrived at a simple physical picture
in which incoherent, finite momentum pairs become progressively more important as the pairing
interaction becomes stronger, leading to the distinction between EG and OP. The superconductivity
from the fermionic perspective and BEC from the bosonic perspective are just two sides of the same
coin. Our theory is capable of making verifiable quantitative predictions. We obtain a cuprate
phase diagram (with one free parameter) , in (semi-)quantitative agreement with experiment. The
mutually compensating contributions from fermionic quasiparticles and bosonic pair excitations
provides a natural explanation for the quasi-universal behavior of the in-plane superfluid density
versus T. Our bosonic pair excitations also provide an intrinsic mechanism for the long mysterious
linear T terms in the specific heat. Incoherent pair contributions lead to new low T power laws, consistent
with existing experiments. Finally, we demonstrated that the onset of superconducting long range
order leads to sharp features in the specific heat at Tc, consistent with experiment.
