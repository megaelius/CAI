We study the finite-temperature properties of the half-filled two-band Hubbard model in the presence
of Hund's rule coupling and orbital anisotropy. We use the mean-field treatment of the $Z_2$ slave-spin
theory with a finite-temperature extension of the zero-temperature gauge variable previously
developed by Hassan and de' Medici [\href{this http URL}{Phys. Rev. B {\bf 81}, 035106 (2010)}].
We consider the instability of the Fermi liquid phases and how it is enhanced by the Hund's rule. We
identify paramagnetic solutions that have zero quasi-particle weight with bad metallic phases,
and the first-order transition temperature between it and the Fermi liquid phase as a coherence
temperature that signals the crossover to the bad metallic state. When orbital anisotropy is present,
we found an intermediate transition to an orbital-selective bad metal (OSBM), where the narrow
band becomes a bad metal while the wide band remains a renormalised Fermi liquid. The temperatures
$T_\textrm{coh}$ and $T_\textrm{OSBM}$ at which the system transitions to the bad metal phases
can be orders of magnitude less than the Fermi temperature associated with the non-interacting
band. The parameter dependence of the temperature at which the OSBM is destroyed can be understood
in terms of a ferromagnetic Kondo-Hubbard lattice model. In general, Hund's rule coupling enhances
the bad metallic phases, reduce interorbital charge fluctuations and increase spin fluctuations.
The qualitative difference found in the ground state whether the Hund's rule is present or not, related
to the degeneracy of the low energy manifold, is also maintained for finite temperatures.
