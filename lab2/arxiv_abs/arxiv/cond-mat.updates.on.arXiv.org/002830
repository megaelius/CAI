Since the first realization of reversible charge doping in graphene via field-effect devices,
it has become evident how the induction a gap could further enhance its potential for technological
applications. Here we show that the gap opening due to a sublattice symmetry breaking has also a profound
impact on the polar response of graphene. By combining ab-initio calculations and analytical modelling
we show that for realistic band-gap values ($\Delta\lesssim 0.5$ eV) the piezoelectric coefficient
and the Born effective charge of graphene attain a giant value, independent on the gap. In particular
the piezoelectric coefficient per layer of gapped mono- and bilayer graphene is three times larger
than that of a large-gap full polar insulator as hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) monolayer, and 30\%
larger than that of a polar semiconductor as MoS$_2$. This surprising result indicates that piezoelectric
acoustic-phonons scattering can be relevant to model charge transport and charge-carrier relaxation
in gated bilayer graphene. The independence of the piezoelectric coefficient and of the Born effective
charge on the gap value follows from the connection between the polar response and the valley Chern
number of gapped Dirac electrons, made possible by the effective gauge-field description of the
electron-lattice/strain coupling in these systems. In the small gap limit, where the adiabatic
ab-initio approximation fails, we implement analytically the calculation of the dynamical effective
charge, and we establish a universal relation between the complex effective charge and the so-called
Fano profile of the phonon optical peak. Our results provide a general theoretical framework to
understand and compute the polar response in narrow-gap semiconductors, but may also be relevant
for the contribution of piezoelectric scattering to the transport properties in Dirac-like systems.
