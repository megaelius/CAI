Expanding media are typical in many different fields, e.g. in Biology and Cosmology. In general,
a medium expansion (contraction) brings about dramatic changes in the behavior of diffusive transport
properties. Here, we focus on such effects when the diffusion process is described by the Continuous
Time Random Walk (CTRW) model. For the case where the jump length and the waiting time probability
density functions (pdfs) are long-tailed, we derive a general bifractional diffusion equation
which reduces to a normal diffusion equation in the appropriate limit. We then study some particular
cases of interest, including L\'evy flights and subdiffusive CTRWs. In the former case, we find
an analytical exact solution for the Green's function (propagator). When the expansion is sufficiently
fast, the contribution of the diffusive transport becomes irrelevant at long times and the propagator
tends to a stationary profile in the comoving reference frame. In contrast, for a contracting medium
a competition between the spreading effect of diffusion and the concentrating effect of contraction
arises. For a subdiffusive CTRW in an exponentially contracting medium, the latter effect prevails
for sufficiently long times, and all the particles are eventually localized at a single point in
physical space. This "Big Crunch" effect stems from inefficient particle spreading due to subdiffusion.
We also derive a hierarchy of differential equations for the moments of the transport process described
by the subdiffusive CTRW model. In the case of an exponential expansion, exact recurrence relations
for the Laplace-transformed moments are obtained. Our results confirm the intuitive expectation
that the medium expansion hinders the mixing of diffusive particles occupying separate regions.
In the case of L\'evy flights, we quantify this effect by means of the so-called "L\'evy horizon".
