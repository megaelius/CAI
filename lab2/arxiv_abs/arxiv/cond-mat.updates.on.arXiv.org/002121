The influence of structural constraints on the relaxation dynamics of three polyurea networks
with varying degree of crosslinking, has been studied by means of a thorough analysis of broadband
dielectric spectroscopy measurements. Two different relaxation processes are observed, namely,
a fast process involving the soft poly(propylene oxide) chains, and a slower and much broader process
associated to the immediate surroundings of the hard crosslinkers. Microphase separation in soft
and hard domains characterizes the systems in the presence of hydrogen bondings. In this case, different
confinement conditions are explored by varying the soft chain length; overall, the so called 'adsorption'
effects dominate. With respect to both cooperativity and rearrangement energy threshold in fast
relaxation, it is found that the enhancement of configurational constraints is similar to cooling,
but only on qualitative grounds. An upper bound of the hard domain's interface thickness, in which
the slow relaxation is believed to take place, is estimated from the analysis of the fast relaxation
in the system characterized by the highest degree of confinement, taking into account the results
of the structural analysis. Dropping the hydrogen bonding mechanism, phase separation does not
occur anymore and the configurational constraints at the ends of the soft chains are reduced, leaving
just those imposed by the rigid crosslinkers. This leads to a significant increase in cooperativity,
on approaching the glass transition, and to a complex behavior that is thoroughly discussed in comparison
with those observed in the micro-segregated systems.
