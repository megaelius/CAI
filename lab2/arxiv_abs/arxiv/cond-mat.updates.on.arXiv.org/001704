Calculations and mechanistic explanations for the probabilistic movement of objects at the highly
relevant cm length scales has been lacking and overlooked due to the complexity of current techniques.
Predicting the final-configuration probability of flipping cars for example remains extremely
challenging. In this paper we introduce new statistical methodologies to solve these challenging
macroscopic problems. Boltzmann's principles in statistical mechanics have been well recognized
for a century for their usefulness in explaining thermodynamic properties of matter in gas, liquid
and solid phases. Studied systems usually involve a large number of particles at the atomic scales.
However, it is unusual for Boltzmann's principles to be applied to individual objects at centimeter
to human-size length scales. We show that the concept of statistical mechanics still holds for describing
the probability of a tossed dice landing on a particular face. For regular dice, the one in six probability
that the dice land on each face is well known. In the case of orthorhombic dice, this symmetry is broken
and hence we need new tools to predict the probability of landing on each face. We propose a new method
based on Boltzmann's principles which uses synthetic temperature term. Surprisingly, this approach
requires only the dimensions of the thrown object for calculating potential energy as the input,
with no other fitting parameters needed. The statistical predictions for landing fit well to experimental
data of over fifty-thousand samplings of dice in 23 different dimensions. We believe that the ability
to predict, in a simple and tractable manner, the outcomes of macroscopic movement of large scale
probabilistic phenomena opens up a new line of approach for explaining many phenomena in the critical
centimeter length scale.
