Hydrodynamic interactions as modeled by Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics can dramatically
influence the dynamics of fully flexible, ring-shaped polymers in ways not known for any other polymer
architecture or topology. We show that steady shear leads to an inflation scenario exclusive to
ring polymers, which depends not only on Weissenberg number but also on contour length of the ring.
By analyzing velocity fields of the solvent around the polymer, we show the existence of a hydrodynamic
pocket which allows the polymer to self-stabilize at a certain alignment angle to the flow axis.
This self-induced stabilization is accompanied by transitioning of the ring to a non-Brownian
particle and a cessation of tumbling. The ring swells significantly in the vorticity direction,
and the horseshoe regions on the stretched and swollen ring are effectively locked in place relative
to the ring's center-of-mass. The observed effect is exclusive to ring polymers and stems from an
interplay between hydrodynamic interactions and topology. Furthermore, knots tied onto such
rings can serve as additional "stabilization anchors". Under strong shear, the knotted section
is pulled tight and remains well-localized while tank-treading from one horseshoe region to the
opposite one in sudden bursts. We find knotted polymers of high contour length behave very similarly
to unknotted rings of the same contour length, but small knotted rings feature a host of different
configurations. We propose a filtering technique for rings and chains based on our observations
and suggest that strong shear could be used to tighten knots on rings.
