A Majorana fermion is a fermionic particle that is its own antiparticle. Since the theoretical discovery
in 1937, the exotic particle has long been searched in particle physics. In the last few decades,
however, it has attracted renewed interest in condensed matter physics, where it can be realized
as an elementary excitation (quasiparticle) in quantum states of matter. In this review, we discuss
another platform for Majorana fermions, the quantum spin liquid, in which interacting magnetic
moments remain disordered down to the lowest temperature under strong quantum fluctuations. They
are characterized by topological entanglement and fractional excitations, whose possible application
to topological quantum computation is recently discussed intensively. As a prime candidate for
such exotic states, we here focus on the Kitaev magnets, a subgroup of the spin-orbit Mott insulators.
After a brief overview of the Kitaev model and the fractionalization of spins in the exact ground
state, we review recent explosive development in this rapidly growing field, with a focus on numerical
solutions of the Kitaev model at finite temperatures and the comparison with experiments. The key
concept is thermal fractionalization --- two types of fractional excitations manifest themselves
at largely different temperatures. This leads to distinct thermodynamics and spin dynamics in
a variety of experimentally measurable quantities. We discuss such peculiar behaviors as the signatures
of fractional quasiparticles, in careful comparison with the available experimental data for
the candidate materials of the Kitaev magnets. Our review gives an overview of the current status
of the identification of Majorana fermions in the Kitaev magnets, which would serve as a basis for
further experimental and theoretical studies toward the manipulation of the exotic particles
for topological quantum computation.
