For decades it has been a well-known fact that among the few ferroelectric compounds in the perovskite
family namely BaTiO3, KNbO3, PbTiO3 Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3 the dielectric and piezoelectric properties
of BaTiO3 is considerably higher than the others in polycrystalline form at room temperature. Further,
similar to ferroelectric alloys exhibiting morphotropic phase boundary, single crystals of BaTiO3
exhibits anomalously large piezoelectric response when poled away from the direction of spontaneous
polarization at room temperature. These anomalous features in BaTiO3 remained unexplained so
far from the structural stand point. In this work we have used high resolution synchrotron X-ray
powder diffraction, atomic resolution aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy,
in conjunction with a novel powder poling technique, to reveal that (i) the equilibrium state of
BaTiO3 is characterized by coexistence of a subtle monoclinic (Mc) phase and tetragonal phase,
and (ii) strong electric field induces an orthorhombic phase at 300 K. These results suggest that
BaTiO3 at room temperature is within an instability regime, and that this instability is therefore
the fundamental factor responsible for the anomalous dielectric and piezoelectric properties
of BaTiO3 as compared to the other homologous ferroelectric perovskite compounds. The results
demonstrate that pure BaTiO3 at room temperature more akin to lead-based ferroelectric alloys
close to the morphotropic phase boundary where polarization rotation and field induced ferroelectric-ferroelectric
phase transformations play fundamental role in influencing the piezoelectric behavior.
