Precipitate hardening is commonly used in materials science to control strength by acting on the
number density, size distribution, and shape of solute precipitates in the hardened matrix. The
Fe-Cu system has attracted much attention over the last several decades due to its technological
importance as a model alloy for Cu steels. In spite of these efforts several aspects of its phase diagram
remain unexplained. Here we use atomistic simulations to characterize the polymorphic phase diagram
of Cu precipitates in body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe and establish a consistent link between their
thermodynamic and mechanical properties in terms of thermal stability, shape, and strength. The
size at which Cu precipitates transform from BCC to a close-packed 9R structure is found to be strongly
temperature dependent, ranging from approximately 4 nm in diameter (~2,700 atoms) at 200 K to about
8 nm (~22,800 atoms) at 700 K. This strong temperature dependence originates from the entropic stabilization
of BCC Cu, which is mechanically unstable as a bulk phase. While at high temperatures the transition
exhibits first-order characteristics, the hysteresis, and thus the nucleation barrier, vanish
at temperatures below approximately 300 K. This behavior is explained in terms of the mutual cancellation
of the energy differences between core and shell (wetting layer) regions of BCC and 9R nanoprecipitates,
respectively. The proposed mechanism is not specific for the Fe--Cu system but could generally
be observed in immiscible systems, whenever the minority component is unstable in the lattice structure
of the host matrix. Finally, we also study the interaction of precipitates with screw dislocations
as a function of both structure and orientation. The results provide a coherent picture of precipitate
strength that unifies previous calculations and experimental observations.
