We explore the possibility of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) occurring during the
temporal evolution of a quenched transverse field Ising chain coupled to a particle loss type of
bath (local in Jordan-Wigner fermion space) using two versions of the Loschmidt overlap (LO), namely,
the fidelity induced LO and the interferometric phase induced LO. The bath, on the one hand, dictates
the dissipative evolution following a sudden quench and on the other, plays a role in dissipative
mixed state preparation in the later part of the study. During a dissipative evolution following
a sudden quench, no trace of DQPTs are revealed in both the fidelity and the interferometric phase
approaches; however, remarkably the interferometric phase approach reveals the possibility
of inter-steady state DQPTs in passage from one steady state to the other when the system is subjected
to a quench after having reached the first steady state. We further probe the occurrences of DQPTs
when the system evolves unitarily after being prepared in a mixed state of engineered purity by ramping
the transverse field in a linear fashion in the presence of the bath. In this case though the fidelity
approach fails to indicate any DQPT, the interferometric approach indeed unravels the possibility
of occurrence of DQPTs which persists even up to a considerable loss of purity of the engineered initial
state as long as a constraint relation involving the dissipative coupling and ramping time (rate)
is satisfied. This constraint relation also marks the boundary between two dynamically inequivalent
phases; in one the LO vanishes for the critical momentum mode (and hence DQPTs exist) while in the
other no such critical mode can exist and hence the LO never vanishes.
