We develop a field theory of quantum magnets and magnetic (semi)metals, which is suitable for the
analysis of their universal and topological properties. The systems of interest include collinear,
coplanar and general non-coplanar magnets. At the basic level, we describe the dynamics of spin
waves and magnetization using smooth vector fields in the continuum limit. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction is captured by a vector (Berry connection) gauge field, and chiral spin couplings related
to topological defects enter the theory through higher-rank antisymmetric tensor gauge fields.
The spin-orbit coupling of mobile electrons is similarly described by non-Abelian gauge fields,
including higher-rank tensors related to the electronic Berry flux. The electronic and magnetic
gauge fluxes are exchanged between these degrees of freedom through Kondo-type interactions.
Hence, by utilizing gauge fields, this theory provides a unifying physical picture of ``intrinsic''
and ``topological'' anomalous Hall effects, spin-Hall effects, and the general interplay between
topological behaviors of electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom. We predict a feasible topological
magnetoelectric effect in materials prone to the formation of static or dynamic magnetic hedgehogs.
The couplings and gauge fields are derived from generic microscopic models that link the theory
to experimentally available information. Most of the formal analysis is generalized to $d$ spatial
dimensions in order access the $\pi_{d-1}(S^{d-1})$ homotopy classification of the magnetic
hedgehog topological defects, and establish the possibility of novel quantum spin liquids that
exhibit a fractional magnetoelectric effect. However, we emphasize the form of all results in the
physically relevant $d=3$ dimensions, and discuss a few applications to topological magnetic
conductors like Mn$_3$Sn and Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$.
