The main goal of our work was to determine and explore the field dependent transformation of the magnetically
ordered helical structure in FeP. The zero-field NMR spectrum for the polycrystalline sample can
be easily explained assuming an incommensurate spiral ordering of Fe magnetic moments with a dominating
contribution to the local field at the phosphorus nucleus from the Fe - ${}^{31}$P transferred hyperfine
interactions. The NMR lineshape of the FeP powder sample gradually changes with increasing field
from the trapezoidal-like shape at low fields to a pronounced double-horn shape at highest field.
The observed transformation of our ${}^{31}$P NMR spectra of FeP provides strong evidence of the
spin-reorientation of the spin-flop type in FeP which occurs in the range of external fields $4 <
\mu_0 H < 5$ T confirmed also by specific-heat measurements. The single-crystal ${}^{31}$P NMR
spectra for external magnetic fields directed within the ($ac$)-plane exhibit a pronounced four-peak
structure characteristic of an incommensurate helimagnetic ground state with two pairs of magnetically
inequivalent phosphorus positions. These spectra were successfully simulated assuming a simple
planar helix of Fe magnetic moments in the ($ab$)-plane with a phase shift of 36 degrees between Fe1-Fe3
and Fe2-Fe4 sites according to data from neutron scattering. Theoretical estimations of the transferred
hyperfine coupling provide an excellent quantitative description of the observed angular dependences
for the peak-to-Larmor field separations. Rotational single-crystal NMR experiments in high
fields ($\nu_{L}$ (${}^{31}$P) = 140 MHz) reveal an effect of varying phosphorous local fields
distribution caused by an iron spin-reorientation transition in high magnetic field.
