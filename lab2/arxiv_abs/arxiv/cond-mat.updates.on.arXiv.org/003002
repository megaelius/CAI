A growing body of literature suggests that odd-frequency superconducting pair amplitudes can
be generated in normal metal-superconductor junctions. The emergence of odd-frequency pairing
in these systems is often attributed to the breaking of translation invariance. In this work, we
study the pair symmetry of a one-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor in the presence of a single
non-magnetic impurity and demonstrate that translation symmetry breaking is not sufficient for
inducing odd-frequency pairing. We consider three kinds of impurities: a local perturbation of
the chemical potential, an impurity possessing a quantum energy level, and a local perturbation
of the superconducting gap. Surprisingly, we find local perturbations of the chemical potential
do not induce any odd-frequency pairing, despite the fact that they break translation invariance.
Moreover, although odd-frequency can be induced by both the quantum impurity and the perturbation
of the gap, we find these odd-frequency amplitudes emerge from entirely different kinds of scattering
processes. The quantum impurity generates odd-frequency pairs by allowing one of the quasiparticles
belonging to an equal-time Cooper pair to tunnel onto the impurity state and then back to the superconductor,
giving rise to odd-frequency amplitudes with a temporal broadening inversely proportional to
the energy level of the impurity. In contrast to this, the perturbation of the gap leads to odd-frequency
pairing by "gluing-together" normal state quasiparticles from different points in space and time,
leading to odd-frequency amplitudes which are very localized in the time domain.
