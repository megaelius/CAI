Surface bound catalytic chemical reactions self-propel chemically active Janus particles. In
the vicinity of boundaries, these particles exhibit rich behavior, such as the occurrence of wall-bound
steady states of "sliding". Most active particles tend to sediment as they are density mismatched
with the solution. Moreover Janus spheres, which consist of an inert core material decorated with
a cap-like, thin layer of a catalyst, are gyrotactic ("bottom-heavy"). Occurrence of sliding states
near the horizontal walls depends on the interplay between the active motion and the gravity-driven
sedimentation and alignment. It is thus important to understand and quantify the influence of these
gravity-induced effects on the behavior of model chemically active particles moving near walls.
For model gyrotactic, self-phoretic Janus particles, here we study theoretically the occurrence
of sliding states at horizontal planar walls that are either below ("floor") or above ("ceiling")
the particle. We construct "state diagrams" characterizing the occurrence of such states as a function
of the sedimentation velocity and of the gyrotactic response of the particle, as well as of the phoretic
mobility of the particle. We show that in certain cases sliding states may emerge simultaneously
at both the ceiling and the floor, while the larger part of the experimentally relevant parameter
space corresponds to particles that would exhibit sliding states only either at the floor or at the
ceiling or there are no sliding states at all. These predictions are critically compared with the
results of previous experimental studies and our experiments conducted on Pt-coated polystyrene
and silica-core particles suspended in aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions.
