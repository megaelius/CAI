The question of which non-interacting Green's function "best" describes an interacting many-body
electronic system is both of fundamental interest as well as of practical importance in describing
electronic properties of materials in a realistic manner. Here, we study this question within the
framework of Baym-Kadanoff theory, an approach where one locates the stationary point of a total
energy functional of the one-particle Green's function in order to find the total ground-state
energy as well as all one-particle properties such as the density matrix, chemical potential, or
the quasiparticle energy spectrum and quasiparticle wave functions. For the case of the Klein functional,
our basic finding is that minimizing the length of the gradient of the total energy functional over
non-interacting Green's functions yields a set of self-consistent equations for quasiparticles
that is identical to those of the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) [1] approach, thereby
providing an a priori justification for such an approach to electronic structure calculations.
In fact, this result is general, applies to any self-energy operator, and is not restricted to any
particular approximation, e.g. the GW approximation for the self-energy. The approach also shows
that, when working in the basis of quasiparticle states, solving the diagonal part of the self-consistent
Dyson equation is of primary importance while the off-diagonals are of secondary importance, a
common observation in the electronic structure literature of self-energy calculations. Finally,
numerical tests and analytical arguments show that when the Dyson equation produces multiple quasiparticle
solutions corresponding to a single non-interacting state, minimizing the length of the gradient
translates into choosing the solution with largest quasiparticle weight.
