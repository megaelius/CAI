A characteristic property of many soft matter systems is an ultrasoft effective interaction between
their structural units. This softness often leads to complex behavior. In particular, ultrasoft
systems under pressure demonstrate polymorphism of complex crystal and quasicrystal structures.
Therefore, it is of interest to investigate how different can be the structure of the fluid state
in such systems at different pressures. Here we address this issue for the model liquid composed
of particles interacting through the harmonic-repulsive pair potential. This system can form
different crystal structures as the liquid is cooled. We find that, at certain pressures, the liquid
exhibits unusual properties, such as the negative thermal expansion coefficient. Besides, the
volume and the potential energy of the system can increase during crystallization. At certain pressures,
the system demonstrates high stability against crystallization and it is hardly possible to crystallize
it on the timescales of the simulations. To address the liquid's structure at high pressures, we
consider the scaled pair distribution function (PDF) and the bond-orientational order (BOO) parameters.
The marked change happening with the PDF, as pressure increases, is the splitting of the first peak
which is caused by the appearance of non-negligible interaction with the second neighbors and the
following rearrangement of the structure. Our findings suggest that non-trivial effects, usually
explained by different interactions at different spatial scales, can be observed also in one-component
systems with simple one-length-scale ultrasoft repulsive interactions.
