Based on probing electronic transport properties we propose an experimental test for the recently
discovered rich topological phase diagram of one-dimensional Floquet topological insulators
with Rashba spin-orbit interaction [Kennes \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 100}, 041103(R) (2019)].
Using the Keldysh-Floquet formalism we compute electronic transport properties of these nanowires,
where we propose to couple the leads in such a way, as to primarily address electronic states with
a large weight at one edge of the system. By tuning the Fermi energy of the leads to the center of the
topological gap we are able to directly address the topological edge states, granting experimental
access to the topological phase diagram. Surprisingly, when tuning the lead Fermi energy to special
values in the bulk which coincide with extremal points of the dispersion relation, we find additional
peaks of similar magnitude to those caused by the topological edge states. These peaks reveal the
presence of continua of states centered around aforementioned extremal points whose wavefunctions
are linear combinations of delocalized bulk states and exponentially localized edge states, where
the ratio of edge- to bulk-state amplitude is maximal at the extremal point of the dispersion. We
discuss the transport properties of these \emph{non-topological edge states}, explain their
emergence in terms of an intuitive yet quantitative physical picture and discuss their relationship
with Van Hove singularities in the bulk of the system. The mechanism giving rise to these states is
not specific to the model we consider here, suggesting that they may be present in a wide class of one-dimensional
systems.
