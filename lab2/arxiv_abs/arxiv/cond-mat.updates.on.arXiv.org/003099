Half-Heuslers, an emerging thermoelectric material group, has complex bandstructures with multiple
bands that can be aligned through band engineering approaches, giving us an opportunity to improve
their power factor. In this work, going beyond the constant relaxation time approximation, we perform
an investigation of the benefits of band alignment in improving the thermoelectric power factor
under different density of states dependent scattering scenarios. As a test case we consider the
Co-based p-type half-Heuslers TiCoSb, NbCoSn and ZrCoSb. First, using simplified effective mass
models combined with Boltzmann transport, we investigate the conditions of band alignment that
are beneficial to the thermoelectric power factor under three different carrier scattering scenarios:
i) the usual constant relaxation time approximation, ii) intra-band scattering restricted to
the current valley with the scattering rates proportional to the density of states as dictated by
Fermi's Golden Rule, and iii) both intra- and inter-band scattering across all available valleys,
with the rates determined by the total density of states at the relevant energies. We demonstrate
that the band-alignment outcome differs significantly depending on the scattering details. Next,
using the density functional theory calculated bandstructures of the half-Heuslers we study their
power factor behavior under strain induced band alignment. We show that strain can improve the power
factor of half-Heuslers, but the outcome heavily depends on the curvatures of the bands involved,
the specifics of the carrier scattering mechanisms, and the initial band separation. Importantly,
we also demonstrate that band alignment is not always beneficial to the power factor.
