We consider the effect of coupling between phonons and a chiral Majorana edge in a gapped chiral spin
liquid with Ising anyons (e.g., Kitaev's non-abelian spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice). This
is especially important in the regime in which the longitudinal bulk heat conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$
due to phonons is much larger than the expected quantized thermal Hall conductance $\kappa_{xy}^{\rm
q}=\frac{\pi T}{12} \frac{k_B^2}{\hbar}$ of the ideal isolated edge mode, so that the thermal
Hall angle, i.e., the angle between the thermal current and the temperature gradient, is small.
By modeling the interaction between a Majorana edge and bulk phonons, we show that the exchange of
energy between the two subsystems leads to a transverse component of the bulk current and thereby
an $effective$ Hall conductivity. Remarkably, the latter is equal to the quantized value when the
edge and bulk can thermalize, which occurs for a Hall bar of length $L \gg \ell$, where $\ell$ is a thermalization
length. We obtain $\ell \sim T^{-5}$ for a model of the Majorana-phonon coupling. We also find that
the quality of the quantization depends on the means of measuring the temperature and, surprisingly,
a more robust quantization is obtained when the lattice, not the spin, temperature is measured.
We present general hydrodynamic equations for the system, detailed results for the temperature
and current profiles, and an estimate for the coupling strength and its temperature dependence
based on a microscopic model Hamiltonian. Our results may explain recent experiments observing
a quantized thermal Hall conductivity in the regime of small Hall angle, $\kappa_{xy}/\kappa_{xx}
\sim 10^{-3}$, in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.
