A multitude of observed boron-based materials have outstanding superconducting, mechanical,
and refractory properties. Yet, the structure, the composition, and the very existence of some
reported metal boride (M-B) compounds have been a subject of extensive debate. This density functional
theory work seeks to set a baseline for current understanding of known metal boride phases as well
as to identify new synthesizable candidates. We have generated a database of over 12,000 binary
M-B entries for pressures of 0 and 30 GPa producing the largest scan of compositions and systems in
this materials class. The 175 selected crystal structures include both observed prototypes and
new ones found with our evolutionary ground state search. The metals considered are: Al, Ag, Au,
Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Hf, Hg, Ir, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, Os, Pd, Pt, Rb, Re, Rh, Ru,
Sc, Sr, Ta, Tc, Ti, V, W, Y, Zn, and Zr. Based on the formation energy calculated at zero pressure and
temperature 4 new M-B phases or structures have been predicted, while a number of previously reported
compounds have been shown to be unstable. At 30 GPa, changes in the convex hulls are expected to occur
in 18 out of 41 M-B systems, which is used to indicate regions of the periodic table (for metal borides)
that require further investigation from the community. Analysis of the collected information
has revealed a nearly linear relationship between the magnetic moment per atom and the metal content
for all the Fe-B, Co-B, and Ni-B structures within 0.15 eV/atom of the stability tie line. Both GGA-PBE
and LDA-PW functionals were used to provide an understanding of the systematic error introduced
by the choice of the exchange-correlation functional.
