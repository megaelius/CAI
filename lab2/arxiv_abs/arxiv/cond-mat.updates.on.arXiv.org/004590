An excitonic insulator (EI) is an unconventional quantum phase of matter in which excitons, bound
pairs of electrons and holes, undergo Bose--Einstein condensation, forming a macroscopic coherent
state. While its existence was first hypothesized half a century ago, the EI has eluded experimental
observation in bulk materials for decades. In the last few years, a resurgence of interest in the
subject has been driven by the identification of several candidate materials suspected to support
an excitonic condensate. However, one obstacle in verifying the nature of these systems has been
to find signatures of the EI that distinguish it from a normal insulator. To address this, we focus
on a clear qualitative difference between the two phases: the existence of Goldstone modes born
by the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry in the EI. Even if this mode is gapped, as occurs in
the case of an approximate symmetry, this branch of collective modes remains a fundamental feature
of the low-energy dynamics of the EI provided the symmetry-breaking is small. We study a simple model
that realizes an excitonic condensate, and use mean field theory within the random-phase approximation
to determine its collective modes. We subsequently develop a diagrammatic method to incorporate
the effects of disorder perturbatively, and use it to determine the scattering rate of the collective
modes. We interpret our results within an an effective field theory. The collective modes are found
to be robust against symmetry-preserving disorder, implying an experimental fingerprint unique
to the EI: the ballistic propagation of low-lying modes over mesoscopic distances, at electronic-scale
velocities. We suggest this could affect thermal transport at low temperatures, and could be observed
via spatially-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy through the coherent response of phonons that
hybridize with the collective modes.
