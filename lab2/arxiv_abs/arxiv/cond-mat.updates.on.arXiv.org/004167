The renormalization of the electrons in the bilayer cuprate superconductors is investigated within
the kinetic-energy driven superconductivity. It is shown that the quasiparticle excitation spectrum
is split into its bonding and antibonding components due to the presence of the bilayer coupling,
with each component that is independent. In the underdoped regime, two electron Fermi surface (EFS)
contours deriving from the bonding and antibonding copper-oxide layers are reconstructed to form
the bonding and antibonding Fermi pockets around the nodal region. However, the bonding and antibonding
Fermi pockets are almost degenerate, leading to that only one Fermi pocket is observed. In particular,
the strongest intensity point on the bonding (antibonding) Fermi arc reaches exactly the tip of
the bonding (antibonding) Fermi arc, which in this case coincide with the bonding (antibonding)
hot spot. These hot spots connected by the scattering wave vectors ${\bf q}_i$ construct an octet
scattering model, and then the enhancement of the quasiparticle scattering processes with the
wave vectors ${\bf q}_i$ is confirmed via the result of the autocorrelation of the ARPES spectral
intensities. Moreover, the peak-dip-hump (PDH) structure developed in each component along the
corresponding EFS sheet is related with the peak structure in the corresponding quasiparticle
scattering rate except for at the hot spots, where the PDH structure is caused by the pure bilayer
coupling. Although the kink in the quasiparticle dispersion is present all around the EFS sheets,
when the momentum moves away from the node to the antinode, the kink energy smoothly decreases, while
the dispersion kink becomes more pronounced, and in particular, near the antinodal cut, develops
into a break separating of the fasting dispersing high-energy part of the quasiparticle excitation
spectrum from the slower dispersing low-energy part.
