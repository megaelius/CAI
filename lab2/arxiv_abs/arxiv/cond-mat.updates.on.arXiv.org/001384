Graphitic micro-particles coated with thin layers in solution are technologically interesting
as they can be manipulated with electric fields. Modeling the electrical manipulation of submerged
layered micro-particles analytically or numerically is not straight forward. In particular,
the generation of reliable quantitative torque predictions for electro-orientation experiments
has been elusive. The traditional Laplace model approximates the coated particle by an ellipsoid
with a confocal ellipsoidal layer and solves Laplace's equation to produce convenient analytical
predictions. However, due to the non-uniformity of the layer thickness around the ellipsoid, this
method can lead to incorrect torque predictions. Here we present a new theoretical dual-ellipsoid
Laplace model that corrects the effect of the non-uniform layer thickness by calculating two layered
ellipsoids, each accounting for the correct layer thickness along each relevant direction for
the torque. Our model describes the electro-orientation of submerged lipid-coated graphitic
micro-particles in the presence of an alternating current (AC) electric field and is valid for ellipsoids
with moderate aspect ratios and coated with thin shells. It is one of the first models to generate
correct quantitative electric torque predictions. We present model results for the torque versus
frequency and compare them to our measurements for lipid-coated highly ordered pyrolytic graphite
(HOPG) micro-flakes in aqueous NaCl solution at MHz frequencies. The results show how the lipid
shell changes the overall electrical properties of the micro-flakes so that the torque is low at
low frequencies and increases at higher frequencies into the MHz regime. The torque depends critically
on the lipid-shell thickness, the solution conductivity and the shape of the particle, all of which
can be used as handles to control the response of the particles.
