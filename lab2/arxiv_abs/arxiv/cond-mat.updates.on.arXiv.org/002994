The Thirring model is an interacting fermion theory with current-current interaction. The model
in $1+2$ dimensions has applications in condensed-matter physics to describe the electronic excitations
of Dirac materials. Earlier investigations with Schwinger-Dyson equations, the functional renormalization
group and lattice simulations with staggered fermions suggest that a critical number of (reducible)
flavors $N^{\mathrm{c}}$ exists, below which chiral symmetry can be broken spontaneously. Values
for $N^{\mathrm{c}}$ found in the literature vary between $2$ and $7$. Recent lattice studies with
chirally invariant SLAC fermions have indicated that chiral symmetry is unbroken for all integer
flavor numbers [Wellegehausen et al., 2017]. An independent simulation based on domain wall fermions
seems to favor a critical flavor-number that satisfies $1<N^{\mathrm{c}}<2$ [Hands, 2018]. However,
in the latter simulations difficulties in reaching the massless limit in the broken phase (at strong
coupling and after the $L_s\to\infty$ limit has been taken) are encountered. To find an accurate
value $N^{\mathrm{c}}$ we study the Thirring model (by using an analytic continuation of the parity
even theory to arbitrary real $N$) for $N$ between $0.5$ and $1.1$. We investigate the chiral condensate,
the spectral density of the Dirac operator, the spectrum of (would-be) Goldstone bosons and the
variation of the filling-factor and conclude that the critical flavor number is $N^{\mathrm{c}}=0.80(4)$.
Thus we see no chiral symmetry breaking in all Thirring models with $1$ or more flavors of ($4$-component)
fermions. Besides the artifact transition to the unphysical lattice artifact phase we find strong
evidence for a hitherto unknown phase transition that exists for $N>N^{\mathrm{c}}$ and should
answer the question of where to construct a continuum limit.
