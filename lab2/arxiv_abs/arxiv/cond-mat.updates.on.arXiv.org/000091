In many systems, nucleation of a stable solid may occur in the presence of other (often more than one)
metastable phases. These may be polymorphic solids or even liquid phases. In such cases, nucleation
of the solid phase from the melt may be facilitated by the metastable phase because the latter can
"wet" the interface between the parent and the daughter phases, even though there may be no signature
of the existence of metastable phase in the thermodynamic properties of the parent liquid and the
stable solid phase. Straightforward application of classical nucleation theory (CNT) is flawed
here as it overestimates the nucleation barrier since surface tension is overestimated (by neglecting
the metastable phases of intermediate order) while the thermodynamic free energy gap between daughter
and parent phases remains unchanged. In this work we discuss a density functional theory (DFT) based
statistical mechanical approach to explore and quantify such facilitation. We construct a simple
order parameter dependent free energy surface that we then use in DFT to calculate (i) the order parameter
profile, (ii) the overall nucleation free energy barrier and (iii) the surface tension between
the parent liquid and the metastable solid and also parent liquid and stable solid phases. The theory
indeed finds that the nucleation free energy barrier can decrease significantly in the presence
of wetting. This approach can provide a microscopic explanation of Ostwald step rule and the well-known
phenomenon of "disappearing polymorphs" that depends on temperature and other thermodynamic
conditions. Theory reveals a diverse scenario for phase transformation kinetics some of which
may be explored via modern nanoscopic synthetic methods.
