A longstanding (1, 2), and still present (3--5), proposal relates the activation of collective
intra-molecular oscillations of biomolecules with their biological functioning. These collective
oscillations have been hitherto studied only at thermal equilibrium. On the basis of a theoretical
model, inspired by a longstanding proposal, a Bose-like phenomenon of phonon (as protein-normal
modes) condensation is predicted to occur out-of-thermal-equilibrium, that is, through an energy
flow due to the combined effects of energy pumping and dissipation. This is expected to bring about
giant oscillating molecular dipole moments, a necessary condition to activate sizable long-distance
electrodynamic interactions between resonating molecules (1, 2, 6, 7). The new theoretical prediction
makes it worthwhile the effort to experimentally check whether out-of-equilibrium collective
oscillations of biomolecules can be activated. Here, for a model protein, the BSA (Bovine Serum
Albumin) protein in watery solution, we show that, when suitably driven in a stationary out-of-thermal
equilibrium state, it displays a remarkable absorption feature around 0.314 THz, identified as
a collective oscillation of the entire molecule. Two different and complementary THz near-field
spectroscopic techniques have been used in order to enhance the sensitivity to oscillations of
the molecules: a plasmonic rectenna, and a micro-wire near-field probe. The outcomes are in very
good agreement with the theory. The present findings motivate also suitable experimental attempts
at detecting long range electrodynamic forces between biomolecules.
