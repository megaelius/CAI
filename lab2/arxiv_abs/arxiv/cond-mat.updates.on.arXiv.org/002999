A determinant formalism in combination with \emph{ab initio} calculations proposed recently
has paved a new way for simulating and interpreting x-ray excitation spectra. The new method systematically
takes into account many-electron effects in the Mahan-Nozi\'eres-De Dominicis (MND) theory,
including core-level excitonic effects, the Fermi-edge singularity, shakeup excitations, and
wavefunction overlap effects such as the orthogonality catastrophe, all within a universal framework
using many-electron configurations. A heuristic search algorithm was introduced to search for
the configurations that are important for defining spectral lineshapes, instead of enumerating
them in a brute-force way. The algorithm has proven to be efficient for calculating \ce{O} $K$ edges
of transition metal oxides, which converge at the second excitation order (denoted as $f^{(n)}$
with $n = 2$), i.e., the final-state configurations with two \emph{e-h} pairs (with one hole being
the core hole). However, it remains unknown how the determinant calculations converge for general
cases and at which excitation order $n$ one should stop the determinant calculation. Even with the
heuristic algorithm, the number of many-electron configurations still grows exponentially with
the excitation order $n$. In this work, we prove two theorems that can indicate the order of magnitude
of the contribution of the $f^{(n)}$ configurations, so that one can estimate their contribution
very quickly without actually calculating their amplitudes. The two theorems are based on the singular-value
decomposition (SVD) analysis, a method that is widely used to quantify entanglement between two
quantum many-body systems. We examine the $K$ edges of several metallic systems with the determinant
formalism up to $f^{(5)}$ to illustrate the usefulness of the theorems.
