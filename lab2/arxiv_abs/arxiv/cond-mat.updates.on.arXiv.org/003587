A major motivation for the scientific study of artworks is to understand their states of preservation
and ongoing degradation mechanisms. This enables preservation strategies to be developed for
irreplaceable works. Intensely-hued cadmium sulphide (CdS) yellow pigments are of particular
interest because these are key to the palettes of many important late 19th and early 20th century
masters, including Vincent Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Edvard Munch. As these paintings
age, their cadmium yellow paints are undergoing severe fading, flaking, and discolouration. These
effects are associated with photodegradation, the light-facilitated reactions of CdS with oxygen,
moisture, and even the paint binding medium. The use of common optical and X-ray methods to characterize
the physical state of the pigment is challenging due to the mixing of the various components of the
paint at length scales smaller than their resolution. Here, we present an atomic-scale structural
and chemical analysis of the CdS pigment in Edvard Munch's The Scream (c. 1910, Munch Museet), enabled
by new electron microscope detector technologies. We show that the CdS pigment consists of clusters
of defective nanoparticles ~5-10 nm in diameter. It is known from the modern use of such particles
in photocatalysis that they are inherently vulnerable to photodegradation. Chlorine doping and
a polytype crystal structure further enhance the sensitivity of the CdS pigment to photodegradation.
In addition to The Scream, we have also observed this inherently unstable pigment structure in Henri
Matisse's Flower Piece (1906, Barnes Foundation). The fundamental understanding of the pigments'
nanoscale structures and impurities described here can now be used to predict which paintings are
most at risk of photooxidation, and guide the most effective preservation strategies for iconic
masterpieces.
