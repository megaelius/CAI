Spin dependent recombination in GaAsN offers many interesting possibilities in the design of spintronic
devices mostly due to its astounding capability to reach conduction band electron spin polarizations
close to 100% at room temperature. The mechanism behind the spin selective capture of electrons
in Ga$^{2+}$ paramagnetic centers is revisited in this paper to address inconsistencies common
to most previously presented models. Primarily, these errors manifest themselves as major disagreements
with the experimental observations of two key characteristics of this phenomenon: the effective
Overhauser-like magnetic field and the width of the photoluminescence Lorentzian-like curves
as a function of the illumination power. These features are not only essential to understand the
spin dependent recombination in GaAsN, but are also key to the design of novel spintronic devices.
Here we demonstrate that the particular structure of the electron capture expressions introduces
spurious electron-nucleus correlations that artificially alter the balance between the hyperfine
and the Zeeman contributions. This imbalance strongly distorts the effective magnetic field and
width characteristics. In this work we propose an alternative recombination mechanism that preserves
the electron-nucleus correlations and, at the same time, keeps the essential properties of the
spin selective capture of electrons. This mechanism yields a significant improvement to the agreement
between experimental and theoretical results. In particular, our model gives results in very good
accord with the experimental effective Overhauser-like magnetic field and width data, and with
the degree of circular polarization under oblique magnetic fields.
