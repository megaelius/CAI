We study equilibrium properties of catalytically-activated $A + A \to \oslash$ reactions taking
place on a lattice of adsorption sites. The particles undergo continuous exchanges with a reservoir
maintained at a constant chemical potential $\mu$ and react when they appear at the neighbouring
sites, provided that some reactive conditions are fulfilled. We model the latter in two different
ways: In the Model I some fraction $p$ of the {\em bonds} connecting neighbouring sites possesses
special catalytic properties such that any two $A$s appearing on the sites connected by such a bond
instantaneously react and desorb. In the Model II some fraction $p$ of the adsorption {\em sites}
possesses such properties and neighbouring particles react if at least one of them resides on a catalytic
site. For the case of \textit{annealed} disorder in the distribution of the catalyst, which is tantamount
to the situation when the reaction may take place at any point on the lattice but happens with a finite
probability $p$, we provide an exact solution for both models for the interior of an infinitely large
Cayley tree - the so-called Bethe lattice. We show that both models exhibit a rich critical behaviour:
For the annealed Model I it is characterised by a transition into an ordered state and a re-entrant
transition into a disordered phase, which both are continuous. For the annealed Model II, which
represents a rather exotic model of statistical mechanics in which interactions of any particle
with its environment have a peculiar Boolean form, the transition to an ordered state is always continuous,
while the re-entrant transition into the disordered phase may be either continuous or discontinuous,
depending on the value of $p$.
