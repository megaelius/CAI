Topological materials have attracted considerable experimental and theoretical attention.
They exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling both in the band structure (intrinsic) and in the impurity
potentials (extrinsic), although the latter is often neglected. Here we discuss weak localization
and antilocalization of massless Dirac fermions in topological insulators and massive Dirac fermions
in Weyl semimetal thin films taking into account both intrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit interactions.
The physics is governed by the complex interplay of the chiral spin texture, quasiparticle mass,
and scalar and spin-orbit scattering. We demonstrate that terms linear in the extrinsic spin-orbit
scattering are generally present in the Bloch and momentum relaxation times in all topological
materials, and the correction to the diffusion constant is linear in the strength of the extrinsic
spin-orbit. In TIs, which have zero quasiparticle mass, the terms linear in the impurity spin-orbit
coupling lead to an observable density dependence in the weak antilocalization correction. They
produce substantial qualitative modifications to the magnetoconductivity, differing greatly
from the conventional HLN formula traditionally used in experimental fits, which predicts a crossover
from weak localization to antilocalization as a function of the extrinsic spin-orbit strength.
In contrast, our analysis reveals that topological insulators always exhibit weak antilocalization.
In WSM thin films having intermediate to large values of the quasiparticle mass extrinsic spin-orbit
scattering strongly affects the boundary of the weak localization to antilocalization transition.
We produce a complete phase diagram for this transition as a function of the mass and spin-orbit scattering
strength. We discuss implications for experiments and provide a brief comparison with transition
metal dichalcogenides.
