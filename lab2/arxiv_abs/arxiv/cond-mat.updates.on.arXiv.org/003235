Graphene is an attractive material for microelectronics applications, given such favourable
electrical characteristics as high mobility, high operating frequency, and good stability. If
graphene is to be implemented in electronic devices on a mass scale, then it must be compatible with
existing semiconductor industry fabrication processes. Unfortunately, such processing introduces
defects and impurities to the graphene, which cause scattering of the charge carriers and changes
in doping level. Scattering results in degradation of electrical performance, including lower
mobility and Dirac point shifts. In this paper, we review methods by which to mitigate the effects
of charged impurities and defects in graphene devices. Using capping layers such as fluoropolymers,
statistically significant improvement of mobility, on/off ratio, and Dirac point voltage for
graphene FETs have been demonstrated. These effects are also reversible and can be attributed to
the presence of highly polar groups in these capping layers such as carbon-fluoride bonds in the
fluoropolymer acting to electrostatically screen charged impurities and defects in or near the
graphene. In other experiments, graphene FETs were exposed to vapour-phase, polar, organic molecules
in an ambient environment. This resulted in significant improvement to electrical characteristics,
and the magnitude of improvement to the Dirac point scaled with the dipole moment of the delivered
molecule type. The potential profile produced in the plane of the graphene sheet by the impurities
was calculated to be significantly reduced by the presence of polar molecules. We present strong
evidence that the polar nature of capping layers or polar vapour molecules introduced to the surface
of a graphene FET act to mitigate detrimental effects of charged impurities/defects.
