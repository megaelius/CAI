Motivated by recent theoretical progress demonstrating the existence of non-Abelian parafermion
zero modes in domain walls on interfaces between two dimensional Abelian topological phases of
matter, we investigate the properties of gapped interfaces of hierarchical fractional quantum
Hall states, in the lowest Landau level, characterized by the Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy}(m,p)
= \frac{p}{2mp+1} \frac{e^{2}}{h}$, for integer numbers $(m,p)$ with $m,p \geq 1$. The case $m=1$
corresponds to the experimentally well established sequence of fractional quantum Hall states
with $\sigma_{xy} = \frac{1}{3}\frac{e^{2}}{h}, \frac{2}{5}\frac{e^{2}}{h}, \frac{3}{7}\frac{e^{2}}{h},
...\, $, which has been observed in many two dimensional electron gases. Exploring the mechanism
by which the $(m,p+1)$ hierarchical state is generated from the condensation of quasiparticles
of the ``parent" state $(m,p)$, we uncover a remarkably rich sequence of parafermions in hierarchical
interfaces whose quantum dimension $d_{m,p}$ depends both upon the total quantum dimension $\mathcal{D}_{m,p}
= \sqrt{2mp+1}$ of the bulk Abelian phase, as well as on the parity of the ``hierarchy level" $p$,
which we associate with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ stability of Majorana zero modes in one dimensional
topological superconductors. We show that these parafermions reside on domain walls separating
segments of the interface where the low energy modes are gapped by two distinct mechanisms: (1) a
charge neutral backscattering process or (2) an interaction that breaks $U(1)$ charge conservation
symmetry and stabilizes a condensate whose charge depends on $p$. Remarkably, this charge condensate
corresponds to a clustering of quasiparticles of fractional charge $\frac{p}{2mp+1}\,e$, allowing
us to draw a correspondence between these fractionalized condensates and Read-Rezayi non-Abelian
fractional quantum Hall cluster states.
