Electrical machines employing superconductors are attractive solutions in a variety of application
domains. Numerical models are powerful and necessary tools to optimize their design and predict
their performance. The electromagnetic modeling of superconductors by finite-element method
(FEM) is usually based on a power-law resistivity for their electrical behavior. The implementation
of such constitutive law in conventional models of electrical machines is quite problematic: the
magnetic vector potential directly gives the electric field and requires using a power-law depending
on it. This power-law is a non-bounded function that can generate enormous uneven values in low electric
field regions that can destroy the reliability of solutions. The method proposed here consists
in separating the model of an electrical machine in two parts, where the magnetic field is calculated
with the most appropriate formulation: the H-formulation in the part containing the superconductors
and the A-formulation in the part containing conventional conductors (and possibly permanent
magnets). The main goal of this work is to determine and to correctly apply the continuity conditions
on the boundary separating the two regions. Depending on the location of such boundary -- in the fixed
or rotating part of the machine -- the conditions that one needs to apply are different. In addition,
the application of those conditions requires the use of Lagrange multipliers satisfying the field
transforms of the electromagnetic quantities in the two reference systems, the fixed and the rotating
one. In this article, several exemplary cases for the possible configurations are presented. In
order to emphasize and capture the essential point of this modeling strategy, the discussed examples
are rather simple. Nevertheless, they constitute a solid starting point for modeling more complex
and realistic devices.
