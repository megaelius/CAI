In different materials, orientationally-controlled assembling of building blocks results into
develop anisotropic particles. These trends are more pronounced in atoms of metallic elements
when they are in certain transition state as their monolayer assembly is vital to develop triangular-shaped
tiny particles. When triangular-shape packets of nanoshape energy are placed over the compact
monolayer assembly of such atoms, they result into bind those atoms into their own shape. A joined
triangular-shaped tiny particle developed under tuned bipolar pulse divided at the point of connection
into two equal tiny-shaped particles. Atoms of those tiny particles elongate on both sides from
their centers under the exertion of surface format forces while resting at electronically flat
surface where atoms of each one-dimensional array convert into a structure of smooth element. A
structure of smooth element is further shaped while travelling photons along the air-solution
interface. Originally, binding of such atoms is under the execution of confined inter-state electron-dynamics
when undertake neutral state at below ground surface. Such tiny-shaped particles pack as a one-unit
under the maintenance of their immersing force at electronically-controlled slope surface resulting
into assemble their structures of smooth elements at a center of exerting no surface format force.
Structures of smooth elements arriving from the different regions nucleate a mono-layer of developing
a certain anisotropic particle where unfilled regions are filled by the afterward arriving ones,
which is not the case when a distorted particle is developing. The mono-layer developing a certain
shape of particle deals localized gravity where its structures of smooth elements bind to the structures
of smooth elements of above mono-layer under clamping of unfilled energy knots to laterally-orientated
electrons of elongated atoms.
