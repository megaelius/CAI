The paper presents a theoretical description of the effects of strain induced by out-of-plane deformations
on charge distributions and transport on graphene. A review of a continuum model for electrons using
the Dirac formalism is complemented with elasticity theory to represent strain fields. The resulting
model is cast in terms of scalar and pseudo-magnetic fields that control electron dynamics. Two
distinct geometries, a bubble, and a fold are chosen to represent the most commonly observed deformations
in experimental settings. It is shown that local charge accumulation regions appear in deformed
areas, with a peculiar charge distribution that favors the occupation of one sublattice only. This
unique phenomenon that allows distinguishing each carbon atom in the unit cell, is the manifestation
of a sublattice symmetry broken phase. For specific parameters, resonant states appear in localized
charged regions, as shown by the emergence of discrete levels in band structure calculations. These
findings are presented in terms of intuitive pictures that exploit analogies with confinement
produced by square barriers. In addition, electron currents through strained regions are spatially
separated into their valley components, making possible the manipulation of electrons with different
valley indices. The degree of valley filtering (or polarization) for a specific system can be controlled
by properly designing the strained area. The comparison between efficiencies of filters built
with this type of geometries identifies extended deformations as better valley filters. A proposal
for their experimental implementations as a component of devices and a discussion for potential
observation of novel physics in strained structures are presented at the end of the article.
