Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) plays a crucial role in magnetic and electronic properties of 5$d$ iridates.
In this paper we have experimentally investigated the structural and physical properties of a series
of Ir-based double perovskite compounds Pr$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$MgIrO$_6$ ($x$ = 0, 0.5, 1; hereafter
abbreviated as PMIO, PSMIO1505, and PSMIO). Interestingly, these compounds have recently been
proposed to undergo a transition from the spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulating phase at $x$ = 0 to
the elusive half-metallic antiferromagnetic (HMAFM) state with Sr doping at $x$ = 1. However, our
detailed magnetic and electrical measurements refute any kind of HMAFM possibility in either of
the doped samples. In addition, we establish that within these Pr$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$MgIrO$_6$ double
perovskites, changes in Ir-oxidation states (4+ for PMIO to 5+ for PSMIO via mixed 4+/5+ for PSMIO1505)
lead to markedly different magnetic behaviors. While SOC on Ir is at the root of the observed insulating
behaviors for all three samples, the correlated magnetic properties of these three compounds develop
entirely due to the contribution from local Ir moments. Additionally, the magnetic Pr$^{3+}$ (4$f^2$)
ions, instead of showing any kind of ordering, only contribute to the total paramagnetic moment.
It is seen that the PrSrMgIrO$_6$ sample does not order down to 2 K despite antiferromagnetic interactions.
But, the $d^5$ iridate Pr$_2$MgIrO$_6$ shows a sharp antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at around
14 K, and in the mixed valent Pr$_{1.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$MgIrO$_6$ sample the AFM transition is shifted
to a much lower temperature ($\sim$ 6 K) due to weakening of the AFM exchange.
