The discovery in 2000 that the ferromagnetic (FM) compound UGe2 (T_Curie = 52 K at ambient pressure)
becomes superconducting under a pressure of P = 1.1 GPa until it enters the paramagnetic (PM) phase
above Pc = 1.6 GPa was a surprise. Successive searches for new materials (URhGe and UCoGe) led to the
discovery of the coexistence of superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism at ambient pressure.
Furthermore in UCoGe, it was found that SC survives in the PM regime from P_c = 1.1 to 4 GPa. Focus has
been on low-temperature experiments under extreme conditions of magnetic field (H), pressure,
and uniaxial stress. In UGe2, strong interplay exists between Fermi surface (FS) reconstructions
in the cascade of different FM and PM ground states and their magnetic fluctuations. Similar phenomena
occur in URhGe and UCoGe but, at first glance, the SC seems to be driven by the FM fluctuations. In UCoGe,
a longitudinal field scan leads to a drastic decrease in the FM fluctuations, while a transverse
field scan leads to suppression of the Curie temperature, T_Curie; the consequence is a boost in
FM fluctuations, leading to a reinforcement of SC. The singularity in URhGe is the weakness of the
anisotropy between c- and b-axes; the most noteworthy feature is the detection of reentrant SC near
H_R. All the experimental results give evidence that the SC in these three materials originates
from the FM fluctuations, which are amplitude modes of magnetic excitations in the FM state. Spin-triplet
pairing has been anticipated in the FM superconductors and was actually observed by Knight-shift
measurements in the SC state of UCoGe. Their fascinating (p, T, H) phase diagrams are now well established.
Discussion is presented on how different theoretical approaches can describe the various phenomena
discovered by experimentalists.
