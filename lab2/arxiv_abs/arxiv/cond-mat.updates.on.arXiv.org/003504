Insulating quantum magnets lie at the forefront both of fundamental research into quantum matter
and of technological exploitation in the increasingly applied field of spintronics. In this context,
the magnetic thermal transport is a particularly sensitive probe of the elementary spin and exotic
topological excitations in unconventional magnetic insulators. However, magnetic contributions
to heat conduction are invariably intertwined with lattice contributions, and thus the issue of
spin-phonon coupling in determining the spin and thermal transport properties becomes more important
with emergent topological magnetic system. Here we report the observation of an anomalously strong
enhancement of the thermal conductivity, occurring at all relevant temperatures, in the layered
honeycomb material CrCl$_3$ in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Away from the magnetically
ordered phase at low temperatures and small fields, there is no coherent spin contribution to the
heat conduction, and hence the effect must be caused by a strong suppression of the phonon thermal
conductivity due to magnetic fluctuations, which are in turn suppressed by the field. We build an
empirical model for the thermal conductivity of CrCl$_3$ within a formalism assuming an independently
determined number of spin-flip processes and an efficiency of the phonon scattering events they
mediate. By extracting the intrinsic phonon thermal conductivity we obtain a quantitative description
at all fields and temperatures and demonstrate that the scattering efficiency is entirely independent
of the field. In this way we use CrCl$_3$ as a model system to understand the interactions between
spin and phonon excitations in the context of thermal transport. We anticipate that the completely
general framework we introduce will have broad implications for the interpretation of transport
phenomena in magnetic quantum materials.
