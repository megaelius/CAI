We use a non-equilibrium many-body theory that engages the elements of transient coherence, correlation,
and nonlinearity to describe changes in the magnetic and electronic phases of strongly correlated
systems induced by femtosecond nonlinear photoexcitation. Using a generalized tight--binding
mean field approach based on Hubbard operators and including the coupling of the laser field, we
describe a mechanism for simultaneous insulator--to--metal and anti-- to ferro--magnetic transition
to a transient state triggered by non-thermal ultrafast spin and charge coupled excitations. We
demontrate, in particular, that photoexcitation of composite fermion quasiparticles induces
quasi-instantaneous spin canting that quenches the energy gap of the antiferromagnetic insulator
and acts as a nonadiabatic "initial condition" that triggers non-thermal lattice dynamics leading
to an insulator to metal and antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transitions. Our theoretical
predictions are consistent with recent ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy experiments that revealed
a magnetic phase transition during 100fs laser pulse photoexcitation of the CE--type AFM insulating
phase of colossal magnetoresistive manganites. In particular, experiment observes two distinct
charge relaxation components, fs and ps, with nonlinear threshold dependence at a pump fluence
threshold that coincides with that for femtosecond magnetization photo excitation. Our theory
attributes the correlation between femtosecond spin and charge nonlinearity leading to transition
in the magnetic and electronic state to spin/charge/lattice coupling and laser-induced quantum
spin canting that accompanies the driven population inversion between two quasi--particle bands
with different properties: a mostly occupied polaronic band and a mostly empty metallic band, whose
dispersion is determined by quantum spin canting.
