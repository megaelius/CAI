We present an ultrafast microscopy imaging experiment and a general analytical description of
a new quasiparticle composed of plasmonic Skyrmion-like spin texture at the core of a surface plasmon
polariton (SPP) vortex. The illumination of a circular coupling structure milled in an Ag film by
circularly polarized light (CPL) couples its spin angular momentum (SAM) into orbital angular
momentum (OAM) of SPPs launching them to form a plasmonic vortex. The coupling of the cycloidal motion
of the SPP polarization at the 2D interface, with their orbital swirl at the vortex core causes the
plasmonic field to generate 3D SAM pseudovectors, whose topological texture has integer Skyrmion
number and is homotopic to a twisted magnetic Skyrmion quasiparticle with the boundary defined
by an optical L-line singularity contour. An analytical description finds that the dielectric
discontinuity at the Ag/vacuum interface supports on each side entwined twisted Skyrmion pairs
that are characterized by stable topological textures with opposite Skyrmion numbers. The SAM
texture of the Skyrmion pair within the primary vortex ring corresponds to a monopole-hedgehog
type SAM texture, with a SAM singularity at the vortex core. Interferometric time-resolved two-photon
photoemission electron microscopy (ITR-2P-PEEM) imaging of the nanofemto spatiotemporal evolution
of the SPP fields and simulation by an analytical model, establish the twisted topological plasmonic
SAM Skyrmion quasiparticle at the vortex core. The SAM textures can probe and simulate topological
responses in trivial and topological materials that can be coupled in the near-field of the SPP vortex.
The theory anticipates different field structures and the accompanying topological spin textures
that construct single Skyrmion and meron-like quasiparticles as well as their arrays.
