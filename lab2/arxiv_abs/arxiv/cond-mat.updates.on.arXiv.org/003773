We develop a tight-binding model based on linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) methods
to describe the electronic structure of arrays of acceptors, where the underlying basis states
are derived from an effective-mass-theory solution for a single acceptor in either the spherical
approximation or the cubic model. Our model allows for arbitrarily strong spin-orbit coupling
in the valence band of the semiconductor. We have studied pairs and dimerised linear chains of acceptors
in silicon in the `independent-hole' approximation, and investigated the conditions for the existence
of topological edge states in the chains. For the finite chain we find a complex interplay between
electrostatic effects and the dimerisation, with the long-range Coulomb attraction of the hole
to the acceptors splitting off states localised at the end acceptors from the rest of the chain. A
further pair of states then splits off from each band, to form a pair localised on the next-to-end
acceptors, for one sense of the bond alternation and merges into the bulk bands for the other sense
of the alternation. We confirm the topologically non-trivial nature of these next-to-end localised
states by calculating the Zak phase. We argue that for the more physically accessible case of one
hole per acceptor these long-range electrostatic effects will be screened out; we show this by treating
a simple phenomenologically screened model in which electrostatic contributions from beyond
the nearest neighbours of acceptor each pair are removed. Topological states are now found on the
end acceptors of the chains. In some cases the termination of the chain required to produce topological
states is not the one expected on the basis of simple geometry (short versus long bonds); we argue
this is because of a non-monotonic relationship between the bond length and the effective Hamiltonian
matrix elements between the acceptors.
