We study low-dimensional quantum systems with analytical and computational methods. Firstly,
the one-dimensional extended $t$-$V$ model of fermions with interactions of a finite range is investigated.
The model exhibits a phase transition between liquid and insulating regimes. We use various analytical
approaches to generalise previous theoretical studies. We devise a strong coupling expansion
to go beyond first-order perturbation theory. The method is insensitive to the presence or the lack
of integrability of the system. We extract the ground state energy and critical parameters of the
model near the Mott insulating commensurate density. We also study the possible charge-density-wave
phases that exist when the model is at the critical density. Secondly, we investigate Mott-Wannier
complexes of two (excitons), three (trions) and four (biexcitons) charge carriers in two-dimensional
semiconductors. Our study also includes impurity-bound complexes. We provide a classification
of trions and biexcitons in transition-metal dichalcogenides, which incorporates the difference
of spin polarisation between molybdenum- and tungsten-based materials. Using the diffusion Monte
Carlo method, which is statistically exact for these systems, we extract binding energies of the
complexes for a complete set of parameters of the model. Our results are compared with theoretical
and experimental work on transition-metal dichalcogenides. An agreement is found for excitonic
and trionic results, but we also observe a large discrepancy in the theoretical biexcitonic binding
energies as compared to the experimental values. Possible reasons for this are outlined. We also
calculate contact pair densities, which in the future can be used in the determination of the contact
interaction.
