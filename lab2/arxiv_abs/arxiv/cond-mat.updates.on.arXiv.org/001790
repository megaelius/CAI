The coupled cluster method is implemented at high orders of approximation to investigate the zero-temperature
$(T=0)$ phase diagram of the frustrated spin-$s$ $J_{1}$--$J_{2}$--$J_{3}$ antiferromagnet
on the honeycomb lattice. The system has isotropic Heisenberg interactions of strength $J_{1}>0$,
$J_{2}>0$ and $J_{3}>0$ between nearest-neighbour, next-nearest-neighbour and next-next-nearest-neighbour
pairs of spins, respectively. We study it in the case $J_{3}=J_{2}\equiv \kappa J_{1}$, in the window
$0 \leq \kappa \leq 1$ that contains the classical tricritical point (at $\kappa_{{\rm cl}}=\frac{1}{2}$)
of maximal frustration, appropriate to the limiting value $s \to \infty$ of the spin quantum number.
We present results for the magnetic order parameter $M$, the triplet spin gap $\Delta$, the spin
stiffness $\rho_{s}$ and the zero-field transverse magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ for the two
collinear quasiclassical antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases with N\'{e}el and striped order, respectively.
Results for $M$ and $\Delta$ are given for the three cases $s=\frac{1}{2}$, $s=1$ and $s=\frac{3}{2}$,
while those for $\rho_{s}$ and $\chi$ are given for the two cases $s=\frac{1}{2}$ and $s=1$. On the
basis of all these results we find that the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-1 models both have an intermediate
paramagnetic phase, with no discernible magnetic long-range order, between the two AFM phases
in their $T=0$ phase diagrams, while for $s > 1$ there is a direct transition between them. Accurate
values are found for all of the associated quantum critical points. While the results also provide
strong evidence for the intermediate phase being gapped for the case $s=\frac{1}{2}$, they are
less conclusive for the case $s=1$. On balance however, at least the transition in the latter case
at the striped phase boundary seems to be to a gapped intermediate state.
