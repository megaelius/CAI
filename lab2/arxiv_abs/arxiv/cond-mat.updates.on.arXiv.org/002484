The rolling resistance between a pair of contacting particles can be modeled with two mechanisms.
The first mechanism, already widely addressed in the DEM literature, involves a contact moment
between the particles. The second mechanism involves a reduction of the tangential contact force,
but without a contact moment. This type of rotational resistance, termed creep-friction, is the
subject of the paper. Within the creep-friction literature, the term "creep" does not mean a viscous
mechanism, but rather connotes a slight slip that accompanies rolling. Two extremes of particle
motions bound the range of creep-friction behaviors: a pure tangential translation is modeled
as a Cattaneo-Mindlin interaction, whereas prolonged steady-state rolling corresponds to the
traditional wheel-rail problem described by Carter, Poritsky, and others. DEM simulations, however,
are dominated by the transient creep-friction rolling conditions that lie between these two extremes.
A simplified model is proposed for the three-dimensional transient creep-friction rolling of
two spheres. The model is an extension of the work of Dahlberg and Alfredsson, who studied the two-dimensional
interactions of disks. The proposed model is applied to two different systems: a pair of spheres
and a large dense assembly of spheres. Although creep-friction can reduce the tangential contact
force that would otherwise be predicted with Cattaneo-Mindlin theory, a significant force reduction
occurs only when the rate of rolling is much greater than the rate of translational sliding and only
after a sustained period of rolling. When applied to the deviatoric loading of an assembly of spheres,
the proposed creep-friction model has minimal effect on macroscopic strength or stiffness. At
the micro-scale of individual contacts, creep-friction does have a modest influence on the incremental
contact behavior.
