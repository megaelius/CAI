The structural correlations in the microscopic structures of random media can induce the dependent
scattering mechanism and thus influence the optical scattering properties. Based on our recent
theory on the dependent scattering mechanism in random media composed of discrete dual-dipolar
scatterers (\textit{Physical Review A 97, 023836}), in this paper, we study the hard-sphere Yukawa
(HSY) random media, in order to further elucidate the role of structural correlations in the dependent
scattering mechanism and hence optical scattering properties. Here, we consider charged colloidal
suspensions, whose effective pair interaction between colloids is described by a screened Coulomb
(Yukawa) potential. By means of adding salt ions, the pair interaction between the charged particles
can be flexibly tailored and therefore the structural correlations are modified. It is shown that
this strategy can affect the optical properties significantly. For colloidal $\mathrm{TiO_2}$
suspensions, the modification of electric and magnetic dipole excitations induced by the structural
correlations can substantially influence the optical scattering properties, in addition to the
far-field interference effect described by the structure factor. However, this modification
is only slightly altered by different salt concentrations and is mainly because of the packing-density-dependent
screening effect. On the other hand, for low refractive index colloidal polystyrene suspensions,
the dependent scattering mechanism mainly involves the far-field interference effect, and the
effective exciting field amplitude for electric dipole almost remains unchanged under different
structural correlations. The present study has profound implications for understanding the role
of structural correlations in dependent scattering mechanism.
