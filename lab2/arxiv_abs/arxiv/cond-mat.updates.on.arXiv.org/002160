We report the structural, static, and dynamic properties of Cr$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Ga by means of
powder x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, magnetic relaxation, and magnetic memory
effect measurements. DC magnetization and AC susceptibility studies reveal a spin-glass transition
at around $T_{\rm f} \simeq 22$~K. An intermediate value of the relative shift in freezing temperature
$\delta T_{\rm f} \simeq 0.017$, obtained from the AC susceptibility data reflects the formation
of cluster spin-glass states. The frequency dependence of $T_{\rm f}$ is also analyzed within the
framework of dynamic scaling laws. The analysis using power law yields a time constant for a single
spin flip $\tau* \simeq 1.1\times10^{-10}$~s and critical exponent $z\nu^{\prime}=4.2\pm0.2$.
On the other hand, the Vogel-Fulcher (VF) law yields the time constant for a single spin flip $\tau_0
\simeq 6.6\times10^{-9}$~s, VF temperature $T_{\rm 0}=21.1\pm0.1$~K, and an activation energy
$E_{\rm a}/k_{\rm B} \simeq 16$~K. The value of $\tau*$ and $\tau_0$ along with a non-zero value
of $T_{\rm 0}$ provide further evidence for the cluster spin-glass behaviour. The magnetic field
dependent $T_{\rm f}$ follows the de Almeida-Thouless line with a non-mean-field type instability,
reflecting either a different universality class or strong anisotropy in the spin system. A detailed
non-equilibrium dynamics study via relaxation and memory effect experiments demonstrates striking
memory effects. All the above observations render a cluster spin-glass behaviour which is triggered
by magnetic frustration due to competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions and
magnetic site disorder. Moreover, the asymmetric response of magnetic relaxation with respect
to the change in temperature, below $T_{\rm f}$ can be explained by the hierarchical model.
