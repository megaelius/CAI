We study analytically the finite-temperature phase diagram of proton ordering of a quasi-two dimensional
hydrogen-bonded system, namely the squaric acid crystal($\text{H}_2\text{C}_4\text{O}_4$).
We take into account the four-spin interaction model at the zeroth order. Using an improvised loop
algorithm within the SSE quantum monte carlo, we find two distinct phases as we increase the temperature
and magnetic-field. One of the phase is the $\Pi_f$, the phase with long range ferroelectric order
and the other being an intermediate state with strong local correlations, i.e, a quantum liquid-like
state $\Pi_{ql}$. The transition to $\Pi_{f}$ shows a very small anomalous peak in the specific
heat with strong dependence of critical temperature on the strength of dipole-dipole interaction.
The presence of the small peak is attributed to the absence of macroscopic degeneracy in the presence
of dipole-dipole interaction and re-entrance of such degeneracy to some extent at small temperature.
Though the degenerate ground state manifold is identical which have a four-spin interaction or
approrpriate two-spin interaction model at zeroth order, we find that for a four-spin interaction
case, the required strength of dipole-dipole interaction is quite larger to induce a ferroelectric
phase. %We also find that the strength required to penetrate the ferroelectric phase through a macroscopic
degenerate phase is large than previous results, which is also indicating a hosting of a robust ground
state for small or zero dipole-dipole strength. The work also presents an intricate connection
of quantum fluctuation and thermal fluctuation in the presence of competing interaction with entropic
effects.
