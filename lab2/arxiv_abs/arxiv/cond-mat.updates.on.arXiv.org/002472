Engineering light-matter interactions up to the strong-coupling regime at room temperature is
one of the cornerstones of modern nanophotonics. Achieving this goal will enable new platforms
for potential applications such as quantum information processing, quantum light sources and
even quantum metrology. Materials like transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) and in particular
tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) possess large transition dipole moments comparable to semiconductor-based
quantum dots, and strong exciton binding energies allowing the detailed exploration of light-matter
interactions at room temperature. Additionally, recent works have shown that coupling TMDCs to
plasmonic nanocavities with light tightly focused on the nanometer scale can reach the strong-coupling
regime at ambient conditions. Here, we use ultra-thin single-crystalline gold nanodisks featuring
large in-plane electromagnetic dipole moments aligned with the exciton transition-dipole moments
located in monolayer WS$_2$. Through scattering and reflection spectroscopy we demonstrate strong
coupling at room temperature with a Rabi splitting of $\sim$108 meV. In order to go further into the
strong-coupling regime and inspired by recent experimental work by St\"uhrenberg et al., we couple
these nanodisks to multilayer WS$_2$. Due to an increase in the number of excitons coupled to our
nanodisks, we achieve a Rabi splitting of $\sim$175 meV, a major increase of 62%. To our knowledge,
this is the highest Rabi splitting reported for TMDCs coupled to open plasmonic cavities. Our results
suggest that ultra-thin single-crystalline gold nanodisks coupled to WS$_2$ represent an exquisite
platform to explore light-matter interactions.
