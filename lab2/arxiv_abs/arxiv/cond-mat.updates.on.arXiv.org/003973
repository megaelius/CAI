Dream of developing molecule-based logic and memory device is more than 70-year-old. Presently,
molecule-based devices are also considered for quantum computation hardware. The recent studies
have shown the molecule connected to metal leads can perform the qubit-based logic operation. This
is an interesting question of why experimental progress is still very slow even when the scope of
molecule-based devices may govern the advancement of next-generation logic and memory devices
for the highest possible computer technologies. Molecules have the potential to be unmatched device
elements as chemists can mass-produce an endless variety of molecules with novel optical, magnetic,
and charge transport characteristics. However, the biggest challenge is to connect two metal leads
to target molecules and develop a robust and versatile device fabrication technology that can be
adopted for commercial-scale mass production. This paper discusses the distinct advantages of
utilizing commercially successful magnetic tunnel junctions as a vehicle for developing molecular
electronics and molecular spintronics devices. We describe the use of a tunnel junction with the
exposed sides as a testbed for molecular devices. On the exposed sides of a tunnel, junction molecules
are bridged across an insulator by chemically bonding with the two metal electrodes; sequential
growth of metal-insulator-metal layers ensures that separation between two metal electrodes
is controlled by the insulator thickness to the molecular device length scale. Here we also strongly
emphasize a need for close collaboration between chemists and magnetic tunnel junction researchers.
Such partnerships will have a strong potential to develop magnetic tunnel junction based molecular
devices for the futuristic areas such as memory devices, magnetic metamaterials, and high sensitivity
biosensors.
