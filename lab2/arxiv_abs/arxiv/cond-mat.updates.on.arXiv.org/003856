We propose a single-site mean-field description, an analogue of Weiss mean-field theory, suitable
for narrow-band systems with correlation-induced hybridisation at finite temperatures. Presently
this approach, based on the notion of a fluctuating on-site density matrix (OSDM), is developed
for the case of extended Falicov-Kimball model (EFKM). In an EFKM, an excitonic insulator phase
can be stabilised at zero temperature. With increasing temperature, the excitonic order parameter
(interaction-induced hybridisation on-site, characterised by the absolute value and phase)
eventually becomes disordered, which involves fluctuations of both its phase and (at higher T)
its absolute value. In order to build an adequate finite-temperature description, it is important
to clarify the nature of degrees of freedom associated with the phase and absolute value of the induced
hybridisation, and correctly account for the corresponding phase space volume. We show that the
OSDM-based treatment of the local fluctuations indeed provides an intuitive and concise description
(including the phase space integration measure). This allows to describe both the lower-temperature
regime where phase fluctuations destroy the long-range order, and the higher temperature crossover
corresponding to a decrease of the absolute value of hybridisation; we also address the amplitude
mode of collective excitations in the context of recent experiments. In spite of the rapid progress
in the studies of excitonic insulators, a unified picture of this kind has not been available to date.
Both the overall scenario and the theoretical framework are also expected to be relevant in other
contexts, including the Kondo lattice model.
