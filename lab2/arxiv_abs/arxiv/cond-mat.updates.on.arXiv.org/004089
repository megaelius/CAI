A system of confined charged electrons interacting via the long-range Coulomb force can form a Wigner
crystal due to their mutual repulsion. This happens when the potential energy of the system dominates
over its kinetic energy, i.e., at low temperatures for a classical system and at low densities for
a quantum one. At T=0, the system is governed by quantum mechanics, and hence, the spatial density
peaks associated with crystalline charge localization are sharpened for a lower average density.
Conversely, in the classical limit of high temperatures, the crystalline spatial density peaks
are suppressed (recovered) at a lower (higher) average density. In this paper, we study those two
limits separately using an exact diagonalization of small one-dimensional (1D) systems containing
few (<10) electrons and propose an approximate method to connect them into a unified effective phase
diagram for Wigner few-electron crystallization. The result is a qualitative quantum-classical
crossover phase diagram of an effective 1D Wigner crystal. We find that the effective crystalline
structure slowly disappears with both the crossover average density and crossover temperature
for crystallization decreasing with increasing particle number, consistent with the absence
of any true long-range 1D order. Thus, an effective few-electron 1D Wigner crystal may be construed
either as existing at all densities (manifesting short-range order) or as non-existing at all densities
(not manifesting any long-range order). Within one unified description, we show through exact
theoretical calculations how a small 1D system interacting through the long-range Coulomb interaction
could manifest effective Wigner solid behavior both in classical and quantum regimes.
