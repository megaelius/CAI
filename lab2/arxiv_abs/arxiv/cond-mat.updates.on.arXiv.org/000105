The incommensurate magnetic structures and phase diagrams of multiferroics has been explored
on the basis of accurate micromagnetic analysis taking into account the spin flexoelecric interaction
(Lifshitz invariant). The objects of the study are BiFeO_3-like single crystals and epitaxial
films grown on the <111> substrates. The main control parameters are the magnetic field,
the magnetic anisotropy, and the epitaxial strain in the case of films. We predict novel quasi-cycloidal
structures induced by external magnetic field or by epitaxial strain in the BiFeO_3-films. Phase
diagrams representing the regions of homogeneous magnetic states and incommensurate structures
stability are constructed for the two essential geometries of magnetic field (magnetic field oriented
parallel to the principal crystal axis C_3 and perpendicular to this direction C_3). It is shown
that the direction of applied magnetic field substantially affects a set of magnetic phases, properties
of incommensurate structures, character of phase transitions. Novel conical type of cycloidal
ordering is revealed during the transition from incommensurate cycloidal structure into homogeneous
magnetic state. Elaborated phase diagrams allow estimate appropriate combination of control
parameters (magnetic field, magnetic anisotropy, exchange stiffness) required to the destruction
of cycloidal ordering corresponding to the transition into homogeneous structure. The results
show that the magnitude of critical magnetic field suppressing cycloid is lowered in multiferroics
films comparing to single crystals, it can be also lowered by the selection of orientation of magnetic
field. Our results can be useful for strain engineering of new multiferroic functional materials
on demand.
