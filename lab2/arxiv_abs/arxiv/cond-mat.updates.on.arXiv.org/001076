In many materials, formation of building blocks and their controlled-angle packing results into
various geometric anisotropic shaped particles. These trends are more pronounced in atoms of many
metal transitions registered for more electrons. Monolayer triangular shape tiny particles are
vital as they are the building blocks of shaped particles under certain modification. When packets
of nano energy shape-like equilateral triangle are being placed over those atoms dealing transition
state, they crop from monolayer assembly resting at atomically flat surface into tiny particles
of own shape and size following by simultaneous elongation as per successively influencing force
till packing at common centre dealing no force of surface format. Each atom of one-dimensional array
of tiny particle elongates uniformly forming a square shape under stretching of energy knots clamping
electron states equally to both sides at centre when deal no force of north south poles and only the
force of surface format is influencing in opposite manner along the single axis, thus, working as
one unit under the maintenance of forces where each one-dimensionally elongated array of atoms
dealing force at single point of tip, which is termed as structure of smooth element. At this instance,
binding of atoms is under straight-forward diffusing or trapping of electrons without undertaking
inter-state dynamics. Nevertheless, tiny particles of elongated one-dimensional arrays of atoms
deal localized gravity once pack into mono layer of developing particle in certain shape at their
common centre dealing no force of surface format following by one step sinking under the force of
grounded format. In different referred processes, developments of particles of anisotropic shapes
appear to deal such tiny particles.
