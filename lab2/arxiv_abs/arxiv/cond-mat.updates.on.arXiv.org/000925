The Landauer expression for computing current-voltage characteristics in nanoscale devices
is efficient and widely applicable but not suited to transient phenomena and time dependent currents
because it assumes that the charge carrier population attains a time independent dynamic equilibrium
as soon as the external voltage is turned on. In this article, we construct a very general expression
for a time dependent current in an electrode-molecule-electrode arrangement. Utilizing a model
Hamiltonian, we propagate the Schrodinger wave function equation to numerically compute the time
dependent population in the individual sub-systems. The current in each electrode (defined in
terms of the rate of change of the corresponding population) has two components, one due to the charges
originating from the same electrode and the other due to the charges initially residing at the other
electrode. We derive an analytical expression for the first component and illustrate that it agrees
reasonably with the numerical counterpart at early times. The structural form reveals that the
initial occupancy can be factored out of the time dependent segment of the expression. We take this
cue to construct a Landauer style formula and demonstrate that the current obtained from this simplified
formula overlaps with our most general numerical current only after the charge flow settles into
a steady state. Thus, we illustrate the emergence of Landauer transport from a true first-principles
quantum dynamics calculation without any prior assumptions. Subsequently, we investigate the
ingredients in our model that regulate the onset time scale of this Landauer regime. We compare the
performance of our general current expression with the Landauer current for time dependent electronic
coupling. Finally, we comment on the applicability of the Landauer formulas to compute hot-electron
current arising upon plasmon decoherence.
