Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs), which have long hole-spin coherence times and are amenable
to optical control schemes, have long been explored as building blocks for qubit architectures.
One such design consists of vertically stacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM) and
using the spin-mixing properties of "molecule-like" coupled hole states for all-optical qubit
manipulation. In this article, the first of two papers, we introduce the incorporation of dilute
GaBiAs alloys in the barrier region between the two dots. GaBiAs is expected to increase the spin-mixing
of the molecular states needed for qubit operations by raising the barrier valence band edge and
spin-orbit splitting. Using an atomistic tight-binding model, we compute the properties of GaBiAs
and the modification of hole states that arise when the alloy is used in the barrier of an InAs QDM.
An atomistic treatment is necessary to correctly capture non-traditional alloy effects such as
the band-anticrossing valence band. It also allows for the study of configurational variances
and clustering effects of the alloy. We find that in InAs QDMs with a GaBiAs interdot barrier, electron
states are not strongly affected by the inclusion of Bi. However, hole states are much more sensitive
to the presence and configuration of Bi in the barriers. By independently studying the alloy-induced
strain and electronic scattering off Bi and As orbitals, we conclude that an initial increase in
QDM hole state energy at low Bi concentration is caused by the alloy-induced strain. We further find
that the decrease in QDM hole energy at higher Bi concentrations can only be explained when both alloy
strain and orbital effects are considered. In our second article, we use the understanding developed
here to discuss how the alloyed barriers contribute to enhancement in hole spin-mixing and the implications
for QDM qubit architectures.
