Solid state lithium- and sodium-ion batteries utilize solid ionicly conducting compounds as electrolytes.
However, the ionic conductivity of such materials tends to be lower than their liquid counterparts,
necessitating research efforts into finding suitable alternatives. The process of electrolyte
screening is often based on a mixture of domain expertise and trial-and-error, both of which are
time and resource-intensive. Data-driven and machine learning approaches have recently come
to the fore to accelerate learnings towards discovery. In this work, we present a simple machine-learning
based approach to predict the ionic conductivity of sodium and lithium-based SICON compounds.
Using primarily theoretical elemental feature descriptors derivable from tabulated information
on the unit cell and the atomic properties of the components of a target compound on a limited dataset
of 70 NASICON-examples, we have designed a logistic regression-based model capable of distinguishing
between poor and good superionic conductors with a cross-validation accuracy of over 82%. Moreover,
we demonstrate how such a system is capable of cross-domain classification on lithium-based examples
at the same accuracy, despite being introduced to zero lithium-based compounds during training.
Through a systematic permutation-based evaluation process, we reduced the number of considered
features from 47 to 7, reduction of over 83%, while simultaneously improving model performance.
The contributions of different electronic and structural features to overall ionic conductivity
is also discussed, and contrasted with accepted theories in literature. Our results demonstrate
the utility of such a simple, yet interpretable tool provides opportunities for initial screening
of potential candidates as solid-state electrolytes through the use of existing data.
