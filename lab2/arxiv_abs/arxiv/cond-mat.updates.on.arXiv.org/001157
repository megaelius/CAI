Water-phospholipid interactions at the lipid bilayer/water interfaces are of essential importance
for the dynamics, stability and function of biological membrane, and are also strongly associated
with numerous biological processes at the interfaces of lipid bilayers. Various force fields,
such as the united-atom Berger force field, its two improved versions by Kukol and by Poger, and the
all-atom Slipid force field developed recently, can be applied to simulating the structures of
lipid bilayer, with their structural predictions in good agreement with experimental data. In
this work, we show that despite the similarity in structural predictions of lipid bilayers, there
are observable differences in formation of hydrogen bonds and the interaction energy profiles
between water and phospholipid groups at the lipid bilayer/water interfaces, when four force fields
for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) phospholipids are employed in molecular dynamics
simulations. In particular, the Slipid force field yields more hydrogen bonds between water and
phospholipids and more symmetrical interaction energy distributions for the two carboxylic groups
on their respective acyl tails, compared to the Berger and its two improved force fields. These differences
are mainly attributed to the different interfacial water distributions and ability to form hydrogen
bonds between interfacial water and oxygen atoms of the DPPC lipids using different force fields.
These results would be helpful in understanding the behaviors of water as well as its interaction
with phospholipids at the lipid bilayer/water interfaces, and provide a guide for making the appropriate
choice on the force field in simulations of lipid bilayers.
