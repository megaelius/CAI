In some systems, the connecting probability (and thus the percolation process) between two sites
depends on the geometric distance between them. To understand such process, we propose gravitationally
correlated percolation models for link-adding networks on the two-dimensional lattice $G$ with
two strategies $S_{\rm max}$ and $S_{\rm min}$, to add a link $l_{i,j}$ to connect site $i$ and site
$j$ with mass $m_i$ and $m_j$, respectively; $m_i$ and $m_j$ are sizes of the clusters which contain
site $i$ and site $j$, respectively. The probability to add the link $l_{i,j}$ is related to the generalized
gravity $g_{ij} \equiv m_i m_j/r_{ij}^d$, where $r_{ij}$ is the geometric distance between $i$
and $j$, and $d$ is an adjustable decaying exponent. In the beginning of the simulation, all sites
of $G$ are occupied and there is no link. In the simulation process, two inter-cluster links $l_{i,j}$
and $l_{k,n}$ are randomly chosen and the generalized gravities $g_{ij}$ and $g_{kn}$ are computed.
In the strategy $S_{\rm max}$, the link with larger generalized gravity is added. In the strategy
$S_{\rm min}$, the link with smaller generalized gravity is added, which include percolation on
the Erd\H os-R\'enyi random graph and the Achlioptas process of explosive percolation as the limiting
cases, $d \to \infty$ and $d \to 0$, respectively. Adjustable strategies facilitate or inhibit
the network percolation in a generic view. We calculate percolation thresholds $T_c$ and critical
exponents $\beta$ by numerical simulations. We also obtain various finite-size scaling functions
for the node fractions in percolating clusters or arrival of saturation length with different intervening
strategies.
