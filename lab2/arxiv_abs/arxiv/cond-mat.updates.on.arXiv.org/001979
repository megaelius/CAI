Boron carbonitride (BxCyNz) represents an interesting family of materials containing all light
elements and two dimensional graphene like hybrid layers. Although rich literature exists on this
peculiar material in chemically processed form, there are relatively fewer reports on device application-worthy
thin film form. This form also offers a natural platform for basic studies on important aspects such
as magnetism and transport, which have attracted attention in the context of ferromagnetism in
doped and defect carbon systems. Thus, in this work we have grown thin films of this compound using
Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) method, and investigated their magnetic and transport properties
in their entirety along with the detailed electronic structure using various spectroscopic techniques
like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Valence Band Spectroscopy (VBS) and X-ray absorption
near edge spectroscopy (XANES). In depth analysis of the typical role of dopants and defects, especially
the prevalent nitrogen defects, is elucidated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations
to understand the experimental observations. A dramatic crossover in the transport mechanism
of charge carriers is observed in this system with the change in doping level of specific nitrogen
defects. A robust and high saturation magnetization is achieved in BCN films which is higher by almost
hundred times as compared to that in similarly grown undoped carbon film. An anomalous transition
and increase in coercive field is also observed at low temperature. A careful analysis brings out
the intriguing role of specific nitrogen defects in defining the peculiar nature and concentration
dependence of the physical properties of this system.
