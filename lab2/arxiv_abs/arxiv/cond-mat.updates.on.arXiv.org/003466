The force between two approaching solids in a liquid medium becomes increasingly large with decreasing
separation, a phenomenon that prevents contact between the two solids. This growth in force occurs
because of the intervening liquid, and, studies of such physical systems constitute the classical
discipline of lubrication. Furthermore, when the solid(s) are soft, there are quantitative as
well as qualitative alterations in the force interaction due to the solids' deformation. The underlying
physics as well as resultant system behaviour are even more complex when forces of non-hydrodynamic
origin come into play, two major classes of such forces being the DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek)
forces and the non-DLVO molecular forces. Studies assessing the coupling of these physical phenomenon
are avenues of contemporary research. With this view, we perform an analytical study of fluid-mediated
oscillatory motion of a rigid sphere over an ultra-thin soft coating, delineating the distinctive
effects of solvation force as well as substrate compliance. Our key finding is the major augmentation
in the force and substrate-deformation characteristics of the system due to solvation force when
the confinement reduces to a few nanometers. Consideration of solvation force leads to upto four
orders of magnitude and upto three orders of magnitude increment in force and substrate-deformation
respectively. While higher softness leads to higher deformation (as expected), its effect on force
and substrate-deformation characteristics exhibits a tendency towards amelioration of the increment
due to solvation force.
