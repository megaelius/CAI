Chiral crystals are materials whose lattice structure has a well-defined handedness due to the
lack of inversion, mirror, or other roto-inversion symmetries. These crystals represent a broad,
important class of quantum materials; their structural chirality has been found to allow for a wide
range of phenomena in condensed matter physics, including skyrmions in chiral magnets, unconventional
pairing in chiral superconductors, nonlocal transport and unique magnetoelectric effects in
chiral metals, as well as enantioselective photoresponse. Nevertheless, while these phenomena
have been intensely investigated, the topological electronic properties of chiral crystals have
still remained largely uncharacterized. While recent theoretical advances have shown that the
presence of crystalline symmetries can protect novel band crossings in 2D and 3D systems, we present
a new class of Weyl fermions enforced by the absence of particular crystal symmetries. These "Kramers-Weyl"
fermions are a universal topological electronic property of all nonmagnetic chiral crystals with
spin-orbit coupling (SOC); they are guaranteed by lattice translation, structural chirality,
and time-reversal symmetry, and unlike conventional Weyl fermions, appear at time-reversal-invariant
momenta (TRIMs). We cement this finding by identifying representative chiral materials in the
majority of the 65 chiral space groups in which Kramers-Weyl fermions are relevant to low-energy
physics. By combining our analysis with the results of previous works, we determine that all point-like
nodal degeneracies in nonmagnetic chiral crystals with relevant SOC carry nontrivial Chern numbers.
We further show that, beyond the previous phenomena allowed by structural chirality, Kramers-Weyl
fermions enable unusual phenomena, such as a novel electron spin texture, chiral bulk Fermi surfaces
over large energy windows.
