We use relativistic ab-initio methods combined with model Hamiltonian approaches to analyze the
normal-phase electronic and structural properties of the recently discovered WP superconductor.
Remarkably, the outcomes of such study can be employed to set fundamental connections among WP and
the pressure induced superconductors CrAs and MnP compounds belonging to the same space group.
One of the key features of the resulting electronic structure is represented by the occurrence of
multiple band crossings along specific high symmetry lines of the Brilloiun zone. In particular,
we demonstrate that an eight-fold band degeneracy is obtained along the S-R path at (kx,ky)=(Pi,Pi),
due to time reversal invariance and a pair of nonsymmorphic symmetries. The presence of multiple
degenerate Fermi points along the S-R direction constraints the topology of the Fermi surface,
which manifests distinctive marks when considering its evolution upon band filling variation.
We show that, by changing the relative position of the Fermi level with respect to the eight-fold
degenerate bands, one can tune the effective dimensionality of the Fermi surface. If the Fermi level
does not cross the multifold degenerate bands, as for the WP and CrAs compounds, the degeneracy forces
the occurrence of two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surface sheets centered around the S-R line with a
corrugated profile along the kz direction. On the contrary, these surfaces are converted into open
or closed Fermi pockets, if the bands along the SR line cross the Fermi level, as it happens in MnP.
Moreover, we show that the spin-orbit interaction determines a selective removal of the band degeneracy
and, consequently, a splitting of the quasi 2D Fermi sheets, as it happens in WP.
