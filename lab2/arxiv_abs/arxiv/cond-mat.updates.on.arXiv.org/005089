A structure evolution in original format of exerting force at electron level in atoms of gaseous,
semi-solid and solid states does not obey the Bravais crystal systems. This study discloses structure
evolutions in atoms of those elements executing confined inter-state dynamics of electrons. To
evolve a structure, atoms amalgamate firstly under significantly attained dynamics. In atoms,
structures evolve according to the mechanisms of electron dynamics. Atoms, when in neutral state,
transform heat energy into binding energy having shapes like tick, integral or Gaussian distribution
symbol. The shape of binding energy depends on the inter-state gap in outer ring of an atom. The evolving
structure of atoms having identical ground points also deals with forced exertions to electrons
at the same level. In atoms of space format, the structure evolves above the suitable level of ground
surface. In atoms of grounded format, the structure evolves below the suitable level of ground surface.
Dimensions of evolving structure depend on the number of electrons executing dynamics in an atom.
When the execution of inter-state dynamics is only for one electron, one-dimensional structure
is evolved. When the execution of inter-state dynamics is for two electrons, two-dimensional structure
is evolved. In the atoms of those elements where three electrons of outer rings simultaneously execute
dynamics, a bit complex mechanism of structure evolution is observed. An atom binds to the targeted
atom at the points of their generated energy. In a structure evolution of space format, amalgamating
atoms bind laterally to the targeted atom from the upward sides. In a structure evolution of grounded
format, amalgamating atoms bind laterally to the targeted atom from the downward sides. In a structure
evolution of surface format, amalgamating...
