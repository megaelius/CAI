Hydrogen has been the essential element in the development of atomic and molecular physics1). Moving
to the properties of dense hydrogen has appeared a good deal more complex than originally thought
by Wigner and Hungtinton in their seminal paper predicting metal hydrogen2): the electrons and
the protons are strongly coupled to each other and ultimately must be treated equally3)4). The determination
of how and when molecular solid hydrogen will transform into a metal is the stepping stone towards
a full understanding of the quantum-many body properties of dense hydrogen. The quest for metal
hydrogen has pushed major developments of modern experimental high pressure physics, yet the various
claims of its observation over the past 30 years have remained controversial5)6)7). Here we show
a first order phase transition near 425 GPa from insulator molecular solid hydrogen to metal hydrogen.
Pressure in excess of 400 GPa could be achieved by using the recently developed Toroidal Diamond
Anvil Cell (T-DAC)8). The structural and electronic properties of dense solid hydrogen at 80 K have
been characterized by synchrotron infrared spectroscopy. The continuous vibron frequency shift
and the electronic band gap closure down to 0.5 eV, both linearly evolving with pressure, point to
the stability of the insulator C2/c-24 phase up to the metallic transition. Upon pressure release,
the metallic state transforms back to the C2/c-24 phase with almost no hysteresis, hence suggesting
that the metallization proceeds through a structural transformation within the molecular solid,
presumably to the Cmca-12 structure. Our results are in good agreement with the scenario recently
disclosed by an advanced calculation able to capture many-body electronic correlations9).
