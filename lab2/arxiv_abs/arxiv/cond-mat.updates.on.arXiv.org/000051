We study the freezing kinetics of colloidal polycrystals made of micelles of Pluronic F108, a thermosensitive
copolymer, to which a small amount of silica nanoparticles of size comparable to that of the micelles
are added. We use rheology and calorimetry to measure Tc, the crystallization temperature, and
find that Tc increases with the heating rate \dot{T} used to crystallize the sample. To rationalize
our results, we first use viscosity measurements to establish a linear mapping between temperature
T and the effective volume fraction, {\phi}, of the micelles, treated as hard spheres. Next, we reproduce
the experimental \dot{T} dependence of the crystallization temperature with numerical calculations
based on standard models for the nucleation and growth of hard spheres crystals, classical nucleation
theory and the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov theory. The models have been adapted to account
for the peculiarities of our experiments: the presence of nanoparticles that are expelled in the
grain boundaries, and the steady increase of T and hence {\phi} during the experiment. We moreover
show that the polycrystal grain size obtained from the calculations is in good agreement with light
microscopy data. Finally, we find that the {\phi} dependence of the nucleation rate for the micellar
polycrystal is in remarkable quantitative agreement with that found in previous experiments on
colloidal hard spheres. These results suggests that deep analogies exist between hard-sphere
colloidal crystals and Pluronics micellar crystals, in spite of the difference in particle softness.
More generally, our results demonstrate that crystallization processes can be quantitatively
probed using standard rheometry.
