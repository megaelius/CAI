Scientific research is and was at all times a transnational activity. In this respect it crosses
several borders: national, cultural, and ideological. Even in times when physical borders separated
the scientific community, scientists kept their minds open and tried to communicate despite all
obstacles. An example of such activities in the field of physics is the travel in the year 1838 of a
group of three scientists through the Western Europe: Andreas Ettingshausen (professor at the
University of Vienna), August Kunzek (professor at the University of Lviv) and P. Marian Koller
(director of the observatory in Chremsminster, Upper Austria). $155$ years later a vivid scientific
exchange between physicists from Austria and Ukraine and in particular between the Institute for
Condensed Matter Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Lviv and the Institute
for Theoretical Physics of Johannes Kepler University Linz began. This became possible due to programs
financed by national institutions, but it had its scientific background in already knotted historic
scientific networks, when Lviv was an international center of mathematics and in Vienna the `School
of Statistical Thought' arose. In this paper, we discuss the above examples of scientific cooperation
pursuing several goals: to record less known facts from the history of science in a general culturological
context, to trace the rise of studies that resulted, with a span of time, in an emergence of statistical
and condensed matter physics, to follow development of multilayer networking structures that
join scientists and enable their research. It is our pleasure to submit this paper to the Festschrift
devoted to the 60th birthday of a renowned physicist, our good colleague and friend Ihor Mryglod.
In fact, his activities contributed a lot into strengthening the networks we describe in this paper.
