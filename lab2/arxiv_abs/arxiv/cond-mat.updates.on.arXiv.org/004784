Non-linear interactions between collective modes play a definitive role in far out of equilibrium
dynamics of strongly correlated electron systems. Understanding and utilizing these interactions
is crucial to photo-control of quantum many-body states. One of the most surprising examples of
strong mode coupling is the interaction between apical oxygen phonons and Josephson plasmons in
bilayer YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ superconductors. Experiments by Hu et al (2014). and Kaiser et
al. (2014) showed that below Tc, photo-excitation of phonons leads to enhancement and frequency
shifts of Josephson plasmon edges, while aboveTc, photo-excited phonons induce plasmon edges
even when there are no discernible features in the equilibrium reflectivity spectrum. Recent experiments
by Van Hoegen et al. (2019) also observed parametric generation of Josephson plasmons from photo-excited
phonons both below Tc and in the pseudogap phase. In this paper we present a theoretical model of phonon-plasmon
three wave interaction arising from coupling between the oxygen motion and the in-plane superfluid
stiffness. Analysis of the parametric instability of plasmons based on this model gives frequencies
of the most unstable plasmons that are in agreement with experimental observations. We also discuss
how strong parametric excitation of Josephson plasmons can explain pump induced changes in the
TeraHertz reflectivity of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ in the superconducting state, including frequency
shifts and sharpening of Josephson plasmon edges, as well as appearance of a new peak around 2THz.
An interesting feature of this model is that overdamped Josephson plasmons do not give any discernible
features in reflectivity in equilibrium, but can develop plasmon edges when parametrically excited.
We suggest that this mechanism explains photo-induced plasmon edges in the pseudogap phase of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$.
