We studied the magnetic properties, in particular dynamics, of the correlated spins associated
with natural defects in the organic spin chain compounds ($o$-DMTTF)$_2X$ ($X$ = Br, Cl) by means
of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Both materials exhibit spin-Peierls transitions
at temperatures around 50 K [P. Foury-Leylekian et al. Phys. Rev. B 84, 195134 (2011)], which allow
a separation of the properties of defects inside the chains from the magnetic response of the spin
chains. Indeed, continuous wave ESR measurements performed over a wide temperature range evidence
the evolution of the spin dynamics from being governed by the spins in the chains at elevated temperatures
to a low-temperature regime which is dominated by defects within the spin-dimerized chains. Such
defects polarize the antiferromagnetically coupled spins in their vicinity, thereby leading
to a finite local alternating magnetization around the defect site which can be described in terms
of a soliton, i.e. a spin 1/2 quasiparticle built of many correlated spins, pinned to the defect.
In addition, contributions of triplon excitations of the spin-dimerized state to the ESR response
below the transition temperature were observed which provides a spectroscopic estimate for the
spin-gap of the studied systems. Moreover, details of spin dynamics deep in the spin-Peierls phase
were investigated by pulse ESR experiments which revealed Rabi-oscillations as signatures of
coherent spin dynamics. From a comparison of the characteristic damping times of the Rabi oscillations
with measurements of the spin relaxation times by means of primary-echo decay and CPMG methods it
becomes evident that inhomogeneities in local magnetic fields strongly contribute to the soliton
decoherence.
