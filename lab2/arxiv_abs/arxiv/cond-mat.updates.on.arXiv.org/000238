We study continuous quantum phase transitions and their critical neighborhoods in one- and two-dimensional
models of interacting spinful fermions -- BCS-like models. The considered models originate from
a two-dimensional model of d-wave superconductivity proposed by Sachdev. Phase diagrams with
lines of critical points are presented. Due to the exact diagonalizability of the considered models,
in one and higher dimensions, for any twisted boundary conditions, closed form analytic expressions
for correlations functions are obtained. Those expressions enable us to analyze numerically with
great accuracy the correlations functions of macroscopic systems, providing such characteristics
of large-distance asymptotic behavior as the correlation lengths and universal critical indices
$\nu$, and revealing scaling properties of correlations functions with respect to the chemical
potential and the distance, and the coupling constant and the distance, which hold in the whole range
of distances. Moreover, in the one- and two-dimensional cases we provide analytic expressions
for large-distance asymptotic behavior of correlation functions, in particular for correlation
lengths. Those analytic results are in excellent agreement with results obtained numerically,
for all kinds of quantum phase transitions exhibited by considered systems. Our results extend
considerably the knowledge of properties of lattice fermion systems exhibiting continuous quantum
phase transitions, especially in two dimensions. They can also be used to test unconventional methods
of studying quantum phase transitions, as the promising fidelity approach or the entanglement
approach, beyond one-dimensional case and beyond the realm of paradigmatic XY and Ising chains
in transverse magnetic fields.
