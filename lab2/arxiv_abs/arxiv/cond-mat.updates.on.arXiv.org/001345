Diblock copolymers by virtue of the chemical dissimilarity between the constituting blocks exhibit
microphase separation in the melt state. The phase separated melt can successfully be exploited
to control the morphology of the final semi crystalline materials by allowing an extended thermal
annealing. Thermal annealing accelerates coalescence of microdomains, yielding a phase separated
melt that would exhibit a distinctly different crystallization behaviour than microphase separated
melt without annealing. In this paper, we report simulation results on the crystallization behavior
of A-B diblock copolymer, wherein the melting temperature of A-block is higher than B-block, instigated
from microphase separated melt. During crystallization, the morphological evolution of microphase
separated melt is extensively driven by thermal history. Annealing of microphase separated melt
at high temperature successfully reorients melt morphology, and remains almost unaltered during
the subsequent crystallization (isothermal and non-isothermal), which is attributed to the hard
confinement resulted during microphase separation. Annealing induces a change in bond orientation
of A-block, whereas there is no appreciable change in bond orientation of B-block keeping crystallinity
and lamellar thickness unaffected. Isothermal crystallization confines crystallization in
phase separated microdomain whereas non-isothermal crystallization results in morphological
perturbation. The crystallization rate of annealed melt is much faster than the non-annealed melt
due to less entanglement and more relaxed structure, achieved via annealing. At a higher composition
of B-block, A-block produces thicker crystals, which is attributed to the dilution effect exhibited
by B-block. Two-step compared to one-step isothermal crystallization yields thicker crystals
with higher crystallinity of A-block.
