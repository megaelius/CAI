We study the low-energy behavior of the vertex function of a single Anderson impurity away from half-filling
for finite magnetic fields, using the Ward identities with careful consideration of the anti-symmetry
and analytic properties. The asymptotic form of the vertex function $\Gamma_{\sigma\sigma';\sigma'\sigma}^{}(i\omega,i\omega';i\omega',i\omega)$
is determined up to terms of linear order with respect to the two frequencies $\omega$ and $\omega'$,
as well as the $\omega^2$ contribution for anti-parallel spins $\sigma'\neq \sigma$ at $\omega'=0$.
From these results, we also obtain a series of the Fermi-liquid relations beyond those of Yamada-Yosida.
The $\omega^2$ real part of the self-energy $\Sigma_{\sigma}^{}(i\omega)$ is shown to be expressed
in terms of the double derivative $\partial^2\Sigma_{\sigma}^{}(0)/\partial \epsilon_{d\sigma}^{2}$
with respect to the impurity energy level $\epsilon_{d\sigma}^{}$, and agrees with the formula
obtained recently by Filippone, Moca, von Delft, and Mora in the Nozi\`{e}res phenomenological
Fermi-liquid theory [Phys.\ Rev.\ B {\bf 95}, 165404 (2017)]. We also calculate the $T^2$ correction
of the self-energy, and find that the real part can be expressed in terms of the three-body correlation
function $\chi_{\uparrow\downarrow,-\sigma}^{[3]} = \partial \chi_{\uparrow\downarrow}/\partial
\epsilon_{d,-\sigma}^{}$. We also provide an alternative derivation of the asymptotic form of
the vertex function. Specifically, we calculate the skeleton diagrams for the vertex function
$\Gamma_{\sigma\sigma;\sigma\sigma}^{}(i\omega,0;0,i\omega)$ for parallel spins up to order
$U^4$ in the Coulomb repulsion $U$. It directly clarifies the fact that the analytic components
of order $\omega$ vanish as a result of the cancellation of four related Feynman diagrams which are
related to each other through the anti-symmetry operation.
