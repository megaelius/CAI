Osmosis is a universal phenomenon occurring in a broad variety of processes and fields. It is the
archetype of entropic forces, both trivial in its fundamental expression - the van 't Hoff perfect
gas law - and highly subtle in its physical roots. While osmosis is intimately linked with transport
across membranes, it also manifests itself as an interfacial transport phenomenon: the so-called
diffusio-osmosis and -phoresis, whose consequences are presently actively explored for example
for the manipulation of colloidal suspensions or the development of active colloidal swimmers.
Here we give a global and unifying view of the phenomenon of osmosis and its consequences with a multi-disciplinary
perspective. Pushing the fundamental understanding of osmosis allows to propose new perspectives
for different fields and we highlight a number of examples along these lines, for example introducing
the concepts of osmotic diodes, active separation and far from equilibrium osmosis, raising in
turn fundamental questions in the thermodynamics of separation. The applications of osmosis are
also obviously considerable and span very diverse fields. Here we discuss a selection of phenomena
and applications where osmosis shows great promises: osmotic phenomena in membrane science (with
recent developments in separation, desalination, reverse osmosis for water purification thanks
in particular to the emergence of new nanomaterials); applications in biology and health (in particular
discussing the kidney filtration process); osmosis and energy harvesting (in particular, osmotic
power and blue energy as well as capacitive mixing); applications in detergency and cleaning, as
well as for oil recovery in porous media.
