Effect of microstructures and interactions on segmental dynamics in polyethylene glycol (PEG)
solution in water is probed with macro-scale oscillatory rheology and micro-scale diffusion of
a fluorescent probe. PEG solution fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) curves have
immobile fractions which increase with PEG concentration, for PEG volume fraction (c) > 0.2, indicating
structuring. PEG solution micro-scale diffusion coefficients follow Rouse scaling D {\ alpha}
c^(-0.54) for c < 0.8, resembling unentangled neutral polymers in good solvent. Addition of nanoclay
bentonite (B) in PEG matrix slows down probe diffusion 3-7 times, with heterogeneous dynamics.
With addition of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in PEG matrix, probe diffusion is homogeneous with
negligibly small enhancement in diffusion time. The macroscale storage modulii for PEG, PEG+B,
and PEG + CMC solutions scale as viscous fluid-like, followed by short elastic plateau. Beyond the
elastic plateau, the scaling is a concentration-dependent power law greater than the Rouse scaling
of 0.5 for 0.1<c<0.2 PEG solutions. We identify a time scale {\tau}_b due to intermolecular interactions
in PEG, such that for {\omega}>{\tau}_b^(-1) , Rouse scaling is recovered. Addition of CMC to PEG
also restores Rouse scaling. Addition of B gives contributions from both polymer matrix and network
of B particles, leading to departure from pure Rouse behaviour. Static microstructural studies
reveal clay aggregation due to depletion interactions on increasing the concentration of clay
particles in PEG matrix, which leads to a non-monotonic concentration dependence of storage modulus
with c.
