It is well-known that not only the orbital ordering but also the choice of the orbitals themselves
as the basis may influence the computational efficiency of density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) calculations significantly. In this paper, for the purpose of assessing the efficiency
of using various natural orbitals (NOs) as the DMRG basis, we perform benchmark DMRG calculations
with different bases, which include the traditional NOs obtained by unrestricted Hartree Fock
(UHF), configuration-interaction singles and doubles (CISD), second-order M\oller-Plesset
perturbation theory (MP2) and complete active space with second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2)
calculations, and NOs acquired from preliminary moderate DMRG calculations (e.g. preserved states
less than 500), as well as Kohn-Sham orbitals, HF canonical orbitals and complete active space self
consistent field (CASSCF) optimized orbitals. The tested systems include N$_2$, transition metal
Cr$_2$ and one-dimensional hydrogen polyradical chain systems under both equilibrium and dissociation
situations. The results indicate that the good compromise between the requirement for low computational
costs of acquiring NOs and the demand for high efficiency of NOs as the basis of DMRG calculations
may be much dependent on the studied systems' diverse electron correlation characters and the size
of the active space. It is also shown that DMRG-complete active space configuration interaction
(DMRG-CASCI) calculation in a basis of carefully chosen NOs can provide a less expensive alternative
to standard DMRG-CASSCF calculation and avoid the convergence difficulties of orbital optimization
for large active space.
