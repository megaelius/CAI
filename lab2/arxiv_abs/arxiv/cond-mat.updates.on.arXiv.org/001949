Micromanipulations, perfusions and measurements performed using glass microelectrodes filled
with an electrolyte is a conventional technique for experimental morphological and membrane electrophysiological
studies at a single cell and membrane surface level. The typical (effective) diameter of the end
of the glass microelectrode is from 500 up to less than 100 nm, which prevents one from observing it
using a standard optical microscope in accordance with the optical resolution criteria, since
the diameter less than 500 nm is indistinguishable within the interference zone. Microprocessor
programming of the puller (microforge) that provides pulling and tearing allows to obtain in certain
regimes the adjusted diameter and shape of the micropipette tip, although this result is not fully
controlled due to the above limitations. In this connection it is necessary to design the control
devices for the micropipette tips both at the preparation and operation stages (intracellular
or extracellular insertion). This method also should provide visualization of the processes occurring
upon interaction of the microelectrode tip with the cell in real time, depending on the electrode
type and state, which allows to level the artifacts arising with the systematic error frequency
from the uncontrolled operation of the micropipette tip after different ways of the microelectrode
filling with the electrolyte. We propose an installation scheme that solves the above problems
by means of introducing an interferometric device for microscopic control of the microelectrode
and micromanipulator or microperfusor, for the first time for a given type of optical instruments
combined with the interferometric optical scheme.
