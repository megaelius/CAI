Density-functional theory calculations are performed to investigate hydrogen transport in the
proton conductor BaSnO$_3$. Structural optimizations in the stable and saddle point configurations
for transfer and reorientation allow description of the high-temperature classical and semi-classical
regimes, in which diffusion occurs by over-barrier motion. At lower temperature (typically below
300 K), we describe a thermally-assisted quantum regime. In this regime, transfer and reorientation
occur when the surrounding matrix adopts particular "coincidence" configurations in which quantum
tunneling is favored. Both the non-adiabatic and the adiabatic cases are examined. In the adiabatic
case, the energy landscape of hydrogen in the coincidence configuration is very flat, with very
low coincidence energy barriers. Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations of the H atom in
the coincidence potential reveal, in the transfer case, highly quantum behavior up to T=300 K (the
density of probability of H in the coincidence configuration, has its maximum at the saddle point,
due to the fact that the zero-point energy exceeds the coincidence energy barrier). Arguments are
given that support the adiabatic picture for the transfer mechanism. This suggests existence of
this state of hydrogen during the very short lifetime of the coincidence configurations ($\sim$
10$^{-13}$ s), as a transition state for the transfer mechanism. Remarkably, such state is identical
to that of ice X, a highly quantum phase of ice observed at high pressures $\approx$ 100 GPa. In the
case of reorientation, typical times for existence of the coincidence configuration and for protonic
motion are roughly equal, suggesting that the adiabatic picture is not valid. Protonic transfer
and reorientation in oxides are therefore governed by radically different mechanisms below room
temperature.
