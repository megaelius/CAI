The extensional rheology of polymeric liquids has been extensively examined through experiments
and theoretical predictions. However, a systematic study of the extensional rheology of polymer
solutions in the semidilute regime, in terms of examining the effects of concentration and molecular
weight, has not been carried out so far. Prior studies of the shear rheology of semidilute polymer
solutions have demonstrated that their behaviour is distinctively different from that observed
in the dilute and concentrated regimes. This difference in behaviour is anticipated to be even more
pronounced in extensional flows. In this work, the extensional rheology of linear, double-stranded
DNA molecules, spanning an order of magnitude of molecular weights (25 to 289 kilobasepairs) and
concentrations (0.03 to 0.3 mg/ml), has been investigated. DNA solutions are now used routinely
as model polymeric systems due to their near-perfect monodispersity. Measurements have been carried
out with a filament stretching rheometer since it is the most reliable method for obtaining an estimate
of the elongational stress growth of a polymer solution. Transient and steady-state uniaxial extensional
viscosities of DNA dissolved in a solvent under excess salt conditions, with a high concentration
of sucrose in order to achieve a sufficiently high solvent viscosity, have been determined in the
semidilute regime at room temperature. The dependence of the steady state uniaxial extensional
viscosity on molecular weight, concentration and extension rate is measured with a view to determining
if data collapse can be observed with an appropriate choice of variables. Steady state shear viscosity
measurements suggest that sucrose-DNA interactions might play a role in determining the observed
rheological behaviour of semidilute DNA solutions with sucrose as a component in the solvent.
