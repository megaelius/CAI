The present study experimentally and numerically investigates the evaporation and resultant
patterns of dried deposits of aqueous colloidal sessile droplets, when the droplets are initially
elevated to a high temperature before being placed on a substrate held at ambient temperature. The
system is then released for natural evaporation without applying any external perturbation. Infrared
thermography and optical profilometry were used as essential tools for interfacial temperature
measurements and quantification of the coffee-ring dimensions, respectively. Initially, a significant
temperature gradient exists along the liquid-gas interface as soon as the droplet is deposited
on the substrate which triggers a Marangoni stress-induced recirculation flow directed from the
top of the droplet towards the contact line along the liquid-gas interface. Thus, the flow is in the
reverse direction to that seen in the conventional substrate heating case. Interestingly, this
temperature gradient decays rapidly -- within the first 10% of the total evaporation time and the
droplet-substrate system reaches thermal equilibrium with ambient thereafter. Despite fast
decay of the temperature gradient, the coffee-ring dimensions significantly diminish, leading
to an inner deposit. This suppression of the coffee-ring effect is attributed to the fact that the
initial Marangoni stress-induced recirculation flow continues until the last stage of the evaporation,
even after the interfacial temperature gradient vanishes. This is essentially a consequence of
liquid inertia. Overall, together with a new experimental condition, the present investigation
discloses a distinct nature of Marangoni stress-induced flow in the drying droplet and its role
in influencing the associated colloidal deposits, which was not explored previously.
