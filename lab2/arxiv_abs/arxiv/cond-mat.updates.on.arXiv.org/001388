LaCrO$_3$ (LCO) / SrTiO$_3$ (STO) heterojunctions are intriguing due to a polar discontinuity
along (001), two distinct and controllable interface structures [(LaO)$^+$/(TiO$_2$)$^0$ and
(SrO)$^0$/(CrO$_2$)$^-$], and interface-induced polarization. In this study, we have used soft-
and hard x-ray standing-wave excited photoemission spectroscopy (SW-XPS) to generate a quantitative
determination of the elemental depth profiles and interface properties, band alignments, and
the depth distribution of the interface-induced built-in potentials in the two constituent oxides.
We observe an alternating charged interface configuration: a positively charged (LaO)$^+$/(TiO$_2$)$^0$
intermediate layer at the LCO$_\textbf{top}$/STO$_\textbf{bottom}$ interface and a negatively
charged (SrO)$^0$/(CrO$_2$)$^-$ intermediate layer at the STO$_\textbf{top}$/LCO$_\textbf{bottom}$
interface. Using core-level SW data, we have determined the depth distribution of species, including
through the interfaces, and these results are in excellent agreement with scanning transmission
electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) mapping of local structure
and composition. SW-XPS also enabled deconvolution of the LCO-contributed and STO- contributed
matrix-element-weighted density of states (MEWDOSs) from the valence band (VB) spectra for the
LCO/STO superlattice (SL). Monitoring the VB edges of the deconvoluted MEWDOS shifts with a change
in probing profile, the alternating charge- induced built-in potentials are observed in both constituent
oxides. Finally, using a two-step simulation approach involving first core-level binding energy
shifts and then valence-band modeling, the built-in potential gradients across the SL are resolved
in detail and represented by the depth distribution of VB edges.
