The structure and morphology of polymers are significantly altered upon exposure to high energy
gamma irradiation. The present investigation reports the influence of such irradiation of doses
in the range of 1 - 30 kGy on the particle size of Poly (Ethylene Oxide) [PEO] powder along with its correlation
with molecular weight distribution. Pore-size distribution and overall porosity of the synthesized
films prepared with irradiated and unirradiated PEO powder is also reported. The particle size
of both unirradiated and irradiated PEO powders is found be in the range of 0.01 - 1000 micrometer.
It is known that, variation in irradiation dose either generates particles of lower dimension through
bond breakage i.e scission or higher dimension through cross-linkage. PEO films exhibit strong
dependence of irradiation effect on pore size distribution and porosity. PEO films synthesized
using both unirradiated and irradiated powders exhibit pore dimension in the range of 20 - 500 nm.
The overall porosity of PEO films studied through BET adsorption technique initially increases
with dose upto 3 kGy followed by linear decrease upto 30 kGy. Films cast with unirradiated PEO powder
show multimodal pore size distribution, but perturbation with irradiation changes the modality
to uni-or bimodal nature. The mentioned outcome of irradiation viz. particle and pore size variation
is also correlated with PEO microstructures.The article demonstrates that, selective irradiation
is capable of tailoring the pore-size within a definite regime thereby reducing the multimodal
trait. The reported study may be relevant towards applications such as catalysis, sensing and filtration,
where pore size distribution plays a crucial role.
