In this work, we perform a comparative study of the size dependence of diffusion of charged and neutral
solutes in water. The neutral solute in water shows a nonmonotonicity in the size dependence of diffusion.
This is usually connected to the well known Levitation effect where it is found that when solute diffuses
through the transient solvent cages then for attractive solute-solvent interaction and for a particular
size of the solute there is a force balance which leads to the maximum in diffusion. Similar maximum
in diffusion of charged solutes has also been observed and connected to Levitation effect. However,
earlier studies of ionic diffusion connects this nonmonotonicity to the interplay between hard
sphere repulsion and Coulombic attraction. In this work, we show that although the size dependence
of both charged and neutral solutes have a nonmonotonicity, there is a stark difference in their
behaviour. For charged solute with increase in attraction the maximum shifts to higher solute sizes
and has a lower value whereas for neutral solute it remains at the same place and has a higher value.
We show by studying the ionic and non-ionic part of the potential that for larger solutes it is the
nonionic part which dominates and for smaller solutes the ionic part and the is a transition between
them. As the charge on the solute increases, this transition takes place at larger solute sizes which
leads to the shift in the diffusivity maxima and reduction of the peak value. We show that although
the charged solutes also explore the solvent cage even before we reach the size which Levitates due
to Coulombic attraction the diffusion value drops. Thus the origin of diffusivity maxima in charged
and neutral solute diffusion is different.
