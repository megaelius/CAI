The molecular coordination complex NiI$_2$(3,5-lut)$_4$ [where (3,5-lut) $=$ (3,5-lutidine)
$=$ (C$_7$H$_9$N)] has been synthesized and characterized by several techniques including synchrotron
X-ray diffraction, ESR, SQUID magnetometry, pulsed-field magnetization, inelastic neutron
scattering and muon spin relaxation. Templated by the configuration of 3,5-lut ligands the molecules
pack in-registry with the Ni--I$\cdots$I--Ni chains aligned along the $c$--axis. This arrangement
leads to through-space I$\cdots$I magnetic coupling which is directly measured for the first time
in this work. The net result is a near-ideal realization of the $S = 1$ Haldane chain with $J = 17.5~\rm{K}$
and energy gaps of $\Delta^{\parallel} = 5.3~{\rm K}$ $\Delta^{\perp} =7.7~{\rm K}$, split by
the easy-axis single-ion anisotropy $D=-1.2~{\rm K}$. The ratio $D/J = -0.07$ affords one of the
most isotropic Haldane systems yet discovered, while the ratio $\Delta_0/J = 0.40(1)$ (where $\Delta_0$
is the average gap size) is close to its ideal theoretical value, suggesting a very high degree of
magnetic isolation of the spin chains in this material. The Haldane gap is closed by orientation-dependent
critical fields $\mu_0H_{\rm c}^{\parallel} = 5.3~\rm{T}$ and $\mu_0H_{\rm c}^{\perp} = 4.3~\rm{T}$,
which are readily accessible experimentally and permit investigations across the entirety of
the Haldane phase, with the fully polarized state occurring at $\mu_0 H_{\rm s}^{\parallel}=46.0~\rm{T}$
and $\mu_0 H_{\rm s}^{\perp}=50.7~\rm{T}$. The results are explicable within the so-called fermion
model, in contrast to other reported easy-axis Haldane systems. Zero-field magnetic order is absent
down to $20~{\rm mK}$ and emergent end-chain effects are observed in the gapped state, as evidenced
by detailed low-temperature measurements.
