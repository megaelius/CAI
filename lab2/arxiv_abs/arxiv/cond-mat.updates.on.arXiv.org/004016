The phenomenon whereby atoms deal with the positive or negative charge by losing or gaining the electron
forms the basis of familiar processes. The elements in which the atoms comprise unfilled states
can be eligible for electron dynamics indicating that they cannot ionize. On suitable level ground
surface, atoms of solid behaviors elongate or deform while atoms of gas behaviors condense or squeeze
as per exerting force to electrons. Dynamics of electrons in atoms of such behaviors are due to infinitesimal
displacements, where they remain clamped by energy knots. In inert gas atoms, a different mechanism
is involved. By excessive population of photons, atoms of inert gas behavior split distorting in
electron streams. As a result, when lowering forcing energy photons leave distorting inter-state
electron gaps of splitted atoms to enter in the air medium, their characteristics become obvious
revealing the phenomenon of light glow known in plasma. By splitting inert gas atoms, their electrons
carry forced energy of chasing photons. When forced energy electrons impinge on underneath elongated
atoms of solid at suitable inclination, they elongate them further. When carrying forced energy
electrons do not impinge on underneath elongated atoms at suitable inclination, instead of elongating
further, impinging electrons deform elongated atoms by making non-orientational based stretching
of energy knots. The splitting of inert gas atoms into electrons and carrying of photons by electrons
indicate that silicon solar cells and other similar kind of gadgets generate photons having characteristics
of current. But to generate photons, atoms should execute confined inter-state electron dynamics
under conservative mode of forces as discussed in references 15 and 16. Different microscopic analyses
of specimens are due to the resolving power of working photons ...
