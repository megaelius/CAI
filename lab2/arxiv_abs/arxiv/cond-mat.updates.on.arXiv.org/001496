It is well known that sufficiently strong electrostatic fields are able to change the morphology
of Large Area Field Emitters (LAFEs). This phenomenon affects the electrostatic interactions
between adjacent sites on a LAFE during field emission and may lead to several consequences, such
as: the emitter's degradation, diffusion of absorbed particles on the emitter's surface, deflection
due to electrostatic forces and mechanical stress. These consequences are undesirable for technological
applications, since they may significantly affect the macroscopic current density on the LAFE.
Despite the technological importance, these processes are not completely understood yet. Moreover,
the electrostatic effects due to the proximity between emitters on a LAFE may compete with the morphological
ones. The balance between these effects may lead to a non trivial behavior in the apex-Field Enhancement
Factor (FEF). The present work intends to study the interplay between proximity and morphological
effects by studying a model amenable for an analytical treatment. In order to do that, a conducting
system under an external electrostatic field, with a profile limited by two mirror-reflected triangular
protrusions on an infinite line, is considered. The FEF near the apex of each emitter is obtained
as a function of their shape and the distance between them via a Schwarz-Christoffel transformation.
Our results suggest that a tradeoff between morphological and proximity effects on a LAFE may provide
an explanation for the observed reduction of the local FEF and its variation at small distances between
the emitter sites.
