We present gravimetrical and optical imaging experiments on the capillarity-driven imbibition
of silicone oils in monolithic silica glasses traversed by 3D networks of pores (mesoporous Vycor
glass with 6.5 nm or 10 nm pore diameters). As evidenced by a robust square-root-of-time Lucas-Washburn
(L-W) filling kinetics, the capillary rise is governed by a balance of capillarity and viscous drag
forces in the absence of inertia and gravitational effects over the entire experimental times studied,
ranging from a few seconds up to 10 days. A video on the infiltration process corroborates a collective
pore filling as well as pronounced imbibition front broadening resulting from the capillarity
and permeability disorder, typical of Vycor glasses. The transport process is analyzed within
a Darcy scale description, considering a generalized pre-factor of the L-W law, termed Lucas-Washburn-Darcy
imbibition ability. It assumes a Hagen-Poiseuille velocity profile in the pores and depends on
the porosity, the mean pore diameter, the tortuosity and the velocity slip length and thus on the
effective hydraulic pore diameter. For both matrices a reduced imbibition speed and thus reduced
imbibition ability, compared to the one assuming the nominal pore diameter, bulk fluidity and bulk
capillarity, can be quantitatively traced to an immobile, pore-wall adsorbed boundary layer of
1.4 nm thickness. Presumably, it consists of a monolayer of water molecules adsorbed on the hydrophilic
pore walls covered by a monolayer of flat-laying silicone oil molecules. Our study highlights the
importance of immobile nanoscopic boundary layers on the flow in tight oil reservoirs as well as
the validity of the Darcy scale description for transport in mesoporous media.
