Weyl semimetals are materials with topologically nontrivial band structure both in the bulk and
on the surface, hosting chiral nodes which are sinks and sources of Berry curvature. Weyl semimetals
have been predicted, and recently measured, to exhibit large nonlinear optical responses. This
discovery, along with their high mobilities, makes Weyl semimetals relevant to a broad spectrum
of applications in optoelectronic, nanophotonic and quantum optical devices. While there is growing
interest in understanding and characterizing the linear and nonlinear behavior of Weyl semimetals,
an ab initio calculation of the linear optical and optoelectronic responses at finite temperature
remains largely unexplored. Here, we specifically address the temperature dependence of the linear
optical response in type-I Weyl semimetals TaAs and NbAs. We evaluate from first principles the
scattering lifetimes due to electron-phonon and electron-electron interaction and incorporate
these lifetimes in evaluating an experimentally relevant frequency-, polarization- and temperature-dependent
complex dielectric function for each semimetal. From these calculations we present linear optical
conductivity predictions which agree well where experiment exists (for TaAs) and guide the way
for future measurements of type-I Weyl semimetals. Importantly, we also examine the optical conductivity's
dependence on the chemical potential, a crucial physical parameter which can be controlled experimentally
and can elucidate the role of the Weyl nodes in optoelectronic response. Through this work, we present
design principles for Weyl optoelectronic devices that use photogenerated carriers in type-I
Weyl semimetals.
