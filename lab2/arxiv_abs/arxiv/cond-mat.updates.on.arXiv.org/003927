We study two novel approaches to efficiently encoding universal constraints imposed by conformal
symmetry, and describe applications to quantum chaos in higher dimensional CFTs. The first approach
consists of a reformulation of the shadow operator formalism and kinematic space techniques. We
observe that the shadow operator associated with the stress tensor (or other conserved currents)
can be written as the descendant of a field ${\cal E}$ with negative dimension. Computations of stress
tensor contributions to conformal blocks can be systematically organized in terms of the "soft
mode" ${\cal E}$, turning them into a simple diagrammatic perturbation theory at large central
charge. Our second (equivalent) approach concerns a theory of reparametrization modes, generalizing
previous studies in the context of the Schwarzian theory and two-dimensional CFTs. Due to the conformal
anomaly in even dimensions, gauge modes of the conformal group acquire an action and are shown to
exhibit the same dynamics as the soft mode ${\cal E}$ that encodes the physics of the stress tensor
shadow. We discuss the calculation of the conformal partial waves or the conformal blocks using
our effective field theory. The separation of conformal blocks from shadow blocks is related to
gauging of certain symmetries in our effective field theory of the soft mode. These connections
explain and generalize various relations between conformal blocks, shadow operators, kinematic
space, and reparametrization modes. As an application we study thermal physics in higher dimensions
and argue that the theory of reparametrization modes captures the physics of quantum chaos in Rindler
space. This is also supported by the observation of the pole skipping phenomenon in the conformal
energy-energy two-point function on Rindler space.
