Two porous carbon-based samples doped with Au and Co are investigated. The neutron diffraction
study reveals an amorphous structure of both samples. The Co-doped sample exhibits a long-range
ferromagnetic (FM) ordering at 2.6 K. The NMR investigations demonstrate, that the samples are
obtained with a partial carbonization of initial aromatic compounds and do not reach a state of glassy
carbon. The magnetization, longitudinal nonlinear response to a weak ac field and electron magnetic
resonance data give evidences for presence of FM clusters in the samples well above 300 K. A short-range
character of the FM ordering in the Au-doped sample transforms below T$_C \approx$ 210 K into another
inhomogeneous FM state. Besides the FM clusters, this state contains a subsystem with a long-range
FM ordering (matrix) formed by paramagnetic centers, existing outside the clusters. The nonlinear
response data suggest a percolative character of the long-range FM matrix, which is connected probably
with a porous sample structure. The magnetization data give evidence for the formation of an inhomogeneous
state in the Co-doped sample, similar to that in the Au-doped one. However, this state is formed at
higher temperatures, lying well above 350 K, and exhibits a more homogeneous arrangement of the
FM nanoparticles and the FM matrix. Temperature dependence of the magnetization in the Au-doped
sample is attributable to changes of the domain formation regime in the FM matrix on cooling, connected
with the inhomogeneous character of its FM state. Such peculiarity is absent in the Co-doped sample
below 350 K, which is in agreement with formation of the FM state in this sample at much higher temperatures.
Further cooling below T ~ 3(10) K leads to a steep increase of the magnetization in both samples. This
is attributable to the domain rearrangement in the inhomogeneous FM state at low temperatures.
