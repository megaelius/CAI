We present an analytical investigation of the exciton optical absorption in a narrow armchair graphene
nanoribbon (AGNR) in the presence of a longitudinal external electric field directed parallel
to the ribbon axis. The two-body 2D Dirac equation for the massless electron and hole subject to the
ribbon confinement, Coulomb interaction and electric field is employed. The ribbon confinement
is assumed to be much stronger than the internal exciton electric field which in turn considerably
exceeds the external electric field. This justifies an adiabatic approximation implying a slow
longitudinal and fast transverse electron-hole relative motion governed by the exciton attraction
and accompanied by the external electric field and ribbon confinement effects, respectively.
In the single subband approximation of the isolated size-quantized subbands induced by the ribbon
confinement the exciton electroabsorption coefficient is determined in an explicit form. The
pronounced dependencies of the exciton peak positions, widths and intensities on the ribbon width
and electric field strength are traced. The electron-hole exciton attraction modifies remarkably
the Franz-Keldysh electroabsorption in the frequency region both below and above the edges determined
by the size-quantized energy levels. In the double-subband approximation of the interacting ground
and first excited subbands the combined effect of the exciton electro- and autoionization caused
by the electric field and intersubband coupling, respectively, are explored. Estimates of the
expected experimental values for the typically employed AGNR show that for a weak electric field
the exciton quasi-discrete states remain sufficiently stable to be observed in optical experiments,
while relatively strong fields free the captured carriers to further restore their contribution
to the transport.
