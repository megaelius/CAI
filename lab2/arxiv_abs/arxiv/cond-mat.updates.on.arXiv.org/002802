The electromagnetic modes and the resonances of homogeneous, finite size, two-dimensional bodies
are examined in the frequency domain by a rigorous full wave approach based on an integro-differential
formulation of the electromagnetic scattering problem. Using a modal expansion for the current
density that disentangles the geometric and material properties of the body the integro-differential
equation for the induced surface (free or polarization) current density field is solved. The current
modes and the corresponding resonant values of the surface conductivity (eigen-conductivities)
are evaluated by solving a linear eigenvalue problem with a non-Hermitian operator. They are inherent
properties of the body geometry and do not depend on the body material. The material only determines
the coefficients of the modal expansion and hence the frequencies at which their amplitudes are
maximum (resonance frequencies). The eigen-conductivities and the current modes are studied
in detail as the frequency, the shape and the size of the body vary. Open and closed surfaces are considered.
The presence of vortex current modes, in addition to the source-sink current modes (no whirling
modes), which characterize plasmonic oscillations, is shown. Important topological features
of the current modes, such as the number of sources and sinks, the number of vortexes, the direction
of the vortexes are preserved as the size of the body and the frequency vary. Unlike the source-sink
current modes, in open surfaces the vortex current modes can be resonantly excited only in materials
with positive imaginary part of the surface conductivity. Eventually, as examples, the scattering
by two-dimensional bodies with either positive or negative imaginary part of the surface conductivity
is analyzed and the contributions of the different modes are examined.
