We consider a lateral hetero-junction where the left and right leads are made of monolayer graphene
and the middle region is made of a gapped tilted Dirac material (borophene or quinoid graphene) illuminated
with off-resonant circularly polarized radiation. The tilt parameter $v_t$ makes the band gap
indirect and smaller in magnitude as compared to Dirac materials without tilt. Exposure to radiation
makes the band gaps of the central region valley-dependent which show their signatures as valley
polarized charge and thermal currents, thereby causing a valley Seebeck effect. We study the variation
of the valley polarized electrical conductance, thermal conductance, thermopower and figure
of merit of this junction with chemical potential $\mu$ and a tunable gap parameter $\eta$. For non-zero
$\eta$, all the valley polarized quantities are peaked at certain values of chemical potential
and then vanish asymptotically. Increase in gap parameter enhances the valley thermopower and
valley figure of merit, whereas the valley conductances (electrical and thermal) show non monotonic
behavior with $\eta$. We also compare the valley polarized quantities with their corresponding
charge counterparts (effective contribution from both the valleys). The charge thermopower and
the charge figure of merit behave non monotonically with $\eta$ and the charge conductances (electrical
and thermal) depict a decreasing trend with $\eta$. Furthermore, the tilt parameter reduces the
effective transmission of carriers through the junction, thereby diminishing all the charge and
valley polarized quantities. As the gaps in the dispersion can be adjusted by varying the intensity
of light as well as the Semenoff mass, the tunability of this junction with regard to its thermoelectric
properties may be experimentally realizable.
