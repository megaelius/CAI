We investigate the occurrence of multicritical points under pressure and magnetic field in a model
that describes two 5f bands (of either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ characters) which hybridize with a single
itinerant conduction band. The 5f-electrons interact through Coulomb and exchange terms. The
AF order parameter is a N\'eel vector, which is assumed to be fixed by an Ising anisotropy. The applied
magnetic field is transverse to the anisotropy axis. Without field, our results for the temperature
- pressure phase diagram show that, at low temperatures, a first-order phase transition occurs
between two distinct antiferromagnetic phases, AF$_1$ and AF$_2$, as the pressure is increased.
The two phases are characterized by the gaps of bands $\alpha$ and $\beta$ given by $\Delta_{\alpha}$
and $\Delta_{\beta}$, respectively. The AF$_1$ phase occurs when $\Delta_{\beta}>\Delta_{\alpha}>0$,
while in the AF$_2$ phase, the gaps satisfy $\Delta_{\alpha}>\Delta_{\beta}>0$. The application
of a magnetic field produces a drastic change in the phase diagram. The AF1 and AF2 phases separate
with the latter acquiring a dome shape which is eventually suppressed for large values of the applied
field. The evolution of the phase diagram under pressure, without and with magnetic field, shows
the presence of multicritical points. Our results show that the evolution of these multicritical
points by the simultaneous application of pressure and field is also drastic with the suppression
of some multicritical points and the emergence of others ones. We believe that these results may
have relevance for the growing field of multicritical points (classical and quantum) in the physics
of Uranium compounds.
