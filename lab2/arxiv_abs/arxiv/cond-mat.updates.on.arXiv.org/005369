Waveguides and resonators are core components in the large-scale integration of electronics,
photonics, and phononics, both in existing and future scenarios. In certain situations, there
is critical coupling of the two components; i.e., no energy passes through the waveguide after the
incoming wave couples into the resonator. The transmission spectral characteristics resulting
from this phenomenon are highly advantageous for signal filtering, switching, multiplexing,
and sensing. In the present study, adopting an elastic-wave platform, we introduce topological
insulator (TI), a remarkable achievement in condensed matter physics over the past decade, into
a classical waveguide-ring-resonator configuration. Along with basic similarities with classical
systems, a TI system has important differences and advantages, mostly owing to the spin-momentum
locked transmission states at the TI boundaries. As an example, a two-port TI waveguide resonator
can fundamentally eliminate upstream reflections while completely retaining useful transmission
spectral characteristics, and maximize the energy in the resonator, with possible applications
being novel signal processing, gyro/sensing, lasering, energy harvesting, and intense wave-matter
interactions, using phonons, photons, or even electrons. The present work further enhances the
confidence of using topological protection for practical device performance and functionalities,
especially considering the crucial advantage of introducing (pseudo)spins to existing conventional
configurations. More in-depth research on advancing phononics/photonics, especially on-chip,
is foreseen.
