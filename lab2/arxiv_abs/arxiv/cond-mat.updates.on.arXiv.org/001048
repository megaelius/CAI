In a mean-field description of superfluidity, particle number and gauge angle are treated as quasi-classical
conjugated variables. This level of description was recently used to describe nuclear reactions
around the Coulomb barrier. Important effects of the relative gauge angle between two superfluid
nuclei on transfer probabilities and fusion barrier have been uncovered. A theory making contact
with experiments should at least average over different initial relative gauge-angles. In the
present work, a semi-classical phase-space approach is employed to describe pairing effects beyond
the time-dependent Hartree-Fock Bogoliubov (TDHFB) or TDHF+BCS theory. The method is applied
to a schematic model composed of two pairing Hamiltonians interacting during a short time leading
to transfer of pairs between the two systems. It is shown that a naive phase-space approach, describes
properly some aspects of the pair transfer probability distribution (e.g. its second moments)
but cannot grasp the full complexity of this distribution. Based on this assertion and assuming
that the probability to add or remove one pair dominates over the other channels, we propose a simple
approach to obtain the multiple pair transfer probabilities. This new method, called Phase-Space
combinatorial (PSC) technique. The approach is investigated in cases were the two superfluids
are identical (symmetric reactions) or different (asymmetric reactions). We finally compare
this novel approach to a projection technique on particle number for the collision $^{20}$O+$^{20}$O
at various energies below the Coulomb barrier. Both approaches lead to similar two particles transfer
probabilities. However, the probabilities to transfer more than two pairs are generally found
to be much smaller in the PSC approach compared to the projection case.
