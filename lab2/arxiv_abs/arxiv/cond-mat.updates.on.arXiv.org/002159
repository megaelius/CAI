Amorphous solids, such as glasses, have complex responses to deformations, with significant consequences
in material design and applications. In this respect two intertwined aspects are important: stability
and reversibility. It is crucial to understand on the one hand how a glass may become unstable due
to increased plasticity under shear deformations; on the other hand, to what extent the response
is reversible, meaning how much a system is able to recover the original configuration once the perturbation
is released. Here we focus on assemblies of hard spheres as the simplest model of amorphous solids
such as colloidal glasses and granular matter. We prepare glass states quenched from equilibrium
supercooled liquid states, which are obtained by using the swap Monte Carlo algorithm and correspond
to a wide range of structural relaxation time scales. We exhaustively map out their stability and
reversibility under volume and shear strains, using extensive numerical simulations. The region
on the volume-shear strain phase diagram where the original glass state remains solid is bounded
by the shear-yielding and the shear-jamming lines which meet at a yielding-jamming crossover point.
This solid phase can be further divided into two sub-phases: the stable glass phase where the system
deforms purely elastically and is totally reversible, and the marginal glass phase where it experiences
stochastic plastic deformations at mesoscopic scales and is partially irreversible. The details
of the stability-reversibility map depend strongly on the quality of annealing of the glass. This
study provides a unified framework for understanding elasticity, plasticity, yielding and jamming
in amorphous solids.
