The purpose of continuum plasticity models is to efficiently predict the behavior of structures
beyond their elastic limits. The purpose of multiscale materials science models, among them crystal
plasticity models, is to understand the material behavior and design the material for a given target.
The current successful continuum hyperelastoplastic models are based in the multiplicative decomposition
from crystal plasticity, but significant differences in the computational frameworks of both
approaches remain, making comparisons not straightforward. In previous works we have presented
a theory for multiplicative continuum elastoplasticity which solved many long-standing issues,
preserving the appealing structure of additive infinitesimal Wilkins algorithms. In this work
we extend the theory to crystal plasticity. We show that the new formulation for crystal plasticity
is parallel and comparable to continuum plasticity, preserving the attractive aspects of the framework:
(1) simplicity of the kinematics reaching a parallelism with the infinitesimal framework; (2)
possibility of very large elastic strains and unrestricted type of hyperelastic behavior; (3)
immediate plain backward-Euler algorithmic implementation of the continuum theory avoiding
algorithmically motivated exponential mappings, yet preserving isochoric flow; (4) absence
of Mandel-type stresses in the formulation; (5) objectiveness and weak-invariance by construction
due to the use of flow rules in terms of elastic corrector rates. We compare the results of our crystal
plasticity formulation with the classical formulation from Kalidindi and Anand based on quadratic
strains and an exponential mapping update of the plastic deformation gradient.
