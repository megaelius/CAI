In a quantum spin liquid, the magnetic moments of the constituent electron spins evade classical
long-range order to form an exotic state that is quantum entangled and coherent over macroscopic
length scales [1-2]. Such phases offer promising perspectives for device applications in quantum
information technologies, and their study can reveal fundamentally novel physics in quantum matter.
Quantum spin ice is an appealing proposal of one such state, in which the fundamental ground state
properties and excitations are described by an emergent U(1) lattice gauge theory [3-7]. This quantum-coherent
regime has quasiparticles that are predicted to behave like magnetic and electric monopoles, along
with a gauge boson playing the role of an artificial photon. However, this emergent lattice quantum
electrodynamics has proved elusive in experiments. Here we report neutron scattering measurements
of the rare-earth pyrochlore magnet Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ that provide evidence for a quantum spin
ice ground state. We find a quasi-elastic structure factor with pinch points - a signature of a classical
spin ice - that are partially suppressed, as expected in the quantum-coherent regime of the lattice
field theory at finite temperature. Our result allows an estimate for the speed of light associated
with magnetic photon excitations. We also reveal a continuum of inelastic spin excitations, which
resemble predictions for the fractionalized, topological excitations of a quantum spin ice. Taken
together, these two signatures suggest that the low-energy physics of Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ can be
described by emergent quantum electrodynamics. If confirmed, the observation of a quantum spin
ice ground state would constitute a concrete example of a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid
- a topical state of matter which has so far mostly been explored in lower dimensionalities.
