An indispensable step to understand collective magnetic phenomena in rare-earth compounds is
the determination of spatially-anisotropic single-ion properties resulting from spin-orbit
coupling and crystal electric field (CEF). The CEF Hamiltonian has a discrete energy spectrum --
accessible to spectroscopic probes such as neutron scattering -- controlled by a number of independent
parameters reflecting the point-symmetry of the magnetic sites. Determining these parameters
in low-symmetry systems is often challenging. Here, we describe a general method to analyze CEF
excitation spectra using adjustable effective point-charges. We benchmark our method to existing
neutron-scattering measurements on pyrochlore rare-earth oxides and obtain a universal point-charge
model that describes a large family of related materials. We adapt this model to the newly discovered
tripod Kagome magnets ($R_{3}$Mg$_2$Sb$_{3}$O$_{14}$, $R$ = Tb, Ho, Er, Yb) for which we report
broadband inelastic neutron-scattering spectra. Analysis of these data using adjustable point-charges
yields the CEF wave-functions for each compound. From this, we calculate thermomagnetic properties
that accurately reflect our measurements on powder samples, and predict the effective gyromagnetic
tensor for pseudo-spin degrees of freedom -- a crucial step to understand the exotic collective
properties of these kagome magnets at low temperature. We present further applications of our method
to other tripod kagome materials and triangular rare-earth compounds $R$MgGaO$_4$ ($R$ =Yb, Tm).
Overall, this study establishes a widely applicable methodology to predict CEF and single-ion
properties of rare-earth compounds based on interpretable and adjustable models of effective
point-charges
