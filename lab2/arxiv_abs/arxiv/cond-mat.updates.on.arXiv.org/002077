Accurate identification of chemical phases associated with the electrode and solid electrolyte
interphase (SEI) is critical for understanding and controlling interfacial degradation mechanisms
in lithium containing battery systems. To study these critical battery materials and interfaces
X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a widely used technique that provides quantitative chemical
insights. However, due to the fact that a majority of chemical phases relevant to battery interfaces
are poor electronic conductors, phase identification that relies primarily on absolute XPS core
level binding-energies (BEs) can be problematic. Charging during XPS measurements leads to BE
shifts that can be difficult to correct. These difficulties are often exacerbated by the coexistence
of multiple Li containing phases in the SEI with overlapping XPS core levels. To facilitate accurate
phase identification of battery relevant phases, we propose a straightforward approach for removing
charging effects from XPS data sets. We apply this approach to XPS data sets acquired from six battery
relevant inorganic phases including lithium metal (Li0), lithium oxide (Li2O), lithium peroxide
(Li2O2), lithium hydroxide (LiOH), lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), and lithium nitride (Li3N). Specifically,
we demonstrate that BE separations between core levels present in a particular phase (e.g. BE separation
between the O 1s and Li 1s core levels in Li2O) provide an additional constraint that can significantly
improve reliability of phase identification. Finally, as an exemplary case we apply the charge-correction
methodology to XPS data acquired from a symmetric cell based on a Li2S P2S5 solid electrolyte. This
analysis demonstrates that accurately accounting for XPS BE shifts as a function of current-bias
conditions can provide a direct probe of ionic conductivities associated with battery materials.
