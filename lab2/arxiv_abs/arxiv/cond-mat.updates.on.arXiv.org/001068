In this paper we explore the effects of 3.5 MeV proton irradiation on Fe(Se,Te) thin films grown on
CaF2. In particular, we carry out a systematic experimental investigation with different irradiation
fluences up to 7.30x10^16 cm^-2 and different proton implantation depths, in order to clarify whether
and to what extent the critical current is enhanced or suppressed, what are the effects of irradiation
on the critical temperature, the resistivity and the critical magnetic fields, and finally what
is the role played by the substrate in this context. We find that the effect of irradiation on superconducting
properties is generally small as compared to the case of other iron-based superconductors. Such
effect is more evident on the critical current density Jc, while it is minor on the transition temperature
Tc, on the normal state resistivity and on the upper critical field Hc2 up to the highest fluences
explored in this work. In addition, our analysis shows that when protons implant in the substrate
far from the superconducting film, the critical current can be enhanced up to 50% of the pristine
value at 7 T and 12 K, while there is no appreciable effect on critical temperature and critical fields
together with a slight decrease in resistivity. On the contrary, when the implantation layer is
closer to the film-substrate interface, both critical current and temperature show a decrease
accompanied by an enhancement of the resistivity and the lattice strain. This result evidences
that possible modifications induced by irradiation in the substrate may affect the superconducting
properties of the film via lattice strain. The robustness of the Fe(Se,Te) system to irradiation
induced damage makes it a promising compound for the fabrication of magnets in high-energy accelerators.
