We report properties of topological insulator - ferromagnet - superconductor trilayers comprised
of thin films of 20 nm thick $\rm Bi_2Se_3$ on 10 nm $\rm SrRuO_3$ on 30 nm $\rm YBa_2Cu_3O_x$. As deposited
trilayers are underdoped and have a superconductive transition with $\rm T_c$ onset at 75 K, zero
resistance at 65 K, $\rm T_{Cueri}$ at 150 K and $\rm T^*$ of about 200 K. Further reannealing under
vacuum yields the 60 K phase of $\rm YBa_2Cu_3O_x$ which still has zero resistance below about 40
K. Only when $10\times 100$ micro-bridges were patterned in the trilayer, some of the bridges showed
resistive behavior all the way down to low temperatures. Magnetoresistance versus temperature
of the superconductive ones showed the typical peak due to flux flow against pinning below $\rm T_c$,
while the resistive ones showed only the broad leading edge of such a peak. All this indicates clearly
weak-link superconductivity in the resistive bridges between superconductive $\rm YBa_2Cu_3O_x$
grains via the topological and ferromagnetic cap layers. Comparing our results to those of a reference
trilayer with the topological $\rm Bi_2Se_3$ layer substituted by a non-superconducting highly
overdoped $\rm La_{1.65}Sr_{0.35}CuO_4$, indicates that the superconductive proximity effect
as well as ferromagnetism in the topological trilayer are actually strongly suppressed compared
to the non-topological reference trilayer. This strong suppression is likely to originate in strong
proximity induced edge currents in the SRO/YBCO layer that can lead to Majorana bound states, a possible
signature of which is observed in the present study as zero bias conductance peaks.
