We develop and implement a novel lattice Boltzmann scheme to study multicomponent flows on curved
surfaces, coupling the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations with the Cahn-Hilliard equation
to track the evolution of the binary fluid interfaces. Standard lattice Boltzmann method relies
on regular Cartesian grids, which makes it generally unsuitable to study flow problems on curved
surfaces. To alleviate this limitation, we use a vielbein formalism to write down the Boltzmann
equation on an arbitrary geometry, and solve the evolution of the fluid distribution functions
using a finite difference method. Focussing on the torus geometry as an example of a curved surface,
we demonstrate drift motions of fluid droplets and stripes embedded on the surface of a torus. Interestingly,
they migrate in opposite directions: fluid droplets to the outer side while fluid stripes to the
inner side of the torus. For the latter we demonstrate that the global minimum configuration is unique
for small stripe widths, but it becomes bistable for large stripe widths. Our simulations are also
in agreement with analytical predictions for the Laplace pressure of the fluid stripes, and their
damped oscillatory motion as they approach equilibrium configurations, capturing the corresponding
decay timescale and oscillation frequency. Finally, we simulate the coarsening dynamics of phase
separating binary fluids in the hydrodynamics and diffusive regimes for tori of various shapes,
and compare the results against those for a flat two-dimensional surface. Our lattice Boltzmann
scheme can be extended to other surfaces and coupled to other dynamical equations, opening up a vast
range of applications involving complex flows on curved geometries.
