The recent development of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials has enabled the rapid
exploration of novel low-dimensional electronic phenomena. The family of hexagonal transition
metal dichalcogenides ($H$-$MX_2$) has proven to be a particularly rich host of exotic quantum
phases due to their crystal structure and strong spin-orbit coupling. However, these materials
are often subject to degradation, and for exfoliated materials, reduction in quality during the
fabrication process can constrain the phase space for potential ground states. Here we show that
high-quality $H$-NbS$_2$ monolayers with electronic mobilities more than three orders of magnitude
larger than in bulk $2H$-NbS$_{2}$ can be realized in a bulk single crystal superlattice formed
with a commensurate block layer. We find that these materials are clean-limt 2D superconductors
exhibiting a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition at $T_{BKT} = 0.82$ K and prominent
2D Shubnikov de-Haas quantum oscillations. Furthermore, we observe an enhancement of the superconducting
upper critical field $\mu_0H_{c2}$ beyond the Pauli limit for field applied within a narrow angular
window $\delta \theta \lesssim 2^\circ$ of the layer plane, which we show is consistent with field-induced
finite momentum Cooper pairing enhanced by local symmetry breaking. Our results demonstrate the
ability of these commensurate superlattices to support clean monolayer $H$-$MX_2$ beyond that
possible in their bulk $2H$-$MX_2$ counterparts and monolayers exfoliated therefrom. Their structure
and exfoliability offer pathways to direct probing of pair density wave superconductivity and,
more broadly, the possibility of engineering other high quality 2D $MX_2$ layers in a new class of
bulk single crystal superlattices.
