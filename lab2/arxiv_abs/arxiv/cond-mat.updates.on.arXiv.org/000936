The tunneling decay event of a metastable state in a fully connected quantum spin model can be simulated
efficiently by path integral quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) [Isakov $et~al.$, Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf
117}$, 180402 (2016).]. This is because the exponential scaling with the number of spins of the thermally-assisted
quantum tunneling rate and the Kramers escape rate of QMC are identical [Jiang $et~al.$, Phys. Rev.
A ${\bf 95}$, 012322 (2017).], a result of a dominant instantonic tunneling path. In Ref. [1], it
was also conjectured that the escape rate in open-boundary QMC is quadratically larger than that
of conventional periodic-boundary QMC, therefore, open-boundary QMC might be used as a powerful
tool to solve combinatorial optimization problems. The intuition behind this conjecture is that
the action of the instanton in open-boundary QMC is a half of that in periodic-boundary QMC. Here,
we show that this simple intuition---although very useful in interpreting some numerical results---deviates
from the actual situation in several ways. Using a fully connected quantum spin model, we derive
a set of conditions on the positions and momenta of the endpoints of the instanton, which remove the
extra degrees of freedom due to open boundaries. In comparison, the half-instanton conjecture
incorrectly sets the momenta at the endpoints to zero. We also found that the instantons in open-boundary
QMC correspond to quantum tunneling events in the symmetric subspace (maximum total angular momentum)
at all temperatures, whereas the instantons in periodic-boundary QMC typically lie in subspaces
with lower total angular momenta at finite temperatures. This leads to a lesser than quadratic speedup
at finite temperatures. We also outline the generalization of the instantonic tunneling method
to many-qubit systems without permutation symmetry using spin-coherent-state path integrals.
