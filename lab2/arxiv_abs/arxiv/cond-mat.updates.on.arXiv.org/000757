We study the yielding transition of a two dimensional amorphous system under shear by using a mesoscopic
elasto-plastic model. The model combines a full (tensorial) description of the elastic interactions
in the system, and the possibility of structural reaccommodations that are responsible for the
plastic behavior. The possible structural reaccommodations are encoded in the form of a "plastic
disorder" potential, which is chosen independently at each position of the sample to account for
local heterogeneities. We observe that the stress must exceed a critical value $\sigma_c$ in order
for the system to yield. In addition, when the system yields a flow curve relating stress $\sigma$
and strain rate $\dot\gamma$ of the form $\dot\gamma \sim(\sigma-\sigma_c)^\beta $ is obtained.
Remarkably, we observe the value of $\beta$ to depend on some details of the plastic disorder potential.
For smooth potentials a value of $\beta\simeq 2.0$ is obtained, whereas for potentials obtained
as a concatenation of smooth pieces a value $\beta\simeq 1.5$ is observed in the simulations. This
indicates a dependence of critical behavior on details of the plastic behavior that has not been
pointed out before. In addition, by integrating out non-essential, harmonic degrees of freedom,
we derive a simplified scalar version of the model that represents a collection of interacting Prandtl-Tomlinson
particles. A mean field treatment of this interaction reproduces the difference of $\beta$ exponents
for the two classes of plastic disorder potentials, and provides values of $\beta$ that compare
favorably with those found in the full simulations.
