Brownian motion occurs in a variety of fluids, from rare gases to liquids. The Langevin equation,
describing friction and agitation forces in statistical balance, is one of the most successful
ways to treat the phenomenon. In relatively dense fluids, such as water and air at standard temperature
and pressure, friction is normally treated as a mesoscopic effect arising from the coordinated
viscous action of fluid surrounding the particle. It is often assumed that the friction in denser
fluids obeys Stokes' law. The appropriateness of this assumption involves a discussion of recent
experimental research in the ballistic or "coasting" phase of motion occurring at a very short time
scale. Given the mesoscopic nature of the friction force for relatively dense fluids, we should
expect the agitation force to also be mesoscopic. It has been suggested occasionally that pressure
fluctuations with a well-defined minimum time scale are an appropriate mesoscopic agitation force
for denser fluids. The purpose of this paper is to do that in the simplest possible way. To accomplish
the goal, the simple random walk will be used to approximate the time and space scales below which
ballistic motion begins and diffusive motion ends. Following that, pressure fluctuations and
the associated time scale will be introduced and shown to be consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem describing the statistical balance between agitation and friction. As successful as the
pressure fluctuation model is, it fails for fluids like glycerin that have viscosities a thousand
times and more that of water. A simple phenomenological model of collective fluid motion will be
presented to explain Brownian motion in such fluids.
