Multi-band superconductivity is realized in a plethora of systems, from high-temperature superconductors
to very diluted superconductors. While several properties of multi-band superconductors can
be understood as straightforward generalizations of their single-band counterparts, recent
works have unveiled rather unusual behaviors unique to the former case. In this regard, a regime
that has received significant attention is that near a Lifshitz transition, in which one of the bands
crosses the Fermi level. In this work, we investigate how impurity scattering $\tau^{-1}$ affects
the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}$ across a Lifshitz transition, in the regime
where intra-band pairing is dominant and inter-band pairing is subleading. This is accomplished
by deriving analytic asymptotic expressions for $T_{c}$ and $\partial T_{c}/\partial\tau^{-1}$
in a two-dimensional two-band system. When the inter-band pairing interaction is repulsive, we
find that, despite the incipient nature of the band crossing the Fermi level, inter-band impurity
scattering is extremely effective in breaking Cooper pairs, making $\partial T_{c}/\partial\tau^{-1}$
quickly approach the limiting Abrikosov-Gor'kov value of the high-density regime. In contrast,
when the inter-band pairing interaction is attractive, pair-breaking is much less efficient,
affecting $T_{c}$ only mildly at the vicinity of the Lifshitz transition. The consequence of this
general result is that the behavior of $T_{c}$ across a Lifshitz transition can be qualitatively
changed in the presence of strong enough disorder: instead of displaying a sharp increase across
the Lifshitz transition, as in the clean case, $T_{c}$ can actually display a maximum and be suppressed
at the Lifshitz transition. These results shed new light on the non-trivial role of impurity scattering
in multi-band superconductors.
