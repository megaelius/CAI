We study the effect of disorder on massless, spinful Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions with
attractive interactions, and show that the combination of disorder and attractive interactions
is deadly to the Dirac semimetal phase. First, we derive the zero temperature phase diagram of a clean
Dirac fermion system with tunable doping level ({\mu}) and attraction strength (g). We show that
it contains two phases: a superconductor and a Dirac semimetal. Then, we show that arbitrarily weak
disorder destroys the Dirac semimetal, turning it into a superconductor. We discuss the strength
of the superconductivity for both long range and short range disorder. For long range disorder,
the superconductivity is exponentially weak in the disorder strength. For short range disorder,
a uniform mean field analysis predicts that superconductivity should be doubly exponentially
weak in the disorder strength. However, a more careful treatment of mesoscopic fluctuations suggests
that locally superconducting puddles should form at a much higher temperature, and should establish
global phase coherence at a temperature that is only exponentially small in weak disorder. We also
discuss the effect of disorder on the quantum critical point of the clean system, building in the
effect of disorder through a replica field theory. We show that disorder is a relevant perturbation
to the supersymmetric quantum critical point. We expect that in the presence of attractive interactions,
the flow away from the critical point ends up in the superconducting phase, although firm conclusions
cannot be drawn since the renormalization group analysis flows to strong coupling. We argue that
although we expect the quantum critical point to get buried under a superconducting phase, signatures
of the critical point may be visible in the finite temperature quantum critical regime.
