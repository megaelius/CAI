The interactions between elementary excitations such as phonons, plasmons, magnons, or particle-hole
pairs, drive emergent functionalities and electronic instabilities such as multiferroic behaviour,
anomalous thermoelectric properties, polar order, or superconductivity. Whereas various hybrid
excitations have been studied extensively, the feed-back of prototypical elementary excitations
on the crystal electric fields (CEF), defining the environment in which the elementary excitations
arise, has been explored for very strong coupling only. We report high-resolution neutron spectroscopy
and ab-initio phonon calculations of {\ceaual}, an archetypal fluctuating valence compound.
The high resolution of our data allows us to quantify the energy scales of three coupling mechanisms
between phonons, CEF-split localized 4f electron states, and conduction electrons. Although
these interactions do not appear to be atypically strong for this class of materials, we resolve,
for the first time, a profound renormalization of low-energy quasiparticle excitations on all
levels. The key anomalies of the spectrum we observe comprise (1) the formation of a CEF-phonon bound
state with a comparatively low density of acoustic phonons reminiscent of vibronic modes observed
in other materials, where they require a pronounced abundance of optical phonons, (2) an anti-crossing
of CEF states and acoustic phonons, and (3) a strong broadening of CEF states due to the hybridization
with more itinerant excitations. The fact that all of these features are well resolved in CeAuAl$_3$
suggests that similar hybrid excitations should also be dominant in a large family of related materials.
This promises a predictive understanding towards the discovery of new magneto-elastic functionalities
and instabilities.
