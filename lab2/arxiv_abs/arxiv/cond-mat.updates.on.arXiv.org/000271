Topological Surface States (TSS) represent new types of two dimensional electron systems with
novel and unprecedented properties distinct from any quantum Hall-like or spin-Hall effects.
Their Z$_2$ topological order can be realized at room temperatures without magnetic fields and
they can be turned into magnets, exotic superconductors or Kondo insulators leading to worldwide
interest and activity in the topic. We review the basic concepts defining such topological matter
and the experimental discovery via the key experimental probe that revealed the Z$_2$ topological
order in the bulk of these spin-orbit interaction dominated insulators for the first time. This
review focuses on the key results that demonstrated the fundamental Z$_2$ topological properties
such as spin-momentum locking, non-trivial Berry's phases, mirror Chern number, absence of backscattering,
bulk-boundary correspondence (topology), protection by time-reversal and other discrete (mirror)
symmetries and their remarkable persistence up to the room temperature elaborating on results
first briefly discussed in an early review by M.Z. Hasan and C.L. Kane [Rev. of Mod. Phys., 82, 3045
(2010)]. Additionally, key results on broken symmetry phases such as quantum magnetism and superconductivity
induced in topological materials are briefly discussed. Topological insulators beyond the Z$_2$
classification such as Topological Crystalline Insulators (TCI) are discussed based on their
spin properties (mirror Chern invariants). The experimental methodologies detailed here have
been used in most of the subsequent studies of Z$_2$ topological physics in almost all bulk topological
insulator materials to this date.
