The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction is present in the transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDC) magnets of form $M_{1/3}T$S$_{2}$ ($M$ $=$ 3d transition metal, $T$ $\in$ {Nb, Ta}), given
that the intercalants $M$ form $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ superlattices within the structure
of the parent materials $T$S$_2$ and break the centrosymmetry. Competition between the DM and ferromagnetic
exchange interactions in these systems has been shown to stabilize a topological defect known as
a chiral soliton in select intercalated TMDCs, initiating interest both in terms of fundamental
physics and the potential for technological applications. In the current article, we report on
our study of the materials V$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ and V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, using a combination of x-ray
powder diffraction, magnetization and single crystal neutron diffraction. Historically identified
as ferromagnets, our diffraction results instead reveal that vanadium spins in these compounds
are arranged into an A-type antiferromagnetic configuration at low temperatures. Refined moments
are 1.37(6)$\mu_{B}$ and 1.50(9)$\mu_{B}$ for V$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ and V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, respectively.
Transition temperatures $T_{c}$~$=$~32K for V$_{1/3}$TaS$_{2}$ and 50K for V$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$
are obtained from the magnetization and neutron diffraction results. We attribute the small net
magnetization observed in the low-temperature phases to a subtle ($\sim$2$^{\circ}$) canting
of XY-spins in the out-of-plane direction. These new results are indicative of dominant antiferromagnetic
exchange interactions between the vanadium moments in adjacent ab-planes, likely eliminating
the possibility of identifying stable chiral solitons in the current materials.
