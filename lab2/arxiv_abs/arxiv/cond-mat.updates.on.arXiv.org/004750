Over 90 % of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. Related work thus responds to major societal
demand. This study is of water-gas shift on platinum for hydrogen production. The close-packed
Pt(111) surface catalyses this process. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation.
This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting
but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described
by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, this work adopts Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology. QMC is
a stochastic approach to solving the Schr\"odinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous
systems involving solids. The present work considers co-adsorption of water and carbon monoxide
on Pt(111). The water is partially dissociated while its oxygen atom binds to CO losing a hydrogen
atom. This concerted step is rate-limiting. The resulting adsorbed formate species then decomposes
to readily eliminated carbon dioxide and the clean-fuel product is H$_2$. The Transition-State
geometry can be optimized using molecular Quantum Monte Carlo force constants, on the basis of our
earlier work using the CASINO software. Our embedded active site approach is used. This allows a
high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves
and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function
is used to guide the Quantum Monte Carlo calculation. Results are given here on mechanism and QMC
activation barrier for water addition to CO pre-adsorbed on Pt(111) of 17 +/- 0.2 c.f. apparent measured
value of 17.05 kcal/mol. They are encouraging for investigating similar or complex catalytic systems.
