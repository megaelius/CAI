The dissolution of liquid nanodroplets is a crucial step in many applied processes, such as separation
and dispersion in food industry, crystal formation of pharmaceutical products, concentrating
and analysis in medical diagnosis, and drug delivery in aerosols. In this work, using both experiments
and numerical simulations, we \textit{quantitatively} study the dissolution dynamics of femtoliter
surface droplets in a highly ordered array under a uniform flow. Our results show that the dissolution
of femoliter droplets strongly depends on their spatial positions relative to the flow direction,
drop-to-drop spacing in the array, and the imposed flow rate. In some particular case, the droplet
at the edge of the array can dissolve about 30% faster than the ones located near the centre. The dissolution
rate of the droplet increases by 60% as the inter-droplet spacing is increased from 2.5 $\mu$m to
20 $\mu$m. Moreover, the droplets close to the front of flow commence to shrink earlier than those
droplets in the center of the array. The average dissolution rate is faster for faster flow. As a result,
the dissolution time $T_{i}$ decreases with the Reynolds number Re of the flow as $T_{i}\propto
Re^{-3/4}$. The experimental results are in good agreement with numerical simulations where the
advection-diffusion equation for the concentration field is solved and the concentration gradient
on the surface of the drop is computed. The findings suggest potential approaches to manipulate
nanodroplet sizes in droplet arrays simply by dissolution controlled by an external flow. The obtained
droplets with varying curvatures may serve as templates for generating multifocal microlens in
one array.
