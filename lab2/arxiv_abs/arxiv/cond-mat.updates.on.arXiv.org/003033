QuantumATK is an integrated set of atomic-scale modelling tools developed since 2003 by professional
software engineers in collaboration with academic researchers. While different aspects and individual
modules of the platform have been previously presented, the purpose of this paper is to give a general
overview of the platform. The simulation engines included in the QuantumATK platform enable electronic-structure
calculations using density functional theory or tight-binding model Hamiltonians, and also offers
bonded or reactive empirical force fields in many different parametrizations. Density functional
theory is implemented using either a plane-wave basis or expansion of electronic states in a linear
combination of atomic orbitals. The platform includes a long list of advanced modules, including
Green's function methods for electron transport simulations and surface calculations, first-principles
electron-phonon and electron-photon couplings, simulation of atomic-scale heat transport,
ion dynamics, spintronics, optical properties of materials, static polarization, and more. Seamless
integration of the different simulation engines into a common platform allows for easy combination
of different simulation methods into complex workflows. Besides giving a general overview and
presenting a number of implementation details not previously published, we also present four different
application examples. These are calculation of phonon limited mobility of Cu, Ag and Au, electron
transport in a gated 2D device, multi-model simulation of lithium ion drift through a battery cathode
in an external electric field, and electronic-structure calculations of the composition-dependent
band gap of SiGe alloys.
