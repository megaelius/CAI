Oligothiophenes are pi-conjugated semiconducting and fluorescent molecules whose self-assembly
properties are widely investigated for application in organic electronics, optoelectronics,
biophotonics and sensing. We report here an approach to the preparation of crystalline oli-gothiophene
nano/micro-fibers based on the use of a sulfur overrich quaterthiophene building block, -T4S4-,
containing in its covalent network all the information needed to promote the di-rectional, pi-pi
stacking driven, self-assembly of Ar-T4S4-Ar oligomers into fibers with hierar-chical supramolecular
arrangement from nano- to microscale. We show that when Ar varies from unsubstituted thiophene
to thiophene substituted with electron withdrawing groups, a wide redistribution of the molecular
electronic charge takes place without substantially affecting the aggregation modalities of
the oligomer. In this way a structurally comparable series of fibers is obtained having progressively
varying optical properties, redox potentials, photoconductivity and type of prevailing charge
carriers (from p- to n-type). A thorough characterization of the fi-bers based on SEM, CD, CV, X-ray
diffraction, UV-vis and PL spectroscopies, photoconductivi-ty and KPFM measurements is reported.
With the aid of DFT calculations, combined with X-ray data, a model accounting for the growth of the
fibers from molecular to nano- and microscale is proposed. We believe that the simple strategy outlined
in this study allows to establish a straightforward correlation between the molecular structure
of the components and the function-al properties of the corresponding self-assembled nano/micro-fibers.
