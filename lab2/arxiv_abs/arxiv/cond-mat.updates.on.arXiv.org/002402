Calcium sulfate minerals are found under the form of three crystalline phases: gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O),
bassanite (CaSO4.0.5H2O), and anhydrite (CaSO4). Due to its relevance in natural and industrial
processes, the formation pathways of these calcium sulphate phases from aqueous solution have
been the subject of intensive research. There is a growing body of literature, that calcium sulfate
forms essentially through a non-classical nanoparticle- or cluster-mediated crystallisation
process. At the early stages of precipitation calcium sulfate crystals grow through the reorganization
and coalescence of aggregates rather than through classical unit addition. Here, we show by using
low-dose dark field (DF) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron diffraction, that
these re-structuring processes by no means continue until a near-perfectly homogeneous single
crystal is obtained. Instead the growth process yields a final imperfect mesocrystal of the overall
morphology resembling that of a single crystal, yet composed of smaller nano-domains. Hence, our
data indicate that organic-free mesocrystal grown by a particle mediated-pathway may preserve
a 'memory or 'imprint' of the non-classical growth process in the final crystal structure, something
that has been largely overlooked until now. Furthermore, the nano-scale misalignment of the structural
sub-units within crystals might propagate through the length-scales, and potentially is expressed
macroscopically as misaligned zones/domains in large single crystals, e.g. as those observed
in some of the giant crystals from the Naica Mine, Chihuahua, Mexico.
