Quantum-mechanical fluctuations between competing phases at $T=0$ induce exotic finite-temperature
collective excitations that are not described by the standard Landau Fermi liquid framework. These
excitations exhibit anomalous temperature dependences, or non-Fermi liquid behavior, in the
transport and thermodynamic properties in the vicinity of a quantum critical point, and are often
intimately linked to the appearance of unconventional Cooper pairing as observed in strongly correlated
systems including the high-$T_c$ cuprate and iron pnictide superconductors. The presence of superconductivity,
however, precludes direct access to the quantum critical point, and makes it difficult to assess
the role of quantum-critical fluctuations in shaping anomalous finite-temperature physical
properties, such as Planckian dissipation $\hbar/\tau_{p} =k_{B}T$. Here we report temperature-field
scale invariance of non-Fermi liquid thermodynamic, transport and Hall quantities in a non-superconducting
iron-pnictide, Ba(Fe$_{1/3}$Co$_{1/3}$Ni$_{1/3}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$, indicative of quantum
criticality at zero temperature and zero applied magnetic field. Beyond a linear in temperature
resistivity, the hallmark signature of strong quasiparticle scattering, we find a more universal
Planck-limited scattering rate that obeys a scaling relation between temperature and applied
magnetic fields down to the lowest energy scales. Together with the emergence of hole-like carriers
close to the zero-temperature and zero-field limit, the scale invariance, isotropic field response
and lack of applied pressure sensitivity point to the realization of a novel quantum fluid predicted
by the holographic correspondence and born out of a unique quantum critical system that does not
drive a pairing instability.
