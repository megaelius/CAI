There appears to be a longtime, very slowly evolving state in dense simple fluids which, for high
enough density, approaches a glassy nonergodic state. The nature of the nonergodic state can be
characterized by the associated static equilibrium state. In particular, systems driven by Smoluchowski
or Newtonian dynamics share the same static equilibrium and nonergodic states. That these systems
share the same nonergodic states is a highly nontrivial statement and requires establishing a number
of results. In the high-density regime one finds that an equilibrating system decays via a three-step
process identified in mode-coupling theory (MCT). For densities greater than a critical density
one has time-power-law decay with exponents a and b. There are sets of linear fluctuation dissipation
relations (FDRs) which connect the cumulants of these two fields. The form of the FDRs is the same
for both Smoluchowski or Newtonian dynamics. While we show this universality of nonergodic states
within perturbation theory, we expect it to be true more generally. The nature of the approach to
the nonergodic state has been suggested by MCT. It has been a point of contention that MCT is a phenomenological
theory and not a systematic theory with prospects for improvement. Recently a systematic theory
has been developed. It naturally allows one to calculate self-consistently density cumulants
in a perturbation expansion in a pseudo-potential. At leading order one obtains a kinetic kernel
quadratic in the density. This is a "one-loop" theory like MCT. At this one-loop level one finds vertex
corrections which depend on the three-point equilibrium cumulants. Here we assume these vertex-corrections
can be ignored and focus on the higher-order loops. We show that one can sum up all of the loop contributions.
The higher-order loops do not change the nonergodic state parameters substantially.
