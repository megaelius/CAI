Experimental investigations of surface forces generally involve two solid bodies of simple and
well-defined geometry interacting across a medium. Direct measurement of their surface interaction
can be interpreted to reveal fundamental physics in confinement, i.e. independent of the particular
geometry. However real solids are deformable - they can change shape due to their mutual interaction
- and this can influence force measurements. These aspects are frequently not considered, and remain
poorly understood. We have performed experiments in a dry atmosphere and across an ionic liquid
with a Surface Force Balance (SFB), combining measurement of the surface interactions and simultaneous
in-situ characterization of the geometry. First we find that, whilst the variation of the contact
radius with the force across dry nitrogen can be interpreted by the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR)
model, for the (ionic) liquid it is well described only by the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model.
Secondly, we find that mica does not only bend but also experiences a compression. By performing
experiments with substantially thicker mica than usual we were able to investigate this with high
precision, and find compression of order 1 nm with 7 um mica. These findings imply that, in some cases
structural forces measured across nanoconfined liquids must be interpreted as a convolution of
the surface forces across the liquid and the mechanical response of the confining solids. We discuss
the influence of mica thickness, and propose a scaling criterion to distinguish situations where
the solid deformation is negligible and when it is dominant.
