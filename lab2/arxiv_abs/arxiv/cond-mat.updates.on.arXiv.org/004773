The Perdew-Zunger(PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) was designed to correct the one-electron
limit of any approximate density functional for the exchange-correlation (xc) energy, while yielding
no correction to the exact functional. Unfortunately, it spoils the slowly-varying-in-space
limits of the uncorrected approximate functionals, where those functionals are right by construction.
The right limits can be restored by locally scaling down the energy density of the PZ SIC in many-electron
regions, but then a spurious correction to the exact functional would be found unless the self-Hartree
and exact self-xc terms of the PZ SIC energy density were expressed in the same gauge. Only the local
density approximation satisfies the same-gauge condition for the energy density, which explains
why the recent local-scaling SIC (LSIC) is found here to work excellently for atoms and molecules
only with this basic approximation, and not with the more advanced generalized gradient approximations
(GGAs) and meta-GGAs, which lose the Hartree gauge via simplifying integrations by parts. The transformation
of energy density that achieves the Hartree gauge for the exact xc functional can also be applied
to approximate functionals. Doing so leads to a simple scaled-down self-interaction (sdSIC) correction
that is typically much more accurate than PZ SIC in tests for many molecular properties (including
equilibrium bond lengths). The present work shows unambiguously that the largest errors of PZ SIC
applied to standard functionals at three levels of approximation can be removed by restoring their
correct slowly-varying-density limits. It also confirms the relevance of these limits to atoms
and molecules.
