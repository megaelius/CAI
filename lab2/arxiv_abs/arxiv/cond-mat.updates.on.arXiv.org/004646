Motivated by the need to understand and simulate the ubiquitous experimentally-observed zero-bias
conductance peaks in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures, we theoretically investigate
the tunneling conductance spectra in one-dimensional nanowires in proximity to superconductors
in a systematic manner taking into account several different physical mechanisms producing zero-bias
conductance peaks. The mechanisms we consider are the presence of quantum dots, inhomogeneous
potential, random disorder in the chemical potential, random fluctuations in the superconducting
gap, and in the effective $g$ factor with the self-energy renormalization induced by the parent
superconductor in both short ($L\sim1~\mu$m) and long nanowires ($L\sim3~\mu$m). We classify
all foregoing theoretical results for zero-bias conductance peaks into three types: the good,
the bad, and the ugly, according to the physical mechanisms producing the zero-bias peaks and their
topological properties. We find that, although the topological Majorana zero modes are immune
to weak disorder, strong disorder (ugly) completely suppresses topological superconductivity
and generically leads to trivial zero bias peaks. Compared qualitatively with the extensive existing
experimental results in the superconductor-semiconductor nanowire structures, we conclude
that most current experiments are likely exploring trivial zero-bias peaks in the ugly situation
dominated by strong disorder. We also study the nonlocal end-to-end correlation measurement in
both the short and long wires, and point out the limitation of the nonlocal correlation in ascertaining
topological properties particularly when applied to short wires. The goal of the work is to establish
with a very high confidence level the real physical possibility that essentially all experimentally
observed zero bias peaks in Majorana nanowires are most likely ugly.
