In capillary-driven fluid dynamics, simple departures from equilibrium offer the chance to quantitatively
model the resulting relaxations. These dynamics in turn provide insight on both practical and fundamental
aspects of thin-film hydrodynamics. In this work, we describe a model trilayer dewetting experiment
elucidating the effect of solid, no-slip confining boundaries on the bursting of a liquid film in
a viscous environment. This experiment was inspired by an industrial polymer processing technique,
multilayer coextrusion, in which thousands of alternating layers are stacked atop one another.
When pushed to the nanoscale limit, the individual layers are found to break up on time scales shorter
than the processing time. To gain insight on this dynamic problem, we here directly observe the growth
rate of holes in the middle layer of the trilayer films described above, wherein the distance between
the inner film and solid boundary can be orders of magnitude larger than its thickness. In otherwise
identical experimental conditions, thinner films break up faster than thicker ones. This observation
is found to agree with a scaling model that balances capillary driving power and viscous dissipation
with, crucially, a no-slip boundary condition at the solid substrate/viscous environment boundary.
In particular, even for the thinnest middle-layers, no finite-size effect is needed to explain
the data. The dynamics of hole growth is captured by a single master curve over four orders of magnitude
in the dimensionless hole radius and time, and is found to agree well with predictions including
analytic expressions for the dissipation.
