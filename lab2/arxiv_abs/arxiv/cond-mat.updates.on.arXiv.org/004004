Spin-dependent charge transport in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) can be manipulated by a temperature
gradient, which can be utilized for spintronic and spin caloritronic applications. Evaluation
of the thermally induced phenomena requires knowledge of the temperature differences across the
oxide tunnel barrier adjacent to the ferromagnetic (FM) leads. However, it is challenging to accurately
measure thermal properties of an oxide tunnel barrier consisting of only a few atomic layers. In
this work, we experimentally interrogate the temperature evolutions in Ru/oxide/FM/seed/MgO
(oxide=MgO, MgAl2O4; FM=Co, CoFeB; seed=Pt, Ta) structures having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
using ultrafast thermometry. The Ru layer is optically thick and heated by ultrafast laser pulses;
the subsequent temperature changes are monitored using thermoreflectance of Ru and magneto-optic
Kerr effect (MOKE) of the FM layers. We independently measure the response times of Co and CoFeB magnetism
using quadratic MOKE and obtain {\tau}em=0.2 ps for Co and 2 ps for CoFeB. These time scales are much
shorter than the time scale of heat transport through the oxide tunnel barrier, which occurs at 10-3000
ps. We determine effective thermal conductivities of MgO and MgAl2O4 tunnel barriers in the range
of 0.4-0.6 W m-1 K-1, comparable to an estimate of the series conductance of the Ru/oxide and oxide/FM
interfaces and an order of magnitude smaller than the thermal conductivity of MgO thin films. We
find that the electron-phonon thermal conductance near the tunnel barrier is only a factor of 5-12
larger than the thermal conductance of the oxide tunnel barrier. Therefore, the drop in the electronic
temperature is approximately 20-30% larger than the drop in the phonon temperature across the tunnel
barrier.
