As a magnetic Weyl semimetal, Co3Sn2S2 integrates the flat bands of correlated d-electrons on the
kagome lattice into the topological band structure and exhibits remarkable properties such as
the giant anomalous Hall/Nernst effect, chiral-anomaly, surface-termination dependent Fermi
arcs, topological catalysis, flat band Berry phase and orbital magnetism. Probing the nature of
the magnetism in Co3Sn2S2 is thus crucial for understanding the physical origin, implications,
as well as the control of the emergent novel phenomena through manipulation of magnetic order. Here,
using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) combined with first-principle
calculations, we study the layer-resolved magnetic behaviors and localized spin-orbit polaron
in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2. We find that the Sn-terminated surface has a nonzero spin-polarization
antiparallel to that of the Co3Sn layer, while the S-terminated surface is nonmagnetic. On the S-terminated
surface, we observe bound magnetic polarons localized around single-S vacancies with a three-fold
rotation symmetry, a polarization antiparallel to the magnetization of the Sn surface, and formed
out of the correlated d-electron orbitals in the Co3Sn plane. Studying their response to external
magnetic field up to 6 T reveals an anomalous Zeeman effect, indicating a dominant orbital contribution,
in contrast to bound magnetic polarons in dilute magnetic semiconductors. We term this new excitation
as a bound spin-orbit polaron (SOP). Our findings suggest that engineering of single-S atomic vacancies
in S-deficient Co3Sn2S2-x may offer a new direction to enhance magnetism in a controlled fashion
through the bound SOP.
