First, we reformulate RG transformations in a recursive way with introduction of an order-parameter
field. As a result, we manifest the RG flow of an effective field theory through the emergence of an
extra dimensional space, where both RG $\beta-$functions of coupling functions and RG flow equation
of the order-parameter field appear in the resulting effective action explicitly through the extra
dimensional space. Second, we consider an effective dual holographic description derived recently,
where the classical gravity theory of the large $N$ limit takes into account quantum corrections
in the all-loop order. This non-perturbative nature turns out to originate from an intertwined
renormalization structure between both RG flow equations of coupling functions and order-parameter
fields in the emergent extra-dimensional space, where the IR boundary condition of the order-parameter
field gives rise to a mean-field equation with fully renormalized interaction coefficients. Third,
comparing the RG-reformulated effective field theory with this effective dual holographic description,
we obtain term-by-term matching conditions in the level of an effective action. As a result, we express
all RG coefficients of fields and interaction vertices in terms of the metric tensor of the dual holographic
theory. Through this metric reformulation for the RG analysis, we propose a prescription on how
to find RG $\beta-$functions of interaction coefficients in a non-perturbative way beyond the
perturbative RG analysis. In particular, we claim that the present prescription of the RG flow generalizes
the holographic RG flow of the holographic duality conjecture towards the absence of conformal
symmetry, where the emergent holographic dual effective field theory has been derived from the
first principle, thus being applicable even away from quantum criticality.
