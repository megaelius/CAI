Room and high temperature mechanical properties of reactive magnetron sputtered TaSiN coatings
were measured using nanoindentation (between 25C and 500C). Fracture toughness was also evaluated
at a similar temperature range using the micropillar splitting method. The influence of the nitrogen
concentration on the evolving phases and microstructure of the TaSiN coatings, before and after
the high temperature testing, were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis. XRD spectra showed broad peaks with hexagonal $\gamma$-Ta2N as the
main phase, with the cubic $\delta$-TaN phase emerging for higher N contents. Phase composition
remained unchanged before and after the 500C tests. However, after the high temperature tests,
TEM analysis showed the presence of an oxide surface layer, with a thickness that decreased (from
42 to 15 nm) with N content, due to residual oxygen diffusion, which replaces nitrogen to form amorphous
SiOx. Beneath the oxide-rich surface layer, coatings exhibited a stable nanocrystalline columnar
microstructure. Hardness and fracture toughness increased with N content, initially due to the
formation of an amorphous Si-N tissue at grain boundaries, and for even higher N contents, due to
the appearance of the hard cubic $\delta$-TaN phase. Hardness at 500C decreased only by 15%, while
fracture toughness followed the opposite trend, due to increased plasticity with temperature.
The optimum composition turned out to be Ta55Si10N35, which retained a hardness of 30 GPa at 500C,
being also the toughest. These observations make this system very interesting for high temperature
applications.
