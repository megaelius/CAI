There is a growing family of rare-earth kagome materials with dominant nearest-neighbor interactions
and strong spin orbit coupling. The low symmetry of these materials makes theoretical description
complicated, with six distinct nearest-neighbor coupling parameters allowed. In this Article,
we ask what kinds of classical, ordered, ground states can be expected to occur in these materials,
assuming generic (i.e. non-fine-tuned) sets of exchange parameters. We show that there are only
five distinct classical ground state phases occurring for generic parameters. The five phases
are: (i) a coplanar, 2-fold degenerate, state with vanishing magnetization (${\sf A_1}$), (ii)
a noncoplanar, 2-fold degenerate, state with magnetization perpendicular to the kagome plane
(${\sf A_2}$), (iii) a coplanar, 6-fold degenerate, state with magnetization lying within the
kagome plane (${\sf E}$-coplanar), (iv) a noncoplanar, 6-fold degenerate, state with magnetization
lying within a mirror plane of the lattice (${\sf E}$-noncoplanar$_{6}$), (v) a noncoplanar, 12-fold
degenerate, state with magnetization in an arbitrary direction (${\sf E}$-noncoplanar$_{12}$).
All five are translation invariant (${\bf q}=0$) states. The state ${\sf E}$-noncoplanar$_{12}$
is extremely rare, occupying $<1\%$ of the full phase diagram, so for practical purposes there are
four main ordered states likely to occur in anisotropic kagome magnets with dominant nearest neighbor
interactions. These results can aid in interpreting recent experiments on "tripod kagome" systems
R$_3$A$_2$Sb$_3$O$_{14}$, as well as materials closer to the isotropic limit such as Cr- and Fe-
jarosites.
