Ultradilute quantum droplets are intriguing new state of matter, in which the attractive mean-field
force can be balanced by the repulsive force from quantum fluctuations to avoid collapse. Here,
we present a microscopic theory of ultradilute quantum droplets in three-, one- and two-dimensional
two-component Bose-Bose mixtures, by generalizing the conventional Bogoliubov theory to include
the bosonic pairing arising from the interspecies attraction. Our pairing theory is fully equivalent
to a variational approach and hence gives an upper bound for the energy of quantum droplets. In three
dimensions, we predict the existence of a strongly interacting Bose droplet at the crossover from
Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) to Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superfluids and map out
the bosonic BEC-BCS crossover phase diagram. In one dimension, we find that the energy of the one-dimensional
Bose droplet calculated by the pairing theory is in an excellent agreement with the latest diffusion
Monte Carlo simulation {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{122}, 105302 (2019){]}, for nearly all the
interaction strengths at which quantum droplets exist. In two dimensions, we show that Bose droplets
disappear and may turn into a soliton-like many-body bound state, when the interspecies attraction
exceeds a critical value. Below the threshold, the pairing theory predicts more or less the same
results as the Bogoliubov theory derived by Petrov and Astrakharchik {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{117},
100401 (2016){]}. The predicted energies from both theories are higher than the diffusion Monte
Carlo results, due to the weak interspecies attraction and the increasingly important role played
by the beyond-Bogoliubov-approximation effect in two dimensions.
