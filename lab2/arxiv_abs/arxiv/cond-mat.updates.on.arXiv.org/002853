Temperature dependencies for concentration and the Hall mobility of electrons for the $\textit{n}$-$\text{Ge}
\langle \text{Sb}\rangle$ and \linebreak $\textit{n}$-$\text{Ge} \langle \text{Sb, Au}\rangle$
single crystals uniaxially deformed along the crystallographic directions [100] and [111] are
obtained on the basis of piezo-Hall effect measurements. A deformation-induced increase of the
Hall mobility of electrons for $\textit{n}$-$\text{Ge} \langle \text{Sb, Au}\rangle$ single
crystals at the uniaxial pressure along the crystallographic direction [100] has been revealed.
A comparison of the obtained experimental results with the corresponding theoretical calculations
of temperature dependencies of the Hall mobility showed that the obtained effect occurs at the expense
of the reduction probability of electron scattering on the fluctuational potential. Its amplitude
depends on the tempe\-rature and on the value of the uniaxial pressure. It has also been shown that
an increase of the Hall mobility for the $\textit{n}$-$\text{Ge} \langle \text{Sb, Au}\rangle$
single crystals uniaxially deformed along the crystallographic direction [111] with an increasing
temperature turns out to be insignificant and is observed only for the uniaxial pressures $P<0.28$
GPa. A decrease of the Hall mobility of electrons at the expense of the deformational redistribution
of electrons among the valleys of the germanium conduction band with different mobility should
be taken into account in the present case. The Hall mobility magnitude for the uniaxially deformed
$\textit{n}$-$\text{Ge} \langle \text{Sb}\rangle$ single crystals is determined only by the
mechanisms of phonon scattering and we have not observed the effect of the growth of the Hall mobility
with an increase of temperature or the magnitude of uniaxial pressure.
