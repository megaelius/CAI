Ferroelectric switching is unambigiously demonstrated for the first time in a III-V semiconductor
based material: AlScN -- A discovery which could help to satisfy the urgent demand for thin film ferroelectrics
with high performance and good technological compatibility with generic semiconductor technology
which arises from a multitude of memory, micro/nano-actuator and emerging applications based
on controlling electrical polarization. The appearance of ferroelectricity in AlScN can be related
to the continuous distortion of the original wurtzite-type crystal structure towards a layered-hexagonal
structure with increasing Sc content and tensile strain, which is expected to be extendable to other
III-nitride based solid solutions. Coercive fields which are systematically adjustable by more
than 3 MV/cm, high remnant polarizations in excess of 100 \mu C/cm$^2$ which constitute the first
experimental estimate of the previously inaccessible spontaneous polarization in a III-nitride
based material, an almost ideally square-like hysteresis resulting in excellent piezoelectric
linearity over a wide strain interval from -0.3% to +0.4% as well as a paraelectric transition temperature
in excess of 600{\deg}C are confirmed. This intriguing combination of properties is to our knowledge
as of now unprecedented in the field of polycrystalline ferroelectric thin films and promises to
significantly advance the commencing integration of ferroelectric functionality to micro- and
nanotechnology, while at the same time providing substantial insight to one of the central open
questions of the III-nitride semiconductors - that of their actual spontaneous polarization.
