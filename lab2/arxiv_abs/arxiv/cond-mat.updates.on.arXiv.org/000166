We present a thorough analysis of soliton solutions to the quasi-one-dimensional zigzag and armchair
nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE) for a Bose-Einstein condensate in a honeycomb lattice. The two
types of NLDEs correspond to quasi-one-dimensional reductions in two independent directions,
in direct analogy to the narrowest of graphene nanoribbons. We analyze the solution space of the
quasi-one-dimensional NLDE by finding fixed points, delineating the various regions in solution
space, and through an invariance relation which we obtain as a first integral of the NLDE. For both
the zigzag and armchair geometries we obtain spatially oscillating multi-soliton as well as asymptotically
flat single soliton solutions using five different methods: by direct integration; an invariance
relation; parametric transformation; a series expansion; and by numerical shooting. By tuning
the ratio of the chemical potential to the nonlinearity for a fixed value of the Dirac spinor kinetic
energy, we can obtain both bright and dark solitons over a nonzero background. The density contrast
between the dark (bright) soliton notch (peak) and the background is about 2/3 (3/1). For both soliton
types, we compute the discrete spectra for several spatially quantized states in a harmonic potential.
We interpret our solitons as topologically protected domain walls in a quasi-one-dimensional
system which separate distinct regions of pseudospin-$1/2$ with $S_z = \pm 1/2$. By solving the
relativistic linear stability equations we obtain the low-energy spectrum for excitations in
the bulk region far from the soliton core and for bound states in the core and find that excitations
occur as spin waves and as a Nambu-Goldstone mode. For a Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$
atoms, we find that our soliton solutions are stable on time scales relevant to experiments.
