We analyzed the effects of a spin voltage as well as a conventionally applied voltage in a QD system
with a different number of quantum states in the dot region in presence of Coulombic interaction
between the quantum dot and two leads. We extended the NEGF treatment developed for noninteracting
leads onto the case of four quantum states $m =\{\sigma,\lambda\}=\{\pm,\pm\}$ interacting with
leads. Our derivation is based on the equation-of-motion technique and Langreth's theorem. For
a Coulombic repulsion between the contacts and QD we obtain an expression for the current through
QD for the four quantum states. To determine the parameters of the model Hamiltonian we used our previous
calculations [1] of the electronic properties of a symmetrical nanotube QD (5,5)/(10,0)\_1/(5,5)
in a tight binding model, where \_1 denotes the length of the middle QD segment of a (10,0) zigzag nanotube.
We calculated the density of electronic states with spin up and down for the case of a single QD without
pseudospin states for an infinite Coulomb repulsion, in good agreement with the calculations of
Yuan Li, et al. [2]. Our calculation showed that the position of the conductance peaks nearest to
zero is not affected by the strength of the QD-lead Coulombic interaction parameters. We also demonstrated
that this interaction shifts the density of states to higher energies. The interplay between the
Kondo effect and the bias is highly temperature-dependent and becomes significant only at low temperatures.
Lastly, we found that the existence of four quantum states $m=\{\sigma,\lambda\}$ leads to abrupt
changes in the density of states. In this case the values of the current are approximately ten times
lower than for QD with only two quantum states $m =\{\sigma\}=\{\pm\}$. However, in the case of a
conventional bias the current amplitudes in both cases are approximately the same.
