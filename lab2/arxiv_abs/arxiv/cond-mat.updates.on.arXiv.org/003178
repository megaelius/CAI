Standard flavors of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations are known to fail in describing
anions, due to large self-interaction errors. The problem may be circumvented by using localized
basis sets of reduced size, leaving no variational flexibility for the extra electron to delocalize.
Alternatively, a recent approach exploiting DFT evaluations of total energies on electronic densities
optimized at the Hartree-Fock (HF) level has been reported, showing that the self-interaction-free
HF densities are able to lead to an improved description of the additional electron, returning affinities
in close agreement with the experiments. Nonetheless, such an approach can fail when the HF densities
are too inaccurate. Here, an alternative approach is presented, in which an embedding environment
is used to stabilize the anion in a bound configuration. Similarly to the HF case, when computing
total energies at the DFT level on these corrected densities, electron affinities in very good agreement
with experiments can be recovered. The effect of the environment can be evaluated and removed by
an extrapolation of the results to the limit of vanishing embedding. Moreover, the approach can
be easily applied to DFT calculations with delocalized basis sets, e.g. plane-waves, for which
alternative approaches are either not viable or more computationally demanding. The proposed
extrapolation strategy can be thus applied also to extended systems, as often studied in condensed-matter
physics and materials science, and we illustrate how the embedding environment can be exploited
to determine the energy of an adsorbing anion - here a chloride ion on a metal surface - whose charge
configuration would be incorrectly predicted by standard density functionals.
