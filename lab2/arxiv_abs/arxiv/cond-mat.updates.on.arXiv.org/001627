Diffusion in ternary, multiphase systems was studied theoretically and experimentally in Ni-Cr-Al
system at 1200C. The samples were prepared by the multiple method. It has been shown that the method
allows obtaining good quality, planar, reproducible and oxide-free diffusion couples. For the
first time the concentration profiles were measured by the wide-line EDS analysis. Two models were
applied: 1) multi-phase multi-component model based on the bivelocity method in R1 and 2) dual-scale
two-phase model, that includes interdiffusion in matrix (global scale in R1) and the diffusion
between matrix and precipitates (local scale in R3). The models were used in numerical experiments
in which the diffusion paths, the local entropy production rate and the volume fractions of the phases
present in the system were calculated. For the first time the Kirkendall plane shift in two-phase
system was computed and compared with experimental findings. It has been shown that both models
are consistent. The multi-phase, multi-component model was applied to simulate diffusion and
the results were compared with experiment. Experimental and numerical results are in agreement.
It has been found that: 1) the type 0 interphase boundary (IB) moves during diffusion, contrary to
the Morral theorem, 2) in the case when the terminal compositions of the two-phase alloys are close
to the phase boundary then the single beta-phase zone can grow between two-phase zones and diffusion
path enters the single-phase region, 3) the diffusion path strongly depends on the shape of the phase
boundary line and the accuracy of thermodynamical data is a key factor in modelling and 4) the recently
reported occurrence of the local extrema in the distribution of entropy production at the IBs is
a result of numerical errors and can be eliminated as is shown in dual-scale two-phase model.
