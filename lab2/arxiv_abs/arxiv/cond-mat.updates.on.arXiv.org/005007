We present a general theory of classical metastability in open quantum systems. Metastability
is a consequence of a large separation in timescales in the dynamics, leading to the existence of
a regime when states of the system appear stationary, before eventual relaxation towards a true
stationary state at much larger times. In this work, we focus on the emergence of classical metastability,
i.e., when metastable states of an open quantum system with separation of timescales can be approximated
as probabilistic mixtures of a finite number of states. We find that a number of classical features
follow from this approximation, for both the manifold of metastable states and long-time dynamics
between them. Namely, those states are approximately disjoint and thus play the role of metastable
phases, and the relaxation towards the stationary state is approximated by a classical stochastic
dynamics between them. Importantly, the classical dynamics is observed not only on average, but
also at the level of individual quantum trajectories: we show that time coarse-grained continuous
measurement records can be viewed as noisy classical trajectories, while their statistics can
be approximated by that of the classical dynamics. Among others, this explains how first-order
dynamical phase transitions arise from metastability. Finally, in order to verify the presence
of classical metastability in a given open quantum system, we develop an efficient numerical approach
that delivers the set of metastable phases together with the effective classical dynamics. Since
the proximity to a first-order dissipative phase transition manifests as metastability, the theory
and tools introduced in this work can be used to investigate such transitions - which occur in the
large size limit - through the metastable behavior of many-body systems of moderate sizes accessible
to numerics.
