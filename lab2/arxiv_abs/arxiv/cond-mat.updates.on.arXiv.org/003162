The polymer brush normally swells in a good solvent, while it collapses in a poor solvent. An abnormal
response of polymer brush, so-called co-nonsolvency, is a phenomenon where the brush collapses
counter-intuitively in a good solvent mixture. In this work, the structural properties of the co-nonsolvency
in the grafted polymers are investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. We consider the
brushes at three different grafting densities to study the effect of topologically excluded volumes
on the co-nonsolvency. Preferential adsorption of solvent molecules on the polymers leads to the
formation of a bridging structure between them, which causes the polymer brush to collapse significantly.
We find that the intermolecular bridging structure is predominant in the overlapping brush regime,
while the intramolecular bridging is only formed in the mushroom brush regime. Topological constraints
also affect the degree of collapse as well as the orientation of the polymer substantially. Based
on these observations, we construct a phase diagram of the polymer brush system using the average
thickness and orientation as structural order parameters when both the grafting density and the
fraction of the solvent mixture are varied, respectively. Going beyond previous works on the co-nonsolvency
in the single polymer model and adsorption-attraction model, this work provides a microscopic
insight into many-chain effects on the co-nonsolvency behavior in a systematic way. Furthermore,
the phase diagrams presented in this work can provide useful theoretical guidelines for controlling
co-nonsolvency behavior in various polymer brush systems such as bio-interface, drug-delivery,
and sensor devices.
