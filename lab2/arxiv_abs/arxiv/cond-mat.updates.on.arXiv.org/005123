In this work, we addressed the effects of Y$^{3+}$ and Nd$^{3+}$ cations on the adsorption of the
whey protein $\beta$-lactoglobulin (BLG) at air-water interfaces as a function of electrolyte
concentration. Both cations caused very similar but dramatic changes at the interface and in the
bulk solution. Here, measurements of the electropho-retic mobility and vibrational sum-frequency
generation spectroscopy (SFG) were applied and consistently showed a reversal of the BLG net charge
at remarkably low ion concentrations of 30 (bulk) and 40 (interface) $\mu$M of Y$^{3+}$ or Nd$^{3+}$
for a BLG concentration of 15 $\mu$M. SFG spectra of carboxylate stretching vibrations from Asp
or Glu residues of interfacial BLG showed significant changes in the carboxylate stretching frequency,
which we associate to specific and efficient bind-ing of Y$^{3+}$ or Nd$^{3+}$ ions to the proteins
carboxylate groups. Characteristic reentrant condensation for BLG moieties with bound trivalent
ions was found in a broad concentration range around the point of zero net charge. The highest colloidal
stability of BLG was found for ion concentrations <20$\mu$M and >50$\mu$M. Investigations on macroscopic
foams from BLG solutions, revealed the existence of structure-property relations between the
interfacial charging state and the foam stability. In fact, a minimum in foam stability at 20$\mu$M
ion concentration was found when the interfacial net charge was negligible. Our results provide
new information on the charge reversal at the liquid-gas interface of protein/ion dispersions.
Therefore, we see our findings as an important step in the clarification of reentrant con-densation
effects at interfaces and their relevance to foam stability.
