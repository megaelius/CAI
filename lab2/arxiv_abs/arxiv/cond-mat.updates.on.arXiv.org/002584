The formation, growth and detachment of gas bubbles on electrodes are omnipresent in electrolysis
and other gas-producing chemical processes. To better understand their role in the mass transfer
efficiency, we perform experiments involving successive bubble nucleations from a predefined
nucleation site which consists of a superhydrophobic pit on top of a micromachined pillar. The experiments
on bubble nucleation at these spots permit the comparison of mass transfer phenomena connected
to electrolytically generated H$_2$ bubbles with the better-understood evolution of CO$_2$ bubbles
in pressure-controlled supersaturated solutions. In both cases, bubbles grow in a diffusion-dominated
regime. For CO$_2$ bubbles, it is found that the growth rate coefficient of subsequent bubbles always
decreases due to the effect of gas depletion. In contrast, during constant current electrolysis,
the bubble growth rates are affected by the evolution of a boundary layer of dissolved H$_2$ gas near
the flat electrode which competes with gas depletion. This competition results in three distinct
regimes. Initially, the bubble growth slows down with each new bubble in the succession due to the
dominant depletion of the newly-formed concentration boundary layer. In later stages, the growth
rate increases due to a local increase of gas supersaturation caused by the continuous gas production
and finally levels off to an approximate steady growth rate. The gas transport efficiency associated
with the electrolytic bubble succession follows a similar trend in time. Finally, for both H$_2$
and CO$_2$ bubbles, detachment mostly occurs at smaller radii than theory predicts and at a surprisingly
wide spread of sizes. A number of explanations are proposed, but the ultimate origin of the spreading
of the results remains elusive.
