The behavior of fluids in the vicinity of the liquid-gas critical point is studied within the cell
fluid model framework. The analytic method for deriving the equation of state of a cell fluid model
in the low-temperature region (T<Tc) is developed using the renormalization group transformation
within the collective variables approach. Mathematical description within the grand canonical
ensemble is illustrated by an example of the Morse interaction potential possessing the Fourier
transform. A specific feature of the proposed method lies in the possibility to use exclusively
microscopic characteristics of a fluid (parameters of the interaction potential) for calculating
macroscopic quantities (pressure and other thermodynamic quantities) without involving the
hard-spheres reference system. The grand partition function, thermodynamic potential, and equation
of state of the model near the critical point are derived taking into account the non-Gaussian (quartic)
distribution of order parameter fluctuations. A nonlinear equation, which links the density and
the chemical potential, is presented and solved. Graphs of the dependence of the density on the chemical
potential are plotted for various values of the relative temperature. The numerical estimates
of the critical-point parameters for potassium, obtained in addition to the estimates for sodium,
are given. The calculated critical-point parameters for liquid alkali metals (sodium and potassium)
are in accord with experimental data. The coexistence curve for sodium is plotted and compared with
other authors' data in the immediate vicinity of Tc, where theoretical and experimental researches
are difficult to carry out. The differences between the obtained results and the earlier published
results for T>Tc are discussed.
