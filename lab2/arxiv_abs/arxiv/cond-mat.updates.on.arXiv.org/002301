We analyse the antiferromagnetic spin-$1/2$ XXZ model on the kagome lattice at finite external
magnetic field with the help of a nonperturbative zero-temperature renormalization group (RG)
technique. Following the work of Kumar \emph{et al} (Phys. Rev. B {\bf 90}, 174409 (2014)), we use
a Jordan-Wigner transformation to map the spin problem into one of spinless fermions (spinons)
in the presence of a statistical gauge field, and with nearest-neighbour interactions. While the
work of Kumar \emph{et al} was confined mostly to the plateau at $1/3$-filling (magnetisation per
site) in the XY regime, we analyse the role of inter-spinon interactions in shaping the phases around
this plateau in the entire XXZ model. The RG phase diagram obtained contains three spin liquid phases
whose position is determined as a function of the exchange anisotropy and the energy scale for fluctuations
arising from spinon scattering. Two of these spins liquids are topologically ordered states of
matter with gapped, degenerate states on the torus. The gap for one of these phases corresponds to
the one-spinon band gap of the Azbel-Hofstadter spectrum for the XY part of the Hamiltonian, while
the other arises from two-spinon interactions. The Heisenberg point of this problem is found to
lie within the interaction gapped spin liquid phase, in broad agreement with a recent experimental
finding. The third phase is an algebraic spin liquid with a gapless Dirac spectrum for spinon excitations,
and possess properties that show departures from the Fermi liquid paradigm. The three phase boundaries
correspond to critical theories, and meet at a $SU(2)$-symmetric multicritical point. This special
critical point agrees well with the gap-closing transition point predicted by Kumar \emph{et al}.
We discuss the relevance of our findings to various recent experiments, as well as results obtained
from other theoretical analyses.
