Magnetic skyrmions have been the focus of intense research due to their potential applications
in ultra-high density data and logic technologies, as well as for the unique physics arising from
their antisymmetric exchange term and topological protections. In this work we prepare a chiral
jammed state in chemically disordered (Fe, Co)Si consisting of a combination of randomly-oriented
magnetic helices, labyrinth domains, rotationally disordered skyrmion lattices and/or isolated
skyrmions. Using small angle neutron scattering, (SANS) we demonstrate a symmetry-breaking magnetic
field sequence which disentangles the jammed state, resulting in an ordered, oriented skyrmion
lattice. The same field sequence was performed on a sample of powdered Cu2OSeO3 and again yields
an ordered, oriented skyrmion lattice, despite relatively non-interacting nature of the grains.
Micromagnetic simulations confirm the promotion of a preferred skyrmion lattice orientation
after field treatment, independent of the initial configuration, suggesting this effect may be
universally applicable. Energetics extracted from the simulations suggest that approaching
a magnetic hard axis causes the moments to diverge away from the magnetic field, increasing the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
energy, followed subsequently by a lattice re-orientation. The ability to facilitate an emergent
ordered magnetic lattice with long-range orientation in a variety of materials despite overwhelming
internal disorder enables the study of skyrmions even in imperfect powdered or polycrystalline
systems and greatly improves the ability to rapidly screen candidate skyrmion materials.
