Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ (STO) was discovered over 50 years ago, yet STO has remained
one of the most intriguing known superconductors. Here we report superconductivity in STO doped
with a novel dopant, Nd, which is expected to carry a net spin. A major open question for STO relates
to the possibility that multiple bands could be involved in establishing the superconducting state.
Here we offer evidence of two-band superconductivity in Nd$_x$Sr$_{1-x}$TiO$_3$ thin films based
on the temperature dependence of the upper critical field, an approach that has not been previously
used to investigate multi-band effects in doped STO. Specifically, we observe a pronounced positive
curvature of the temperature-dependence of the out-of-plane upper critical field, which extends
substantially below the critical temperature and changes to negative curvature at the lowest temperatures.
Moreover, we find that the out-of-plane upper critical field can exceed the Pauli paramagnetic
limit by a factor of nearly two. We show that these unusual observations are consistent with enhancement
of the critical field by multi-band superconductivity effects, in conjunction with weakening
of paramagnetic pair-breaking by strong spin-orbit coupling. Currently, there exist no models
for describing the temperature dependence of the critical field for a multi-band superconductor
that take into account the combined orbital, paramagnetic and spin-orbital coupling effects.
We propose such a two-band model and find very good agreement with our data. Our analysis also suggests
that intra-band superconducting coupling dominates over inter-band coupling.
