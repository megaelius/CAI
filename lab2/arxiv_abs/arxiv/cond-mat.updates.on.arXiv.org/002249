Biomolecular condensates undergirded by phase separations of proteins and nucleic acids serve
crucial biological functions. To gain physical insights into their genetic basis, we study how
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) depends on
their sequence charge patterns using a continuum Langevin chain model wherein each amino acid residue
is represented by a single bead. Charge patterns are characterized by the `blockiness' measure
$\kappa$ and the `sequence charge decoration' (SCD) parameter. Consistent with random phase approximation
(RPA) theory and lattice simulations, LLPS propensity as characterized by critical temperature
$T^*_{\rm cr}$ increases with increasingly negative SCD for a set of sequences showing a positive
correlation between $\kappa$ and $-$SCD. Relative to RPA, the simulated sequence-dependent variation
in $T^*_{\rm cr}$ is often---though not always---smaller, whereas the simulated critical volume
fractions are higher. However, for a set of sequences exhibiting an anti-correlation between $\kappa$
and $-$SCD, the simulated $T^*_{\rm cr}$'s are quite insensitive to either parameters. Additionally,
we find that blocky sequences that allow for strong electrostatic repulsion can lead to coexistence
curves with upward concavity as stipulated by RPA, but the LLPS propensity of a strictly alternating
charge sequence was likely overestimated by RPA and lattice models because interchain stabilization
of this sequence requires spatial alignments that are difficult to achieve in real space. These
results help delineate the utility and limitations of the charge pattern parameters and of RPA,
pointing to further efforts necessary for rationalizing the newly observed subtleties.
