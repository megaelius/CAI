The electronic structure of WTe$_2$ and orthorhombic $\gamma-$MoTe$_2$, are claimed to contain
pairs of Weyl type-II points. A series of ARPES experiments claim a broad agreement with these predictions.
We synthesized single-crystals of MoTe$_2$ through a Te flux method to validate these predictions
through measurements of its bulk Fermi surface (FS) \emph{via} quantum oscillatory phenomena.
We find that the superconducting transition temperature of $\gamma-$MoTe$_2$ depends on disorder
as quantified by the ratio between the room- and low-temperature resistivities, suggesting the
possibility of an unconventional superconducting pairing symmetry. Similarly to WTe$_2$, the
magnetoresistivity of $\gamma-$MoTe$_2$ does not saturate at high magnetic fields and can easily
surpass $10^{6}$ \%. Remarkably, the analysis of the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) signal superimposed
onto the magnetic torque, indicates that the geometry of its FS is markedly distinct from the calculated
one. The dHvA signal also reveals that the FS is affected by the Zeeman-effect precluding the extraction
of the Berry-phase. A direct comparison between the previous ARPES studies and density-functional-theory
(DFT) calculations reveals a disagreement in the position of the valence bands relative to the Fermi
level $\varepsilon_F$. Here, we show that a shift of the DFT valence bands relative to $\varepsilon_F$,
in order to match the ARPES observations, and of the DFT electron bands to explain some of the observed
dHvA frequencies, leads to a good agreement between the calculations and the angular dependence
of the FS cross-sectional areas observed experimentally. However, this relative displacement
between electron- and hole-bands eliminates their crossings and, therefore, the Weyl type-II
points predicted for $\gamma-$MoTe$_2$.
