Trigonal tellurium (Te) is a chiral semiconductor which lacks both mirror and inversion symmetries,
resulting in complex band structures with Weyl crossings and unique spin textures. Here we employ
detailed time-resolved polarized transient reflectivity (TR) to investigate its complex electronic
structure as well as carrier dynamics within the extended bulk band structure. The polarized TR
spectra reveal optical transitions at H-point between the uppermost spin-split H4 and H5 and the
degenerate H6 valence bands (VB) and the lowest lying degenerate H6 conduction band (CB) as well
as a higher energy transition at the L-point in the Brillouin zone. More surprisingly, the degeneracy
of the H6 CB (a proposed Weyl node) is lifted and the H4-H5 spin-split gap is reduced upon photoexcitation
before relaxing to equilibrium as the carriers decay. Using ab initio density functional theory
(DFT) calculations we find the major mechanism involved corresponds to photoinduced shear strain
generation in the Te film that breaks the screw symmetry of the crystal. The band-edge anisotropy
is also reflected in the hot carrier decay rate, which is twice slower along c-axis than perpendicular
to it. The majority of photoexcited carriers near the band edge are seen to recombine within 30 ps
while higher lying transitions observed near 1.2 eV appear to have substantially longer lifetimes,
potentially due to contributions of intervalley processes in the recombination rate. These new
findings shed light on strong correlation between photoinduced carriers and electronic structure
in anisotropic crystals which opens a potential pathway for designing novel Te-based devices that
take advantage of the topological structures as well as strong spin-related properties.
