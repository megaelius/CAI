The magneto-optical (MO) effects, such as the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and the Faraday
effect (FE), have been intensively investigated experimentally in a variety of magnetic materials
serving as a highly sensitive probe for electronic and magnetic properties. Recent measurements
using MOKE have led to the discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets, and demonstrated their rich
magnetic behaviors. In particular, a giant Kerr response has been measured in mono- and few-layer
CrI$_3$. However, the exact microscopic origin of such large MO signals in 2D materials is still
unknown, because treating accurately sizable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and excitonic effects
that are essential for such an understanding is beyond the capability of existing methods. With
a newly developed full-spinor GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) method, we show, for the
first time from first principles, that the exceedingly large optical and MO responses in ferromagnetic
monolayer CrI$_3$ arise from strongly bound exciton states consisting of spin-polarized electron-hole
pairs. These exciton states are shown to have distinct characteristics compared with either the
Frenkel excitons in ionic crystals and polymers, or Wannier excitons in other 2D semiconductors.
By simulating a realistic experimental setup, we further find that substrate configuration and
excitation frequency of the photon strongly shape the MO signals. Our results provide a new conceptual
mechanism, explaining quantitatively the recent experiments on CrI$_3$. In addition, comparison
between bulk and monolayer CrI$_3$ reveals the pivotal role of quantum confinement in enhancing
the MO signals.
