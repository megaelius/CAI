We present a theoretical study of the local optical conductivity, plasmon spectra, and thermoelectric
properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at different filling factors and twist angles $\theta$.
Our calculations are based on the electronic band structures obtained from a continuum model that
has two tunable parameters, $u_0$ and $u_1$, which parametrize the intra-sublattice inter-layer
and inter-sublattice inter-layer tunneling rate, respectively. In this Article we focus on two
key aspects: i) we study the dependence of our results on the value of $u_0$, exploring the whole range
$0\leq u_0\leq u_1$; ii) we take into account effects arising from the intrinsic charge density
inhomogeneity present in TBG, by calculating the band structures within the self-consistent Hartree
approximation. At zero filling factor, i.e.~at the charge neutrality point, the optical conductivity
is quite sensitive to the value of $u_0$ and twist angle, whereas the charge inhomogeneity brings
about only modest corrections. On the other hand, away from zero filling, static screening dominates
and the optical conductivity is appreciably affected by the charge inhomogeneity, the largest
effects being seen on the intra-band contribution to it. These findings are also reflected by the
plasmonic spectra. We compare our results with existing ones in the literature, where effects i)
and ii) above have not been studied systematically. As natural byproducts of our calculations,
we obtain the Drude weight and Seebeck coefficient. The former displays an enhanced particle-hole
asymmetry stemming from the inhomogeneous ground-state charge distribution. The latter is shown
to display a broad sign-changing feature even at low temperatures ($\approx 5~{\rm K}$) due to the
reduced slope of the bands, as compared to those of single-layer graphene.
