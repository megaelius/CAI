Ice nucleation from vapor presents a variety of challenges across a wide range of industries and
applications including refrigeration, transportation, and energy generation. However, a rational
comprehensive approach to fabricating intrinsically icephobic surfaces for frost formation-both
from water condensation (followed by freezing) and in particular from desublimation (direct growth
of ice crystals from vapor)-remains elusive. Here, guided by nucleation physics, we investigate
the effect of material composition and surface texturing (atomically smooth to nanorough) on the
nucleation and growth mechanism of frost for a range of conditions within the sublimation domain
(0 C to -55C; partial water vapor pressures 6 to 0.02 mbar). Surprisingly, we observe that on silicon
at very cold temperatures-below the homogeneous ice solidification nucleation limit (< -46 C)-desublimation
does not become the favorable pathway to frosting. Furthermore we show that surface nanoroughness
makes frost formation on silicon more probable. We experimentally demonstrate at temperatures
between -48 C and -55 C that nanotexture with radii of curvature within one order of magnitude of the
critical radius of nucleation favors frost growth, facilitated by capillary condensation, consistent
with Kelvin's Equation. Our findings show that such nanoscale surface morphology imposed by design
to impart desired functionalities-such as superhydrophobicity-or from defects, can be highly
detrimental for frost icephobicity at low temperatures and water vapor partial pressures (< 0.05
mbar). Our work contributes to the fundamental understanding of heterogeneous phase transitions
well within the equilibrium sublimation domain and has implications for applications such as travel,
power generation, and refrigeration.
