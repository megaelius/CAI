We have investigated the structural and magnetic properties of BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films grown
over (100)-oriented Si substrates by rf magnetron sputtering in a new route under O$_2$ free low
pressure Ar atmosphere. Single-phase BFO films were deposited in a heated substrate and post-annealed
in situ. The new routed allows high deposition rate and produce polycrystalline BFO pure phase,
confirmed by high resolution X-ray diffraction. Scanning electron and atomic force microscopy
reveal very low surface roughness and mean particle size of 33 nm. The BFO phase and composition were
confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and line scanning energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
in transmission electron microscopy mode. The surface chemistry of the thin film, analyzed by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, reveals the presence of Fe$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$ in a 2:1 ratio, a strong
indication that the film contains oxygen vacancies. An hysteretic ferromagnetic behavior with
room temperature high saturation magnetization $\sim 165 \times 10^3$ A/m was measured along the
film perpendicular and parallel directions. Such high magnetization, deriving from this new route,
is explained in the scope of oxygen vacancies, the break of the antiferromagnetic cycloidal order
and the increase of spin canting by change in the surface/volume ratio. Understanding the magnetic
behavior of a multiferroic thin films is a key for the development of heterogeneous layered structures
and multilayered devices and the production of multiferroic materials over Si substrates opens
new possibilities in the development of materials that can be directly integrated into the existent
semiconductor and spintronic technologies.
