Experiments on planar Josephson junction architectures have recently been shown to provide an
alternative way of creating topological superconductors hosting accessible Majorana modes.
These zero-energy modes can be found at the ends of a one-dimensional channel in the junction of a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) proximitized by two spatially separated superconductors.
The channel, which is below the break between the superconductors, is not in direct contact with
the superconducting leads, so that proximity coupling is expected to be weaker and less well-controlled
than in the simple nanowire configuration widely discussed in the literature. This provides a strong
incentive for this paper which investigates the nature of proximitization in these Josephson architectures.
At a microscopic level we demonstrate how and when it can lead to topological phases. We do so by going
beyond simple tunneling models through solving self-consistently the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations
of a heterostructure multicomponent system involving two spatially separated $s$-wave superconductors
in contact with a normal Rashba spin-orbit-coupled 2DEG. Importantly, within our self-consistent
theory we present ways of maximizing the proximity-induced superconducting gap by studying the
effect of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, chemical potential mismatch between the superconductor
and 2DEG, and sample geometry on the gap. Finally, we note (as in experiment) a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
phase is also found to appear in the 2DEG channel, albeit under circumstances which are not ideal
for topological superconducting phase.
