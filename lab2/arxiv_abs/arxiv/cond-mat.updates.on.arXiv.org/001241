Intralayer deformation in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is generally assumed to be negligible
due to the weak nature of the interactions between the layers, especially when the interfaces are
found incoherent. In the present work, graphene-phosphorene vdW-heterostructures are investigated
with the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The challenge of treating nearly incommensurate (very
large) supercell in DFT is bypassed by considering different energetic quantities in the grand
canonical ensemble, alternative to the formation energy, in order to take into account the mismatch
elastic contribution of the different layers. In the investigated heterostructures, it is found
that phosphorene contracts by ~4% in the armchair direction when compared to its free-standing
form. This large contraction leads to important changes in term of electronic properties, with
the direct electronic optical transition of phosphorene becoming indirect in specific vdW-heterostructures.
More generally, such a contraction indicates strong substrate effects in supported or encapsulated
phosphorene -neglected hitherto- and paves the way to substrate-controlled stress- tronic in
such 2D crystal. In addition, the stability of these vdW-heterostructures are investigated as
a function of the rotation angle between the layers and as a function of the stacking composition.
The alignment of the specific crystalline directions of graphene and phosphorene is found energetically
favored. In parallel, several several models based on DFT-estimated quantities are presented;
they allow notably a better understanding of the global mutual accommodation of 2D materials in
their corresponding interfaces, that is predicted to be non-negligible even in the case of incommensurate
interfaces.
