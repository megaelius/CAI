We study the early time and coarsening dynamics in a system consisting of two species of particles
($light$ and $heavy$) coupled to a fluctuating surface (described by tilt fields). The dynamics
of particles and tilts are coupled through local update rules, and lead to different ordered and
disordered steady state phases depending on the microscopic rates. We introduce a generalised
balance mechanism in non-equilibrium systems, namely $bunchwise~balance$, in which incoming
and outgoing transition currents are balanced between groups of configurations. This allows us
to exactly determine the steady state in a subspace of the phase diagram of this model. We introduce
the concept of $irreducible~sequences$ of interfaces and bends in this model. These sequences
are non-local, and we show that they provide a coarsening length scale in the ordered phases at late
times. Finally, we propose a $local$ correlation function ($\mathcal{S}$) that has a direct relation
to the number of irreducible sequences, and is able to distinguish between several phases of this
system through its coarsening properties. Starting from a totally disordered initial configuration,
$\mathcal{S}$ displays an initial linear rise and a broad maximum. As the system evolves towards
the ordered steady states, $\mathcal{S}$ further exhibits power law decays at late times that encode
coarsening properties of the approach to the ordered phases. Focusing on early time dynamics, we
posit coupled mean-field evolution equations governing the particles and tilts, which at short
times are well approximated by a set of linearized equations, which we solve analytically. Beyond
a timescale set by an ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff and preceding the onset of coarsening, our linearized
theory predicts the existence of an intermediate diffusive (power-law) stretch, which we also
find in simulations of the ordered regime of the system.
