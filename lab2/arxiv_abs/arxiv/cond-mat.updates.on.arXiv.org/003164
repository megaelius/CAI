We study surface effects of neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluids in neutron stars. $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluids
are in uniaxial nematic (UN), D$_{2}$ biaxial nematic (BN), or D$_{4}$ BN phase, depending on the
strength of magnetic fields from small to large. We suppose a neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluid in
a ball facing to the boundary at the surface sphere. Adopting a suitable boundary condition for $^{3}P_{2}$
condensates, we solve the Ginzburg-Landau equation to find several surface properties for the
neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluid. First, the phase on the surface can be different from that of the
bulk, and symmetry restoration/breaking occurs in general on the surface. Second, the distribution
of the surface energy density has an anisotropy depending on the polar angle in the sphere, which
may lead to the deformation of the geometrical shape of the surface. Third, the order parameter manifold
(OPM) induced on the surface, which is described by two-dimensional vector fields induced on the
surface from the condensates, allows topological defects (vortices) on the surface, and there
must exist such defects even in the ground state thanks to the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf theorem: although
the numbers of the vortices and anti-vortices depend on the bulk phases, the difference between
them are topologically invariant (the Euler number $\chi=2$) irrespective to the bulk phases.
These vortices which are not extended to the bulk are called boojums in the context of liquid crystals
and helium-3 superfluids. The surface properties of the neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluid found
in this paper may provide us useful information to study neutron stars.
