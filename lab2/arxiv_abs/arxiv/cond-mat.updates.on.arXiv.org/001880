The experimental manifestation of topological effects in bulk materials under ambient conditions,
especially those with practical applications, has attracted enormous research interest. Recent
discovery of Weyl semimetal provides an ideal material platform for such endeavors. The Berry curvature
in a Weyl semimetal becomes singular at the Weyl node, creating an effective magnetic monopole in
the k-space. A pair of Weyl nodes carry quantized effective magnetic charges with opposite signs,
and therefore, opposite chirality. Although Weyl-point-related signatures such as chiral anomaly
and non-closing surface Fermi arcs have been detected through transport and ARPES measurements,
direct experimental evidence of the effective k-space monopole of the Weyl nodes has so far been
lacking. In this work, signatures of the singular topology in a type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 is
revealed in the photo responses, which are shown to be directly related to the divergence of Berry
curvature. As a result of the divergence of Berry curvature at the Weyl nodes, TaIrTe4 exhibits unusually
large photo responsivity of 130.2 mA/W with 4-{\mu}m excitation in an unbiased field effect transistor
at room temperature arising from the third-order nonlinear optical response. The room temperature
mid-IR responsivity is approaching the performance of commercial HgCdTe detector operating at
low temperature, making Type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 of practical importance in terms of photo
sensing and solar energy harvesting. Furthermore, the high shift photocurrent response at the
Weyl cones is found to enhance the circularly polarized galvanic response from Weyl cones with opposite
chirality, which opens new experimental possibilities for studying and controlling the chiral
polarization of Weyl Fermions through an in-plane DC electric field in addition to the optical helicities.
