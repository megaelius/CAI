Molecular systems are materials that intersect with many different promising fields such as organic/molecular
electronics and spintronics, organic magnetism and quantum computing1-7. Particularly, magnetism
in organic materials is very intriguing: the possibility to realize long-range magnetic order
in completely metal-free systems means that magnetic moments are coupled to useful properties
of organic materials, such as optical transparency, low-cost fabrication, and flexible chemical
design. Magnetic ordering in light elements, such as nitrogen and carbon, has been studied in magnetic-edged
graphene nanoribbons8 and bilayers9, and polymers10 while in organic thin films most of the investigations
show this effect as due to the proximity of light atoms to heavy metals, impurities, or vacancies11.
Purely organic radicals are molecules that carry one unpaired electron giving rise to a permanent
magnetic moment, in the complete absence of metal ions.12-14 Inspired by their tremendous potential,
here we investigate thin films of an exceptionally chemically stable Blatter radical derivative15
by using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)16-18. Here we observe XMCD at the nitrogen K-edge.
Our results show a magnetic ordering different than in the single crystals and calculations indicate,
although weak, a long-range intermolecular coupling. We anticipate our work to be a starting point
for investigating and modelling magnetic behaviour in purely organic thin films. The tuning of
the magnetic properties by the molecular arrangement in organic films is an exciting perspective
towards revealing new properties and applications.
