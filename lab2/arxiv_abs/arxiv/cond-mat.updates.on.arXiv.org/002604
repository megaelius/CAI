A chain of Josephson junctions implements one of the simplest many-body models undergoing a superconductor-insulator
(SI) quantum phase transition between states with zero and infinite resistance. Apart from zero
resistance, the superconducting state is necessarily accompanied by a sound-like mode due to collective
oscillations of the phase of the complex-valued order parameter. Exciting this phase mode results
in transverse photons propagating along the chain. Surprisingly little is known about the fate
of this mode upon entering the insulating state, where the order parameter's amplitude remains
non-zero, but the phase ordering is "melted" by quantum fluctuations. Here we report momentum-resolved
radio-frequency spectroscopy of collective modes in nanofabricated chains of Al/AlOx/Al tunnel
junctions. We find that the phase mode survives remarkably far into the insulating regime, such
that $\textrm{M}\Omega$-resistance chains carry $\textrm{GHz}$-frequency alternating currents
as nearly ideal superconductors. The insulator reveals itself through broadening and random frequency
shifts of collective mode resonances, originated from intrinsic interactions. By pushing the
chain parameters deeper into the insulating state, we achieved propagation with the speed of light
down to $8\times 10^5~\textrm{m/s}$ and the wave impedance up to $23~\textrm{k}\Omega$. The latter
quantity exceeds the predicted critical impedance by an order of magnitude, which opens the problem
of quantum electrodynamics of a Bose glass insulator for both theory and experiment. Notably, the
effective fine structure constant of such a 1D vacuum exceeds a unity, promising transformative
applications to quantum science and technology.
