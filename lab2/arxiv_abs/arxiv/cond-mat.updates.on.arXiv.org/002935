The development of long range order in nickel-chromium alloys is of great technological interest
but the kinetics and mechanisms of the transformation are poorly understood. The present research
utilizes a combined computational and experimental approach to elucidate the mechanism by which
phosphorus accelerates the ordering rate of stoichiometric Ni_2Cr in Ni-Cr alloys. A series of
Ni-33%Cr-x%P samples (in atomic percent) were fabricated with phosphorus concentrations, x =
<0.005-0.1 at.% and aged between 373 and 470{\deg}C for times up to 3000 h. The first-principles
modeling considers fcc Ni with dilute P as a reasonable approximation for the complex Ni-Cr-P alloy
system. Calculation results show a pronounced enhancement of vacancy transport by vacancy-solute
pair diffusion via consecutive exchange and rotation jumps of vacancies associated with the phosphorus
atom. The energy barriers of these two migration paths are at least 0.35 eV lower than that of vacancy-atom
exchange in pure Ni solvent. The analytical diffusion model predicts enhanced solvent diffusion
by 2 orders of magnitude for 0.1 at.% P at 400-500{\deg}C. The model prediction is in good agreement
with the evolution of micro-hardness. We characterize the micro-hardness result by a kinetic ordering
model, showing a significant decrease of the activation energy of ordering transformation. These
results help gauge the risk of industrial alloys developing long range order which increases strength
but degrades ductility and toughness. Specifically, minor alloying additions that bind with excess
vacancies and lower the vacancy migration barrier can greatly accelerate hardening via Ni_2Cr
precipitation.
