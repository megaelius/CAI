Liquid crystals establish a nearly unique combination of thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and topological
behavior. This poses a challenge to their theoretical understanding and modeling. The arena where
these effects come together is the mesoscopic (micron) scale. It is then important to develop models
aimed at capturing this variety of dynamics. We have generalized the particle-based multiparticle
collision dynamics (MPCD) method to model the dynamics of nematic liquid crystals. Following the
Qian--Sheng theory of nematics, the spatial and temporal variations of the nematic director field
and order parameter are described by a tensor order parameter. The key idea is to assign tensorial
degrees of freedom to each MPCD particle, whose mesoscopic average is the tensor order parameter.
This new nematic-MPCD method includes backflow effect, velocity-orientation coupling and thermal
fluctuations. We validate the applicability of this method by testing: (i) the nematic-isotropic
phase transition, (ii) the flow alignment of the director in shear and Poiseuille flows, and (iii)
the annihilation dynamics of a pair of line defects. We find excellent agreement with existing literature.
We also investigate the flow field around a force dipole in a nematic liquid crystal, which represents
the leading-order flow field around a force-free microswimmer. The anisotropy of the medium not
only affects the magnitude of velocity field around the force dipole, but can also induce hydrodynamic
torques depending on the orientation of dipole axis relative to director field. A force dipole experiences
a hydrodynamic torque when the dipole axis is tilted with respect to the far-field director. The
direction of hydrodynamic toque is such that the pusher- (or puller-) type force dipole tends to
orient along (or perpendicular to) the director field.
