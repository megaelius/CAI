We develop the elastic theory for inversion-asymmetric tethered membranes and use it to identify
and study their possible phases. Asymmetry in a tethered membrane causes spontaneous curvature,
which in general depends upon the local in-plane dilation of the tethered network. This in turn leads
to long-ranged interactions between the local mean and Gaussian curvatures, which is not present
in symmetric tethered membranes. This interplay between asymmetry and Gaussian curvature leads
to a new {\em double-spiral} phase not found in symmetric tethered membranes. At temperature $T=0$,
tethered membranes of arbitrarily large size are always rolled up tightly into a conjoined pair
of Archimedes' spirals. At finite $T$ this spiral structure swells up significantly into algebraic
spirals characterized by universal exponents which we calculate. These spirals have long range
orientational order, and are the asymmetric analogs of statistically flat symmetric tethered
membranes. We also find that sufficiently strong asymmetry can trigger a structural instability
leading to crumpling of these membranes as well. This provides a new route to crumpling for asymmetric
tethered membranes. We calculate the maximum linear extent $L_c$ beyond which the membrane crumples,
and calculate the universal dependence of $L_c$ on the membrane parameters. By tuning the asymmetry
parameter, $L_c$ can be continuously varied, implying a {\em scale-dependent} crumpling. Our
theory can be tested on controlled experiments on lipids with artificial deposits of spectrin filaments,
in-vitro experiments on %\sout{artificial deposition of spectrin filaments on} red blood cell
membrane extracts, %\sout{after %depletion of adenosine-tri-phosphate molecules} and on graphene
coated on one side.
