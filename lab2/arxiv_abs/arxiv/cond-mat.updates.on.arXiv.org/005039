Quantum-mechanical fluctuations between competing phases at $T=0$ induce exotic finite-temperature
collective excitations that are not described by the standard Landau Fermi liquid framework. These
excitations exhibit anomalous temperature dependences, or non-Fermi liquid behavior, in the
transport and thermodynamic properties in the vicinity of a quantum critical point, and are often
intimately linked to the appearance of unconventional Cooper pairing as observed in strongly correlated
systems including the high-$T_c$ cuprate and iron pnictide superconductors. The presence of superconductivity,
however, precludes direct access to the quantum critical point, and makes it difficult to assess
the role of quantum-critical fluctuations in shaping anomalous finite-temperature physical
properties. Here we report temperature-field scale invariance of non-Fermi liquid thermodynamic,
transport, and Hall quantities in a non-superconducting iron-pnictide, Ba(Fe$_{1/3}$Co$_{1/3}$Ni$_{1/3}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$,
indicative of quantum criticality at zero temperature and zero applied magnetic field. Beyond
a linear in temperature resistivity, the hallmark signature of strong quasiparticle scattering,
we find the scattering rate that obeys a universal scaling relation between temperature and applied
magnetic fields down to the lowest energy scales. Together with the dominance of hole-like carriers
close to the zero-temperature and zero-field limits, the scale invariance, isotropic field response,
and lack of applied pressure sensitivity suggests a unique quantum critical system that does not
drive a pairing instability.
