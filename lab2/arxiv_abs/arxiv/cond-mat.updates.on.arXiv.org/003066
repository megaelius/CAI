Quantum oscillations (QOs) in transport and thermodynamic parameters at high magnetic fields
are an unambiguous signature of the Fermi surface, the defining characteristic of a metal. Therefore,
recent observations of QOs in insulating SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$, in particular the QOs of the resistivity
$\rho_{xx}$ in YbB$_{12}$, have been a big surprise, pointing to the formation of a novel state of
quantum matter. Despite the large charge gap inferred from the insulating behaviour of $\rho_{xx}$,
these compounds seemingly host a Fermi surface at high magnetic fields. However, the nature of the
ground state in zero field has been little explored. Here we report the use of low-temperature heat-transport
measurements to discover gapless, itinerant, charge-neutral excitations in the ground state
of YbB$_{12}$. At zero field, despite $\rho_{xx}$ being far larger than that of conventional metals,
a sizable linear temperature dependent term in the thermal conductivity is clearly resolved in
the zero-temperature limit ($\kappa_{xx}/T(T\rightarrow0)=\kappa_{xx}^0/T\neq0$). Such
a residual $\kappa_{xx}^0/T$ term at zero field, which is absent in SmB$_6$, leads to a spectacular
violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law: the Lorenz ratio $L=\kappa_{xx}\rho_{xx}/T$ is $10^{4}$-$10^{5}$
times larger than that expected in conventional metals. These data indicate that YbB$_{12}$ is
a charge insulator but a thermal metal, suggesting the presence of itinerant neutral fermions.
Remarkably, more insulating crystals with larger activation energies exhibit a larger amplitude
of the resistive QOs as well as a larger $\kappa_{xx}^0/T$, in stark contrast to conventional metals.
Moreover, we find that these fermions couple to magnetic field, despite their charge neutrality.
Our findings expose novel gapless and highly itinerant, charge-neutral quasiparticles in this
unconventional quantum state.
