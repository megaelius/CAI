Quantitative evaluations of the free energy of materials must take into account thermal and zero-point
energy fluctuations. While these effects can easily be estimated within a harmonic approximation,
corrections arising from the anharmonic nature of the interatomic potential are often crucial
and require computationally costly path integral simulations. Consequently, different approximate
frameworks for computing affordable estimates of the anharmonic free energies have been developed
over the years. Understanding which of the approximations involved are justified for a given system
is complicated by the lack of comparative benchmarks. To facilitate this choice we assess the accuracy
and efficiency of some of the commonly used approximate methods -- the vibrational self-consistent
field and self-consistent phonons -- by comparing the anharmonic correction to the Helmholtz free
energy against reference path integral calculations. These benchmarks are performed for a diverse
set of systems, ranging from simple quasi-harmonic solids to flexible molecular crystals with
freely-rotating units. Our results suggest that for simple solids such as allotropes of carbon
these methods yield results that are in excellent agreement with the reference calculations, at
a considerably lower computational cost. For more complex molecular systems such as polymorphs
of ice and paracetamol the methods do not consistently provide a reliable approximation of the anharmonic
correction. Despite substantial cancellation of errors when comparing the stability of different
phases, we do not observe a systematic improvement over the harmonic approximation even for relative
free-energies. Our results suggest that efforts towards obtaining computationally-feasible
anharmonic free-energies for flexible molecular solids should therefore be directed towards
reducing the expense of path integral methods
