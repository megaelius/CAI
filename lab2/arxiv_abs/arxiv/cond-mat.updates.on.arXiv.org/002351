Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of condensed matter physics, providing physical insight
into material behaviour while enabling the design of new devices. Perhaps this is most evident in
the push to develop quantum information and spintronic technologies. On the side of quantum information,
engineered light-matter interactions offer a powerful means to access and control quantum states,
while at the same time new insights into spin-photon manipulation will benefit the development
of spintronic technologies. In this context the recent discovery of hybridization between ferromagnets
and cavity photons has ushered in a new era of light-matter exploration at the crossroads of quantum
information and spintronics. The key player in this rapidly developing field of cavity spintronics
is a quasiparticle, the cavity-magnon-polariton. In this early review of recent work, the fundamental
behaviour of the cavity-magnon-polariton is summarized and related to the development of new spintronic
applications. In the last few years a comprehensive theoretical framework of spin-photon hybridization
has been developed. On an intuitive level many features can be described by a model of coupled oscillators,
however the origin of hybridization is only revealed by considering a comprehensive electrodynamic
framework. Here both approaches are summarized and a quantum description using the input-output
formalism is outlined. Based on this foundation, in depth experimental investigations of the coupled
spin-photon system have been performed. For example, the influence of hybridization on spin current
generation has been revealed and several in-situ coupling control mechanisms have been developed.
The many recent developments within this field represent only the first steps in what appears to
be a bright future for cavity spintronics.
