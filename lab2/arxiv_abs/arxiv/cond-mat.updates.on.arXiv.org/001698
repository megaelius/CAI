The defect stability in a prototypical perovskite oxide superlattice consisting of SrTiO$_3$
and PbTiO$_3$ (STO/PTO) is determined using first principles density functional theory calculations.
Specifically, the oxygen vacancy formation energies E$_v$ in the paraelectric and ferroelectric
phases of a superlattice with four atomic layers of STO and four layers of PTO (4STO/4PTO) are determined
and compared. The effects of charge state, octahedral rotation, polarization, and interfaces
on the E$_v$ are examined. The formation energies vary layer-by-layer in the superlattices, with
E$_v$ being higher in the ferroelectric phase than that in the paraelectric phase. The two interfaces
constructed in these oxide superlattices, which are symmetrically equivalent in the paraelectric
systems, exhibit very different formation energies in the ferroelectric superlattices and this
can be seen to be driven by the coupling of ferroelectric and rotational modes. At equivalent lattice
sites, E$_v$ of charged vacancies is generally lower than that of neutral vacancies. Octahedral
rotations (a$^0$a$^0$c$^-$) in the FE superlattice have a significant effect on the E$_v$, increasing
the formation energy of vacancies located near the interface but decreasing the formation energy
of the oxygen vacancies located in the bulk-like regions of the STO and PTO constituent parts. The
formation energy variations among different layers are found to be primarily caused by the difference
in the local relaxation at each layer. These fundamental insights into the defect stability in perovskite
superlattices can be used to tune defect properties via controlling the constituent materials
of superlattices and interface engineering.
