In this work, we consider the possibility of using synthetic multiferroics comprising piezoelectric
and magnetostrictive materials as an interconnect for nano magnetic logic circuits. The proposed
interconnect resembles a parallel plate capacitor filled with a piezoelectric, where one of the
plates is made of a magnetoelastic material. The operation of the interconnect is based on the effect
of stress-mediated anisotropy modulation, where an electric field applied across the piezoelectric
material produces stress, which, in turn, affects the anisotropy field in the magnetostrictive
material. We present the results of numerical modeling illustrating signal propagation through
the interconnect. The model combines electric and magnetic parts, where the electric part describes
the distribution of an electric field through the piezoelectric and the magnetic part describes
the change of magnetization in the magnetoelastic layer. The model is based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation with the electric field dependent anisotropy term included. The utilization of the electro-magnetic
coupling makes it possible to amplify magnetic signal during its propagation via energy conversion
from the electric to magnetic domains. Potentially, synthetic multiferroic interconnects can
be implemented in a variety of spin-based devices ensuring reliable and low-energy consuming data
transmission. According to the estimates, the group velocity of magnetic signals may be up to 100
km/s with energy dissipation less than aJ per bit per 100nm. The fundamental limits and practical
shortcoming of the proposed approach are also discussed.
