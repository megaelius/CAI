The results of Monte Carlo simulation of adsorption and wetting behaviour of a highly non-additive
symmetric mixture at selective walls is discussed. We have concentrated on the interplay between
the surface induced demixing in the adsorbed films and the properties of the bulk mixture, which
exhibits a closed immiscibility loop. It has been shown that the wetting behaviour depends on the
absolute values of the parameters determining the strengths of interaction between the mixture
components and the surface, as well as on their difference. In general, an increase of the difference
between the adsorption energies of the components leads to a decrease of the wetting temperature.
In the cases when the wetting of non-selective walls occurs at the temperatures above the onset of
demixing transition in the bulk, an increasing wall selectivity leads to a gradual decrease of the
wetting temperature towards the triple point, in which the vapour coexists with the mixed and demixed
liquid phases. When the wetting temperature at the non-selective wall is located below the onset
of the demixing transition in the bulk mixture, an increase of the adsorption energy of the selected
component causes the developing adsorbed films to demix and to show the reentrant mixing upon approaching
the bulk coexistence. At the temperatures above the onset of the demixing transition in the bulk,
the adsorbed films remain demixed up to the bulk coexistence and undergo the first-order wetting
transition. A rather unexpected finding has been the observation of a gradual increase of the wetting
temperature at highly selective walls.
