We show that the glassy dynamics of soft harmonic spheres at different temperatures can be characterized
by an effective packing fraction and a temperature-dependent glass transition, i.e., there are
two main contributions: First, the temperature-dependent effective packing fraction that has
already been employed previously decreases with increasing temperature due to thermal fluctuations
that lead to an increasing mean overlap between neighboring particles. Therefore, concerning
this contribution, with increasing temperature the distance of the effective packing fraction
from the glass transition packing fraction as obtained in the small temperature limit is expected
to increase. We argue that there is a second contribution due to the crossing of energy barriers that
are usually not considered when the effective packing fraction is determined. We show that the crossing
of energy barriers can be denoted with a transition packing fraction of thermal jamming that decreases
with increasing temperature $T$ according to $T^{0.2}$. As a consequence, if one studied this second
contribution alone, the distance of the packing fraction from the glass transition packing fraction
would decrease for increasing temperature. By reanalyzing data of soft sphere simulations, we
demonstrate that the dynamics of soft harmonic spheres is well-characterized if both contributions
are considered, namely the temperature-dependent effective packing fraction due to the increase
of the mean overlap between neighboring particles with stronger thermal fluctuations as well as
the glass transition packing fraction that depends on the temperature due to the crossing of energy
barriers.
