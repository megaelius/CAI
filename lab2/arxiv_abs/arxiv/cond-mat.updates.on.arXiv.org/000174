We have explored the manifold physical scenario emerging from a model of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization
(DNP) via thermal mixing under the hypothesis of highly effective electron-electron interaction.
When the electron and nuclear reservoirs are also assumed to be in strong thermal contact and the
microwave irradiation saturates the target electron transition, the enhancement of the nuclear
polarization is expected to be considerably high even if the irradiation frequency is set far away
from the centre of the ESR line (as already observed by Borghini) and the typical polarization time
is reduced on moving towards the boundaries of said line. More reasonable behaviours are obtained
by reducing the level of microwave saturation or the contact between electrons and nuclei in presence
of nuclear leakage. In both cases the function describing the dependency of the steady state nuclear
polarization on the frequency of irradiation becomes sharper at the edges and the build up rate decreases
on moving off-resonance. If qualitatively similar in terms of the effects produced on nuclear polarization,
the degree of microwave saturation and of electron-nucleus contact has a totally different impact
on electron polarization, which is of course strongly correlated to the effectiveness of saturation
and almost insensitive, at the steady state, to the magnitude of the interactions between the two
spin reservoirs. The likelihood of the different scenario is discussed in the light of the experimental
data currently available in literature, to point out which aspects are suitably accounted and which
are not by the declinations of thermal mixing DNP considered here.
