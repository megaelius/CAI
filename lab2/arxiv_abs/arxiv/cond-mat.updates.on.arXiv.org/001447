Increasing evidence suggests that chromosome folding and genetic expression are intimately connected.
For example, the co-expression of a large number of genes can benefit from their spatial co-localization
in the cellular space. Furthermore, functional structures can result from the particular folding
of the chromosome. Such phenomena have in common to result from the binding of divalent proteins
that can bridge regions sometimes far away on the DNA sequence. The physical system consisting of
the chromosome interacting with divalent proteins can be very complex. As such, most of the mechanisms
responsible for chromosome folding and for the formation of functional structures have remained
elusive. Using methods from statistical physics, we investigated models of chromosome architecture.
A common denominator of our approach has been to represent the chromosome as a polymer with bending
rigidity and consider its interaction with a solution of DNA-binding proteins. Structures entailed
by the binding of such proteins were then characterized at the thermodynamical equilibrium. Furthermore,
we complemented theoretical results with Brownian dynamics simulations, allowing to reproduce
more of the biological complexity. The main contributions of this thesis have been: (i) to provide
a model for the existence of transcription factories characterized in vivo with fluorescence microscopy;
(ii) to propose a physical basis for a conjectured regulatory mechanism of the transcription involving
the formation of DNA hairpin loops by the H-NS protein as characterized with atomic-force microscopy
experiments; (iii) to propose a physical model of the chromosome that reproduces contacts measured
in chromosome conformation capture (CCC) experiments. Consequences on the regulation of transcription
are discussed in each of these studies.
