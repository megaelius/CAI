This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical study of the magnetic-tunable near-field radiative
heat transfer (NFRHT) between two twisted graphene gratings. As a result of the quantum Hall regime
of magneto-optical graphene and the grating effect, three types of graphene surface plasmon polaritons
(SPPs) modes are observed in the system: near-zero modes, high-frequency hyperbolic modes, and
elliptic modes. The elliptic SPPs modes, which are caused by the combined effect of magnetic field
and grating, are observed in the graphene grating system for the first time. In addition, the near-zero
modes can be greatly enhanced by the combined effect grating and magnetic field, rendering graphene
devices promising for thermal communication at ultra-low frequency. In particular, the near-zero
modes result in a unique enhancement region of heat transfer, no matter for any twisted angle between
gratings. The combined effect of grating and magnetic field is investigated simultaneously. By
changing the strength of magnetic field, the positions and intensities of the modes can be modulated,
and hence the NFRHT can be tuned accordingly, no matter for parallel or twisted graphene gratings.
The magnetic field endows the grating action (graphene filling factors and twisted angles) with
a higher modulation ability to modulate the NFRHT compared with zero-field. Moreover, the modulation
ability of twist can be tuned by the magnetic field at different twisted angles. In sum, the combined
effect of magnetic field and grating provides a tunable way to realize the energy modulation or multi-frequency
thermal communications related to graphene devices.
