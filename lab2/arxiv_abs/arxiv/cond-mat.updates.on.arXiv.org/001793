Grain boundary migration is driven by the boundary's curvature and external loads such as temperature
and stress. In intercalation electrodes an additional driving force results from Li-diffusion.
That is, Li-intercalation induces volume expansion of the host-electrode, which is stored as elastic
energy in the system. This stored energy is hypothesized as an additional driving force for grain
boundaries and edge dislocations. Here, we apply the 2D Cahn-Hilliard$-$phase-field-crystal
(CH-PFC) model to investigate the coupled interactions between highly mobile Li-ions and host-electrode
lattice structure, during an electrochemical cycle. We use a polycrystalline FePO$_{4}$/ LiFePO$_{4}$
electrode particle as a model system. We compute grain growth in the FePO$_{4}$ electrode in two
parallel studies: In the first study, we electrochemically cycle the electrode and calculate Li-diffusion
assisted grain growth. In the second study, we do not cycle the electrode and calculate the curvature-driven
grain growth. External loads, such as temperature and stress, did not differ across studies. We
find the mean grain-size increases by $\sim11\%$ in the electrochemically cycled electrode particle.
By contrast, in the absence of electrochemical cycling, we find the mean grain-size increases by
$\sim2\%$ in the electrode particle. These CH-PFC computations suggest that Li-intercalation
accelerates grain-boundary migration in the host-electrode particle. The CH-PFC simulations
provide atomistic insights on diffusion-induced grain-boundary migration, edge dislocation
movement and triple-junction drag-effect in the host-electrode microstructure.
