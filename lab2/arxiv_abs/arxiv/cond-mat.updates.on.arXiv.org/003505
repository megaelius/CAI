Superconductivity is a quantum phenomenon caused by bound pairs of electrons. In diverse families
of strongly correlated electron systems, the electron pairs are not bound together by phonon exchange
but instead by some other kind of bosonic fluctuations. In these systems, superconductivity is
often found near a magnetic quantum critical point (QCP) where a magnetic phase vanishes in the zero-temperature
limit. Moreover, the maximum of superconducting transition temperature Tc frequently locates
near the magnetic QCP, suggesting that the proliferation of critical spin fluctuations emanating
from the QCP plays an important role in Cooper pairing. In cuprate superconductors, however, the
superconducting dome is usually separated from the antiferromagnetic phase and Tc attains its
maximum value near the verge of enigmatic pseudogap state that appears below doping-dependent
temperature T*. Thus a clue to the pairing mechanism resides in the pseudogap and associated anomalous
transport properties. Recent experiments suggested a phase transition at T*, yet, most importantly,
relevant fluctuations associated with the pseudogap have not been identified. Here we report on
direct observations of enhanced nematic fluctuations in (Bi,Pb)2Sr2CaCu2O8+d by elastoresistance
measurements, which couple to twofold in-plane electronic anisotropy, i.e. electronic nematicity.
The nematic susceptibility shows Curie-Weiss-like temperature dependence above T*, and an anomaly
at T* evidences a second-order transition with broken rotational symmetry. Near the pseudogap
end point, where Tc is not far from its peak in the superconducting dome, nematic susceptibility
becomes singular and divergent, indicating the presence of a nematic QCP. This signifies quantum
critical fluctuations of a nematic order, which has emerging links to the high-Tc superconductivity
and strange metallic behaviours in cuprates.
