Despite the importance that fluid flow plays in transporting and organizing populations, few laboratory
systems exist to systematically investigate the impact of advection on their spatial evolutionary
dynamics. To address this problem, we study the morphology and genetic spatial structure of microbial
colonies growing on the surface of a nutrient-laden fluid $10^4$ to $10^5$ times more viscous than
water in Petri dishes, the extreme but finite viscosity inhibits undesired thermal convection
and allows populations to effectively live at the air-liquid interface due to capillary forces.
We discover that S. cerevisiae (baker's yeast) growing on a viscous liquid behave like "active matter":
they metabolically generate fluid flows many times larger than their unperturbed colony expansion
speed, and that flow, in return, can dramatically impact their colony morphology and spatial population
genetics. We show that yeast cells generate fluid flows by consuming surrounding nutrients and
decreasing the local substrate density, leading to misaligned fluid pressure and density contours,
which ultimately generates vorticity via a thresholdless baroclinic instability. Numerical
simulations demonstrate that an intense vortex ring is produced below the colony's edge and quantitatively
predict the observed flow. As the viscosity of the substrate is lowered and the self-induced flow
intensifies, we observe three distinct morphologies: at the highest viscosity,compact circular
colonies similar to those grown on hard agar plates except with a stretched regime of exponential
expansion, intermediate viscosities give rise to compact colonies with "fingers" that are ripped
away to break into smaller cell clusters, and at the lowest viscosity, the expanding colony breaks
up into many genetically-diverse, mutually repelling, island-like fragments of yeast colonies.
