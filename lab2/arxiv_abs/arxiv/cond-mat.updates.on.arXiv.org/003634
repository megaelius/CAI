Multichannel imaging -- the ability to acquire images of an object through more than one imaging
mode simultaneously -- has opened exciting new avenues in several areas from astronomy to biomedicine.
Visible optics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer complimentary advantages of resolution,
speed and depth of penetration, and as such would be attractive in combination. In this paper, we
take first steps towards marrying together optical and MR imaging in a class of biocompatible and
deployable particulate materials constructed out of diamond. The particles are endowed with a
high density of quantum defects (Nitrogen Vacancy centers) that under optical excitation fluoresce
brightly in the visible, but also concurrently electron spin polarize, allowing the hyperpolarization
of lattice 13C nuclei to make the particles over three-orders of magnitude brighter than in conventional
MRI. We highlight additional benefits in background-free imaging, demonstrating lock-in suppression
by factors of 2 and 5 in optical and MR domains respectively, although ultimate limits are at least
two orders of magnitude in each domain. Finally, leveraging the ability of optical and MR imaging
to simultaneously probe Fourier-reciprocal domains (real and k-space), we elucidate the ability
to employ hybrid sub-sampling in both conjugate spaces to vastly accelerate dual-image acquisition,
by as much as two orders of magnitude in practically relevant sparse-imaging scenarios. Our work
portends new avenues for quantum-enhanced dual-mode imaging platforms and opens possibilities
for new therapeutic avenues including in low-field MRI-guided endoscopy.
