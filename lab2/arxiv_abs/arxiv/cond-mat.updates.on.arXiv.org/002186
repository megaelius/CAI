The recent discovery of quasi-one-dimensional Chromium-based superconductivity has generated
much excitement. We study in this work the superconducting instabilities of a representative compound,
the newly synthesized KCr$_3$As$_3$ superconductor. Based on inputs from density functional
theory calculations, we first construct an effective multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonian
to model its low-energy band structure. We then employ standard random-phase approximation calculations
to investigate the superconducting instabilities of the resultant multi-orbital Hubbard model.
We find various pairing symmetries in the phase diagram in different interaction parameter regimes,
including the triplet $f$-wave, $p_z$-wave and singlet $s^\pm$-wave pairings. We argue that the
singlet $s^\pm$-wave pairing, which emerges at intermediate interaction strength, is realized
in this material. This singlet pairing is driven by spin-density wave fluctuations enhanced by
Fermi-surface nesting. We point out that phase-sensitive measurement can distinguish the $s$-wave
pairing in KCr$_3$As$_3$ from the $p_z$-wave previously proposed for a related compound K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$.
The $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing in KCr$_3$As$_3$ shall also exhibit a subgap spin resonance mode near
the nesting vector, which can be tested by inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Another
intriguing property of the $s^\pm$-pairing is that it can induce time-reversal invariant topological
superconductivity in a semiconductor wire with large Rashba spin-orbit coupling via proximity
effect. Our study shall be of general relevance to all superconductors in the family of ACr$_3$As$_3$
(A=K, Rb, Cs).
