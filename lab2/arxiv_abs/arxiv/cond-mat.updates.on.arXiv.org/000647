Nanostructured semiconductors emit light from electronic states known as excitons[1]. According
to Hund's rules[2], the lowest energy exciton in organic materials should be a poorly emitting triplet
state. Analogously, the lowest exciton level in all known inorganic semiconductors is believed
to be optically inactive. These 'dark' excitons (into which the system can relax) hinder light-emitting
devices based on semiconductor nanostructures. While strategies to diminish their influence
have been developed[3-5], no materials have been identified in which the lowest exciton is bright.
Here we show that the lowest exciton in quasi-cubic lead halide perovskites is optically active.
We first use the effective-mass model and group theory to explore this possibility, which can occur
when the strong spin-orbit coupling in the perovskite conduction band is combined with the Rashba
effect [6-10]. We then apply our model to CsPbX3 (X=Cl,Br,I) nanocrystals[11], for which we measure
size- and composition-dependent fluorescence at the single-nanocrystal level. The bright character
of the lowest exciton immediately explains the anomalous photon-emission rates of these materials,
which emit 20 and 1,000 times faster[12] than any other semiconductor nanocrystal at room[13-16]
and cryogenic[17] temperatures, respectively. The bright exciton is further confirmed by detailed
analysis of the fine structure in low-temperature fluorescence spectra. For semiconductor nanocrystals[18],
which are already used in lighting[19,20], lasers[21,22], and displays[23], these optically
active excitons can lead to materials with brighter emission and enhanced absorption. More generally,
our results provide criteria for identifying other semiconductors exhibiting bright excitons
with potentially broad implications for optoelectronic devices.
