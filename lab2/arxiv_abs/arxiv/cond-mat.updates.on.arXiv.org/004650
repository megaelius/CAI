We examine driven superconducting vortices interacting with quenched disorder where we measure
the memory effects under a sequence of drive pulses applied perpendicular to each other. As a function
of disorder strength, we find four types of behavior: an elastic response, a fragile phase, a jammed
phase, and a pinning dominated regime. These phases can be distinguished by the presence or absence
of different types of memory effects. The fragile and jammed states exhibit memory, while the elastic
and pinning dominated regimes do not. In the fragile regime, the system organizes into a pinned state
during the first drive pulse, flows during the second drive pulse which is applied in the perpendicular
direction, and then returns to a pinned state during the third drive pulse which is applied in the
same direction as the first pulse. This behavior is the hallmark of fragility that has been proposed
for jamming in particulate matter by Cates et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1841 (1998)]. For stronger
disorder, we observe a robust jamming state in which a memory effect is still present but the system
reaches a pinned or reduced flow state during the perpendicular drive pulse, similar to what appears
in granular systems under shear jamming. We show that the different states produce signatures in
the spatial vortex configurations, with memory effects arising from the coexistence of an elastic
component and a pinned component in the vortex assembly. The sequential perpendicular driving
protocol we propose for distinguishing fragile, jammed, and pinned phases should be general to
the broader class of driven interacting particles in the presence of quenched disorder.
