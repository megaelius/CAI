We consider a dynamical field theory (Active Model B+) that minimally extends the equilibrium Model
B for diffusive phase separation of a scalar field, by adding leading-order terms that break time-reversal
symmetry. It was recently shown that such active terms can cause the bulk phase separation of Model
B to be replaced by a steady state of microphase separation at a finite length scale. This phenomenon
was understood at mean-field level as due to the activity-induced reversal of the Ostwald ripening
mechanism, which provides the kinetic pathway to bulk phase separation in passive fluids. This
reversal occurs only in certain ranges for the activity parameters. In this paper we go beyond such
a mean-field analysis and develop a $1$-loop Renormalisation Group (RG) approach. We first show
that, in the parameter range where bulk phase separation is still present, the critical point belongs
formally to the same (Wilson-Fisher) universality class as the passive Model B. In contrast, in
a parameter range associated with microphase separation, we find that an unstable non-equilibrium
fixed point of the RG flow arises for $d\geq 2$, colliding with the Wilson-Fisher point in $d\to 2^+$
and making it unstable in $d=2$. At large activity, the flow in this region is towards strong coupling.
We argue that the phase transition to microphase separation in active systems, in the physically
relevant dimensions $d=2$ and $3$, very probably belongs to a new non-equilibrium universality
class. Because it is governed by the strong-coupling regime of the RG flow, our perturbative analysis
leaves open the quantitative characterization of this new class.
