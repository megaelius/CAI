Topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics is an emerging field of research, which involves
the topological electronic states coupled to the AFM order parameter known as the N$\acute{\rm
e}$el vector. The control of these states is envisioned through manipulation of the N$\acute{\rm
e}$el vector by spin-orbit torques driven by electric currents. Here we propose a different approach
favorable for low-power AFM spintronics, where the control of the topological states in a two-dimensional
material, such as graphene, is performed via the proximity effect by the voltage induced switching
of the N$\acute{\rm e}$el vector in an adjacent magnetoelectric AFM insulator, such as chromia.
Mediated by the symmetry protected boundary magnetization and the induced Rashba-type spin-orbit
coupling at the interface between graphene and chromia, the emergent topological phases in graphene
can be controlled by the N$\acute{\rm e}$el vector. Using density functional theory and tight-binding
Hamiltonian approaches, we model a graphene/Cr2O3 (0001) interface and demonstrate non-trivial
band gap openings in the graphene Dirac bands asymmetric between the K and K' valleys. This gives
rise to an unconventional quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) with a quantized value of $2e^2/h$
and an additional step-like feature at a value close to $e^2/2h$, and the emergence of the spin-polarized
valley Hall effect (VHE). Furthermore, depending on the N$\acute{\rm e}$el vector orientation,
we predict the appearance and transformation of different topological phases in graphene across
the $180^{\circ}$ AFM domain wall, involving the QAHE, the valley-polarized QAHE and the quantum
VHE (QVHE), and the emergence of the chiral edge state along the domain wall. These topological properties
are controlled by voltage through magnetoelectric switching of the AFM insulator with no need for
spin-orbit torques.
