The ability to control electronic states at the nanoscale has contributed to our modern understanding
of condensed matter. In particular, quantum dot circuits represent model systems for the study
of strong electronic correlations, epitomized by the Kondo effect. Here, we show that circuit Quantum
Electrodynamics architectures can be used to study the internal degrees of freedom of such a many-body
phenomenon. We couple a quantum dot to a high finesse microwave cavity to measure with an unprecedented
sensitivity the dot electronic compressibility i.e. the ability of the dot to accommodate charges.
Because it corresponds solely to the charge response of the electronic system, this quantity is
not equivalent to the conductance which involves in general other degrees of freedom such as spin.
By performing dual conductance/compressibility measurements in the Kondo regime, we uncover
directly the charge dynamics of this peculiar mechanism of electron transfer. Strikingly, the
Kondo resonance, visible in transport measurements, is transparent to microwave photons trapped
in the high finesse cavity. This reveals that, in such a many body resonance, finite conduction is
achieved from a charge frozen by Coulomb interaction. This previously elusive freezing of charge
dynamics is in stark contrast with the physics of a free electron gas. Our setup highlights the power
of circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures to study condensed matter problems. The tools
of cavity quantum electrodynamics could be used in other types of mesoscopic circuits with many-body
correlations and bring a promising platform to perform quantum simulation of fermion-boson problems.
