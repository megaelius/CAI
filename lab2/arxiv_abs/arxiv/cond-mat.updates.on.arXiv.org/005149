We introduce a novel NMR approach that extends the capabilities of indirect dynamic nuclear polarization
(DNP) under magic-angle spinning to probe the local environment of half-integer spin quadrupolar
nuclei. Compared to cross-polarization, this novel method based on the refocused INEPT scheme
with adiabatic dipolar recoupling is easier to optimize and does not distort the quadrupolar line
shapes. Furthermore, the use of this technique, instead of the PRESTO (Phase-shifted Recoupling
Effects a Smooth Transfer of Order) scheme or direct DNP, greatly improves the sensitivity of DNP-NMR
for the detection of quadrupolar isotopes with small dipolar couplings to protons, including notably
those located in the subsurface of inorganic materials or with low gyromagnetic ratio ($\gamma$).
This technique has been applied to identify the atomic-level structure of Br{\o}nsted acid sites
of hydrated titania-supported MoO${}_3$, MoO${}_3$/TiO${}_2$, a widely used heterogeneous
catalyst. The spectra of protonated and unprotonated ${}^{17}$O sites, acquired in natural abundance,
indicate the presence of various oxomolybdate species as well as HOMo${}_2$ and HOMo${}_3$ Br{\o}nsted
acid sites. The enhanced sensitivity of this new method has also enabled the acquisition of the first
DNP-enhanced spectra of ${}^{95}$Mo and ${}^{47,49}$Ti low-$\gamma$ quadrupolar isotopes.
The proposed polarization transfer is also employed to acquire the first DNPenhanced spectrum
of ${}^{67}$Zn, another low-$\gamma$ quadrupolar isotope. This possibility is demonstrated
for Al-doped ZnO nanoparticles used in optoelectronic devices. The obtained ${}^{17}$O, ${}^{27}$Al,
and ${}^{67}$Zn DNP-NMR data prove that the surface region of these nanoparticles contains ZnO
phase as well as secondary phases, such as $\alpha$-Al${}_2$O${}_3$ and partially inverse ZnAl${}_2$O${}_4$
spinel.
