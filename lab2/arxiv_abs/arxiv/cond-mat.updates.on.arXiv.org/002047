In this study, a thenoyltriflouroacetone ligand (TTA) with a Tb3+ MOF was synthesized (Tb=10 and
50% mol) and its structural and luminescent properties were analyzed. The metalorganic compound
was generated in a simple one-pot reaction from terbium nitrate and 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone
precursors at room temperature. By means of FTIR, it was confirmed the presence of carbon groups,
which made possible the terbium ion chelation, and also the Tb-O bonds vibration modes. HNMR results
confirm that the complex with 10% mol of Tb3+ contains three coordinates molecules of TTA and two
waters molecules. The powders exhibit rod-like morphology with size about 170 nm of diameter and
a length about 2 {\mu}m, the rod-like nature of powders was confirmed by SEM and TEM analyses. By XRD
it was concluded that at higher terbium concentration (TTA-50Tb sample) higher the crystallite
size and crystallinity, in fact the TTA-10Tb sample shows a partial-amorphous nature. By photoluminescence
analyses, the 5D4-7FJ (J=3, 4, 5 and 6) emissions were recorded for both synthesized samples ({\lambda}exc=376
nm). Furthermore, it was observed that the emission intensity was enhanced in a factor of 3.5 for
the TTA-50Tb. The energy transfer efficiency from TTA to Tb3+ (antenna effect) was 0.984 for TTA-10Tb
and 0.993 for TTA-50Tb. Decay time analyses indicate effective lifetime of 1.45 and 1.60ms for the
samples doped at 10 and 50%, respectively, indicating that the forbidden transition rules are stronger
at higher crystallinity. The integrated intensities of the 5D4 - 7F5 (green at 541 nm) and 5D4 - 7F6
(blue at 486 nm) emissions and their intensity ratios IG/IB upon 376 nm excitation have been evaluated
for TTA-10Tb andTTA-50Tb samples.
