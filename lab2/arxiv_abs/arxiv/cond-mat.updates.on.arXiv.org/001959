At the Mott transition, electron-electron interaction changes a metal, in which electrons are
itinerant, to an insulator, in which electrons are localized. This phenomenon is central to quantum
materials. Here we contribute to its understanding by studying the two-dimensional Hubbard model
at finite temperature with plaquette cellular dynamical mean-field theory. We provide an exhaustive
thermodynamic description of the correlation-driven Mott transition of the half-filled model
by calculating pressure, charge compressibility, entropy, kinetic energy, potential energy
and free energy across the first-order Mott transition and its high-temperature crossover (Widom
line). The entropy is extracted from the Gibbs-Duhem relation and shows complex behavior near the
transition, marked by discontinuous jumps at the first-order boundary, singular behavior at the
Mott endpoint and inflections marking sharp variations in the supercritical region. The free energy
allows us to identify the thermodynamic phase boundary, to discuss phases stability and metastability,
and to touch upon nucleation and spinodal decomposition mechanisms for the transition. We complement
this thermodynamic description of the Mott transition by an information-theoretic description.
We achieve this by calculating the local entropy, which is a measure of entanglement, and the single-site
total mutual information, which quantifies quantum and classical correlations. These information-theoretic
measures exhibit characteristic behaviors that allow us to identify the first-order coexistence
regions, the Mott critical endpoint and the crossovers along the Widom line in the supercritical
region.
