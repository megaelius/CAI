We study the static charge correlation function in an one-band model on a square lattice. The Hamiltonian
consist of effective hoppings of the electrons between the lattice sites and the Heisenberg Hamiltonian.
Approximating the irreducible charge correlation function by a single bubble yields the ladder
approximation for the charge correlation function. In this approximation one finds in general
three charge instabilities, two of them are due to nesting, the third one is the flux phase instability.
Since these instabilities cannot explain the experiments in hole-doped cuprates we have included
in the irreducible charge correlation function also Aslamasov-Larkin (AL) diagrams where charge
fluctuations interact with products of spin fluctuations. We then find at high temperatures a nematic
or $d$-wave Pomeranchuk instability with a very small momentum. Its transition temperature decreases
roughly linearly with doping in the underdoped region and vanishes near optimal doping. Decreasing
the temperature further a secondary axial charge-density wave (CDW) instability appears with
mainly $d$-wave symmetry and a wave vector somewhat larger than the distance between nearest neighbor
hot spots. At still lower temperatures the diagonal flux phase instability emerges. A closer look
shows that the AL diagrams enhance mainly axial and not diagonal charge fluctuations in our one-band
model. This is the main reason why axial and not diagonal instabilities are the leading ones in agreement
with experiment. The two instabilities due to nesting vanish already at very low temperatures and
do not play any major role in the phase diagram. Remarkable is that the nematic and the axial CDW instabilities
show a large reentrant behavior.
