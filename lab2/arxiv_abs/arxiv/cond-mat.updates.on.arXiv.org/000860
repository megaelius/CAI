Residual stresses may appear in elastic bodies due to the formation of misfits in the micro-structure,
driven by plastic deformations, thermal or growth processes. They are especially widespread in
living matter, resulting from the dynamic remodelling processes aiming at optimizing the overall
structural response to environmental physical forces. From a mechanical viewpoint, residual
stresses are classically modelled through the introduction of a virtual incompatible state that
collects the local relaxed states around each material point. In this work, we instead employ an
alternative approach based on a strain energy function that constitutively depends only on the
deformation gradient and the residual stress tensor. In particular, our objective is to study the
morphological stability of an incompressible sphere, made of a neo-Hookean material and subjected
to given distributions of residual stresses. Firstly, we perform a linear stability analysis on
the pre-stressed solid sphere using the method of incremental deformations. The marginal stability
conditions are given as a function of a control parameter, being the dimensionless variable that
represents the characteristic intensity of the residual stresses. Secondly, we perform finite
element simulations using a mixed formulation in order to investigate the post-buckling morphology
in the fully nonlinear regime. Considering different distributions of the residual stresses,
we find that different morphological transitions occur around the material domain where the hoop
residual stress reaches its maximum compressive value. The results provide useful guidelines
in order to design morphable soft spheres, for example by controlling the residual stresses through
active deformations. They finally suggest a viable solution for the nondestructive characterization
of residual stresses in soft tissues, such as solid tumors.
