Self-organizing logic is a recently-suggested framework that allows the solution of Boolean truth
tables "in reverse," i.e., it is able to satisfy the logical proposition of gates regardless to which
terminal(s) the truth value is assigned ("terminal-agnostic logic"). It can be realized if time
non-locality (memory) is present. A practical realization of self-organizing logic gates (SOLGs)
can be done by combining circuit elements with and without memory. By employing one such realization,
we show, numerically, that SOLGs exploit elementary instantons to reach equilibrium points. Instantons
are classical trajectories of the non-linear equations of motion describing SOLGs, and connect
topologically distinct critical points in the phase space. By linear analysis at those points,
we show that these instantons connect the initial critical point of the dynamics, with at least one
unstable direction, directly to the final fixed point. We also show that the memory content of these
gates only affects the relaxation time to reach the logically consistent solution. Finally, we
demonstrate, by solving the corresponding stochastic differential equations, that since instantons
connect critical points, noise and perturbations may change the instanton trajectory in the phase
space, but not the initial and final critical points. Therefore, even for extremely large noise
levels, the gates self-organize to the correct solution. Our work provides a physical understanding
of, and can serve as an inspiration for, new models of bi-directional logic gates that are emerging
as important tools in physics-inspired, unconventional computing.
