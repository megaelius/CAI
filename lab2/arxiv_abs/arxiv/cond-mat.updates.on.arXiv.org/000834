Recently, interest in Superconductor (S)-Normal (N) interfaces was renewed by the observation
of exotic proximity effects in various systems, including S/semiconductor, S/ferromagnet, and
S/topological insulator. In general, the proximity effect is enhanced in transparent weak links
where coherent Andreev reflection is possible. Also, it is a common knowledge that the proximity
effect is, by definition, is a localized phenomenon that can only be active in each S/N interface
region. However, here we show that a three-dimensional (3D) macroscale proximity effect is realized
in few-micrometer-thick MgO/Mg2Si/MgB2 nanocomposite layers with atomically smooth and clean
heterointerfaces. We found from scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
microscopy measurements that a normal region of more than 100x100 square micrometers totally undergoes
transition into a bulk-like superconducting state although the normal host originally contains
less than ~10 vol % of superconducting MgB2 nanograins in a dispersed manner. In the proximity-induced
superconducting region, vortex formation and annihilation processes as well as vortex-free Meissner
regions were observed with respect to applied fields in a similar manner as Abrikosov vortices in
type-II superconductors. Furthermore, we found that the induced superconducting layers exhibit
an anisotropic magnetization behavior, in consistent with the formation of the large-scale superconducting
coherence. This unusually extended proximity effect suggests that disorder-induced interaction
and coupling of Andreev bound states, which are coherent superposition of time reversed electron
hole pairs, is realized in the nanocomposite. Thus, the present results not only expand the limit
of the proximity effect to bulk scales, but also provides a new route to obtain a proximity-induced
superconducting state from disordered systems.
