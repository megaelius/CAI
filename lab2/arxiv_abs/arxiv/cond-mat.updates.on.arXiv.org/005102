Intermetallic compounds are key materials for energy transition as they form reversible hydrides
that can be used for solid state hydrogen storage or as anodes in batteries. ABy compounds (A = Rare
Earth (RE); B = transition metal; 2 < y < 5) are good candidates to fulfill the required properties
for practical applications. They can be described as stacking of AB5 and AB2 sub-units along the
c crystallographic axis. The latter sub-unit brings a larger capacity, while the former one provides
a better cycling stability. However, ABy binaries do not show good enough properties for applications.
Upon hydrogenation, they exhibit multiplateau behavior and poor reversibility, attributed to
H induced amorphization. These drawbacks can be overcome by chemical substitutions on the A and/or
the B sites leading to stabilized reversible hydrides. The present work focuses on the pseudo-binary
Sm2MnxNi7-x system (0 <= x < 0.5). The structural, thermodynamic and corrosion properties are analyzed
and interpreted by means of X-ray diffraction, chemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy,
thermogravimetric analysis and magnetic measurements. Unexpected cell parameter variations
are reported and interpreted regarding possible formation of structural defects and uneven Mn
distribution within the Ni sublattice. Reversible capacity is improved for x > 0.3 leading to larger
and flatter isotherm curves, allowing for reversible capacity >1.4 wt %. Regarding corrosion,
the binary compound corrodes in alkaline medium to form rare earth hydroxide and nanoporous nickel.
As for the Mn-substituted compounds, a new corrosion product is formed in addition to those above
mentioned, as manganese initiates a sacrificial anode mechanism taking place at the early corrosion
stage.
