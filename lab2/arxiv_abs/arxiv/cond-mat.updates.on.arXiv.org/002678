In the present work, we start from a minimal Hamiltonian for Fermi systems where the s-wave scattering
is the only low energy constant at play. Many-Body Perturbative approach that is usually valid at
rather low density is first discussed. We then use the resummation technique with the ladder approximation
to obtain compact expressions for both the energy and/or the on-shell self-energy in infinite spin-degenerated
systems. Diagrammatic resummation technique has the advantage in general to be predictive in a
region of density larger compared to many-body perturbation theory. It also leads to non-diverging
limit as $|a_s| \rightarrow + \infty$. Still, the obtained expressions are rather complex functional
of the Fermi momentum $k_F$. We introduce the full phase-space average or the partial phase-space
methods respectively applied to the energy or to the self-energy to simplify their dependences
in terms of $(a_s k_F)$ while keeping the correct limit at low density and the non-diverging property
at large $|a_s k_F|$. Quasi-particle properties of Fermi system in various regime of density and
scattering length are then illustrated. Our conclusion is that such simplified expressions where
the direct link is made with the low energy constant without fine-tuning can provide a clear guidance
to obtain density functional theory beyond the perturbative regime. However, quasi-particle
properties close or near unitary cannot be reproduced unless this limit is explicitly used as a constraint.
We finally discuss how such approximate treatment of quasi-particle can guide the development
of density functional theory for strongly interacting Fermi systems.
