We have investigated the spatial distribution of the electron temperature generated in a two-dimensional
electron system (2DES) subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. We measure thermoelectric
voltages between Ohmic contacts located at the end of the voltage-probe arms of a Hall bar fabricated
from a GaAs/AlGaAs 2DES wafer, immersed in the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator held at
20 mK. Magneto-oscillations due to the Landau quantization are examined for the thermoelectric
voltages between the contact pairs straddling the main bar (arrangement to measure the transverse
component $V_{yx}$), and between the pairs located along the same side of the main bar (arrangement
for the longitudinal component $V_{xx}$). For the former arrangement, the oscillation amplitude
diminishes with the distance from the heater. For the latter arrangement, the pair on one side exhibits
much larger amplitude than the pair on the opposite side, and the relation becomes reversed by inverting
the magnetic field. The behaviours of the oscillation amplitude are qualitatively explained by
the spatial distribution of the electron temperature numerically calculated taking into consideration
the thermal diffusion into the voltage contacts and the electron-phonon interaction. For both
arrangements, the oscillations are shown to derive predominantly from the transverse (Nernst)
component, $S_{yx}$, of the thermopower tensor. The calculation also reveals that the voltage
probes, introducing only minor disturbance at zero magnetic field, substantially reduce the temperature
once a magnetic field is applied, and the thermoelectric voltages generated at the voltage arms
account for a significant part of the measured voltages.
