The element specificity of soft X-ray spectroscopy makes it an ideal tool for analyzing the microscopic
origin of ultrafast dynamics induced by localized optical excitation in metal-insulator heterostructures.
Using [Fe/MgO]$_n$ as a model system, we perform ultraviolet pump/soft X-ray probe experiments,
which are sensitive to all constituents of these heterostructures, to probe both electronic and
lattice excitations. Complementary ultrafast electron diffraction experiments independently
analyze the lattice dynamics of the Fe constituent, and together with ab initio calculations yield
comprehensive insight into the microscopic processes leading to local relaxation within a single
constituent or non-local relaxation between two constituents. Besides electronic excitations
in Fe, which are monitored at the Fe L$_3$ absorption edge and relax within 1 ps by electron-phonon
coupling, soft X-ray analysis identifies a change at the oxygen K absorption edge of the MgO layers
which occurs within 0.5 ps. This ultrafast energy transfer across the Fe-MgO interface is mediated
by high-frequency, interface vibrational modes, which are excited by hot electrons in Fe and couple
to vibrations in MgO in a mode-selective, non-thermal manner. A second, slower timescale is identified
at the oxygen K pre-edge and the Fe L$_3$ edge. The slower process represents energy transfer by acoustic
phonons and contributes to thermalization of the entire heterostructure. We thus find that the
interfacial energy transfer is associated with non-equilibrium behavior in the phonon system.
Because our experiments lack signatures of charge transfer across the interface, we conclude that
phonon-mediated processes dominate the competition of electronic and lattice excitations in
these non-local, non-equilibrium dynamics.
