Band theory and BCS theory are arguably the most successful theories of condensed matter physics.
Yet, in a number of materials, in particular the high-temperature superconductors and the layered
organic superconductors, they fail. In these lecture notes for an international school, I emphasize
that even though the low energy properties of a phase of matter are generally emergent and entirely
determined by the broken symmetry, there are many differences between a strongly correlated and
a weakly correlated state of matter. For example, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets,
but for weak correlations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic, whereas it
is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of interaction strength, above
the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between a metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator
is described by the Mott transition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with
dynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors: despite similar
emergent properties, there are many differences between both kinds of superconductors. Experimental
evidence suggests that hole-doped cuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations
are weaker in the electron-doped case, especially near optimal doping. Evidence for a pseudogap
arising from antiferromagnetic fluctuations is strong in the latter case, whereas in the hole-doped
case the pseudogap temperature appears as a consequence of Mott physics. In cluster dynamical mean-field
theory, the pseudogap line T* is a Widom line arising from a T=0 first-order transition that terminates
at a finite T critical point. Strongly correlated superconductors are much more resilient to near-neighbor
repulsion than their weakly correlated counterpart. Many different methods to attack these problems
theoretically are described.
