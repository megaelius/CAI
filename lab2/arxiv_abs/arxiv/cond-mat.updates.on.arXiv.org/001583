The unique properties of graphene offer immense opportunities for applications to many scientific
fields, as well as societal needs, beyond our present imagination. One of the important features
of graphene is the relatively simple tunability of its electronic structure, an asset which extends
the usability of graphene even further beyond present experience. A direct injection of charge
carriers into the conduction or valence bands, i.e., doping, represents a viable way of shifting
the Fermi level. In particular, the electrochemical doping should be the method of choice, when
higher doping levels are desired and when a firm control of experimental conditions is needed. In
this Account, we focus on the electrochemistry of graphene in combination with in-situ Raman spectroscopy,
i.e., the in-situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry. Such a combination of methods is indeed very
powerful, since Raman spectroscopy can readily monitor not only the changes in the doping level,
but it can give information also on eventual stress or disorder in the material. However, when employing
Raman spectroscopy, one of its main strengths lies in the utilization of isotope engineering during
the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of the graphene samples. The in-situ Raman spectroelectrochemical
study of multi-layered systems with smartly designed isotope compositions in individual layers
can provide a plethora of knowledge about the mutual interactions: (i) between the graphene layers
themselves, (ii) between graphene layers and their directly adjacent environment (e.g., substrate
or electrolyte), and (iii) between graphene layers and their extended environment, which is separated
from the layer by a certain number of additional graphene layers.
