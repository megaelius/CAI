In the last decade, a 2-terminal passive circuit element called a memristor has been developed for
non-volatile resistive random access memory and has more recently shown promise for neuromorphic
computing. Compared to flash memory, memristors have higher endurance, multi-bit data storage,
and faster read/write times. However, although 2-terminal memristors have demonstrated basic
neural functions, synapses in the human brain outnumber neurons by more than a factor of 1000, which
implies that multiterminal memristors are needed to perform complex functions such as heterosynaptic
plasticity. Previous attempts to move beyond 2-terminal memristors include the 3-terminal Widrow-Hoff
memistor and field-effect transistors with nanoionic gates or floating gates, albeit without
memristive switching in the transistor. Here, we report the scalable experimental realization
of a multi-terminal hybrid memristor and transistor (i.e., memtransistor) using polycrystalline
monolayer MoS2. Two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 memtransistors show gate tunability in individual
states by 4 orders of magnitude in addition to large switching ratios with high cycling endurance
and long-term retention of states. In addition to conventional neural learning behavior of long-term
potentiation/depression, 6-terminal MoS2 memtransistors possess gate-tunable heterosynaptic
functionality that is not achievable using 2-terminal memristors. For example, the conductance
between a pair of two floating electrodes (pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons) is varied by
10X by applying voltage pulses to modulatory terminals. In situ scanning probe microscopy, cryogenic
charge transport measurements, and device modeling reveal that bias-induced MoS2 defect motion
drives resistive switching by dynamically varying Schottky barrier heights.
