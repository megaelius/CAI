In this study, the effect of rhenium (Re) addition on microstructural evolution of a new low-density
Co-Ni-Al-Mo-Nb based superalloy is presented. Addition of Re significantly influences the {\gamma}'
precipitate morphology, the {\gamma}/{\gamma}' lattice misfit and the {\gamma}/{\gamma}' microstructural
stability during long term aging. An addition of 2 at.% Re to a Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (all in at.%)
alloy, aged at 900{\deg}C for 50 hours, reduces the {\gamma}/{\gamma}' lattice misfit by {\approx}
40% (from +0.32% to +0.19%, measured at room temperature) and hence alters the {\gamma}' morphology
from cuboidal to round-cornered cuboidal precipitates. The composition profiles across the {\gamma}/{\gamma}'
interface by atom probe tomography (APT) reveals Re partitions to the {\gamma} phase (K_Re=0.34)
and also results in the partitioning reversal of Mo to the {\gamma} phase (K_Mo=0.90) from the {\gamma}'
precipitate. An inhomogeneous distribution of Gibbsian interfacial excess for the solute Re ({\Gamma}_Re,
ranging from 0.8 to 9.6 atom.nm-2) has been observed at the {\gamma}/{\gamma}' interface. A coarsening
study at 900{\deg}C (up to 1000 hours) suggests that the coarsening of {\gamma}' precipitates occurs
solely by an evaporation--condensation (EC) mechanism. This is contrary to that observed in the
Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb alloy as well as in some of the Ni-Al based and high mass density Co-Al-W based
superalloys, where {\gamma}' precipitates coarsen by coagulation/coalescence mechanism with
extensive alignment of {\gamma}' along <100> directions as a sign of microstructural instability.
The {\gamma}' coarsening rate exponent (K_r) and {\gamma}/{\gamma}' interfacial energy are estimated
to be 1.41 x 10-27 m3/s and 8.4 mJ/m2, which are comparable and lower than Co-Al-W based superalloys.
