Weyl semimetals such as the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP) host quasiparticle excitations resembling
the long sought after Weyl fermions at special band-crossing points in the band structure denoted
as Weyl nodes. They are predicted to exhibit a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) due
to the chiral anomaly if the Fermi energy is sufficiently close to the Weyl points. However, current
jetting effects, i.e. current inhomogeneities caused by a strong, field-induced conductivity
anisotropy in semimetals, have a similar experimental signature and therefore have hindered a
determination of the intrinsic LMR in the TaAs family so far. This work investigates the longitudinal
magnetoresistance of all four members of this family along the crystallographic $a$ and $c$ direction.
Our samples are of similar quality as those previously studied in the literature and have a similar
chemical potential as indicated by matching quantum oscillation (QO) frequencies. Care was taken
to ensure homogeneous currents in all measurements. As opposed to previous studies where this was
not done, we find a positive LMR that saturates in fields above 4 T in TaP, NbP and NbAs for $B||c$. Using
Fermi-surface geometries from band structure calculations that had been confirmed by experiment,
we show that this is the behaviour expected from a classical purely orbital effect, independent
on the distance of the Weyl node to the Fermi energy. The TaAs family of compounds is the first to show
such a simple LMR without apparent influences of scattering anisotropy. In configurations where
the orbital effect is small, i.e. for $B||a$ in NbAs and NbP, we find a non-monotonous LMR including
regions of negative LMR. We discuss a weak antilocalisation scenario as an alternative interpretation
than the chiral anomaly for these results, since it can fully account for the overall field dependence.
