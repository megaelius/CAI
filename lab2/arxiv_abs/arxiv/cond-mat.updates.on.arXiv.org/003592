Since the prediction of spin-gapless semiconducting behaviour in the Heusler compound Mn$_2$CoAl,
evidence of spin-gapless behaviour in thin films has typically been inferred from magnetotransport
measurements. The spin gapless state is however fragile, and further, band structure calculations
indicate that even a small amount of atomic disorder may destroy it. To explore the impact of disorder
on the properties of Mn$_2$CoAl, we have undertaken an experimental study of the structural, magnetotransport
and optical properties from the far infrared to the UV, on DC magnetron sputtered Mn$_2$CoAl thin
films. A very short mean free path, of the order of a lattice spacing, is extracted from the DC transport
data. A room temperature resistivity of 200 $\mu$$\Omega$cm along with a small and negative temperature
coefficient of resistance between 4 and 400 K was measured. We note that parameters of this magnitude
are often observed in disordered metals. We find this behaviour is well described by a weak localisation
model, a result that is supported by a large Drude contribution to the optical response, where a high
scattering rate is derived, which is equal to the value derived from the DC conductivity and Hall
effect data. We also note the strong similarities between the magnetotransport behaviour reported
for Mn$_2$CoAl films in the literature, including ours. We conclude that, based on comparisons
between the experimental data, and recent band structure calculations that explicitly include
disorder, as-prepared Mn$_2$CoAl films are best described as a disordered metal, rather than a
spin gapless semiconductor.
