The liquid spinodal, which is the bedrock of water thermodynamics, has long been discussed alongside
the elusive liquid-liquid critical point hidden behind the limit of homogeneous nucleation. This
has inspired numerous scenarios that attempt to explain water anomalies. Despite recent breakthrough
experiments eliminating several of thous scenarios, we lacked a tool to localize the spinodal and
the liquid-liquid critical point. We constructed a unique equation of state combining the famous
Speedy's equation and the liquid-liquid critical point to remove that deficit and to review these
explanations. For the first time, the proposed equation of state independently depicts the spinodal
in the presence of the liquid-liquid critical point and demonstrates that the explanation for water
anomalies based on the reentrance of the spinodal is not valid; this feature (reentering the spinodal)
was solely predicted based on the curved density surface caused by the existence of the second critical
point. However, the critical point alone is not sufficient to explain the shape of the density surface
of water. In the new equation, hydrogen bond cooperativity is important to force the critical point
to exist outside of zero temperature. Together with mounting evidence for the existence of a compressibility
maximum behind the homogeneous nucleation limit at positive pressure, the findings practically
exclude all explanations for water anomalies except for the existence of the liquid-liquid critical
point at positive pressure. Finally, an extensive study of heat capacity demonstrated profound
disagreement between the two major experimental heat capacity datasets and identified the more
accurate dataset.
