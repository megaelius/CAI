The quench dynamics in type-I inversion symmetric Weyl semimetals (WSM) are explored in this work
which, due to the form of the Hamiltonian, may be readily extended to two-dimensional Chern insulators.
We analyze the role of equilibrium topological properties characterized by the Chern number of
the pre-quench ground state in dictating the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system, specifically,
the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). By investigating the ground state
fidelity, it is found that a change in the signed Chern number constitutes a sufficient but not necessary
condition for the occurrence of DQPTs. Depending on the ratio of the transverse and longitudinal
hopping parameters, DQPTs may also be observed for quenches lying entirely within the initial Chern
phase. Additionally, we analyze the zeros of the boundary partition function discovering that
while the zeros generally form two-dimensional structures resulting in one-dimensional critical
times, infinitesimal quenches may lead to one-dimensional zeros with zero-dimensional critical
times provided the quench distance scales appropriately with the system size. This is strikingly
manifested in the nature of non-analyticies of the dynamical free energy, revealing a logarithmic
singularity. In addition, following recent experimental advances in observing the dynamical
Fisher zeros of the Loschmidt overlap amplitude through azimuthal Bloch phase vortices by Bloch-state
tomography, we rigorously investigate the same in WSMs. Finally, we establish the relationship
between the dimension of the critical times and the presence of dynamical vortices, demonstrating
that only one-dimensional critical times arising from two-dimensional manifolds of zeros of the
boundary partition function lead to dynamical vortices.
