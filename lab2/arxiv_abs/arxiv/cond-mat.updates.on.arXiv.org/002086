Photonic states of superconducting microwave cavities controlled by transmon ancillas provide
a platform for encoding and manipulating quantum information. A key challenge in scaling up the
platform is the requirement to communicate on demand the information between the cavities. It has
been recently demonstrated that a tunable bilinear interaction between two cavities can be realized
by coupling them to a bichromatically-driven transmon ancilla, which allows swapping and interfering
the multi-photon states of the cavities [Gao et al., Phys. Rev. X 8, 021073(2018)]. Here, we explore
both theoretically and experimentally the regime of relatively strong drives on the ancilla needed
to achieve fast SWAP gates but which can also lead to undesired non-perturbative effects that lower
the SWAP fidelity. We develop a theoretical formalism based on linear response theory that allows
one to calculate the rate of ancilla-induced interaction, decay and frequency shift of the cavities
in terms of a susceptibility matrix. We treat the drives non-perturbatively using Floquet theory,
and find that the interference of the two drives can strongly alter the system dynamics even in the
regime where the rotating wave approximation applies. We identify two major sources of infidelity
due to ancilla decoherence. i) Ancilla dissipation and dephasing leads to incoherent hopping among
Floquet states which occurs even when the ancilla is at zero temperature, resulting in a sudden change
of the SWAP rate. ii) The cavities inherit finite decay from the relatively lossy ancilla through
the inverse Purcell effect; the effect can be enhanced when the drive-induced AC Stark shift pushes
certain ancilla transition frequencies to the vicinity of the cavity frequencies. The theoretical
predictions agree quantitatively with the experimental results, paving the way for using the theory
to design future experiments.
