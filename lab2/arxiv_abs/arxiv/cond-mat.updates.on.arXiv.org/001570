Methylammonium lead tribromide perovskite (CH3NH3PbBr3, or MAPbBr3) as a photovoltaic material
has attracted a great deal of recent interest. Factors that are important in their application in
optoelectronic devices include their fractional contribution of the composition of the materials
as well as their microscopic arrangement that is responsible for the formation of well-defined
macroscopic structures. CH3NH3PbBr3 assumes different polymorphs (orthorhombic, tetragonal
and cubic) depending on the evolution temperature of the bulk material. Density functional theory
calculations have been performed on polymorphs of CH3NH3PbBr3 to demonstrate that the H atoms on
C of the methyl group in MA entrapped within a MAPbBr3 perovskite cage are not electronically innocent,
as is often contended. We show here that these H atoms are involved in attractive interactions with
the surrounding bromides of corner-sharing octahedra of the CH3NH3PbBr3 cage to form Br...H(-C)
hydrogen bonding interactions. This is analogous to the way the H atoms on N of the ammonium group
in MA form Br...H(-N) hydrogen bonding interactions to stabilize the structure of CH3NH3PbBr3.
Both these hydrogen bonding interactions are shown to persist regardless of the nature of the three
polymorphic forms of CH3NH3PbBr3. These, together with the Br...C(-N) carbon bonding, the Br...N(-C)
pnictogen bonding, and the Br...Br lump-hole type intermolecular non-covalent interactions
identified for the first time in this study, are shown to be collectively responsible for the eventual
emergence of the orthorhombic geometry of the CH3NH3PbBr3 system. These conclusions are arrived
at from a systematic analysis of the results obtained from combined DFT, Quantum Theory of Atoms
in Molecules, and Reduced Density Gradient Non-Covalent Interaction calculations carried out
on the three temperature-dependent polymorphic geometries of CH3NH3PbBr3.
