We constructed a four spin-1/2 model on a triangular star lattice to study the quantum statistical
behavior of the frustrated triple-spin clusters and double-spin clusters. The double-spin cluster
behaves as boson in zero-energy state and the highest excited state. While in the ground state and
other intermediate excited states, the double spin cluster shows a hybrid statistical factor of
fermion, boson and exotic quasiparticles. We find a definition for computing the statistical factor
between two triple-spin plaquette quasiparticles. The statistical matrix of exchanging two triple-spin
clusters is far beyond fermion and boson. The eigenstates of this model are maximal entangled quantum
states like Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and Yeo-Chua's genuine four-qubit entangled
state. The zero-energy state is a generalized singlet state of two double-spin clusters. While
the highest excited state is generalized symmetric state of two double-spin clusters. The quantum
entanglement of triple-spin cluster state is stronger than double-spin clusters. The von Neumann
entropy of triple-spin cluster state is much higher. This spin model is not directly related to Majorana
fermions. We represent Majorana fermions by string operator of spins following the inverse Jordan-Wigner
transformation. In this representation, the Majorana fermions do not behaves like independent
free operators but entangled with one another. Exchanging two Majorana fermions not only changed
the output wave function of the two fermions, but also rearranged all the rest components of the collective
wave function. This property is showed by computing the statistical matrix of Majorana fermions
for exchanging two particles. The output wave function of Majorana fermions is collectively entangled
quantum state. The exotic statistical matrix maybe useful for constructing quantum gate.
