Moir\'e superlattices of van der Waals heterostructures provide a powerful new way to engineer
the electronic structures of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Many novel quantum phenomena have
emerged in different moir\'e heterostructures, such as correlated insulators, superconductors,
and Chern insulators in graphene systems and moir\'e excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide
(TMDC) systems. Twisted phosphorene offers another attractive system to explore moir\'e physics
because phosphorene features an anisotropic rectangular lattice, different from the isotropic
hexagonal lattice in graphene and TMDC. Here we report emerging anisotropic moir\'e optical transitions
in twisted monolayer/bilayer phosphorene. The optical resonances in phosphorene moir\'e superlattice
depend sensitively on the twist angle between the monolayer and bilayer. Surprisingly, even for
a twist angle as large as 19{\deg} the moir\'e heterostructure exhibits optical resonances completely
different from those in the constituent monolayer and bilayer phosphorene. The new moir\'e optical
resonances exhibit strong linear polarization, with the principal axis lying close to but different
from the optical axis of bilayer phosphorene. Our ab initio calculations reveal that the {\Gamma}-point
direct bandgap and the rectangular lattice of phosphorene, unlike the K-point bandgap of hexagonal
lattice in graphene and TMDC, give rise to the remarkably strong moir\'e physics in large-twist-angle
phosphorene heterostructures. Our results highlight the exciting opportunities to explore moir\'e
physics in phosphorene and other van der Waals heterostructures with different lattice configurations.
