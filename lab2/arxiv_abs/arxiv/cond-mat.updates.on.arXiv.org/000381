We model the normal state of ferromagnetic superconductors with two general ellipsoidal Fermi
surfaces (FSs), one for each spin projection $\sigma=\{\uparrow,\downarrow\}$, each with its
ferromagnetically split chemical potential $\mu_{\sigma}$ and its three distinct single particle
effective masses, $\{m_{i\sigma}\}$, the geometric mean of which is $m_{\sigma}$. We study this
model in the presence of an arbitrarily oriented magnetic induction, ${\bf B}=\mu_{0}{\bf H}+{\bf
M_{0}}$, where ${\bf M_{0}}$ includes the Ising-like spontaneous ferromagnetic order, which
for URhGe is in the $c$-axis direction above the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$.
We assume the low-$T$ total particle density $\Sigma_{\sigma} n_{\sigma}({\bf B})$ to be independent
of ${\bf B}$, and obtain a self-consistent asymptotic expansion for $\sum_{\sigma}\Pi^{3/2}_{\sigma}({\bf
B})$ in even powers of ${\bf B}$, where $\Pi_{\sigma}({\bf B})=m_{\sigma}({\bf B})\mu_{\sigma}({\bf
B})$. We assume that the $\mu_{\sigma}({\bf B})$ are linear in ${\bf B}$ for both spins due to the
Zeeman interaction and that the remaining even ${\bf B}$ dependence in the $\Pi_{\sigma}({\bf
B})$ arises only from $m_{\downarrow}({\bf B})$. Our analogous expression for the Sommerfeld
constant $\gamma({\bf B})$ leads to good fits to the $\gamma({\bf H})$ data of Aoki and Flouquet
[J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. \textbf{81}, 011003 (2012)] obtained for the ferromagnetic superconductor
URhGe in the ferromagnetic, non-superconducting phase, with the applied magnetic field ${\bf
H}$ along each of the three crystallographic directions. We discuss this model in terms of the reentrant
superconducting properties of URhGe and UCoGe. This model can be generalized to an arbitrary number
of ellipsoidal FSs.
