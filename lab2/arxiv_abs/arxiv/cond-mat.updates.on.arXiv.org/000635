Graphene has hugely increased its quality in nanodevices thanks to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
acting as a supporting layer. Here, we investigate to which extent hBN and channel length scaling
can be exploited in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) to get competitive radio-frequency
(RF) performances. For such a purpose, we have applied multi-scale physics-based techniques to
assess the scalability of the transistor RF performance via reduction of the channel length. To
capture the specific physics of graphene supported on hBN, the carrier density dependent mobility
and saturation velocity were obtained from an ensemble Monte Carlo simulator that deals with the
relevant scattering mechanisms, such as intrinsic phonons, scattering with impurities and defects,
surface polar phonons with the substrate and gate dielectric, and electron-electron interactions.
This information is fed into a self-consistent simulator, which solves the drift-diffusion equation
coupled with the two-dimensional Poisson's equation to take full account of short channel effects.
The GFET electrical characteristics obtained with the simulator were benchmarked against experimental
data from our fabricated devices. RF performance and stability were evaluated as a function of the
channel length from a charge-conserving small-signal model. We found that device instability
poses a hard limit on the expected benefit that scalability is supposed to bring in terms of RF performance.
A careful choice of the bias point is necessary to avoid instability, although at the expense of getting
smaller performance. Despite this, maximum oscillation frequencies in the THz region are still
achievable for channel lengths of few hundreds of nanometer.
