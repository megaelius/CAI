We study the spectrum of Andreev bound states and Josephson currents across a junction of $N$ superconducting
wires which may have $s$- or $p$-wave pairing symmetries and develop a scattering matrix based formalism
which allows us to address transport across such junctions. For $N \ge 3$, it is well known that Berry
curvature terms contribute to the Josephson currents; we chart out situations where such terms
can have relatively large effects. For a system of three $s$- or three $p$-wave superconductors,
we provide analytic expressions for the Andreev bound state energies and study the Josephson currents
in response to a constant voltage applied across one of the wires; we find that the integrated transconductance
at zero temperature is quantized to integer multiples of $4e^2/h$, where $e$ is the electron charge
and $h = 2\pi \hbar$ is Planck's constant. For a sinusoidal current with frequency $\omega$ applied
across one of the wires in the junction, we find that Shapiro plateaus appear in the time-averaged
voltage $\langle V_1 \rangle$ across that wire for any rational fractional multiple (in contrast
to only integer multiples in junctions of two wires) of $2e \langle V_1 \rangle/(\hbar \omega)$.
We also use our formalism to study junctions of two $p$- and one $s$-wave wires. We find that the corresponding
Andreev bound state energies depend on the spin of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles; this produces
a net magnetic moment in such junctions. The time variation of these magnetic moments may be controlled
by an external applied voltage across the junction. We discuss experiments which may test our theory.
