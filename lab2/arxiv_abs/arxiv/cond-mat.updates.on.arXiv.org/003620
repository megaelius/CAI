We analyze the origin and properties of the chaotic dynamics of two atomic ensembles in a driven-dissipative
experimental setup, where they are collectively damped by a bad cavity mode and incoherently pumped
by a Raman laser. Starting from the mean-field equations, we explain the emergence of chaos by way
of quasiperiodicity -- presence of two or more incommensurate frequencies. This is known as the
Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse route to chaos. The equations of motion have a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetry
with respect to the interchange of the two ensembles. However, some of the attractors of these equations
spontaneously break this symmetry. To understand the emergence and subsequent properties of various
attractors, we concurrently study the mean-field trajectories, Poincar\'{e} sections, maximum
and conditional Lyapunov exponents, and power spectra. Using Floquet analysis, we show that quasiperiodicity
is born out of non $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetric oscillations via a supercritical Neimark-Sacker
bifurcation. Changing the detuning between the level spacings in the two ensembles and the repump
rate results in the synchronization of the two chaotic ensembles. In this regime, the chaotic intensity
fluctuations of the light radiated by the two ensembles are identical. Identifying the synchronization
manifold, we understand the origin of synchronized chaos as a tangent bifurcation intermittency
of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetric oscillations. At its birth, synchronized chaos is unstable.
The interaction of this attractor with other attractors causes on-off intermittency until the
synchronization manifold becomes sufficiently attractive. We also show coexistence of different
phases in small pockets near the boundaries.
