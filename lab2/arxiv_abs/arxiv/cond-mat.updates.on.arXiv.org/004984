The evaporation of multi-component droplets is relevant to various applications but challenging
to study due to the complex physicochemical dynamics. Recently, Li (2018) reported evaporation-triggered
segregation in 1,2-hexanediol-water binary droplets. In this present work, we added 0.5 wt% silicone
oil into the 1,2-hexanediol-water binary solution. This minute silicone oil concentration dramatically
modifies the evaporation process as it triggers an early extraction of the 1,2-hexanediol from
the mixture. Surprisingly, we observe that the segregation of 1,2-hexanediol forms plumes, rising
up from the rim of the sessile droplet towards the apex during the droplet evaporation. By orientating
the droplet upside down, i.e., by studying a pendant droplet, the absence of the plumes indicates
that the flow structure is induced by buoyancy, which drives a Rayleigh-Taylor instability (i.e.,
driven by density differences & gravitational acceleration). From micro-PIV measurement, we
further prove that the segregation of the non-volatile component (1,2-hexanediol) hinders the
evaporation near the contact line, which leads to a suppression of the Marangoni flow in this region.
Hence, on long time scales, gravitational effects play the dominant role in the flow structure,
rather than Marangoni flows. We compare the measurement of the evaporation rate with the diffusion
model of Popov (2005), coupled with Raoult's law and the activity coefficient. This comparison
indeed confirms that the silicone-oil-triggered segregation of the non-volatile 1,2-hexanediol
significantly delays the evaporation. With an extended diffusion model, in which the influence
of the segregation has been implemented, the evaporation can be well described.
