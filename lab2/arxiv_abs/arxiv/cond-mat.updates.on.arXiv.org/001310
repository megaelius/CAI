We develop a framework to analyze one-dimensional topological superconductors with charge conservation.
In particular, we consider models with $N$ flavors of fermions and $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^N$ symmetry,
associated with the conservation of the fermionic parity of each flavor. For a single flavor, we
recover the result that a distinct topological phase with exponentially localized zero modes does
not exist due to absence of a gap to single particles in the bulk. For $N>1$, however, we show that the
ends of the system can host low-energy, exponentially-localized modes. The analysis can readily
be generalized to systems in other symmetry classes. To illustrate these ideas, we focus on lattice
models with $SO\left(N\right)$ symmetric interactions, and study the phase transition between
the trivial and the topological gapless phases using bosonization and a weak-coupling renormalization
group analysis. As a concrete example, we study in detail the case of $N=3$. We show that in this case,
the topologically non-trivial superconducting phase corresponds to a gapless analogue of the
Haldane phase in spin-1 chains. In this phase, although the bulk is gapless to single particle excitations,
the ends host spin-$1/2$ degrees of freedom which are exponentially localized and protected by
the spin gap in the bulk. We obtain the full phase diagram of the model numerically, using density
matrix renormalization group calculations. Within this model, we identify the self-dual line
studied by Andrei and Destri [Nucl. Phys. B, 231(3), 445-480 (1984)], as a first-order transition
line between the gapless Haldane phase and a trivial gapless phase. This allows us to identify the
propagating spin-$1/2$ kinks in the Andrei-Destri model as the topological end-modes present
at the domain walls between the two phases.
