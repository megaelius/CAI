The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical variational
algorithm designed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. Despite its promise for near-term
quantum applications, not much is currently understood about QAOA's performance beyond its lowest-depth
variant. An essential but missing ingredient for understanding and deploying QAOA is a constructive
approach to carry out the outer-loop classical optimization. We provide an in-depth study of the
performance of QAOA on MaxCut problems by developing an efficient parameter-optimization procedure
and revealing its ability to exploit non-adiabatic operations. Building on observed patterns
in optimal parameters, we propose heuristic strategies for initializing optimizations to find
quasi-optimal $p$-level QAOA parameters in $O(\text{poly}(p))$ time, whereas the standard strategy
of random initialization requires $2^{O(p)}$ optimization runs to achieve similar performance.
We then benchmark QAOA and compare it with quantum annealing, especially on difficult instances
where adiabatic quantum annealing fails due to small spectral gaps. The comparison reveals that
QAOA can learn via optimization to utilize non-adiabatic mechanisms to circumvent the challenges
associated with vanishing spectral gaps. Finally, we provide a realistic resource analysis on
the experimental implementation of QAOA. When quantum fluctuations in measurements are accounted
for, we illustrate that optimization will be important only for problem sizes beyond numerical
simulations, but accessible on near-term devices. We propose a feasible implementation of large
MaxCut problems with a few hundred vertices in a system of 2D neutral atoms, reaching the regime to
challenge the best classical algorithms.
