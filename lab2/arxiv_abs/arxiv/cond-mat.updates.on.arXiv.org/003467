While in most ferro or antiferromagnetic materials there is a unique crystallographic direction,
including crystallographically equivalent directions, in which the moments like to point due
to spin-orbit coupling, in some, the direction of the spin reorients as a function of a certain physical
parameter such as temperature, pressure etc. Fe3Sn2 is a kagome ferromagnet with an onset of ferromagnetism
below 650 K, and undergoes a spin reorientation near 150 K. While it is known that the moments in Fe3Sn2
point perpendicular to the kagome plane at high temperatures and parallel to the kagome plane at
low temperatures, how the distribution of the magnetic domains in the two different spin orientations
evolve throughout the spin reorientation is not well known. Furthermore, while there have been
various reports on the magnetotransport properties in the Hall configuration, the angular dependence
of magnetoresistance has not been studied so far. In this paper, we have examined the spin reorientation
by using anisotropic magnetoresistivity in detail, exploiting the dependence of the resistivity
on the direction between magnetization and applied current. We are able to determine the distribution
of the magnetic domains as a function of temperature between 360 K to 2 K and the reorientation transition
to peak at 120 K. We discover that both out of plane and in plane phases coexist at temperatures around
the spin reorientation, indicative of a first order transition. Although the volume of the magnetic
domains in the different phases sharply changes at the spin reorientation transition, the electronic
structure for a specific magnetization is not influenced by the spin reorientation. In contrast,
we observe an electronic transition around 40 K, hitherto unreported, and reflected in both the
zero-field resistivity and anisotropic resistivity.
