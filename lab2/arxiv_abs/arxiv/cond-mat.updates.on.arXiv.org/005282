The interaction between light and matter can be utilized to qualitatively alter physical properties
of materials. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have explored this possibility of controlling
matter by light based on driving many-body systems via strong classical electromagnetic radiation,
leading to a time-dependent Hamiltonian for electronic or lattice degrees of freedom. To avoid
inevitable heating, pump-probe setups with ultrashort laser pulses have so far been used to study
transient light-induced modifications in materials. Here, we pursue yet another direction of
controlling quantum matter by modifying quantum fluctuations of its electromagnetic environment.
In contrast to earlier proposals on light-enhanced electron-electron interactions, we consider
a dipolar quantum many-body system embedded in a cavity composed of metal mirrors, and formulate
a theoretical framework to manipulate its equilibrium properties on the basis of quantum light-matter
interaction. We analyze hybridization of different types of the fundamental excitations, including
dipolar phonons, cavity photons, and plasmons in metal mirrors, arising from the cavity confinement
in the regime of strong light-matter interaction. This hybridization qualitatively alters the
nature of the collective excitations and can be used to selectively control energy-level structures
in a wide range of platforms. Most notably, we show that in quantum paraelectrics the cavity-induced
softening of infrared optical phonons enhances the ferroelectric phase in comparison with the
bulk materials. Our findings suggest an intriguing possibility of inducing a superradiant-type
transition via the light-matter coupling without external pumping. We also discuss possible applications
of the cavity-induced modifications in collective excitations to molecular materials and excitonic
devices.
