In civil, mechanical, and aerospace engineering, structural dynamics is commonly understood
to be a discipline concerned with the analysis and characterization of the vibratory response of
structures. Key elements of the response are the amplitude, phase, and damping ratio, which are
quantities that vary with the excitation frequency. In this paper, we extend the discipline of structural
dynamics to the realm of materials engineering by intrinsically building localized substructures
within, or attached to, the material domain itself$-$which is viewed as an extended medium without
defined external boundaries. Our system is essentially a locally resonant elastic metamaterial,
except here it is viewed from the perspective of unique dissipation characteristics rather than
subwavelength effective properties or band gaps, as widely done in the literature. We provide a
theory, validated by experiments, for substructurally synthesizing the dissipation under the
conditions of free-wave motion, i.e., waves not constrained to a prescribed driving frequency.
We use an extended elastic beam with attached pillars as an example of a metamaterial. When compared
to an identical infinite beam with no attached substructures, we show that within certain frequency
ranges the metamaterial exhibits either enhanced or reduced dissipation$-$which we refer to as
positive and negative metadamping, respectively. These regimes are rigorously identified and
characterized using the metamaterial's band structure and wavenumber-dependent dissipation
diagram. This theory impacts applications that require a combination of high stiffness and high
damping or, conversely, applications that benefit from a reduction in loss without the need to change
the backbone constituent material.
