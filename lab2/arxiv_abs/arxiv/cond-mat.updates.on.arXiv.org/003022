Spin currents can be generated within the bulk of magnetically ordered solids due to heat flow even
in the absence of an interface, an effect called intrinsic spin-Seebeck. This bulk spin current
is composed of a non-equilibrium thermal magnon cloud, parametrized by the magnon chemical potential
($\mu_{m}$), with a diffusion length of several microns in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) as measured
using steady-state non-local measurements. Here we present transient opto-thermal measurements
of the spin-Seebeck effect (SSE) as a function of temperature, revealing the time evolution of $\mu_{m}$
due to intrinsic SSE in YIG. In contrast to the spin current generated by the interface temperature
difference, developing at times < 2 ns, the intrinsic SSE signal continues to evolve at times > 500
$\mu$s. By analyzing the magnitude of the signal components, we find that the bulk, rather than the
interface, spin current dominates the temperature dependence of SSE in bulk YIG. Time-dependent
SSE data are fit to a multi-temperature model of coupled spin/heat transport using the finite element
method where the magnon spin lifetime ($\tau$) and magnon-phonon thermalization time ($\tau_{mp}$)
are used as fit parameters. From 300 K to 4 K, $\tau_{mp}$ varies from 1 to 10 ns, whereas $\tau$ varies
from 2 to 60 $\mu$s with the spin lifetime peaking at 90 K. At low temperature, a reduction in $\tau$
is observed consistent with impurity relaxation reported in ferromagnetic resonance measurements.
These results demonstrate that the thermally-excited bulk spin current is composed of extremely
low frequency magnons, ~10 GHz providing insight to the microscopic scattering processes involved
in magnon spin/heat diffusion.
