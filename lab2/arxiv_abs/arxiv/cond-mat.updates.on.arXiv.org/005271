Piezoelectric surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are powerful for investigating and controlling elementary
and collective excitations in condensed matter. In semiconductors SAWs have been used to reveal
the underlying spatial and temporal structure of quantum phases of electronic matter, produce
quantized charge pumping, transfer quantum information, and coherently control single electron
states, culminating in the possibility of SAW-driven electronic flying qubits. However important
challenges remain in protecting the coherence of propagating electrons from uncontrolled background
nuclear spins, chemical dopants and spin-orbit crystal fields. In contrast, electrons trapped
on the surface of superfluid helium form a ultra-clean low-dimensional electron system devoid
of the imperfections limiting the coherence in semiconductors. However, SAWs have not, to-date,
been employed to manipulate electrons in this system or to explore the development of flying-qubits.
Additionally, electrons on helium form strongly-interacting Coulomb liquid and solid states
having collective dynamics that can couple to SAWs. Here we report on the first coupling of electrons
on helium to an evanescent piezoelectric SAW. The electrons surf with the piezoelectric wave and
we demonstrate high-frequency charge pumping in this system for the first time. With this piezoacoustic
method we can precisely transport as little as ~0.01% of the total electron density, opening the
door to quantized charge pumping, the possibility of electrical metrology, and ultimately single
electron state transfer with electrons on helium. We also show that SAWs are a route to directly investigating
the high-frequency dynamical response, and relaxational processes, of collective excitations
of the electronic liquid and solid phases of electrons on helium.
