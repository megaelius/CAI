In a previous paper (Leblond et al., 2011), we proposed a theoretical interpretation of the experimentally
well known instability of coplanar crack propagation in mode I+III. The interpretation relied
on a stability analysis based on analytical expressions of the stress intensity factors for a crack
slightly perturbed both within and out of its original plane, due to Gao and Rice (1986) and Movchan
et al. (1998), coupled with a double propagation criterion combining Griffith's energetic condition
and principle of local symmetry. Under such assumptions instability modes were indeed evidenced
for values of the mode mixity ratio of the mode III to mode I stress intensity factors applied remotely
larger than some threshold depending only on Poisson's ratio. Unfortunately, the predicted thresholds
were much larger than those generally observed for typical values of this material parameter. While
the subcritical character of the nonlinear bifurcation from coplanar to fragmented fronts has
been proposed as a possible explanation for this discrepancy (Chen et al., 2015), we propose here
an alternative explanation based on the introduction of a constitutive relationship between the
fracture energy and the mode mixity ratio, which is motivated by experimental observations. By
reexamining the linear stability analysis of a planar propagating front, we show that such a relationship
suffices, provided that it is strong enough, to lower significantly the threshold value of the mode
mixity ratio for instability so as to bring it in a range more consistent with experiments. Interesting
formulae are also derived for the distributions of the perturbed stress intensity factors and energy
release rate, in the special case of perturbations of the crack surface and front obeying the principle
of local symmetry and having reached a stationary state.
