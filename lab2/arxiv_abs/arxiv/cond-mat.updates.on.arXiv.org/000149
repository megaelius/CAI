After a recent series of rapid and exciting developments, the long search for the Majorana fermion
- the elusive quantum entity at the border between particles and antiparticles - has produced the
first positive experimental results, but is not over yet. Originally proposed by E. Majorana in
the context of particle physics, Majorana fermions have a condensed matter analog in the zero-energy
bound states emerging in topological superconductors. A promising route to engineering topological
superconductors capable of hosting Majorana zero modes consists of proximity coupling semiconductor
thin films or nanowires with strong spin-orbit interaction to conventional s-wave superconductors
in the presence of an external Zeeman field. The Majorana zero mode is predicted to emerge above a
certain critical Zeeman field as a zero-energy state localized near the order parameter defects,
viz., vortices for thin films and wire-ends for the nanowire. These Majorana bound states are expected
to manifest non--Abelian quantum statistics, which makes them ideal building blocks for fault--tolerant
topological quantum computation. This review provides an update on current status of the search
for Majorana fermions in semiconductor nanowires by focusing on the recent developments, in particular
the period following the first reports of experimental signatures consistent with the realization
of Majorana bound states in semiconductor nanowire--superconductor hybrid structures. We start
with a discussion of the fundamental aspects of the subject, followed by considerations on the realistic
modeling which is a critical bridge between theoretical predictions based on idealized conditions
and the real world, as probed experimentally. The last part is dedicated to a few intriguing issues
that were brought to the fore by the recent encouraging experimental advances.
