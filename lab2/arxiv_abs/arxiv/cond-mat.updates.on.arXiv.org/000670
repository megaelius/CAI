We study the dynamics of solutions of infinitely thin needles up to densities deep in the semidilute
regime by Brownian dynamics simulations. For high densities, these solutions become strongly
entangled and the motion of a needle is essentially restricted to a one-dimensional sliding in a
confining tube composed of neighboring needles. From the density-dependent behavior of the orientational
and translational diffusion, we extract the long-time transport coefficients and the geometry
of the confining tube. The sliding motion within the tube becomes visible in the non-Gaussian parameter
of the translational motion as an extended plateau at intermediate times and in the intermediate
scattering function as an algebraic decay. This transient dynamic arrest is also corroborated
by the local exponent of the mean-square displacements perpendicular to the needle axis. Moreover,
the probability distribution of the displacements perpendicular to the needle becomes strongly
non-Gaussian, rather it displays an exponential distribution for large displacements. On the
other hand, based on the analysis of higher-order correlations of the orientation we find that the
rotational motion becomes diffusive again for strong confinement. At coarse-grained time and
length scales, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the needle for the high entanglement is captured
by a single freely diffusing phantom needle with long-time transport coefficients obtained from
the needle in solution. The time-dependent dynamics of the phantom needle is also assessed analytically
in terms of spheroidal wave functions. The dynamic behavior of the needle in solution is found to
be identical to needle Lorentz systems, where a tracer needle explores a quenched disordered array
of other needles.
