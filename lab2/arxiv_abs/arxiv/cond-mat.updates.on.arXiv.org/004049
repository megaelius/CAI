We not only reproduce computationally the burst of spin waves (SWs) of very short wavelengths observed
in recent experiments [S. Woo et al., Nat. Phys. 13, 448 (2017)] where magnetic field drives annihilation
of two domain walls (DWs) within a ferromagnetic nanowire, but furthermore we predict that this
will be accompanied by a peculiar pumping of electronic spin currents in the absence of any bias voltage.
Prior to the instant of annihilation, their power spectrum is broadband with finite width around
a mean frequency, collapsing to the usual narrow peak around a single frequency after annihilation.
The pumping stems from time-dependent fields introduced into the quantum Hamiltonian of conduction
electrons by the classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments comprising the domains. The
pumped currents carry spin-polarized electrons which, in turn, exert spin-transfer torque on
localized magnetic moments, so that the self-consistent nonequilibrium state of the whole system
cannot be captured by standard classical micromagnetic simulations where conduction electrons
are completely absent. Instead, we use recently developed multiscale framework, combining time-dependent
electronic nonequilibrium Green functions with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation,
to simulate coupled dynamics of magnetic moments and conduction electrons. The pumped currents
inside the annihilation region effectively generate time-retarded damping in the LLG equation
which can dramatically affect the SW spectrum. They will also flow out of the annihilation region,
where they can be converted into rapidly changing in time charge currents via the inverse spin Hall
effect as a potential source of broadband electromagnetic radiation.
