With the advent of increasingly elaborate experimental techniques in physics, chemistry and materials
sciences, measured data are becoming bigger and more complex. The observables are typically a function
of several stimuli resulting in multidimensional data sets spanning a range of experimental parameters.
As an example, a common approach to study ferroelectric switching is to observe effects of applied
electric field, but switching can also be enacted by pressure and is influenced by strain fields,
material composition, temperature, time, etc. Moreover, the parameters are usually interdependent,
so that their decoupling toward univariate measurements or analysis may not be straightforward.
On the other hand, both explicit and hidden parameters provide an opportunity to gain deeper insight
into the measured properties, provided there exists a well-defined path to capture and analyze
such data. Here, we introduce a new, two-dimensional approach to represent hysteretic response
of a material system to applied electric field. Utilizing ferroelectric polarization as a model
hysteretic property, we demonstrate how explicit consideration of electromechanical response
to two rather than one control voltages enables significantly more transparent and robust interpretation
of observed hysteresis, such as differentiating between charge trapping and ferroelectricity.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how the new data representation readily fits into a variety of machinelearning
methodologies, from unsupervised classification of the origins of hysteretic response via linear
clustering algorithms to neural-network-based inference of the sample temperature based on the
specific morphology of hysteresis.
