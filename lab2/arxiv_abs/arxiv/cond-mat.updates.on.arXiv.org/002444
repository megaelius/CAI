Pure Topological Insulating materials preserve a unique electronic state comprising of bulk insulating
gap and conducting surface states. Here we use bulk Bi2Se3 single crystals possessing Se vacancy
defects as a prototype topological insulator (TI) material for exploring the effect of non-magnetic
disorder on the conducting properties of TIs. We employ a sensitive, non-contact, mutual inductance
based technique for measuring the surface and bulk contribution to electrical conductivity in
the TI. We discern the different contributions, by observing that predominant surface electrical
conduction produces linear frequency dependence of the pickup signal while bulk conductivity
gives rise to quadratic frequency dependence. We also see an algebraic temperature dependent surface
conductivity while an activated bulk conductivity. Using the above we uncover an interplay between
surface and bulk contribution to electrical conductivity in the TI as a function of temperatures.
In the Bi2Se3 crystals the transformation from surface to bulk dominated electrical transport
is found to occur close to 70 K. This temperature range matches well with our results from activated
bulk electrical transport results which shows an activation energy scale, delta which is in the
millieV range. The gap delta is much less than the bulk band gap in Bi2Se3, and which we argue is associated
with defect states in the TI material. To understand our results, we propose a model of a TI comprising
of an inhomogeneous low electrically conducting medium (bulk) which is sandwiched between thin
two high electrically conducting sheets (surface). The inhomogeneous TI state we argue is generated
by Selenium vacancies defects in Bi2Se3, which is responsible for producing an interplay between
bulk and surface conductivity.
