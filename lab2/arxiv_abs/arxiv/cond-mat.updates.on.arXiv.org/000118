We present a comprehensive numerical investigation of non-universal parameters and corrections
related to interface fluctuations of models belonging to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality
class, in d=1+1, for both flat and curved geometries. We analyzed two classes of models. In the isotropic
models the non-universal parameters are uniform along the surface, whereas in the anisotropic
growth they vary. In the latter case, that produces curved surfaces, the statistics must be computed
independently along fixed directions. The ansatz h = v t + (\Gamma t)^{1/3} \chi + \eta, where \chi
is a Tracy-Widom (geometry-dependent) distribution and \eta is a time-independent correction,
is probed. Our numerical analysis shows that the non-universal parameter \Gamma determined through
the first cumulant leads to a very good accordance with the extended KPZ ansatz for all investigated
models in contrast with the estimates of \Gamma obtained from higher order cumulants that indicate
a violation of the generalized ansatz for some of the studied models. We associate the discrepancies
to corrections of unknown nature, which hampers an accurate estimation of \Gamma at finite times.
The discrepancies in \Gamma via different approaches are relatively small but sufficient to modify
the scaling law t^{-1/3} that characterize the finite-time corrections due to \eta. Among the investigated
models, we have revisited an off-lattice Eden model that supposedly disobeyed the shift in the mean
scaling as t^{-1/3} and showed that there is a crossover to the expected regime. We have found model-dependent
(non-universal) corrections for cumulants of order n > 1. All investigated models are consistent
with a further term of order t^{-1/3} in the KPZ ansatz.
