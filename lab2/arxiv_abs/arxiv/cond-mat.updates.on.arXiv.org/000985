Molecular-scale manipulation of electronic/ionic charge accumulation in materials is a preeminent
challenge, particularly in electrochemical energy storage. Layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals
exemplify a diverse family of materials that permit ions to reversibly associate with a host atomic
lattice by intercalation into interlamellar gaps. Motivated principally by the search for high-capacity
battery anodes, ion intercalation in composites of vdW materials is a subject of intense study.
Yet the precise role and ability of heterolayers to modify intercalation reactions remains elusive.
Previous studies of vdW hybrids represented ensemble measurements at macroscopic films or powders,
which do not permit the isolation and investigation of the chemistry at 2-dimensional (2D) interfaces
individually. Here, we demonstrate the electro-intercalation of lithium at the level of individual
atomic interfaces of dissimilar vdW layers. Electrochemical devices based on vdW heterostructures
comprised of deterministically stacked hexagonal boron nitride, graphene (G) and molybdenum
dichalcogenide (MoCh2; Ch = S, Se) layers are fabricated, enabling the direct resolution of intermediate
stages in the intercalation of discrete heterointerfaces and the extent of charge transfer to individual
layers. Operando magnetoresistance and optical spectroscopy coupled with low-temperature quantum
magneto-oscillation measurements show that the creation of intimate vdW heterointerfaces between
G and MoCh2 engenders over 10-fold accumulation of charge in MoCh2 compared to MoCh2/MoCh2 homointerfaces,
while enforcing a ca. 0.5 V more negative intercalation potential than that of bulk MoCh2. Beyond
energy storage, our new experimental methodology to manipulate and characterize the electrochemical
behavior of layered systems opens up novel approaches to controlling the charge density in 2D (opto)electronic
devices.
