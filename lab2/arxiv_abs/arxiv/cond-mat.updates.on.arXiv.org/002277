We use DFT to compute core structures of $a_0[100](010)$ edge, $a_0[100](011)$ edge, $a_0/2[\bar{1}\bar{1}1](1\bar{1}0)$
edge, and $a_0/2[111](1\bar{1}0)$ $71^{\circ}$ mixed dislocations in bcc Fe. The calculations
use flexible boundary conditions (FBC), which allow dislocations to relax as isolated defects
by coupling the core to an infinite harmonic lattice through the lattice Green function (LGF). We
use LGFs of dislocated geometries in contrast to previous FBC-based dislocation calculations
that use the bulk crystal LGF. Dislocation LGFs account for changes in topology in the core as well
as strain throughout the lattice. A bulk-like approximation for the force constants in a dislocated
geometry leads to LGFs that optimize the cores of the $a_0[100](010)$ edge, $a_0[100](011)$ edge,
and $a_0/2[111](1\bar{1}0)$ $71^{\circ}$ mixed dislocations. This approximation fails for
the $a_0/2[\bar{1}\bar{1}1](1\bar{1}0)$ dislocation, so here we derive the LGF using accurate
force constants from a Gaussian approximation potential. The standard deviations of dislocation
Nye tensor distributions quantify the widths of the cores. The relaxed cores are compact, and the
magnetic moments on the Fe atoms closely follow the volumetric strain distributions in the cores.
We also compute the core structures of these dislocations using eight different classical interatomic
potentials, and quantify symmetry differences between the cores using the Fourier coefficients
of their Nye tensor distributions. Most of the core structures computed using the classical potentials
agree well with DFT results. The DFT geometries provide benchmarking for classical potential studies
of work-hardening, as well as substitutional and interstitial sites for computing solute-dislocation
interactions that serve as inputs for mesoscale models of solute strengthening and solute diffusion
near dislocations.
