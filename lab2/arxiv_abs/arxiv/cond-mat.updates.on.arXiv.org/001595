A common feature of topological insulators is that they are characterized by topologically invariant
quantity such as the Chern number and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index. This quantity distinguishes a nontrivial
topological system from a trivial one. A topological phase transition may occur when there are two
topologically distinct phases, and it is usually defined by a gap closing point where the topologically
invariant quantity is ill-defined. In this paper, we show that the magnon bands in the strained (distorted)
kagome-lattice ferromagnets realize an example of a topological magnon phase transition in the
realistic parameter regime of the system. When spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected (i.e. no
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction), we show that all three magnon branches are dispersive with
no flat band, and there exists a critical point where tilted Dirac and semi-Dirac point coexist in
the magnon spectra. The critical point separates two gapless magnon phases as opposed to the usual
phase transition. Upon the inclusion of SOC, we realize a topological magnon phase transition point
at the critical strain $\delta_c=\frac{1}{2}\big[ 1-(D/J)^2\big]$, where $D$ and $J$ denote
the perturbative SOC and the Heisenberg spin exchange interaction respectively. It separates
two distinct topological magnon phases with different Chern numbers for $\delta<\delta_c$ and
for $\delta>\delta_c$. The associated anomalous thermal Hall conductivity develops an abrupt
change at $\delta_c$, due to the divergence of the Berry curvature in momentum space. The proposed
topological magnon phase transition is experimentally feasible by applying external perturbations
such as uniaxial strain or pressure.
