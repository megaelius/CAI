Mott tunneling dynamics are entirely distinct from the superfluid ones and ground state properties
of quantum phases can predict highly non-equilibrium behavior. We consider quasi-bound state
dynamics or tunneling escape in the Bose-Hubbard model from a behind a finite barrier, which can
be realized in quantum simulators. In the superfluid regime we find that escape dynamics are wave-like
and coherent, leading to interference patterns in the density with a non-exponential but still
rapid decay process. Quantum entropy production peaks when about half the atoms have escaped. In
contrast, in the Mott insulator regime we find the dynamics are atom-like and incoherent, with no
interference fringes. Quantum entropy production peaks at double the value of the superfluid case
and when only about one quarter of the atoms have escaped. Despite stronger repulsive interactions,
tunneling is significantly slowed by the presence of a Mott gap, creating an effective extra barrier
to overcome, and the decay process is nearly linear. Moreover, we introduce a new quantum tunneling
rate, the fluctuation rate, which shows oscillatory interference between the trapped and the escaped
atoms on short time scales beyond the constant waiting time known for single-particle tunneling
before exponential decay ensues. The fluctuation rate is overall positive for the superfluid and
initially negative for the Mott insulator, only turning positive in the latter case when about half
the atoms have escaped. Finally, off-diagonal correlators show entirely different structure
for the two quantum phases. In the superfluid case, the barrier height and interaction strength
can be used to tune from pulsed to continuous-wave positive correlation emissions in the escape
region. In the Mott insulator, negative correlations between the trap and the escape region emphasize
emission one atom at a time.
