We study the scaling behavior of two-dimensional (2D) crystalline membranes in the flat phase by
a renormalization group (RG) method and an $\epsilon$-expansion. Generalization of the problem
to non-integer dimensions, necessary to control the $\epsilon$-expansion, is achieved by dimensional
continuation of a well-known effective theory describing out-of-plane fluctuations coupled
to phonon-mediated interactions via a scalar composite field, equivalent for small deformations
to the local Gaussian curvature. The effective theory, which will be referred to as Gaussian curvature
interaction (GCI) model, is equivalent to theories of elastic $D$-dimensional manifolds fluctuating
in a $(D + d_{c})$-dimensional embedding space in the physical case $D = 2$ for arbitrary $d_{c}$.
For $D\neq 2$, instead, the GCI model is not equivalent to a direct dimensional continuation of elastic
membrane theory and it defines an alternative generalization to generic internal dimension $D$.
We calculate explicitly RG functions at two-loop order and determine the exponent $\eta$ characterizing
the long-wavelength scaling of correlation functions to order $\epsilon^{2}$ in an $\epsilon=(4-D)$-expansion.
The self-consistent screening approximation (SCSA) for the GCI model is shown to be exact to O($\epsilon^{2}$).
For $d_{c} = 1$, the O($\epsilon^{2}$) correction is suppressed by a small numerical prefactor.
As a result, despite the large value of $\epsilon = 2$, extrapolation of the first and second order
results to $D = 2$ leads to very close numbers, $\eta = 0.8$ and $\eta \simeq 0.795$. The calculated
exponent values are close to earlier reference results obtained by non-perturbative RG, the SCSA
and numerical simulations. These indications suggest that a perturbative analysis of the GCI model
could provide an useful framework for accurate quantitative predictions of the scaling exponent
even at $D = 2$.
