When water molecules are confined to nanoscale spacings, such as in the nanometer size pores of activated
carbon fiber (ACF), their freezing point gets suppressed down to very low temperatures ($\sim$
150 K), leading to a metastable liquid state with remarkable physical properties. We have investigated
the ambient pressure diffusive dynamics of water in microporous Kynol\texttrademark ACF-10 (average
pore size $\sim$11.6 {\AA}, with primarily slit-like pores) from temperature $T=$ 280 K in its stable
liquid state down to $T=$ 230 K into the metastable supercooled phase. The observed characteristic
relaxation times and diffusion coefficients are found to be respectively higher and lower than
those in bulk water, indicating a slowing down of the water mobility with decreasing temperature.
The observed temperature-dependent average relaxation time $<\tau>$ when compared to
previous findings indicate that it is the size of the confining pores - not their shape - that primarily
affects the dynamics of water for pore sizes larger than 10 {\AA}. The experimental observations
are compared to complementary molecular dynamics simulations of a model system, in which we studied
the diffusion of water within the 11.6 {\AA} gap of two parallel graphene sheets. We find generally
a reasonable agreement between the observed and calculated relaxation times at the low momentum
transfer $Q$ ($Q\le 0.9$ \AA${^{-1}}$). At high $Q$ however, where localized dynamics becomes
relevant, this ideal system does not satisfactorily reproduce the measurements. The best agreement
is obtained for the diffusion parameter $D$ associated with the hydrogen-site when a representative
stretched exponential function, rather than the standard bi-modal exponential model, is used
to parameterize the self-correlation function $I(Q,t)$.
