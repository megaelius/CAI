We consider the real time dynamics of $N$ noninteracting fermions in $d=1$. They evolve in a trapping
potential $V(x)$, starting from the equilibrium state in a potential $V_0(x)$. We study the time
evolution of the Wigner function $W(x,p,t)$ in the phase space $(x,p)$, and the associated kernel
which encodes all correlation functions. At $t=0$ the Wigner function for large $N$ is uniform in
phase space inside the Fermi volume, and vanishes at the Fermi surf over a scale $e_N$ being described
by a universal scaling function related to the Airy function. We obtain exact solutions for the Wigner
function, the density, and the correlations in the case of harmonic and inverse square potentials,
for several $V_0(x)$. In the large $N$ limit, near the edges where the density vanishes, we obtain
limiting kernels (of the Airy or Bessel types) that retain the form found in equilibrium, up to a time
dependent rescaling. For non-harmonic traps the evolution of the Fermi volume is more complex.
Nevertheless we show that, for intermediate times, the Fermi surf is still described by the same
equilibrium scaling function, with a non-trivial time and space dependent width which we compute
analytically. We discuss the multi-time correlations and obtain their explicit scaling forms
valid near the edge for the harmonic oscillator. Finally, we address the large time limit where relaxation
to the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) was found to occur in the "classical" regime $\hbar \sim
1/N$. Using the diagonal ensemble we compute the Wigner function in the quantum case (large $N$,
fixed $\hbar$) and show that it agrees with the GGE. We also obtain the higher order (non-local) correlations
in the diagonal ensemble.
