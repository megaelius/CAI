We have investigated the thermal-transport properties of the kagome antiferromagnet Cd-kapellasite
(Cd-K). At low temperatures, the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ was strongly
suppressed in the magnetic field, suggesting a large spin contribution $\kappa_{xx}^\textrm{sp}$.
Clear thermal Hall signals were observed in the spin liquid phase in all Cd-K samples. We find a large
sample dependence of the magnitude of the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ of Cd-K, of which
the peak increases almost linear to $\kappa_{xx}$. On the other hand, the temperature dependence
of $\kappa_{xy}$ is similar in all Cd-K samples and shows a peak at almost the same temperature of
the peak of the phonon thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}^\textrm{ph}$ which is estimated by $\kappa_{xx}$
at 15 T. These results indicate the presence of a phonon thermal Hall $\kappa_{xy}^\textrm{ph}$
in Cd-K. In addition to $\kappa_{xy}^\textrm{ph}$, we find that the non-linear field dependence
of $\kappa_{xy}$ at low temperatures indicates the presence of a spin thermal Hall $\kappa_{xy}^\textrm{sp}$
in Cd-K. Remarkably, both $\kappa_{xy}^\textrm{ph}$ and $\kappa_{xy}^\textrm{sp}$ disappear
in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase at low fields, showing that $\kappa_{xy}^\textrm{ph}$
alone does not exhibit the thermal Hall effect. A high field above $\sim7$ T induces $\kappa_{xy}^\textrm{ph}$,
concomitantly with a field-induced increase of $\kappa_{xx}$ and the specific heat. These results
demonstrate that the spin liquid state in the Cd-K harbors both $\kappa_{xy}^\textrm{sp}$ and
$\kappa_{xy}^\textrm{ph}$, and suggest a coupling of the phonons to the field-induced excitations
as the origin of $\kappa_{xy}^\textrm{ph}$.
