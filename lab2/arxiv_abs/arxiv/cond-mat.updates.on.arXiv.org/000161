Different energy shifts for majority and minority electrons occur. Thus, for example in case of
(laser) excited ferromagnetic metals majority and minority electrons may respond differently
in time during closing the exchange splitting. Spin flip transitions of the hot electrons due to
electron interactions cause quasi hybridization of the spin split states. This is also the case
in itinerant ferromagnetic metals due to hopping between sites having magnetic moments pointing
in direction of the magnetization (+) and opposite direction (-) and with energy levels $\varepsilon^+_{i\sigma}$
and $\varepsilon^-_{i\sigma}$. For energetic reasons the molecular field acts asymmetrically
on the spins of the electrons and on spin flip transitions and thus causes different lifetimes of
minority and majority electrons and spin dependent electron energy shifts. Quite general minority
hot electrons in spin split states may respond faster than majority electrons at non--equilibrium.
The molecular field acting on the spins delays spin flip transitions $\uparrow \rightarrow \downarrow$
and thus a response of the hot majority electrons and their energy levels. The closing of the exchange
splitting in the electron spectrum of ferromagnetic transition and rare--earth metals, ferromagnetic
semiconductors, spin split quantum well states in thin ferromagnetic films, etc. will reflect
this. The time and spin dependent energy shifts of electrons at non--equilibrium may cause interesting
behavior, in particular of magnetic tunnel junctions, spin currents etc.. In ferromagnets the
moment reversal lifetime of (local) magnetic moments parallel to the global magnetization is larger
than of moments pointing in opposite direction.
