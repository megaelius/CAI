Nonequilibrium conditions are traditionally seen as detrimental to the appearance of quantum-coherent
many-body phenomena, and much effort is often devoted to their elimination. Recently this approach
has changed: It has been realized that driven-dissipative could be used as a resource. By proper
engineering of the reservoirs and their couplings to a system, one may drive the system towards desired
quantum-correlated steady states, even in the absence of internal Hamiltonian dynamics. An intriguing
category of equilibrium many-particle phases are those which are distinguished by topology rather
than by symmetry. A natural question thus arises: which of these topological states can be achieved
as the result of purely dissipative Lindblad-type (Markovian) evolution? Beside its fundamental
importance, it may offer novel routes to the realization of topologically-nontrivial states in
quantum simulators, especially ultracold atomic gases. In this work I go beyond previous studies
in giving a general answer to this question in the context of Gaussian ("integer") topological states,
concentrating on 2D Chern insulators as the main example. On the one hand I prove a no-go theorem which
shows that such dynamics cannot lead to a topological robust (gapped Liouvillian) unique pure steady
state as the result of finite-range Liouvillian. On the other hand, I construct a recipe showing
that, under the above conditions, a pure topological steady state may result if exponetially-local
Liouvillian is allowed. If strictly local evolution is insisted upon, a mixed steady state arbitrarily
close to the desired pure state may be obtained. I will also show how such dynamics could be realized
with ultracold atoms and similar systems, and how the resulting states may be detected and topologically-classified.
Extension to other types of topological insulators and superconductors is also discussed.
