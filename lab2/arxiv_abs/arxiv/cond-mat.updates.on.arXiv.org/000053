Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to study the dynamics of polymer translocation through a nanopore
in the limit where the translocation rate is sufficiently slow that the polymer maintains a state
of conformational quasi-equilibrium. The system is modeled as a flexible hard-sphere chain that
translocates through a cylindrical hole in a hard flat wall. In some calculations, the nanopore
is connected at one end to a spherical cavity. Translocation times are measured directly using MC
dynamics simulations. For sufficiently narrow pores, translocation is sufficiently slow that
the mean translocation time scales with polymer length N according to <\tau> \propto (N-N_p)^2,
where N_p is the average number of monomers in the nanopore; this scaling is an indication of a quasi-static
regime in which polymer-nanopore friction dominates. We use a multiple-histogram method to calculate
the variation of the free energy with Q, a coordinate used to quantify the degree of translocation.
The free energy functions are used with the Fokker-Planck formalism to calculate translocation
time distributions in the quasi-static regime. These calculations also require a friction coefficient,
characterized by a quantity N_{eff}, the effective number of monomers whose dynamics are affected
by the confinement of the nanopore. This was determined by fixing the mean of the theoretical distribution
to that of the distribution obtained from MC dynamics simulations. The theoretical distributions
are in excellent quantitative agreement with the distributions obtained directly by the MC dynamics
simulations for physically meaningful values of N_{eff}. The free energy functions for narrow-pore
systems exhibit oscillations with an amplitude that is sensitive to the nanopore length. Generally,
larger oscillation amplitudes correspond to longer translocation times.
