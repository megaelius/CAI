Massive mechanical resonators operating at the quantum scale can enable a large variety of applications
in quantum technologies, as well as fundamental tests of quantum theory. Of crucial importance
in that direction, is both their integrability into state-of-the-art quantum platforms as well
as the ability to prepare them in generic quantum states using well-controlled high-fidelity operations.
Here, we propose a scheme for controlling a radio-frequency mechanical resonator at the quantum
scale using two superconducting transmon qubits that can be integrated on the same chip. Specifically,
we consider two qubits coupled via a capacitor in parallel to a superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID), which has a suspended mechanical beam embedded in one of its arms. Following a theoretical
analysis of the quantum system, we find that this configuration, in combination with an in-plane
magnetic field, can give rise to a tuneable three-body interaction in the single-photon strong-coupling
regime, while enabling suppression of the stray qubit-qubit coupling. Using state-of-the-art
parameters and qubit operations at single-excitation levels, we numerically demonstrate the
possibility of ground-state cooling as well as high-fidelity preparation of mechanical quantum
states and qubit-phonon entanglement, i.e. states having negative Wigner functions and obeying
non-classical correlations. Our work significantly extends the quantum control toolbox of radio-frequency
mechanical resonators and may serve as a promising architecture for integrating such mechanical
elements with transmon-based quantum processors.
