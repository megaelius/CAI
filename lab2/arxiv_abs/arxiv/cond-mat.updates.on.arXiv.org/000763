Previous Zernike phase-plates, for transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM) have always been
made out of carbon. A critical constraint on those phase-plates is their fast degradation during
use. Here, a Zernike phase-plate consisting out of metal is produced and tested for the first time.
For the new aluminium phase-plate, no charging like for the carbon phase-plate is observed. Under
conditions of use, the stability of the aluminium phase-plate, is excellent. For both materials,
a distortion in the image's Fourier-transformation is observed, when inserting the thin-film
into the beam at the back-focal-plane. This distortion is a negative, spatial-frequency dependent
phase-shift, that is not equal to a focus-change. A phase-shift and an increase of contrast, is observed
for the tested phase-plates. Different types of self-sustaining metal-films are produced with
a technique, invented by Janbroers et al. All metal-films, produced at room-temperature, exhibit
a polycrystalline structure, while carbon-films are amorphous. However, a high crystallinity
is unfavored, causing distortions in the image and an increase of electron-scattering in the phase-plate,
due to diffraction. Using cryo-deposition, metal-films are obtained that combine an amorphous
structure with beneficial properties of metals such as lower charging and prolonged durability.
Investigations with TEM, show a great potential of those cryo-films as material for Zernike phase-plates.
Thickness-measurements are successfully carried out with atomic-force-mycroscopy at step-edges
between the thin-film and its substrate. For this, a technique for the preparation of very narrow
step-edges is developed here.
