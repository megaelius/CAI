Malignant cancers that lead to fatal outcomes for patients may remain dormant for very long periods
of time. Although individual mechanisms such as cellular dormancy, angiogenic dormancy and immunosurveillance
have been proposed, a comprehensive understanding of cancer dormancy and the "switch" from a dormant
to a proliferative state still needs to be strengthened from both a basic and clinical point of view.
Computational modeling enables one to explore a variety of scenarios for possible but realistic
microscopic dormancy mechanisms and their predicted outcomes. The aim of this paper is to devise
such a predictive computational model of dormancy with an emergent "switch" behavior. Specifically,
we generalize a previous cellular automaton (CA) model for proliferative growth of solid tumor
that now incorporates a variety of cell-level tumor-host interactions and different mechanisms
for tumor dormancy, for example the effects of the immune system. Our new CA rules induce a natural
"competition" between the tumor and tumor suppression factors in the microenvironment. This competition
either results in a "stalemate" for a period of time in which the tumor either eventually wins (spontaneously
emerges) or is eradicated; or it leads to a situation in which the tumor is eradicated before such
a "stalemate" could ever develop. We also predict that if the number of actively dividing cells within
the proliferative rim of the tumor reaches a critical, yet low level, the dormant tumor has a high
probability to resume rapid growth. Our findings may shed light on the fundamental understanding
of cancer dormancy.
