The significant experimental advances of the last few decades in dealing with the interaction of
spin currents and nanomagnets, at the device level, has allowed envisioning a broad class of devices
that propose to implement information processing using spin currents and nanomagnets. To analyze
such spin-magnet logic circuits, in general, we have developed a coupled spin-transport/ magnetization-dynamics
simulation framework that could be broadly applicable to various classes of spin-valve/ spin-torque
devices. Indeed, the primary purpose of this chapter is to describe in detail, the overall approach
we have developed to include a description of spin transport coupled with magnetization dynamics
and to show how it was benchmarked against available data on experiments. We address non-collinear
spin-transport in Section-2 using a lumped "4-component spin-circuit formalism" that describes
the interaction of non-collinear magnets (required for modeling spin torque), by computing 4-component
currents and voltages at every node of a "circuit". For modeling the magnetization dynamics, we
use the standard Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation with the Slonczewski and the field-like
terms included for spin torque. Section-3 describes how this LLG model is coupled with the spin transport
model to analyze spin-torque experiments and spin-magnet circuits in general. We include MATLAB
codes in the Appendix to facilitate a "hands-on" understanding of our model and hope it will enable
interested readers to conveniently analyze their own experiments, develop a deeper insight into
spin-magnet circuits or come up with their own creative designs.
