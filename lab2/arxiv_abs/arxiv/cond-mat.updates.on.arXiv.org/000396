Bi1-xLaxFe1-xMnxO3 (x = 0.000 - 0.300) ceramics prepared by the tartaric acid modified sol-gel
technique have been studied to analyze the effect of composition driven structural transition
on the magnetic properties of bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3). It was found that the co-substitution of
La & Mn at Bi & Fe sites leads to suppression of impurity phases (Bi2Fe4O9 and Bi25FeO40)
which generally appear in BiFeO3. The quantitative crystallographic phase analysis has been carried
out by double phase Rietveld analysis of all the XRD patterns which indicates the existence of compositional
driven crystal structure transformation from rhombohederal (space group R3c) to the orthorhombic
(Pbnm space group) with the increase in substitution concentration. There is nanoscale phase separation
of the LaMnO3 for x > 0.150 (15% Bi as well as Fe sites) which is the maximum solubility limit for
the present co-substituted BiFeO3. It has been analyzed with the help of high power X-ray diffractometer,
RAMAN and FT-IR spectra. 5% co-substituted sample exhibit very high remnant magnetization i.e.
about 15 times that of BiFeO3 which is due to the suppression of cycloid spin structure and enhanced
canting angle of antiferromagnetically ordered spins caused by the crystal lattice distortion.
However, further increase in substitution results in the reduction of remnant magnetization and
coercivity due to the appearance of complete antiferromagnetic ordering in the orthorhombic structure
because of the significant contribution from the crystallographic phase of Pbnm space group (as
obtained from double phase Rietveld analysis). The frequency independent higher dielectric constant
and lower dielectric loss were observed for 5% co-substitution. Hence, this particular composition
may be interesting for device applications
