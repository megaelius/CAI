Correlated charge inhomogeneity breaks the electron-hole symmetry in two-dimensional (2D) bilayer
heterostructures which is responsible for non-zero drag appearing at the charge neutrality point.
Here we report Coulomb drag in novel drag systems consisting of a two-dimensional graphene and a
one dimensional (1D) InAs nanowire (NW) heterostructure exhibiting distinct results from 2D-2D
heterostructures. For monolayer graphene (MLG)-NW heterostructures, we observe an unconventional
drag resistance peak near the Dirac point due to the correlated inter-layer charge puddles. The
drag signal decreases monotonically with temperature ($\sim T^{-2}$) and with the carrier density
of NW ($\sim n_{N}^{-4}$), but increases rapidly with magnetic field ($\sim B^{2}$). These anomalous
responses, together with the mismatched thermal conductivities of graphene and NWs, establish
the energy drag as the responsible mechanism of Coulomb drag in MLG-NW devices. In contrast, for
bilayer graphene (BLG)-NW devices the drag resistance reverses sign across the Dirac point and
the magnitude of the drag signal decreases with the carrier density of the NW ($\sim n_{N}^{-1.5}$),
consistent with the momentum drag but remains almost constant with magnetic field and temperature.
This deviation from the expected $T^2$ arises due to the shift of the drag maximum on graphene carrier
density. We also show that the Onsager reciprocity relation is observed for the BLG-NW devices but
not for the MLG-NW devices. These Coulomb drag measurements in dimensionally mismatched (2D-1D)
systems, hitherto not reported, will pave the future realization of correlated condensate states
in novel systems.
