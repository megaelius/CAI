We study quasiparticle states on a surface of a topological insulator (TI) with proximity-induced
superconductivity under an external magnetic field. An applied magnetic field creates two Majorana
bound states: a vortex Majorana state localized inside a vortex core and an exterior Majorana state
localized along a circle centered at the vortex core. We calculate the spin-resolved local density
of states (LDOS) and demonstrate that the shrinking of the radius of the exterior Majorana state,
predicted in Ref. [R. S. Akzyanov et al., Phys. Rev. B 94, 125428 (2016)], under a strong magnetic
field can be seen in LDOS without smeared out by non-zero-energy states. The spin-resolved LDOS
further reveals that the spin of the exterior Majorana state is strongly polarized. Accordingly,
the induced odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs are found to be spin-polarized as well. In order to
detect the exterior Majorana states, however, the Fermi energy should be closed to the Dirac point
to avoid contributions from continuum levels. We also study a different two-dimensional topological-superconducting
system where a two-dimensional electron gas with the spin-orbit coupling is sandwiched between
an s-wave superconductor and a ferromagnetic insulator. We show that the radius of an exterior Majorana
state can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. However, on the contrary to the results at a TI surface,
neither the exterior Majorana state nor the induced odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs are spin-polarized.
We conclude that the spin-polarization of the Majorana state is attributed to the spin-polarized
Landau level which is characteristic for systems with the Dirac-like dispersion.
