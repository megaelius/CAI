Simulating quantum circuits with classical computers requires resources growing exponentially
in terms of system size. Real quantum computer with noise, however, may be simulated polynomially
with various methods considering different noise models. In this work, we simulate random quantum
circuits in 1D with Matrix Product Density Operators (MPDO), for different noise models such as
dephasing, depolarizing, and amplitude damping. We show that the method based on Matrix Product
States (MPS) fails to approximate the noisy output quantum states for any of the noise models considered,
while the MPDO method approximates them well. Compared with the method of Matrix Product Operators
(MPO), the MPDO method reflects a clear physical picture of noise (with inner indices taking care
of the noise simulation) and quantum entanglement (with bond indices taking care of two-qubit gate
simulation). Consequently, in case of weak system noise, the resource cost of MPDO will be significantly
less than that of the MPO due to a relatively small inner dimension needed for the simulation. In case
of strong system noise, a relatively small bond dimension may be sufficient to simulate the noisy
circuits, indicating a regime that the noise is large enough for an `easy' classical simulation.
Moreover, we propose a more effective tensor updates scheme with optimal truncations for both the
inner and the bond dimensions, performed after each layer of the circuit, which enjoys a canonical
form of the MPDO for improving simulation accuracy. With truncated inner dimension to a maximum
value $\kappa$ and bond dimension to a maximum value $\chi$, the cost of our simulation scales as
$\sim ND\kappa^3\chi^3$, for an $N$-qubit circuit with depth $D$.
