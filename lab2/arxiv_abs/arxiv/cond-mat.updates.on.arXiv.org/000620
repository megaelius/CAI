We contrast the transport properties (dc resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, optical conductivity)
and NMR $1/T_1$ spin-lattice relaxation rate of the repulsive and attractive Hubbard models in
the paramagnetic phase for a generic band filling away from any special points. The calculations
are performed in a wide temperature interval using the dynamical mean-field theory with the numerical
renormalization group as the impurity solver. We find that the attractive case exhibits significantly
more complex temperature dependences which can be explained by the behavior of the half-filled
Hubbard model in external magnetic field with constant magnetization, to which the attractive
Hubbard model maps through the partial particle-hole transformation. The attractive model has
a Mott-like phase transition to an insulating state at $U=U_0$, where $U_0<0$ is similar in magnitude
to $U_{c2}$ of the Mott transition point of the repulsive model at half-filling, while for $U>U_0$
the system has Landau Fermi liquid ground state for both signs of $U$. For repulsive $U$, the resistivity
is linear at higher temperatures and the system has resilient quasiparticles up to $T_\mathrm{MIR}$
where the resistivity exceeds the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit. For attractive $U$, the resistivity
is non-monotonous for large enough $|U|$. It peaks at $T_\mathrm{max}$ where the quasiparticle
band disappears. The maximal resistivity may significantly exceed the MIR value, thus the concept
of resilient quasiparticles can be valid for $\rho > \rho_\mathrm{MIR}$. For both signs of $U$
we find particle-hole asymmetry in the self-energy at low energies, but with opposite kinds of excitations
having longer lifetime. The spin-lattice relaxation rate in the strongly attractive case has a
non-monotonic temperature dependence.
