The effects of Ni doping in Eu(Co{1-x}Ni{x})2As2 single crystals with x =0 to 1 grown out of self flux
are investigated via crystallographic, electronic transport, magnetic, and thermal measurements.
All compositions adopt the body-centered-tetragonal ThCr2Si2 structure with space group I4/mmm.
We also find 3-4% of randomly-distributed vacancies on the Co/Ni site. Anisotropic magnetic susceptibility
chi(T) data versus temperature T show clear signatures of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) c-axis helix
structure associated with the Eu{+2} spins-7/2 for x = 0 and x = 1 as previously reported. The chi(T)
data for x = 0.03 and 0.10 suggest an anomalous 2q magnetic structure containing two helix axes along
the c axis and in the ab plane, respectively, whereas for x = 0.75, 0.82, and 1 a c-axis helix is inferred
as previously found for x = 1. At intermediate compositions x = 0.2, 0.32, 0.42, 0.54, and 0.65 a magnetic
structure with a large ferromagnetic (FM) c-axis component is found from magnetization versus
field isotherms, suggested to be an incommensurate FM cone structure associated with the Eu spins,
which consists of both AFM and FM components. In addition, the chi(T) and heat capacity data for x
= 0.2--0.65 indicate the occurrence of itinerant FM order associated with the Co/Ni atoms with Curie
temperatures from 60 K to 25 K, respectively. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate metallic
character for all compositions with abrupt increases in slope on cooling below the Eu AFM transition
temperatures. In addition to this panoply of magnetic transitions, {151}Eu Mossbauer measurements
indicate that ordering of the Eu moments proceeds via an incommensurate sine amplitude-modulated
structure with additional transition temperatures associated with this effect.
