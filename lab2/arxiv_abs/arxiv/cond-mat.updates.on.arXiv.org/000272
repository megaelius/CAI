Recent experimental advances enabled the realization of mobile impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms. Here we consider impurities with two or more internal hyperfine
states, and study their radio-frequency (RF) absorption spectra, which correspond to transitions
between two different hyperfine states. We calculate RF spectra for the case when one of the hyperfine
states involved interacts with the BEC, while the other state is non-interacting, by performing
a non-perturbative resummation of the probabilities of exciting different numbers of phonon modes.
In the presence of interactions the impurity gets dressed by Bogoliubov excitations of the BEC,
and forms a polaron. The RF signal contains a delta-function peak centered at the energy of the polaron
measured relative to the bare impurity transition frequency with a weight equal to the amount of
bare impurity character in the polaron state. The RF spectrum also has a broad incoherent part arising
from the background excitations of the BEC, with a characteristic power-law tail that appears as
a consequence of the universal physics of contact interactions. We discuss both the direct RF measurement,
in which the impurity is initially in an interacting state, and the inverse RF measurement, in which
the impurity is initially in a non-interacting state. In the latter case, in order to calculate the
RF spectrum, we solve the problem of polaron formation: a mobile impurity dynamically gets dressed
by Bogoliubov phonons. Our solution based on a time-dependent variational ansatz of coherent states
of Bogoliubov phonons, becomes exact when the impurity is localized. Moreover we show that such
an ansatz compares well with a semiclassical estimate of the propagation amplitude of a mobile impurity
in the BEC. Our technique can be extended to cases when both initial and final impurity states interact
with the BEC.
