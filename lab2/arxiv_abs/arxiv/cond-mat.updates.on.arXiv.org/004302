Magnetic bimeron is a topological counterpart of skyrmions in in-plane magnets, which can be used
as spintronic information carrier. Here we report the static properties of bimerons with different
topological structures in a frustrated ferromagnetic thin-film system, where bimerons are stabilized
by a delicate competition between frustrated exchange interactions, in-plane magnetic anisotropy,
and dipole-dipole interaction. The bimeron structure is characterized by the vorticity $Q_{\text{v}}$
and helicity $\eta$. It is found that the energy of a bimeron state increases with $Q_{\text{v}}$,
and the energy of an isolated bimeron with $Q_{\text{v}}=\pm 1$ depends on $\eta$. The bimeron state
with $\left|Q_{\text{v}}\right|>1$ can be regarded as a cluster-like state. We also report the
dynamics of frustrated bimerons driven by the spin-orbit torques, including both the damping-like
and field-like torques. We find that the isolated bimeron with $Q_{\text{v}}=\pm 1$ can be driven
into linear or elliptical motion when the spin polarization direction is perpendicular to the easy
axis. The dynamics of the bimeron depend on the strength of the damping-like and field-like torques.
We numerically reveal the damping dependence of the bimeron Hall angle driven by the damping-like
torque. Besides, the isolated bimeron with $Q_{\text{v}}=\pm 1$ can be driven into rotation by
the damping-like torque when the spin polarization direction is parallel to the easy axis. The rotation
frequency is proportional to the driving current density. In addition, we numerically demonstrate
the possibility of creating a bimeron state with a higher or lower topological charge by the current-driven
collision and merging of bimeron states with different $Q_{\text{v}}$. Our results could be useful
for designing spintronic devices based on frustrated magnetic bimerons.
