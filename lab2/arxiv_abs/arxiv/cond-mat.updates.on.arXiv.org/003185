Epitaxial Fe4N thin films grown on lattice-matched LaAlO3 (LAO) substrate using sputtering and
molecular beam epitaxy techniques have been studied in this work. Within the sputtering process,
films were grown with conventional direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) and for the first
time, using a high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) process. Surface morphology and
depth profile reveal that HiPIMS deposited film has the lowest roughness, the highest packing density
and the sharpest interface. La from the LAO substrate and Fe from the film interdiffuse and forms
an undesired interface spreading to an extent of about 10-20 nm. In the HiPIMS process, layer by layer
type growth leads to a globular microstructure which restricts the extent of the interdiffused
interface. Such substrate-film interactions and microstructure play a vital role in affecting
the electronic hybridization and magnetic properties of Fe4N films. The magnetic moment (Ms) was
compared using bulk, element-specific and magnetic depth profiling techniques. We found that
Ms was the highest when the thickness of the interdiffused layer was lowest and only be achieved in
the HiPIMS grown samples. Presence of small moment at the N site was also evidenced by element-specific
x-ray circular dichroism measurement in HiPIMS grown sample. A large variation in the Ms values
of Fe4N found in the experimental works carried out so far could be due to such interdiffused layer
which is generally not expected to form in otherwise stable oxide substrate. In addition, a consequence
of substrate-film interdiffusion and microstructure results in different kinds of different
kind of magnetic anisotropies in films grown using different techniques.
