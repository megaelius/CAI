The observation of chirality is ubiquitous in nature. Contrary to intuition, the population of
opposite chiralities is surprisingly asymmetric at fundamental levels. Examples range from parity
violation in the subatomic weak force to the homochirality in essential biomolecules. The ability
to achieve chirality-selective synthesis (chiral induction) is of great importance in stereochemistry,
molecular biology and pharmacology. In condensed matter physics, a crystalline electronic system
is geometrically chiral when it lacks any mirror plane, space inversion center or roto-inversion
axis. Typically, the geometrical chirality is predefined by a material's chiral lattice structure,
which is fixed upon the formation of the crystal. By contrast, a particularly unconventional scenario
is the gyrotropic order, where chirality spontaneously emerges across a phase transition as the
electron system breaks the relevant symmetries of an originally achiral lattice. Such a gyrotropic
order, proposed as the quantum analogue of the cholesteric liquid crystals, has attracted significant
interest. However, to date, a clear observation and manipulation of the gyrotropic order remain
challenging. We report the realization of optical chiral induction and the observation of a gyrotropically
ordered phase in the transition-metal dichalcogenide semimetal $1T$-TiSe$_2$. We show that shining
mid-infrared circularly polarized light near the critical temperature leads to the preferential
formation of one chiral domain. As a result, we are able to observe an out-of-plane circular photogalvanic
current, whose direction depends on the optical induction. Our study provides compelling evidence
for the spontaneous emergence of chirality in the correlated semimetal TiSe$_2$. Such chiral induction
provides a new way of optical control over novel orders in quantum materials.
