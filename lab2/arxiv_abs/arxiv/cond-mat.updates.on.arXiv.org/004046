Ab initio-calculated ideal strength and toughness describe the upper limits for mechanical properties
attainable in real systems and can, therefore, be used in selection criteria for materials design.
We employ density-functional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) to investigate the mechanical
properties of defect-free rocksalt-structure (B1) TiN and B1 Ti1-xAlxN (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) solid
solutions subject to [001], [110], and [111] tensile deformation at room temperature. We determine
the alloys' ideal strength and toughness, elastic responses, and ability to plastically deform
up to fracture as a function of the Al content. Overall, TiN exhibits greater ideal moduli of resilience
and tensile strengths than TiAlN solid solutions. Nevertheless, AIMD modelingshows that, irrespective
of the strain direction, the binary compound systematically fractures by brittle cleavage at its
yield point. The simulations also indicate that Ti0.5Al0.5N and Ti0.25Al0.75N solid solutions
are inherently more resistant to fracture and possess much greater toughness than TiN, due to the
activation of local structural transformations (primarily of B1 -> wurtzite type) beyond the elastic-response
regime. In sharp contrast, TiAlN alloys with 25% Al exhibit similar brittleness as TiN. The results
of this work underline the limitations of elasticity-based criteria for prediction of strength,brittleness,
ductility, and toughness in materials able to undergo phase transitions with loading. Furthermore,
comparing present and previous findings, we suggest a general principle for design of hard ceramic
solid solutions that are thermodynamically inclined to dissipate extreme mechanical stresses
via transformation toughening mechanisms.
