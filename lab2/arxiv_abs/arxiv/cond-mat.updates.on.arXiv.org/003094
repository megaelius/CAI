Considering the recent breakthroughs in the synthesis of novel two-dimensional (2D) materials
from layered bulk structures, ternary layered transition metal borides, known as MAB phases, have
come under scrutiny as a means of obtaining novel 2D transition metal borides, so-called MBene.
Here, based on a set of phonon calculations, we show the dynamic stability of many Al-containing
MAB phases, MAlB (M = Ti, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Tc), M$_2$AlB$_2$ (Sc, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Cr, Mo, W,
Mn, Tc, Fe, Rh, Ni), M$_3$Al$_2$B$_2$ (M = Sc, T, Zr, Hf, Cr, Mn, Tc, Fe, Ru, Ni), M$_3$AlB$_4$ (M = Sc,
Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe), and M$_4$AlB$_6$ (M = Sc, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo). By comparing
the formation energies of these MAB phases with those of their available competing binary M$-$B
and M$-$Al, and ternary M$-$Al$-$B phases, we find that some of the Sc-, Ti-, V-, Cr-, Mo-, W-, Mn-,
Tc-, and Fe-based MAB phases could be favorably synthesized in an appropriate experimental condition.
In addition, by examining the strengths of various bonds in MAB phases via crystal orbital Hamilton
population and spring constant calculations, we find that the B$-$B and then M$-$B bonds are stiffer
than the M$-$Al and Al$-$B bonds. The different strength between these bonds implies the etching
possibility of Al atoms from MAB phases, consequently forming various 2D MB, M$_2$B$_3$, and M$_3$B$_4$
MBenes. Furthermore, we employ the nudged elastic band method to investigate the possibility of
the structural phase transformation of the 2D MB MBenes into graphene-like boron sheets sandwiched
between transition metals and find that the energy barrier of the transformation is less than $0.4$
eV/atom.
