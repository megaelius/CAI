In conventional FORC (First Order Reversal Curve) analysis of a magnetic system, reversible and
low-coercivity irreversible materials are treated as being qualitatively different: the FORC
distribution shows low-coercivity materials but completely hides reversible (zero-coercivity)
ones. This distinction is artificial -- as the coercivity approaches zero, the physical properties
of an irreversible material change smoothly into those of a reversible material. We have developed
a method (called FORC+, implemented in free software at this http URL) for displaying the reversible
properties of a system (a reversible switching-field distribution, R-SFD) together with the irreversible
ones (the usual FORC distribution), so that there is no sudden discontinuity in the display when
the coercivity becomes zero. We will define a "FORC+ dataset" to include the usual FORC distribution,
the R-SFD, the saturation magnetization, and what we will call the "lost hysteron distribution"
(LHD) such that no information is lost -- the original FORC curves can be exactly recovered from the
FORC+ dataset. We also give some examples of the application of FORC+ to real data -- it uses a novel
complementary-color display that minimizes the need for smoothing. In systems which switch suddenly
(thus having sharp structures in the FORC distribution) direct display of un-smoothed raw data
allows visualization of sharp structures that would be washed out in a conventional smoothed FORC
display. This is an expanded version of paper GG-05, MMM-Intermag 2019, with a discrete derivation
of the FORC distribution (Eq. 1) and an additional example (Fig. 7).
