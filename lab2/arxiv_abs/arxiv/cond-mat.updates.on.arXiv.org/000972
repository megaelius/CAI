The carbon vacancy in $4H$-SiC is a powerful minority carrier recombination center and a major cause
of degradation of SiC-based devices. Despite the extensiveness of the literature regarding the
characterization and modeling of the defect, many fundamental questions persist. Among them we
have the shaky connection of the EPR data to the electrical measurements, the physical origin of
the pseudo-Jahn-Teller (pJT) effect, the reasoning for the observed sub-lattice dependence of
the paramagnetic states, and the severe temperature-dependence of some hyperfine signals which
cannot be accounted for by a thermally-activated dynamic averaging between equivalent JT-distorted
structures. In this work we address these problems by means of semi-local and hybrid density functional
calculations. We start by inventorying a total of four vacancy structures. Diamagnetic states
have well defined low-energy structures, whereas paramagnetic states display metastability.
This rich structural variety is traced back to the filling of electronic states which are shaped
by a crystal-field-dependent pJT effect. From calculated minimum energy paths for defect rotation
and transformation mechanisms, combined with the calculated formation energies and electrical
levels, we arrived at a configuration-coordinate diagram of the defect. The diagram provides us
with a detailed first-principles picture of the defect when subject to optical and thermal excitations.
The calculated acceptor and donor transitions agree well with Z$_{1/2}$ and EH$_{6/7}$ trap energies,
respectively. From comparison of calculated and measured $U$-values, and correlating the site-dependent
formation energies with the relative intensity of the DLTS peaks in as-grown material, we assign
Z$_{1}$ (EH$_{6}$) and Z$_{2}$ (EH$_{7}$) signals to acceptor (donor) transitions of carbon vacancies
located on the $h$ and $k$ sub-lattice sites, respectively.
