Distinct shortcomings of individual halide perovskites for solar applications, such as restricted
range of band gaps, propensity of ABX3 to decompose into AX+BX2, or oxidation of 2ABX3 into A2BX6
have led to the need to consider alloys of individual perovskites. This creates a non-trivial material-selection
problem, spanning a continuum of three sets of compositions (one for each sub lattice), and requiring
control of phase-separation or ordering in each alloyed subfield. Not surprisingly, material
and structure choices were made thus far mostly via trial-and-error explorations. We use ideas
from solid state theory of semiconductor alloys to analyze the behaviors of the (FA,Cs)(Pb,Sn)I3
alloys system. Density functional calculations utilizing specially constructed supercells
(SQS) are used to calculate the composition dependence of band gaps, energy of decomposition and
alloy mixing enthalpies. A number of trends are observed for A-site as well as for B-site alloys.
To understand the physical reasons that control these trends we decompose the alloy properties
into distinct physical terms: (i) the energies associated with removing the octahedral deformations
(tilting, rotations, B site displacements), (ii) the energies of compressing the larger component
and expanding the smaller one to the alloy volume, (iii) the charge transfer energies associated
with placing the alloyed units onto a common lattice, and finally, (iv) structural relaxation of
all bonds within the cells., This analysis clarifies the origin of the observed trends in bang gaps,
decomposition energies and mixing enthalpies. Unlike a number of previous calculations we find
that the a proper description of alloy physics requires that even the pure, non-alloyed end-point
compounds be allowed to develop local environment dependent octahedral deformation that lowers
significantly the total energy and raises their band gaps.
