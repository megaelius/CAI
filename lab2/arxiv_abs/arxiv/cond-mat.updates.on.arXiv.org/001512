Coalescence of tiny sized particles into extended shapes has been an overlooked phenomenon since
long. Present study discusses the formation of tiny sized particles and their packing into large
sized particles under varying concentration of gold precursor in homemade built pulse-based electronphoton-solution
interface process. Under fixed ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time, different tiny sized particles
develop while varying the amount of gold precursor. Packets of nano shape energy bind gold atoms
into different tiny sized particles depending on the mechanism of formation of their monolayer
assembly at solution surface. For precursor concentration between 0.07 mM to 0.90 mM, many tiny
sized particles are developed in two joint triangles shape for each case, maximum at 0.30 mM and 0.60
mM. On separation and elongation under exerting force of opposite poles at centre of each atom, tiny
sized particles pack at a point where they do not exert surface format force resulting into develop
various large shaped particles. At 0.05 mM and 1.20 mM, tiny sized particles rarely observed in triangular
shape where their packings under non-uniform force resulted into develop distorted particles.
Reflected photons patterns at the surface of different large shaped particles validate the order
of their structural regularity, whereas, it does not exist in the case of distorted ones. Change
of argon gas flow rate alters the morphology-structure of particles at minute level. This study
purely determines that under what concentration of gold precursor, a certain size and shape of tiny
particle or large particle is developed.
