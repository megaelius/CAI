The polymer dynamics of homogeneous C$_{60}$-polystyrene mixtures in the molten state are studied
via molecular simulations using two interconnected levels of representation for polystyrene
nanocomposites: (a) A coarse-grained representation, in which each polystyrene repeat unit is
mapped into a single "superatom" and each fullerene is viewed as a spherical shell. Equilibration
of coarse-grained polymer-nanoparticle systems at all length scales is achieved via connectivity-altering
Monte Carlo simulations. (b) An atomistic representation, where both nanoparticles and polymer
chains are represented in terms of united-atom forcefields. Initial configurations for atomistic
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are obtained by reverse mapping well-equilibrated coarse-grained
configurations. By analyzing MD trajectories under constant energy, the segmental dynamics of
polystyrene (for neat and filled systems) is characterized in terms of bond orientation time autocorrelation
functions. Nanocomposite systems are found to exhibit slightly slower segmental dynamics than
the unfilled ones, in good agreement with available experimental data. Moreover, by employing
Voronoi tessellation of the simulation box, the mean-squared displacement of backbone carbon
atoms is quantified in the vicinity of each fullerene molecule. Fullerenes are found to suppress
the average motion of polymeric chains, in agreement with neutron scattering data, while slightly
increasing the dynamic and stress heterogeneity of the melt. Atomic-level and local (per Voronoi
cell) stress distributions are reported for the pure and the filled systems.
