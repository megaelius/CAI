Small system sizes are a well known source of error in DFT calculations, yet computational constraints
frequently dictate the use of small supercells, often as small as 96 atoms in oxides and compound
semiconductors. In ionic compounds, electrostatic finite size effects have been well characterised,
but self-interaction of charge neutral defects is often discounted or assumed to follow an asymptotic
behaviour and thus easily corrected with linear elastic theory. Here we show that elastic effects
are also important in the description of defects in ionic compounds and can lead to qualitatively
incorrect conclusions if inadequately small supercells are used; moreover, the spurious self-interaction
does not follow the behaviour predicted by linear elastic theory. Considering the exemplar cases
of metal oxides with fluorite structure, we show that numerous previous studies, employing 96-atom
supercells, misidentify the ground state structure of (charge neutral) Schottky defects. We show
that the error is eliminated by employing larger cells (324, 768 and 1500 atoms), and careful analysis
determines that elastic effects, not electrostatic, are responsible. The spurious self-interaction
was also observed in non-oxide ionic compounds and irrespective of the computational method used,
thereby resolving long standing discrepancies between DFT and force-field methods, previously
attributed to the level of theory. The surprising magnitude of the elastic effects are a cautionary
tale for defect calculations in ionic materials, particularly when employing computationally
expensive methods or when modelling large defect clusters. We propose two computationally practicable
methods to test the magnitude of the elastic self-interaction in any ionic system.
