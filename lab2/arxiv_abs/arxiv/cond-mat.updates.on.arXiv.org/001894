A new class of high-performance pyrrolidinium cation based ionanofluid electrolytes with higher
lithium salt concentration are developed. The electrolytes are formed by dispersing imidazolium
ionic liquid functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles in low conducting, 0.6 M lithium salt doped N-alkyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Pyr14TFSI) ionic liquid (IL) hosted electrolyte. Viscosity,
ionic conductivity and thermal properties of these electrolytes are compared with well studied
0.2 M salt doped Pyr14TFSI IL-based electrolyte. The highly crystalline 0.6 M lithium salt dissolved
IL-based electrolytes gradually become amorphous with the increasing dispersion of surface functionalized
nanoparticles within it. The ionic conductivity of the electrolytes shows unusual viscosity decoupled
characteristics and at the 5.0 wt% nanoparticle dispersion it attains a maximum value, higher than
that of pure IL host. As compared to pure IL-based electrolytes, the ionanofluid electrolyte also
possesses a significantly higher value of lithium ion transference number. The Li/LiMn2O4 cell
with the best conducting ionanofluid electrolyte delivers a discharge capacity of about 131 mAh
g-1 at 25 degree C at a current density of 24 mA g-1, much higher than that obtained in 0.2 M Li salt dissociated
Pyr14TFSI electrolyte (87 mAh g-1). Superior interfacial compatibility between ionanofluid
electrolyte and electrodes as indicated by the excellent rate performance with outstanding capacity
retention of the cell as compared to pure IL-based analogue, further establish great application
potentiality of this optimized newly developed electrolyte for safer LMBs.
