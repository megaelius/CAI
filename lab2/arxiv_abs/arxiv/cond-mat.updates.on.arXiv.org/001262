The ab initio calculation of quasiparticle (QP) energies is a technically and computationally
challenging problem. In condensed matter physics the most widely used approach to determine QP
energies is the GW approximation. Although the GW method has been widely applied to many typical
semiconductors and insulators, its application to more complex compounds such as transition metal
oxide perovskites has been comparatively rare, and its proper use is not well established from a
technical point of view. In this work, we have applied the single-shot G0W0 method to a representative
set of transition metal oxide perovskites including 3d (SrTiO3, LaScO3, SrMnO3, LaTiO3, LaVO3,
LaCrO3, LaMnO3, and LaFeO3), 4d (SrZrO3, SrTcO3, and Ca2RuO4) and 5d (SrHfO3, KTaO3 and NaOsO3)
compounds with different electronic configurations, magnetic orderings, structural characteristics
and bandgaps ranging from 0.1 to 6.1 eV. We discuss the proper procedure to obtain well converged
QP energies and accurate bandgaps within single-shot G0W0 by comparing the conventional approach
based on an incremental variation of a specific set of parameters (number of bands, energy cutoff
for the plane-wave expansion and number of k-points and the basis-set extrapolation scheme [Phys.
Rev. B 90, 075125 (2014)]. In addition, we have inspected the difference between the adoption of
norm-conserving and ultrasoft potentials in GW calculations. A minimal statistical analysis
indicates that the correlation of the GW data with the DFT gap is more robust than the correlation
with the experimental gaps; moreover we identify the static dielectric constant as alternative
useful parameter for the approximation of GW gap in high-throughput automatic procedures. Finally,
we compute the QP band structure and spectra within the random phase approximation and compare the
results with available experimental data.
