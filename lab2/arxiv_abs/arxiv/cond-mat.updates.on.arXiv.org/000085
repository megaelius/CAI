Dirac electrons in clean graphene can mediate the interactions between two localized magnetic
moments. The functional form of the RKKY interaction in pristine graphene is specified by two main
features: (i) an atomic scale oscillatory part determined by a wave vector $\vec Q$ connecting the
two valleys. Furthermore with doping another longer range oscillation appears which arise from
the existence of an extended Fermi surface characterized by a single momentum scale $k_F$. (ii)
$R^{\alpha}$ decay in large distances where the exponent $\alpha=-3$ is a distinct feature of undoped
Dirac sea (with a linear dispersion relation) in two dimensions. In this work, we investigate the
effect of a few percent vacancies on the above properties. Depending on the doping level, if the chemical
potential lies on the linear part of the density of states, the exponent $\alpha$ remains close to
-3. Otherwise $\alpha$ reduces towards more negative values which means that the combined effect
of vacancies and the randomness in their positions makes it harder for the carriers of the medium
to mediate the magnetic interaction. Addition of a few percent of vacancies diminishes the atomic
scale oscillations of the RKKY interaction signaling the destruction of two-valley structure
of the parent graphene material. Surprisingly by allowing the chemical potential to vary, we find
that the longer-range oscillations expected to arise from the existence of a $k_F$ scale in the vacant
graphene are absent. This may indicate possible non-Fermi liquid behavior by "alloying" graphene
with vacancies. The complete absence of oscillations in heavily vacant graphene can be considered
an advantage for applications as a uniform sign of the exchange interaction is desirable for magnetic
ordering.
