We have studied the ambient air oxidation of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown monolayers of
the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (S-TMD) WS$_{2}$ using optical microscopy,
laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and atomic
force microscopy (AFM). Monolayer WS$_{2}$ exposed to ambient conditions in the presence of light
(typical laboratory ambient light for weeks, or typical PL spectroscopy map), exhibits damage
due to oxidation which can be detected with the LSCM and AFM; though may not be evident in conventional
optical microscopy due to poorer contrast and resolution. Additionally, this oxidation was not
random, and correlated with 'high-symmetry' and red-shifted areas in the PL spectroscopy map -
areas thought to contain a higher concentration of sulfur vacancies. In contrast, samples kept
in ambient and darkness showed no signs of oxidation for up to 10 months. Low-irradiance/fluence
experiments showed that samples subjected to excitation energies at or above the trion excitation
energy (532 nm/2.33 eV and 660 nm/1.88 eV) oxidized, even for irradiances and fluences eight and
four orders of magnitude lower (respectively) than previously reported. No significant oxidation
was observed for 760 nm/1.63 eV light exposure, which lies below the trion excitation energy in WS$_{2}$.
The strong wavelength dependence and apparent lack of irradiance dependence suggests that ambient
oxidation of WS$_{2}$ is initiated by photon-mediated electronic band transitions, that is, photo-oxidation.
These findings have important implications for prior, present and future studies concerning direct
bandgap S-TMDs measured, stored or manipulated in ambient conditions.
