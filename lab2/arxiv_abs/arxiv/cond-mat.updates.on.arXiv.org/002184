Strain engineering is a powerful technology which exploits stationary external or internal stress
of specific spatial distribution for controllingthe fundamental properties ofcondensed materials
and nanostructures. This advanced technique modulates in space the carrier density and mobility,
the optical absorption and, in strongly correlated systems, the phase, e.g. insulator/metal or
ferromagnetic/paramagnetic. However, while successfully accessing nanometer length scale,
strain engineering is yet to be brought down to ultrafast time scales allowing strain-assisted
control of state of matter at THz frequencies. In our work we demonstrate a control of an optically-driven
insulator-to-metal phase transition by a picosecond strain pulse, which paves a way to ultrafast
strain engineering in nanostructures with phase transitions. This is realized by simultaneous
excitation of VO$_2$ nanohillocks by a 170-fs laser and picosecond strain pulses finely timed with
each other. By monitoring the transient optical reflectivity of the VO$_2$, we show that strain
pulses, depending on the sign of the strain at the moment of optical excitation, increase or decrease
the fraction of VO$_2$ which undergoes an ultrafast phase transition. Transient strain of moderate
amplitude $\sim$0.1% applied during ultrafast photo-induced non-thermal transition changes
the fraction of VO$_2$ in the laser-induced phase by $\sim$1%. By contrast, if applied after the
photo-excitation when the phase transformations of the material are governed by thermal processes,
transient strain of the same amplitude produces no measurable effect on the phase state.
