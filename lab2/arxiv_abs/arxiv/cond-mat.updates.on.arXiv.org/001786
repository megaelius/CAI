This letter investigates the bias-dependent low frequency noise of single layer graphene field-effect
transistors. Noise measurements have been conducted with electrolyte-gated graphene transistors
covering a wide range of gate and drain bias conditions for different channel lengths. A new analytical
model that accounts for the propagation of the local noise sources in the channel to the terminal
currents and voltages is proposed in this paper to investigate the noise bias dependence. Carrier
number and mobility fluctuations are considered as the main causes of low frequency noise and the
way these mechanisms contribute to the bias dependence of the noise is analyzed in this work. Typically,
normalized low frequency noise in graphene devices has been usually shown to follow an M-shape dependence
versus gate voltage with the minimum near the charge neutrality point (CNP). Our work reveals for
the first time the strong correlation between this gate dependence and the residual charge which
is relevant in the vicinity of this specific bias point. We discuss how charge inhomogeneity in the
graphene channel at higher drain voltages can contribute to low frequency noise; thus, channel
regions nearby the source and drain terminals are found to dominate the total noise for gate biases
close to the CNP. The excellent agreement between the experimental data and the predictions of the
analytical model at all bias conditions confirms that the two fundamental 1/f noise mechanisms,
carrier number and mobility fluctuations, must be considered simultaneously to properly understand
the low frequency noise in graphene FETs. The proposed analytical compact model can be easily implemented
and integrated in circuit simulators, which can be of high importance for graphene based circuits
design.
