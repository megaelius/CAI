Spatial correlations play an important role in characterizing material properties related to
non-local effects. Inter alia, they can give rise to fluctuation-induced forces. Equilibrium
correlations in fluids provide an extensively studied paradigmatic case, in which their range
is typically bounded by the correlation length. Out of equilibrium, conservation laws have been
found to extend correlations beyond this length, leading, instead, to algebraic decays. In this
context, here we present a systematic study of the correlations and forces in fluids driven out of
equilibrium simultaneously by quenching and shearing, both for non-conserved as well as for conserved
Langevin-type dynamics. We identify which aspects of the correlations are due to shear, due to quenching,
and due to simultaneously applying both, and how these properties depend on the correlation length
of the system and its compressibility. Both shearing and quenching lead to long-ranged correlations,
which, however, differ in their nature as well as in their prefactors, and which are mixed up by applying
both perturbations. These correlations are employed to compute non-equilibrium fluctuation-induced
forces in the presence of shear, with or without quenching, thereby generalizing the framework
set out by Dean and Gopinathan. These forces can be stronger or weaker compared to their counterparts
in unsheared systems. In general, they do not point along the axis connecting the centers of the small
inclusions considered to be embedded in the fluctuating medium. Since quenches or shearing appear
to be realizable in a variety of systems with conserved particle number, including active matter,
we expect these findings to be relevant for experimental investigations.
