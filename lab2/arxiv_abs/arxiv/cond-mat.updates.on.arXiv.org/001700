We study how hydrodynamic interactions affect the collective behaviour of active particles suspended
in a fluid at high concentrations, with particular attention to lubrication forces which appear
when the particles are very close to one another. We compute exactly the limiting behaviour of the
hydrodynamic interactions between two spherical (circular) active swimmers in very close proximity
to one another in the general setting in both three and (two) dimensions. Combining this with far-field
interactions, we develop a novel numerical scheme which allows us to study the collective behaviour
of large numbers of active particles with accurate hydrodynamic interactions when close to one
another. We study active swimmers whose intrinsic flow fields are characterised by force dipoles
and quadrupoles. Using this scheme, we are able to show that lubrication forces when the particles
are very close to each other can play as important a role as long-range hydrodynamic interactions
in determining their many-body behaviour. We find that when the swimmer force dipole is large, finite
clusters and open gel-like clusters appear rather than complete phase separation. This suppression
is due to near-field lubrication interactions. For swimmers with small force dipoles, we find surprisingly
that a globally polar ordered phase appears because near-field lubrication rather than long-range
hydrodnamics dominate the alignment mechanism. Polar order is present for very large system sizes
and is stable to fluctuations with a finite noise amplitude. We explain the emergence of polar order
using a minimal model in which only the leading rotational effect of the near-field interaction
is included. These phenomena are also reproduced in two dimensions.
