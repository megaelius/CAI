We introduce a driven-dissipative two-mode bosonic system whose reservoir causes simultaneous
loss of two photons in each mode and whose steady states are superpositions of pair-coherent/Barut-Girardello
coherent states. We show how quantum information encoded in a steady-state subspace of this system
is exponentially immune to phase drifts (cavity dephasing) in both modes. Additionally, it is possible
to protect information from arbitrary photon loss in either (but not simultaneously both) of the
modes by continuously monitoring the difference between the expected photon numbers of the logical
states. Despite employing more resources, the two-mode scheme enjoys two advantages over its one-mode
cat-qubit counterpart with regards to implementation using current circuit QED technology. First,
monitoring the photon number difference can be done without turning off the currently implementable
dissipative stabilizing process. Second, a lower average photon number per mode is required to
enjoy a level of protection at least as good as that of the cat-codes. We discuss circuit QED proposals
to stabilize the code states, perform gates, and protect against photon loss via either active syndrome
measurement or an autonomous procedure. We introduce quasiprobability distributions allowing
us to represent two-mode states of fixed photon number difference in a two-dimensional complex
plane, instead of the full four-dimensional two-mode phase space. The two-mode codes are generalized
to multiple modes in an extension of the stabilizer formalism to non-diagonalizable stabilizers.
The $M$-mode codes can protect against either arbitrary photon losses in up to $M-1$ modes or arbitrary
losses and gains in any one mode.
