We first review, following our earlier studies, the critical behavior of the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
(SK) model at finite as well as at zero temperatures. Through the analysis of the Binder cumulant
we determined the entire phase diagram of the model and from the scaling analysis of the numerical
data we obtained the correlation length exponent. For both the critical Binder cumulant and the
correlation length exponent, we observed a crossover from classical- to quantum-fluctuation-dominated
values at a finite temperature. We studied the behavior of the order parameter distribution of the
model in the glass phase (at finite and zero temperatures). Along with a classical-fluctuation-dominated
nonergodic region (where the replica symmetry is broken), we also found a quantum-fluctuation-dominated
low-temperature ergodic region in the spin glass phase. In this quantum-fluctuation-dominated
region, the order parameter distribution has a narrow peak around its most probable value, eventually
becoming a delta function in the infinite-system-size limit (indicating replica symmetry restoration
or ergodicity in the system). We also found that the annealing time (to reach a very low energy level
of the classical SK model) becomes practically system-size-independent when the annealing paths
pass through this ergodic region. In contrast, when such paths pass through the nonergodic region,
the convergence time grows rapidly with the system size. We present a new study of the autocorrelation
of the spins in both ergodic and nonergodic regions. We found a significant increase in the relaxation
time (and also a change in the relaxation behavior) in the classical-fluctuation-dominated (nonergodic)
region compared with that in the quantum-fluctuation-dominated (ergodic) region of the spin glass
phase.
