Emergent phenomena share the fascinating property of not being obvious consequences of the design
of the system in which they appear. This characteristic is no less relevant when attempting to simulate
such phenomena, given that the outcome is not always a foregone conclusion. The present survey focuses
on several simple model systems that exhibit surprisingly rich emergent behavior, all studied
by MD simulation. The examples are taken from the disparate fields of fluid dynamics, granular matter
and supramolecular self-assembly. In studies of fluids modeled at the detailed microscopic level
using discrete particles, the simulations demonstrate that complex hydrodynamic phenomena in
rotating and convecting fluids, the Taylor-Couette and Rayleigh-B\'enard instabilities, can
not only be observed within the limited length and time scales accessible to MD, but even quantitative
agreement can be achieved. Simulation of highly counterintuitive segregation phenomena in granular
mixtures, again using MD methods, but now augmented by forces producing damping and friction, leads
to results that resemble experimentally observed axial and radial segregation in the case of a rotating
cylinder, and to a novel form of horizontal segregation in a vertically vibrated layer. Finally,
when modeling self-assembly processes analogous to the formation of the polyhedral shells that
package spherical viruses, simulation of suitably shaped particles reveals the ability to produce
complete, error-free assembly, and leads to the important general observation that reversible
growth steps contribute to the high yield. While there are limitations to the MD approach, both computational
and conceptual, the results offer a tantalizing hint of the kinds of phenomena that can be explored,
and what might be discovered when sufficient resources are brought to bear on a problem.
