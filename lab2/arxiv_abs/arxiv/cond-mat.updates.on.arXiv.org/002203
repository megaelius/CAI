NPs are ultrafine-grain crystal or amorphous substances which are as small as 100nm. They have unique
physical, chemical and mechanical properties, which are very different from those of large scale
materials. This uniqueness is attributed to the fact that the number of atoms in the surface layer
and in the bulk is commensurable. As the atoms in the surface layer of nanoparticles have their counterparts
from one side only, their balance is impaired, and the resulting structure relaxation leads to the
displacement of atomic spacing in a 2-3nm layer. Therefore the surface layers expand while internal
layers compressed, as these are exposed to an excessive Laplace pressure of up to hundreds kilobars.
Nanoparticles have a highly distorted lattice that has an effect on activation energy of most of
the processes they are involved in, by changing their nature and sequence. Nanoscale implies absolutely
new effects, properties and processes which are defined by the laws of quantum mechanics, size quantization
in small-scale structures, surface-bulk ratio, and other factors. Due to exceptionally small
sizes and good reactivity of NP particles, it looks promising to use them in metal melts as crystallization
centers to enable structure refinement of cast products. As well known, the grains are finer, the
better are mechanical properties of cast products produced from these alloys. After considering
a number of options, an efficient method of nanopowder introduction into a liquid metal was proposed.
This method avoids all of the above problems and consists in pressing of 5-9.5mm diameter rods or
wires that contain aluminum particles (granules and nanopowder). Nanopowder contents in rods
added NP to alloys being no more than 0.05%, and sometimes even thousandths of one percent.
