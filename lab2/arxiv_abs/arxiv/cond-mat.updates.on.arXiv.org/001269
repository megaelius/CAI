There are claims of synthesis of a room temperature superconductor. However, these claims have
not been officially accepted by scientific communities. Currently, the highest transition temperature
(Tc) recognized in scientific articles is 135 K at 1 atm of Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O system which is a copper
oxide superconductor. We packed graphite flakes into a ring-shaped polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) tube and further injected heptane or octane. Then we generated circulating current in this
ring tube by electromagnetic induction and showed that this circulating current continues to flow
continuously at room temperature for 50 days. This experiment suggests that bringing alkane into
contact with graphite may result in a material with zero resistance at room temperature. In addition,
we showed by means of AC resistance measurements using the two-terminal method that the resistances
of graphite fibers brought into contact with various alkanes suddenly change at specific critical
temperatures between 363 and 504 K. In this study, we show that after a magnetic field is applied to
a single-layer graphene at room temperature, alkane is brought into contact with the single-layer
graphene, then the graphene excludes the magnetic field immediately. This phenomenon demonstrates
that the alkane-wetted single-layer graphene shows Meissner effect at room temperature. Furthermore,
we applied a magnetic field perpendicularly to the annular single-layer graphene brought into
contact with n-hexane and immediately removed the magnetic field. After that we observed that a
constant magnetic field generates from this annular graphene for some time. In conclusion, the
single-layer graphene brought into contact with alkane shows Meissner effect at room temperature,
which provides definitive evidence for room temperature superconductivity.
