Crystallographic image processing (CIP) techniques may be utilized in scanning probe microscopy
(SPM) to glean information that has been obscured by signals from multiple probe tips. This may be
of particular importance for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and requires images from a sample
that is periodic in two dimensions. The image-forming current for multiple tips in STM is derived
in a more straightforward manner than prior approaches. The Fourier spectrum of the current for
p4mm Bloch surface wave functions and a pair of delta function tips reveals the tip-separation dependence
of various types of image obscurations. In particular our analyses predict that quantum interference
should be visible on a macroscopic scale in the form of bands quite distinct from the basket-weave
patterns a purely classical model would create at the same periodic double STM tip separations.
A surface wave function that models the essential character of highly (0001) oriented pyrolytic
graphite (technically known as HOPG) is introduced and used for a similar tip-separation analysis.
Using a bonding H_2 tip wave function with significant spatial extent instead of this pair of infinitesimal
Dirac delta function tips does not affect these outcomes in any observable way. This is explained
by Pierre Curie's well known symmetry principle. Classical simulations of multiple tip effects
in STM images may be understood as modeling multiple tip effects in images that were recorded with
other types of SPMs). Our analysis clarifies why CIP and crystallographic averaging work well in
removing the effects of a blunt SPM tip (that consist of multiple mini-tips) from the recorded 2D
periodic images and also outlines the limitations of this image processing techniques for certain
spatial separations of STM mini-tips.
