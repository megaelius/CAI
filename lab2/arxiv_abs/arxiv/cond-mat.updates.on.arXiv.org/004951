The complex phase diagram of manganites with simultaneously active spin, charge, orbital, and
lattice degrees of freedom continues providing surprises. In a recent groundbreaking experiment,
membranes of the perovskite manganite La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LCMO) deposited on a flexible
polymer layer were strained up to 8\% [S.~S. Hong {\it et al.}, Science {\bf 368}, 71 (2020)], much
more than achieved by regular strain induced by a rigid substrate. By increasing this strain a metal-insulator
transition was reported. Here we reproduce the results of the experiments using Monte Carlo simulations
of the two-orbital double-exchange model including Jahn-Teller distortions, at hole density
$x=1/3$. The full phase diagram with varying temperature and Jahn-Teller coupling $\lambda$ is
presented. When the bandwidth $W$ of mobile electrons is reduced, thus when the effective Jahn-Teller
coupling $\lambda/W$ is increased, a metal-insulator transition is found in our simulations,
between a ferromagnetic metallic state with uniform charge distribution and an insulator with
diagonal charge stripes that retains its ferromagnetic character. In between the hole-rich diagonals,
staggered orbital order occurs. We also report resistivity and magnetization measurements alongside
with spin correlations and charge structure factors. Our overall conclusions are in agreement
with the recent experimental and density functional theory results by Hong {\it et al.}, and we confirm
much earlier ground state predictions of striped ferromagnetic order using energy optimization
techniques by T. Hotta {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 86}, 4922 (2001). The experimental observation
of one of the states predicted by theory suggests that diagonal stripes could be achieved at other
hole densities as well, such as $x=1/4$, if LCMO membranes with that hole doping were subject to similar
strains.
