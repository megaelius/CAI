Understanding the correlation between structure and rheology in colloidal suspensions is important
as these suspensions are crucial in industrial applications. Moreover, colloids exhibit a wide
range of structures under confinement that could considerably alter the viscosity. Here, we use
a combination of experiments and simulations to elucidate how confinement induced structures
alter the relative contributions of hydrodynamic and repulsive forces to produce up to a ten fold
change in the viscosity. We use a custom built confocal rheoscope to image the particle configurations
of a colloidal suspension while simultaneously measuring the viscosity. We find a non-monotonic
trend to the viscosity under confinement that is strongly correlated with the microstructure.
As the gap decreases below 15 particle diameters, the viscosity first decreases from its bulk value,
shows fluctuations with the gap, and then sharply increases for gaps below three particle diameters.
Further, we compare our experimental results to two simulations techniques that enables us to determine
the relative contributions of hydrodynamic and short range repulsive stresses. The first method
uses the lubrication approximation to find the hydrodynamic stress and includes a short range repulsive
force between the particles and the second is a Stokesian dynamics simulation that calculates the
full hydrodynamic stress in the suspension. We find that the decrease in the viscosity at moderate
confinements has a significant contribution from both the hydrodynamic and repulsive forces whereas
the increase in viscosity at gaps less than three particle diameters arises primarily from short
range repulsive forces. These results provide new insights to the unique rheological behavior
of confined suspensions and further enable us to tune the viscosity by changing properties such
as the gap, polydispersity, and the volume fraction.
