Transition metal dichalcogenide materials $MX_2 (M=Mo,W;X=S,Se)$ are being thoroughly studied
due to their novel two-dimensional structure, that is associated with exceptional optical and
transport properties. From a computational point of view, Density Functional Theory simulations
perform very well in these systems and are an indispensable tool to predict and complement experimental
results. However, due to the time and length scales where even the most efficient DFT implementations
can reach today, this methodology suffers of stringent limitations to deal with finite temperature
simulations or electron-lattice coupling when studying excitation states: the unit cells required
to study, for instance, systems with thermal fluctuations or large polarons would require a large
computational power. Multi-scale techniques, like the recently proposed Second Principles Density
Functional Theory, can go beyond these limitations but require the construction of tight-binding
models for the systems under investigation. In this work, we compare two such methods to construct
the bands of WSe$_2$. In particular, we compare the result of (i) Wannier-based model construction
with (ii) the band fitting method of Liu and co-workers where the top of the valence band and the bottom
of the conduction band are modeled by three bands symmetrized to have mainly Tungsten $d_{z^2}$,
$d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ character. Our results emphasize the differences between these two
approaches and how band-fitting model construction leads to an overestimation of the localization
of the real-space basis in a tight-binding representation.
