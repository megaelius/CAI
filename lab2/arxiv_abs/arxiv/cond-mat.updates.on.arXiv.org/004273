One of the spectacular examples of a complex system is the financial market, which displays rich
correlation structures among price returns of different assets. The eigenvalue decomposition
of a correlation matrix into partial correlations - market, group and random modes, enables identification
of dominant stocks or "influential leaders" and sectors or "communities". The correlation-based
network of leaders and communities changes with time, especially during market events like crashes,
bubbles, etc. Using the eigen-entropy measure, computed from the eigen-centralities (ranks)
of different stocks in the correlation network, we extract information about the "disorder" (or
randomness) in the market correlation and its different modes. The relative-entropy measures
computed for these modes enable us to construct a "phase space", where the different market events
undergo "phase-separation" and display "order-disorder" transitions, as observed in critical
phenomena in physics. We choose the US S&P-500 and Japanese Nikkei-225 financial markets, over
a 32-year period, and study the evolution of the cross-correlation matrices and their corresponding
eigen-entropies. One of the relative entropy measures displays "universal scaling" behavior
with respect to the mean market correlation. Further, a functional of the relative entropy measure
acts as a good gauge for the "market fragility" (minimum risk of the market portfolio) and the "market
fear" (volatility index). This new methodology helps us to better understand market dynamics and
characterize the events in different phases as anomalies, bubbles, crashes, etc. that display
intriguing phase separation and universal scaling behavior.
