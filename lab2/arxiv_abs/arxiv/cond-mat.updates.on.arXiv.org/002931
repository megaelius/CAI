In this work, we benchmark the well-controlled and numerically accurate exponential thermal tensor
renormalization group (XTRG) in the simulation of interacting spin models in two dimensions. Finite
temperature introduces a thermal correlation length, which justifies the analysis of finite system
size for the sake of numerical efficiency. In this paper we focus on the square lattice Heisenberg
antiferromagnet (SLH) and quantum Ising models (QIM) on open and cylindrical geometries up to width
$W=10$. We explore various one-dimensional mapping paths in the matrix product operator (MPO)
representation, whose performance is clearly shown to be geometry dependent. We benchmark against
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) data, yet also the series-expansion thermal tensor network results.
Thermal properties including the internal energy, specific heat, and spin structure factors,
etc., are computed with high precision, obtaining excellent agreement with QMC results. XTRG also
allows us to reach remarkably low temperatures. For SLH we obtain at low temperature an energy per
site $u_g^*\simeq -0.6694(4)$ and a spontaneous magnetization $m_S^*\simeq0.30(1)$, which
is already consistent with the ground state properties. We extract an exponential divergence vs.
$T$ of the structure factor $S(M)$, as well as the correlation length $\xi$, at the ordering wave
vector $M=(\pi,\pi)$, which represents the renormalized classical behavior and can be observed
over a narrow but appreciable temperature window, by analysing the finite-size data by XTRG simulations.
For the QIM with a finite-temperature phase transition, we employ several thermal quantities,
including the specific heat, Binder ratio, as well as the MPO entanglement to determine the critical
temperature $T_c$.
