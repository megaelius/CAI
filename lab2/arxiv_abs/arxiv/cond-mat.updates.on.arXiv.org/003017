Tuning of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation effects in pyrochlore iridates is considered
for many interesting phenomena. We have investigated the temperature evolution of structural,
magnetic and electronic properties in doped Y$_2$(Ir$_{1-x}$Ti$_{x}$)$_2$O$_7$ ($x$ = 0.0,
0.02, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15) where the substitution of nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ (3$d^0$) for Ir$^{4+}$
(5$d^5$) amounts to dilution of magnetic network and tuning of these parameters in opposite way.
The system retains its original structural symmetry but local structural parameters show an evolution
with Ti content. While the magnetic transition temperature is not largely influenced, both magnetic
moment and magnetic frustration decreases with Ti doping. Magnetic relaxation measurement shows
the parent compound Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ as well as its Ti doped analogues are in nonequilibrium magnetic
state where the magnetic relaxation rate increases with Ti. Temperature dependent Raman measurements
indicate no changes in structural symmetry, however, across the magnetic transition temperature
an anomaly in A$_{1g}$ Raman mode is observed. Temperature dependent x-ray diffraction data also
support the Raman spectroscopy data, however, an evolution of lattice parameters with temperature
is observed. The electrical resistivity data of Y$_2$(Ir$_{1-x}$Ti$_{x}$)$_2$O$_7$ series
exhibits insulating behavior throughout the temperature range, however, the resistivity decreases
with Ti doping. The nature of charge conduction is found to follow power-law behavior in whole series
but the validity of this model varies with temperature. A negative magnetoresistance has been observed
at low temperature in present series which is explained with weak localized mechanism. Similar
to other Ir based oxides, a crossover from negative to positive MR has been observed in present system.
