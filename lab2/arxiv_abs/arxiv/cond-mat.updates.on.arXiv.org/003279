Clustering is an important phenomenon in turbulent flows laden with inertial particles. Although
this process has been studied extensively, there are still open questions about both the fundamental
physics and the reconciliation of different observations into a coherent quantitative view of
this important mechanism for particle-turbulence interaction. In this work, we study the effect
of projecting this phenomenon onto 2D and 1D (as usually done in experiments). In particular, the
effect of measurement volume in 1D projections on detected cluster properties, such as size or concentration,
is explored to provide a method for comparison of published/future observations, from experimental
or numerical data. The results demonstrate that, in order to capture accurate values of the mean
cluster properties under a wide range of experimental conditions, the measurement volume needs
to be larger than the Kolmogorov length scale, and smaller than about ten percent of the integral
length scale of the turbulence. This dependency provides the correct scaling to carry out 1D measurements
of preferential concentration, considering the turbulence characteristics. It is also critical
to disentangle the cluster-characterizing results from random contributions to the cluster statistics,
especially in 1D, as the raw probability density function of Voronoi cells does not provide error-free
information on the clusters size or local concentration. We propose a methodology to correct for
this measurement bias, with an analytical model of the cluster PDF obtained from comparison with
a Random Poisson Process probability distribution in 1D, which appears to discard the existence
of power laws in the cluster PDF. We develop a new test to discern between turbulence-driven clustering
and randomness, that complements the cluster identification algorithm by segregating the number
of particles inside each cluster.
