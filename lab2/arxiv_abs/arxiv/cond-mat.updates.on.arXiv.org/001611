Nanomaterials based on MoS2 are remarkably versatile; MoS2 nanoparticles are proven catalysts
for processes such as hydrodesulphurization and the hydrogen evolution reaction, and transition
metal dichalcogenides in general have recently emerged as novel 2D components for nanoscale electronics
and optoelectronics. The properties of such materials are intimately related to their structure
and dimensionality. For example, only the edges exposed by MoS2 nanoparticles (NPs) are catalytically
active, and extended MoS2 systems show different character (direct or indirect gap semiconducting,
or metallic) depending on their thickness and crystallographic phase. In this work, we show how
particle size and interaction with a metal surface affect the stability and properties of different
MoS2 NPs and the resulting phase diagrams. By means of calculations based on the Density Functional
Theory (DFT), we address how support interactions affect MoS2 nanoparticles of varying size, composition,
and structure. We demonstrate that interaction with Au modifies the relative stability of the different
nanoparticle types so that edge terminations and crystallographic phases that are metastable
for free-standing nanoparticles and monolayers are expressed in the supported system. These support-effects
are strongly size-dependent due to the mismatch between Au and MoS2 lattices, which explains experimentally
observed transitions in the structural phases for supported MoS2 NPs. Accounting for vdW interactions
and the contraction of the Au(111) surface underneath the MoS2 is further found to be necessary for
quantitatively reproducing experimental results. This work demonstrates how the properties
of nanostructured MoS2 and similar layered systems can be modified by the choice of supporting metal.
