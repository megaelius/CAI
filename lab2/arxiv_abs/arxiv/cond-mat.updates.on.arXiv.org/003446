Clear influence of particle size, surfactants and dispersion medium on surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) features of Ag nanoparticles (NPs), synthesized in thermal decomposition method, in the
broad range of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, critical for many potential applications such as a photocatalyst,
UV-sensor and detector, has been demonstrated here. It involves adsorbate coverage, interparticle
distance or agglomeration, surface charge density and solvent refractive index ({\mu}). NP agglomeration
and surface charge density in solvents of varying {\mu} have been studied systematically through
zeta-potential ({\zeta}) and hydrodynamic diameter (HD) using dynamic light scattering (DLS).
The main SPR feature found at 316 nm in 31.5 nm NPs shifts to 320 nm in 15.1 nm NPs. The peak at 320 nm in
air shifts to 259, 261 and 277 nm in polar solvent methanol, deionized water and ethanol, respectively
and to 255, 275 and 282 nm in non-polar solvent n-hexane, benzene and toluene, respectively. In general,
the decrease in particle size and increase in {\mu} of solvents show red-shift. Curiously, a number
of peaks up to seven in these solvents that are attributed to charge-transfer mechanism and change
in inter-particle interaction of the NPs turning from a single peak of SPR in air has been observed
for the first time. A model for re-adjustment of Fermi level (E_F) of Ag NP and the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) to explain them has also
been used. Moreover, the Drude model for shift in the position of SPR in these NPs is only applicable
in non-polar solvents, not in polar solvents. Such novel features will be potential candidates
for various applications.
