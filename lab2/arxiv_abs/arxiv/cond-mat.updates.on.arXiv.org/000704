Theoretically, NaAuS is predicted as topological insulator, while no detail electronic structure
study has been done for this compound. Here, we report the structural and electronic properties
of NaAuS by using LDA, PBEsol, PBE and revPBE exchange correlation functionals. The calculated
values of equilibrium lattice constant for LDA, PBEsol, PBE and revPBE exchange correlation functionals
are found to be $\sim$6.128 {\AA}, $\sim$6.219 {\AA}, $\sim$6.353 {\AA} and $\sim$6.442 {\AA},
respectively. The bulk modulus predicted by LDA, PBEsol, PBE and revPBE exchange correlation functionals
is $\sim$66.6, $\sim$56.4, $\sim$46.5 and $\sim$39.3 GPa, respectively. Hence, the order of calculated
values of bulk modulus is consistent with the order of calculated values of equilibrium lattice
parameters for these exchange correlation functionals. The spread of total density of states below
the Fermi level decreases as the exchange correlation functional changes from LDA to PBEsol to PBE
to revPBE, which is also found to be consistent with the order of bulk modulus for these exchange correlation
functionals. In presence of spin-orbit coupling, a direct band gap is observed in NaAuS compound,
which is found to be $\sim$0.26, $\sim$0.25, $\sim$0.24 and $\sim$0.23 eV for LDA, PBEsol, PBE and
revPBE exchange correlation functionals, respectively. Here, NaAuS is found to be topological
insulator as it shows band inversion at $\Gamma$ point. The calculated values of band inversion
strength for LDA (PBEsol) and PBE (revPBE) exchange correlation functionals are $\sim$1.58 eV
($\sim$1.57 eV) and $\sim$1.50 eV ($\sim$1.47 eV), respectively.
