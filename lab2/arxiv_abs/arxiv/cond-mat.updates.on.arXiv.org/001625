The staggered (or imbricated) lamellar "brick-and-mortar" nanostructure of nacre endows nacre
with strength and fracture toughness values exceeding by an order of magnitude those of the constituents,
and inspires the advent of new robust biomimetic materials. While many deterministic studies clarified
these advantageous features in the mean sense, a closed-form statistical model is indispensable
for determining the tail probability of failure in the range of 1 in a million, which is what is demanded
for most engineering applications. In the authors' preceding study, the so-called `fishnet' statistics,
exemplified by a diagonally pulled fishnet, was conceived to describe the probability distribution.
The fishnet links, representing interlaminar bonds, were considered to be elastic perfectly-brittle.
However, the links may be quasibrittle or almost ductile, exhibiting gradual postpeak softening
in their stress-strain relation. This paper extends the fishnet statistics to links with post-peak
softening slope of arbitrary steepness. Probabilistic analysis is enabled by assuming the postpeak
softening of a link to occur as a series of finite drops of stress and stiffness. The maximum load of
the structure is approximated by the strength of the k-th weakest link (k >= 1), and the distribution
of structure strength is expressed as a weighted sum of the distributions of order statistics. The
analytically obtained probabilities are compared and verified by histograms of strength data
obtained by millions of Monte Carlo simulations for each of many nacreous bodies with different
link softening steepness and with various overall shapes.
