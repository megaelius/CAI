Surface plasmons in a centrosymmetric metal nanocrystal have been perceived as achiral, based
on the quantum-mechanical theory of molecular optical activity. The one-electron theory is insufficient
to describe optical activity in crystals, where spatial variation of polarization states along
the light propagation direction is crucial in dimensions exceeding molecules. Such spatial-dispersion,
which can drastically modify the optical near-field in plasmonic nanocrystals, has yet to be experimentally
proved at the nanometer scale. Here, the experimental observation of natural circular dichroism
of surface plasmons in spherical gold, silver, and copper nanocrystals in solution is presented.
It originates from spatial dispersion (nonlocality) occurred at a dimension as small as 5 nanometers
in the optical region. In particular, the electromagnetic pressure or longitudinal volume plasmons
result in phase-shift and polarization rotation of the transverse electric field of incident light.
Dipolar surface plasmons exhibit negative ellipticity and corresponding negative phase-shift
of the electric field (i.e., optically left-handed), whereas quadrupolar surface plasmons have
positive signs in both ellipticity and phase-shift (i.e., optically right-handed). Structural
effects such as nanocrystal assembly, nanocrystal shape, electron spin-polarization, and plasmon-molecule
interaction are accessed. Volume plasmons inside the nanocrystal also produce a positive rotational
strength for the interband transition. This study implicates optical symmetry-breaking in isotropic
nanocrystals by the axial polarization parallel to the wavevector, which will impact on conduction
electron dynamics, hot-electron generation, and nonlinear optical response at the surface of
plasmonic nanocrystals as well as optical excitation of bound d-band electrons.
