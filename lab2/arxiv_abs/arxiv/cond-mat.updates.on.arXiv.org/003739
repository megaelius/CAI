While cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin films are being used in solar cell prototyping for decades,
the recent advent of two-dimensional (2D) materials challenges the fundamental limit for thickness
of conventional CdTe layers. Here, we report our theoretical predictions on photocarrier dynamics
in an ultimately thin (about 1 nm) CdTe slab. It corresponds to a layer that is just a single unit cell
thick, when the bulk parent crystal in the zinc blende phase is cleaved along the [110] facet. Using
an \textit{ab-initio} method based on density functional theory (DFT) and the Boltzmann equation
in the relaxation time approximation (RTA), we determine the thermalization time for charge carriers
excited to a certain energy for instance through laser irradiation. Our calculations include contributions
arising from all phonon branches in the first Brillouin zone (BZ), thus capturing all relevant inter-
and intraband carrier transitions due to electron-phonon scattering. We find that the photocarrier
thermalization time is strongly reduced, by one order of magnitude for holes and by three orders
of magnitude for electrons, once the CdTe crystal is thinned down from the bulk to a monolayer. Most
surprisingly, the electron thermalization time becomes independent of the electron excess energy
up to about 0.5~eV, when counted from the conduction band minimum (CBM). We relate this peculiar
behavior to the degenerate and nearly parabolic lowest conduction band that yields a constant density
of states in the 2D limit. Our findings may be useful for designing novel CdTe-based optoelectronic
devices, which employ nonequilibrium photoexcited carriers to improve the performance.
