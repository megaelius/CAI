Since its discovery, iron-based superconductivity has been known to develop near an antiferromagnetic
order, but this paradigm fails in the iron chalcogenide FeSe, whose single-layer version holds
the record for the highest superconducting transition temperature in the iron-based superconductors.
The striking puzzle that FeSe displays nematic order (spontaneously broken lattice rotational
symmetry) while being non-magnetic, has led to several competing proposals for its origin in terms
of either the $3d$-electron's orbital degrees of freedom or spin physics in the form of frustrated
magnetism. Here we argue that the phase diagram of FeSe under pressure could be qualitatively described
by a quantum spin model with highly frustrated interactions. We implement both the site-factorized
wave-function analysis and the large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) in cylinders
to study the spin-$1$ bilinear-biquadratic model on the square lattice, and identify quantum transitions
from the well-known $(\pi,0)$ antiferromagnetic state to an exotic $(\pi,0)$ antiferroquadrupolar
order, either directly or through a $(\pi/2,\pi)$ antiferromagnetic state. These many phases,
while distinct, are all nematic. We also discuss our theoretical ground-state phase diagram for
the understanding of the experimental low-temperature phase diagram obtained by the NMR~[\onlinecite{Yuweiqiang2016}]
and X-ray scattering~[\onlinecite{Bohmer2016}] measurements in pressurized FeSe. Our results
suggest that superconductivity in a wide range of iron-based materials has a common origin in the
antiferromagnetic correlations of strongly correlated electrons.
