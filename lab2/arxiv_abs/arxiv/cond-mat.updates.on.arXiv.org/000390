Progress in the last two decades has effectively integrated spintronics and nanomagnetics into
a single field, creating a new class of spin-based devices that are now being used both to Read (R)
information from magnets and to Write (W) information onto magnets. Many other new phenomena are
being investigated for nano-electronic memory as described in Part II of this book. It seems natural
to ask whether these advances in memory devices could also translate into a new class of logic devices.
What makes logic devices different from memory is the need for one device to drive another and this
calls for gain, directionality and input-output isolation as exemplified by the transistor. With
this in mind we will try to present our perspective on how W and R devices in general, spintronic or
otherwise, could be integrated into transistor-like switches that can be interconnected to build
complex circuits without external amplifiers or clocks. We will argue that the most common switch
used to implement digital logic based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors
can be viewed as an integrated W-R unit having an input-output asymmetry that give it gain and directionality.
Such a viewpoint is not intended to provide any insight into the operation of CMOS switches, but rather
as an aid to understanding how W and R units based on spins and magnets can be combined to build transistor-like
switches. Next we will discuss the standard W and R units used for magnetic memory devices and present
one way to integrate them into a single unit with the input electrically isolated from the output.
But we argue that this integrated W-R unit would not provide the key property of gain. We will then
show that the recently discovered giant spin Hall effect could be used to construct a W-R unit with
gain and suggest other possibilities for spin switches with gain.
