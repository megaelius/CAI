Eliashberg - McMillan theory of superconductivity is essentially based on the adiabatic approximation.
Small parameter of perturbation theory is given by $\lambda\frac{\Omega_0}{E_F}\ll 1$, where
$\lambda$ is the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant, $\Omega_0$ is characteristic
phonon frequency, while $E_F$ is Fermi energy of electrons. Here we present an attempt to describe
electron - phonon interaction within Eliashberg - McMillan approach in situation, when characteristic
phonon frequency $\Omega_0$ becomes large enough (comparable or exceeding the Fermi energy $E_F$).
We consider the general definition of electron - phonon pairing coupling constant $\lambda$, taking
into account the finite value of phonon frequency. Also we obtain the simple expression for the generalized
coupling constant $\tilde\lambda$, which determines the mass renormalization, with the account
of finite width of conduction band, and describing the smooth transition from the adiabatic regime
to the region of strong nonadiabaticity. In the case of strong nonadiabaticity, when $\Omega_0\gg
E_F$, the new small parameter appears $\lambda\frac{E_F}{\Omega_0}\sim\lambda\frac{D}{\Omega_0}\ll
1$ ($D$ is conduction band half - width), and corrections to electronic spectrum become irrelevant.
At the same time, the temperature of superconducting transition $T_c$ in antiadiabatic limit is
still determined by Eliashberg - McMillan coupling constant $\lambda$, while the preexponential
factor in the expression for $T_c$, conserving the form typical of weak - coupling theory, is determined
by the bandwidth (Fermi energy). For the case of interaction with a single optical phonon we derive
the single expression for $T_c$, valid both in adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes and describing
the continuous transition between these two limiting cases.
