Engineering of cooling mechanism is of primary importance for the development of nanoelectronics.
Whereas radiation cooling is rather inefficient in nowadays electronic devices, the strong anisotropy
of 2D materials allows for enhanced efficiency because their hyperbolic electromagnetic dispersion
near phonon resonances allows them to sustain much larger ($\sim 10^5$) number of radiating channels.
In this review, we address radiation cooling in 2D materials, specifically graphene hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures. We present the hyperbolic dispersion of electromagnetic
waves due to anisotropy, and describe how the spontaneous fluctuations of current in a 2D electronic
channel can radiate thermal energy in its hyperbolic surrounding medium. We show that both the regime
of (i) thermal current fluctuations and (ii) out-of-equilibrium current fluctuations can be described
within the framework of transmission line theory leading to (i) superPlanckian thermal emission
and (ii) electroluminescent cooling. We discuss a recent experimental investigation on graphene-on-hBN
transistors using electronic noise thermometry. In a high mobility semimetal like graphene at
large bias, a steady-state out-of-equilibrium situation is caused by the constant Zener tunneling
of electrons opening a route for electroluminescence of hyperbolic electromagnetic modes. Experiments
reveal that, compared to superPlanckian thermal emission, electroluminescence cooling is particularly
prominent once the Zener tunneling regime is reached: observed cooling powers are nine orders of
magnitude larger than in conventional LEDs.
