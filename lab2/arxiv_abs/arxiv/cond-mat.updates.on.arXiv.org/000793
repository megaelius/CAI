We present the prototype module of our extendible and robust multichannel SQUID magnetometer system.
A multi-module arrangement can be implemented by using up to 7 modules. It is intended for high-precision
measurements of biomagnetism and spin precession. Further demanding applications are magnetorelaxometry
and ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ULF NMR), where pulsed fields of up to 100 mT are
typically applied. The system is operated inside the Berlin Magnetically Shielded Room and equipped
with 18 magnetometers consisting of niobium (Nb) wire-wound pick-up coils. A total of 16 small pick-up
coils with 17.1 mm diameter form a regular grid with individual channels arranged to ensure system
sensitivity covers all three orthogonal spatial directions. Two large hexagonal pick-up coils
with an equivalent diameter of 74.5 mm sensitive in z-direction surround the grid at two different
heights and are suitable for the detection of deep sources. Each coil is connected to the input of
a thin-film Nb SQUID current sensor via a detachable superconducting contact. The SQUIDs are equipped
with integrated input current limiters. Feedback into the pick-up coils minimizes crosstalk between
channels. The current sensor chip package includes a superconducting shield of Nb. The field distortion
of the prototype and a multi-module arrangement was analysed by numerical simulation. The measured
noise of the small magnetometers was between 0.6 and 1.5 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$, and well below 1 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$
for the large ones. Using a software gradiometer, we achieved a minimum noise level of 0.54 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$.
We performed ULF NMR experiments, verifying the system's robustness against pulsed fields, and
magnetoencephalographgy (MEG) on somatosensory evoked neuronal activity. The low noise performance
of our 18-channel prototype enabled the detection of high-frequency components at around 1 kHz
by MEG.
