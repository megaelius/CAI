Structure evolutions in atoms of suitable elements do not show original mechanisms of formation.
This study deals with structure evolutions in atoms of those elements, which are feasible to execute
confined inter-state electron dynamics. The structures of these atoms get evolved during amalgamation
due to significantly attained dynamics. Structures evolve in different formats of exerting forces
as per mechanism of the electron dynamics in their atoms. In the neutral state, atoms transform heat
energy into binding energy having shapes like tick, integral or Gaussian distribution symbol.
The shape of binding energy depends on the built-in inter-state gap of atom. The evolving structure
of atoms having identical ground points deals with forced exertions to suitable electrons at the
same level, too. In atoms of space format, the structure evolves above the typical level of ground
surface. In atoms of grounded format, the structure evolves below the typical level of ground surface.
Dimensions of evolving structure depend on the number of quadrants of an atom executing electron
dynamics. In the elements, where atoms execute electron dynamics for three quadrants, they show
a bit complex mechanism of their structure evolution. An atom binds to the targeted atom at the points
of their generated energy. In the structure evolution of space format and grounded format, amalgamating
atoms bind to the targeted atom laterally from upward and downward sides respectively. In the structure
of surface format, amalgamated atoms bind to the target atom adjacently. In each definite format,
the adhering mono layers of bound atoms is by means of involved force and engaged energy. The chemical
activity of involved force and engaged energy exploits the chemical reactivity, adhering mono
layers of bound atoms...
