Characterizing the scaling with the total particle number ($N$) of the largest eigenvalue of the
one--body density matrix ($\lambda_0$), provides informations on the occurrence of the off-diagonal
long-range order (ODLRO) according to the Penrose-Onsager criterion. Setting $\lambda_0\sim
N^{\mathcal{C}_0}$, then $\mathcal{C}_0=1$ corresponds to ODLRO. The intermediate case, $0<\mathcal{C}_0<1$,
corresponds for translational invariant systems to the power-law decaying of (non-connected)
correlation functions and it can be seen as identifying quasi-long-range order. The goal of the
present paper is to characterize the ODLRO properties encoded in $\mathcal{C}_0$ [and in the corresponding
quantities $\mathcal{C}_{k \neq 0}$ for excited natural orbitals] exhibited by homogeneous interacting
bosonic systems at finite temperature for different dimensions. We show that $\mathcal{C}_{k
\neq 0}=0$ in the thermodynamic limit. In $1D$ it is $\mathcal{C}_0=0$ for non-vanishing temperature,
while in $3D$ $\mathcal{C}_0=1$ ($\mathcal{C}_0=0$) for temperatures smaller (larger) than
the Bose-Einstein critical temperature. We then focus our attention to $D=2$, studying the $XY$
and the Villain models, and the weakly interacting Bose gas. The universal value of $\mathcal{C}_0$
near the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless temperature $T_{BKT}$ is $7/8$. The dependence
of $\mathcal{C}_0$ on temperatures between $T=0$ (at which $\mathcal{C}_0=1$) and $T_{BKT}$
is studied in the different models. An estimate for the (non-perturbative) parameter $\xi$ entering
the equation of state of the $2D$ Bose gases, is obtained using low temperature expansions and compared
with the Monte Carlo result. We finally discuss a double jump behaviour for $\mathcal{C}_0$, and
correspondingly of the anomalous dimension $\eta$, right below $T_{BKT}$ in the limit of vanishing
interactions.
