Metastable states form by charge (electron and hole) capture in defects in a solid. These play an
important role in dosimetry, information storage, and many medical and industrial applications
of photonics. Despite many decades of research, charge transfer across metastable states and its
role in luminescence production is poorly understood. This is mainly because the measurement of
luminescence from metastable states involves several processes such as detrapping, transport,
competition, and electron-hole (henceforth e-h) recombination. Here we present a novel, coupled
OSL/PL (optically stimulated luminescence/ photoluminescence) system in a natural aluminosilicate
feldspar which comprises >50 % of the Earth crust, to understand the dynamics of the metastable states.
Infrared PL (IRPL) in feldspar is capable of directly probing the trapped electrons. Whereas, OSL
measures e-h recombination. Combining these two pieces of information, we develop here new analytical
methods, and based on these elucidate for the first time the thermal dependence, diffusion, thermo-optical
bleaching, and radiation-induced growth of electron and holes in feldspar. These results support
a strong presence of localized recombination mechanisms in feldspar. These new methods and insights
provide unique information for developing robust mathematical models that are crucial to the next
generation applications of luminescence dosimetry in Earth and environmental sciences. We expect
that this work will inspire a search of a similar coupled OSL-PL systems in other solid-state dosimeters
and enrich our understanding of luminescence phenomena involving the metastable states.
