Raza et al. recently observed the extraordinarily large energy blueshifts of localized surface
plasmon resonances and additional surface plasmon resonances of silver nanoparticles encapsulated
in silicon nitride, which are not fully understood yet. There exists a quantum model for metallic
nanospheres, which consists of two subsystems respectively for describing center of mass and intrinsic
motions of conduction electrons, and a coupling between center of mass and conduction electrons
outside the nanosphere. By using this model, we firstly deduced the general energy and linewidth
size-dependences of localized surface plasmon resonances. Secondly, we proposed that additional
surface plasmon resonances originate from degenerate state pairs of the total Hamiltonian. Then,
we implemented this generation mechanism of additional surface plasmon resonances in silver nanoparticles
encapsulated in silicon nitride and the calculated results are well consistent with experimental
measurements. Furthermore, we obtained a new energy expression of localized surface plasmon resonances,
with which we successfully explained the extraordinarily large energy blueshifts of localized
surface plasmon resonances of few-nanometer silver nanoparticles encapsulated in silicon nitride.
Finally, we calculated the localized and additional surface plasmon resonance energies of silver
nanoparticles resting on carbon films and the calculated results perfectly explain the experimental
measurements of Scholl et al.. Within the framework of this quantum model, the optical properties
of quantum-sized metallic nanoparticles are completely determined by degenerate or nearly degenerate
state pairs of the total Hamiltonian.
