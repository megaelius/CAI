Understanding transport in strongly interacting quantum matter is a central challenge in physics,
with phenomena as varied as superconductivity in cuprates and bi-layer graphene, inspirals of
neutron star binaries and perfect fluidity of the early universe. At the origin of the difficulties
in describing such transport lie the fermionic nature of the constituent particles and their strong
mutual interaction, leading to the absence of well-defined quasi-particles. Even methods from
string theory were employed to connect the physics of black holes to strongly correlated fluids.
Ultracold gases of fermionic atoms near scattering resonances realize a pristine model of strongly
interacting matter, where interactions are as strong as allowed by the unitarity of quantum mechanics.
Featuring a mean free path as short as one interparticle spacing, these systems display the most
robust form of fermionic superfluidity, near-perfect hydrodynamic flow even in the normal state
and universal transport properties. Here we experimentally investigate the attenuation of sound
in a homogeneous, strongly interacting Fermi gas, governed by the coupled transport of momentum
and heat, and quantified by the sound diffusivity D. In contrast to Fermi liquids such as 3He, we observe
a monotonic decrease in D upon lowering the temperature, instead of a diverging behavior D~1/T^2
expected from Pauli blocking of collisions. As the superfluid transition temperature is crossed,
D changes smoothly and attains a universal value set purely by the ratio of Planck's constant h and
the particle mass m. These findings highlight the universal nature of the unitary Fermi gas and inform
novel transport theories for strongly interacting fermionic matter. In particular, our results
exclude a relativistic conformal gravity dual of the unitary Fermi gas.
