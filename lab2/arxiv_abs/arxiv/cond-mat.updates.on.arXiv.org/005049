The static and time-dependent behaviours of adhesively bonded polyethylene Double-Strap (DS)
joints were investigated to assess the viability of this joint configuration relative to the Single-Lap
(SL) joints. Both experiments and finite element simulations are conducted. First, we individually
characterise the tensile and creep behaviour of the adhesive and adherent materials; an epoxy-based
adhesive and polyethylene, respectively. This information is used to develop suitable constitutive
models that are then implemented in the commercial finite element package ABAQUS by means of user
material subroutines, UMATs. The numerical models are used to design the creep tests on the adhesive
joints. Afterwards, an extensive experimental campaign is conducted where we characterise the
static and creep behaviour of two joint configurations, SL and DS joints, and three selected values
of the overlap length. In regard to the static case, results reveal an increase in the failure load
with increasing overlap length, of up to 10% for an overlap length of 39 mm. Also, slightly better
performance is observed for the SL joint configuration. For the creep experiments, we show that
the DS adhesive joint configuration leads to much shorter elongations, relative to the SL joints.
These differences diminish with increasing overlap length but remain substantial in all cases.
In both joint configurations, the elongation increases with decreasing overlap length. For instance,
increasing the overlap length to 39 mm led to a 50% and a 30% reduction in elongation for SL and DS joints,
respectively. Moreover, the numerical predictions show a good agreement with the experiments.
The stress redistribution is investigated and it is found that the shear stress is highly sensitive
to the testing time, with differences being more noticeable for the DS joint system.
