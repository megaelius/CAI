In this work, we studied the pathways for formation of stoichiometric \tcn~thin films. Polycrystalline
and epitaxial \tcn~films were prepared using reactive direct current magnetron (dcMS) sputtering
technique. A systematic variation in the substrate temperature (\Ts) during the dcMS process reveals
that the lattice parameter (LP) decreases as \Ts~increases. We found that nearly stoichiometric
\tcn~films can be obtained when \Ts~= 300\,K. However, they emerge from the transient state of Co
target ($\phi$3\,inch). By reducing the target size to $\phi$1\,inch, now the \tcn~phase formation
takes place from the metallic state of Co target. In this case, LP of \tcn~film comes out to be $\sim$99\p~of
the value expected for \tcn. This is the largest value of LP found so far for \tcn. The pathways achieved
for formation of polycrystalline \tcn~were adopted to grow an epitaxial \tcn~film, which shows
four fold magnetic anisotropy in magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements. Detailed characterization
using secondary ion mass spectroscopy indicates that N diffuses out when \Ts~is raised even to 400\,K.
Measurement of electronic structure using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray absorption
spectroscopy further confirms it. Magnetization measurements using bulk magnetization and polarized
neutron reflectivity show that the saturation magnetization of stoichiometric \tcn~film is even
larger than pure Co. Since all our measurements indicated that N could be diffusing out, when \tcn~films
are grown at high \Ts, we did actual N self-diffusion measurements in a CoN sample and found that N
self-diffusion was indeed substantially higher. The outcome of this work clearly shows that the
\tcn~films grown prior to this work were always N deficient and the pathways for formation of a stoichiometric
\tcn~have been achieved.
