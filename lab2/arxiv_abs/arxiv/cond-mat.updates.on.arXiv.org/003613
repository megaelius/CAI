Colloidal particles, which are ubiquitous, have become ideal testing grounds for the structural
glass transition (SGT) theories. In these systems glassy behavior is manifested as the density
of the particles is increased. Thus, soft colloidal particles with varying degree of softness capture
diverse glass forming properties, observed normally in molecular glasses. By performing Brownian
dynamics simulations for a binary mixture of micron-sized charged colloidal suspensions, known
to form Wigner glasses, we show that by tuning the softness of the potential, achievable by changing
the monovalent salt concentration, there is a continuous transition between fragile to strong
behavior. Remarkably, this is found in a system where the well characterized potential between
the colloidal particles is isotropic. We also show that the predictions of the random first order
transition (RFOT) theory quantitatively describes the universal features such as the growing
correlation length, $\xi\sim (\phi_K/\phi - 1)^{-\nu}$ with $\nu = 2/3$ where $\phi_K$, the analogue
of the Kauzmann temperature, depends on the salt concentration. As anticipated by the RFOT predictions,
we establish a causal relationship between the growing correlation length and a steep increase
in the relaxation time and dynamic heterogeneity. The broad range of fragility observed in Wigner
glasses is used to draw analogies with molecular glasses. The large variations in the fragility
is found only when the temperature dependence of the viscosity is examined for a large class of diverse
glass forming materials. In sharp contrast, this is vividly illustrated in a single system that
can be experimentally probed. Our work also shows that the RFOT predictions are accurate in describing
the dynamics over the entire density range, regardless of the fragility of the glasses, implying
that the physics describing the SGT is universal.
