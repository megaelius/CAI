We consider systems that start from and/or end in thermodynamic equilibrium while experiencing
a finite rate of change of their energy density or other intensive quantities q at intermediate times.
We demonstrate that at these times, during which the global intensive quantities q vary at a finite
rate, the associated covariance, the connected pair correlator $G_{ij} = \langle q_{i} q_{j} \rangle
- \langle q_{i} \rangle \langle q_{j} \rangle$, between any two far separated sites $i$ and $j$ in
a macroscopic system may, on average, become finite. Such non-vanishing connected correlations
between distant sites may also appear in theories that only have local interactions. Once the global
mean q no longer changes, the average of $G_{ij}$ over all site pairs $i$ and $j$ may tend to zero. However,
when the equilibration times are significant (e.g., as in a glass that is not in true thermodynamic
equilibrium yet in which the energy density (or temperature) reaches a final steady state value),
these long range correlations may persist also long after q ceases to change. We explore viable implications
of our findings and speculate on their potential realization in glasses (where a prediction of a
theory based on the effect that we describe here suggests a universal collapse of the viscosity that
agrees with all published viscosity measurements over sixteen decades) and non-Fermi liquids.
We derive uncertainty relation based inequalities connecting the heat capacity to the dynamics
in open thermal systems. These inequalities suggest the shortest possible fluctuation times scales
in open equilibrated systems at a temperature$T$ are typically "Planckian" (i.e., ${\cal{O}}(\hbar/(k_{B}
T))$). We comment on parallels between quantum measurements, unitary quantum evolution, and thermalization
and on how Gaussian distributions may generically emerge.
