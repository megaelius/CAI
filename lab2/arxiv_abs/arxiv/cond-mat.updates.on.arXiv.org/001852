Starting with a simple counting argument, we construct a statistical and thermodynamic model of
free Majorana fermions at low temperature. Originally defined as a fermion identical to its own
antiparticle state, Majorana particles often appear in the contemporary many-body literature
as non-Abelian zero energy modes in topological superconductors. We deviate from the usual anyonic
description and instead consider a gas of non-interacting, spin-1/2 Majorana fermions as Ettore
Majorana first envisioned them. The existence of a fermionic ground state in such a system is heavily
implied by standard quantum mechanical arguments and current theoretical insights from cold dark
matter physics. This allows us to build a quantum statistical theory of the Majorana system in the
low temperature, low density limit without the need to account for strong fluctuations in the particle
number. A combinatorial analysis of the many-body Majorana ensemble leads to a configurational
entropy which deviates from the fermionic result with an increasing number of available microstates.
A Majorana distribution function is then derived which shows signatures of a sharply-defined Fermi
surface at finite temperatures. The Majorana distribution is then re-derived from a microscopic
model in the form of a modified Kitaev chain with a bosonic pair interaction. The subsequent enlargement
of the Hilbert space then allows us to describe a self-hermitian fermionic system while preserving
a global U(1) gauge symmetry. The thermodynamics of the free Majorana system is found to be nearly
identical to that of a free Fermi gas, except now distinguished by a two-fold ground state degeneracy
and, subsequently, a residual entropy at zero temperature. Experimental realization of the Majorana
thermodynamics is then discussed in the context of real materials.
