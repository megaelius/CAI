Conformal field theory has recently been applied to derive few-body Hamiltonians whose ground
states are lattice versions of fractional quantum Hall states. The exact lattice models involve
interactions over long distances, which is difficult to realize in experiments. It seems, however,
that such long-range interactions should not be necessary, as the correlations decay exponentially
in the bulk. This poses the question, whether the Hamiltonians can be truncated to contain only local
interactions without changing the physics of the ground state. Previous studies have in a couple
of cases with particularly much symmetry obtained such local Hamiltonians by keeping only a few
local terms and numerically optimizing the coefficients. Here, we investigate a different strategy
to construct truncated Hamiltonians, which does not rely on optimization, and which can be applied
independent of the choice of lattice. We test the approach on two models with bosonic Laughlin-like
ground states with filling factor $1/2$ and $1/4$, respectively. We first investigate how the coupling
strengths in the exact Hamiltonian depend on distance, and then we study the truncated models. For
the model at $1/2$ filling, we find that the truncated model has an approximate twofold ground state
degeneracy on the torus, and the overlap per site between these states and the states constructed
from conformal field theory is higher than $0.98$ for all the studied lattices. For the model at $1/4$
filling, the overlap is again high, but some of the states with high overlap are found higher up in
the spectrum. We expect that this is due to finite size effects.
