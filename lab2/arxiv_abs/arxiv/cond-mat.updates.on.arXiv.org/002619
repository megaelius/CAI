In topological insulators and topological superconductors, the discrete jump of the topological
invariant upon tuning a certain system parameter defines a topological phase transition. A unified
framework is employed to address the quantum criticality of the topological phase transitions
in one to three spatial dimensions, which simultaneously incorporates the symmetry classification,
order of band crossing, $m$-fold rotational symmetry, correlation functions, critical exponents,
scaling laws, and renormalization group approach. We first classify higher-order Dirac models
according to the time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries, and determine the even-oddness
of the order of band crossing in each symmetry class. The even-oddness further constrains the rotational
symmetry $m$ permitted in a symmetry class. Expressing the topological invariant in terms of a momentum
space integration over a curvature function, the order of band crossing determines the critical
exponent of the curvature function, as well as that of the Wannier state correlation function introduced
through the Fourier transform of the curvature function. The conservation of topological invariant
further yields a scaling law between critical exponents. In addition, a renormalization group
approach based on deforming the curvature function is demonstrated for all dimensions and symmetry
classes. Through clarification of how the critical quantities, including the jump of the topological
invariant and critical exponents, depend on the nonspatial and the rotational symmetry, our work
introduces the notion of universality class into the description of topological phase transitions.
