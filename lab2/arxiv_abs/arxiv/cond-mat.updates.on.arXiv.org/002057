Materials with non-Kramers doublet ground states naturally manifest the two-channel Kondo effect,
as the valence fluctuations are from a non-Kramers doublet ground state to an excited Kramers doublet.
Here, the development of a heavy Fermi liquid requires a channel symmetry breaking spinorial hybridization
that breaks both single and double time-reversal symmetry, and is known as hastatic order. Motivated
by cubic Pr-based materials with $\Gamma_3$ non-Kramers ground state doublets, this paper provides
a survey of cubic hastatic order using the simple two-channel Kondo-Heisenberg model. Hastatic
order necessarily breaks time-reversal symmetry, but the spatial arrangement of the hybridization
spinor can be either uniform (ferrohastatic) or break additional lattice symmetries (antiferrohastatic).
The experimental signatures of both orders are presented in detail, and include tiny conduction
electron magnetic moments. Interestingly, there can be several distinct antiferrohastatic orders
with the same moment pattern that break different lattice symmetries, revealing a potential experimental
route to detect the spinorial nature of the hybridization. We employ an SU(N) fermionic mean-field
treatment on square and simple cubic lattices, and examine how the nature and stability of hastatic
order varies as we vary the Heisenberg coupling, conduction electron density, band degeneracies,
and apply both channel and spin symmetry breaking fields. We find that both ferrohastatic and several
types of antiferrohastatic orders are stabilized in different regions of the mean-field phase
diagram, and evolve differently in strain and magnetic fields.
