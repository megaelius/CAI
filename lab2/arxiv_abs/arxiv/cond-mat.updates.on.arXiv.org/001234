In this paper, we first review fundamental aspects of magnetoresistance in multi-valley systems
based on the semiclassical theory. Then we will review experimental evidence and theoretical understanding
of magnetoresistance in an archetypal multi-valley system, where the electric conductivity is
set by the sum of the contributions of different valleys. Bulk bismuth has three valleys with an extremely
anisotropic effective mass. As a consequence, the magnetoconductivity in each valley is extremely
sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field. Therefore, a rotating magnetic field plays
the role of a valley valve tuning the contribution of each valley to the total conductivity. In addition
to this simple semi-classical effect, other phenomena arise in the high-field limit as a consequence
of an intricate Landau spectrum. In the vicinity of the quantum limit, the orientation of magnetic
field significantly affects the distribution of carriers in each valley, namely, the valley polarization
is induced by the magnetic field. Moreover, experiment has found that well beyond the quantum limit,
one or two valleys become totally empty. This is the only case in condensed-matter physics where
a Fermi sea is completely dried up by a magnetic field without a metal-insulator transition. There
have been two long-standing problems on bismuth near the quantum limit: the large anisotropic Zeeman
splitting of holes, and the extra peaks in quantum oscillations, which cannot be assigned to any
known Landau levels. These problems are solved by taking into account the interband effect due to
the spin-orbit couplings for the former, and the contributions from the twinned crystal for the
latter. Up to here, the whole spectrum can be interpreted within the one-particle theory. Finally,
we will discuss transport and thermodynamic signatures of breaking of the valley symmetry in this
system.
