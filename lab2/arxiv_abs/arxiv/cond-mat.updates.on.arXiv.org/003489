We study the energy and entanglement dynamics of $(1+1)$D conformal field theories (CFTs) under
a Floquet drive with the sine-square deformed (SSD) Hamiltonian. Previous work has shown this model
supports both a non-heating and a heating phase. Here we analytically establish several robust
and `super-universal' features of the heating phase which rely on conformal invariance but not
on the details of the CFT involved. First, we show the energy density is concentrated in two peaks
in real space, a chiral and anti-chiral peak, which leads to an exponential growth in the total energy.
The peak locations are set by fixed points of the M\"obius transformation. Second, all of the quantum
entanglement is shared between these two peaks. In each driving period, a number of Bell pairs are
generated, with one member pumped to the chiral peak, and the other member pumped to the anti-chiral
peak. These Bell pairs are localized and accumulate at these two peaks, and can serve as a source of
quantum entanglement. Third, in both the heating and non-heating phases we find that the total energy
is related to the half system entanglement entropy by a simple relation $E(t)\propto c \exp \left(
\frac{6}{c}S(t) \right)$ with $c$ being the central charge. In addition, we show that the non-heating
phase, in which the energy and entanglement oscillate in time, is unstable to small fluctuations
of the driving frequency in contrast to the heating phase. Finally, we point out an analogy to the
periodically driven harmonic oscillator which allows us to understand global features of the phases,
and introduce a quasiparticle picture to explain the spatial structure, which can be generalized
to setups beyond the SSD construction.
