In their original formulation of superconductivity, the London brothers predicted more than eighty
years ago the exponential suppression of an $electrostatic$ field inside a superconductor over
the so-called London penetration depth, $\lambda_L$, in analogy to the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect.
$\lambda_L$ ranges from a few tens to several hundreds of nanometers for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) superconductors. Conventional BCS predictions based on Fermi liquid estimate a sub-atomic
electrical penetration depth which coincides with the Thomas-Fermi screening length. Yet, more
recent theories have suggested that, albeit being localized at the surface, electrostatic fields
may manifest themselves non-locally deep inside the superconductor, i.e., at distances of the
order of the coherence length or larger. Despite a few experiments indicating hints of perturbation
induced by electrostatic fields, no clue has been provided so far on the possibility to manipulate
conventional superconductors via field-effect. Here we report the evidence of full field-effect
control of the supercurrent in $all$-metallic transistors made of different BCS superconducting
thin films. At low temperature, our field-effect transistors (FETs) show a monotonic decay of the
critical current under increasing electrostatic field up to total quenching for gate voltage values
as large as $\pm 40$V in titanium-based devices. This $bipolar$ field effect persists up to $\sim
85\%$ of the critical temperature ($\sim 0.41$K), and in the presence of sizable magnetic fields.
A similar behavior, though less pronounced, was observed in aluminum thin film FETs. A phenomenological
theory accounts for our observations, and provides a description compatible with an electric-field-induced
non-local perturbation propagating deeply inside the superconducting film.
