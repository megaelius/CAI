The analytic treatment of the non-inertial rotational diffusion equation, i.e., of the Smoluchowski's
one (SE), in a symmetric genuinely double-well Maier-Saupe uniaxial potential of mean torque is
considered. Such potential may find applications to reorientations of the fragments of structure
in polymers and proteins. We obtain the exact solution of SE via the confluent Heun's function. The
solution is uniformly valid for any barrier height. We apply the obtained solution to the calculation
of the mean first passage time and the longitudinal correlation time and obtain their precise dependence
on the barrier height. In the intermediate to high barrier (low temperature) region the results
of our approach are in full agreement with those of the approach developed by Coffey, Kalmykov, D\'ejardin
and their coauthors. In the low barrier (high temperature) region our results noticeably distinguish
from the predictions of the literature formula and give appreciably greater values for the transition
rates from the potential well. The reason is that the above mentioned formula is obtained in the stationary
limit. We conclude that for very small barrier heights the transient dynamics plays a crucial role
and has to be taken into account explicitly. When this requirement is satisfied (as, e.g, at the calculation
of the longitudinal correlation time) we obtain absolute identity of our results with the literature
formula in the whole range of barrier heights. The drawbacks of our approach are its applicability
only to the symmetric potential and its inability to yield an analytical expression for the smallest
non-vanishing eigenvalue.
