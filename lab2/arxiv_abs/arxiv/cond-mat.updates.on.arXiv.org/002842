The ability to interface superconductors with semiconductors is a critically-missing component
of the advanced computing ecosystem. At present, a significant number of scalable quantum computing
and neuromorphic architectures plan to operate at cryogenic temperatures, using superconductors
as the basis of their architecture or as a measurement component. In these architectures, semiconductor
systems are often proposed as a top-level control with low-temperature passive components and
intermediary superconducting electronics acting as the direct interface to the lowest-temperature
stages--this stratification is required because semiconductor-based amplification of small
superconducting signals consumes too much power for extensive use at kelvin-scale temperatures.
As a result, these architectures necessarily require a low-power superconductor-semiconductor
interface that presently does not exist, for example to leverage CMOS coprocessors for classical
control of superconducting qubits, or as a means to drive optoelectronics from superconducting
detectors. Here we present a superconducting switch device that is capable of translating low-voltage
superconducting inputs directly into semiconductor-compatible (>1,000 mV) outputs at kelvin-scale
temperatures. As a demonstration of a superconductor-semiconductor interface, we have used the
switch to drive an LED in a photonic integrated circuit, generating photons at 1 K from a low-voltage
input and detecting them with an on-chip superconducting single-photon detector. We additionally
characterized the device's timing response (<300 ps turn-on, ~15 ns turn-off), output impedance
limitations (>1 M{\Omega}), and energy requirements (0.18 fJ/um^2, 3.24 mV/nW). Despite its simplicity
as a thermal device, we found that this device is an extremely promising candidate for a superconductor-to-semiconductor
logical interface.
