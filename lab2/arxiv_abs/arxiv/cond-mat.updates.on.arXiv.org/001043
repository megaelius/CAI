We report on a comprehensive theory-simulation-experimental study of collective and self-diffusion
in suspensions of charge-stabilized colloidal spheres. In simulation and theory, the spheres
interact by a hard-core plus screened Coulomb pair potential. Intermediate and self-intermediate
scattering functions are calculated by accelerated Stokesian Dynamics simulations where hydrodynamic
interactions (HIs) are fully accounted for. The study spans the range from the short-time to the
colloidal long-time regime. Additionally, Brownian Dynamics simulation and mode-coupling theory
(MCT) results are generated where HIs are neglected. It is shown that HIs enhance collective and
self-diffusion at intermediate and long times, whereas at short times self-diffusion, and for
certain wavenumbers also collective diffusion, are slowed down. MCT significantly overestimate
the slowing influence of dynamic particle caging. The simulated scattering functions are in decent
agreement with our dynamic light scattering (DLS) results for suspensions of charged silica spheres.
Simulation and theoretical results are indicative of a long-time exponential decay of the intermediate
scattering function. The approximate validity of a far-reaching time-wavenumber factorization
of the scattering function is shown to be a consequence of HIs. Our study of collective diffusion
is amended by simulation and theoretical results for the self-intermediate scattering function
and the particle mean squared displacement (MSD). Since self-diffusion is not assessed in DLS measurements,
a method to deduce the MSD approximately in DLS is theoretically validated.
