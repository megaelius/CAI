Solitons are localised wave disturbances that propagate without changing shape, a result of a nonlinear
interaction which compensates for wave packet dispersion. Individual solitons may collide, but
a defining feature is that they pass through one another and emerge from the collision unaltered
in shape, amplitude, or velocity. This remarkable property is mathematically a consequence of
the underlying integrability of the one-dimensional (1D) equations, such as the nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation, that describe solitons in a variety of wave contexts, including matter-waves$^{1,2}$.
Here we explore the nature of soliton collisions using Bose-Einstein condensates of atoms with
attractive interactions confined to a quasi-one-dimensional waveguide. We show by real-time
imaging that a collision between solitons is a complex event that differs markedly depending on
the relative phase between the solitons. Yet, they emerge from the collision unaltered in shape
or amplitude, but with a new trajectory reflecting a discontinuous jump. By controlling the strength
of the nonlinearity we shed new light on these fundamental features of soliton collisional dynamics,
and explore the implications of collisions that bring the wave packets out of the realm of integrability,
where they may undergo catastrophic collapse. 1. Zabusky, N.J. & Kruskal, M.D. Interaction
