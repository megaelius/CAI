We study a generalization of the Alessandro-Beatrice-Bertotti-Montorsi (ABBM) model of a particle
in a Brownian force landscape, including retardation effects. We show that under monotonous driving
the particle moves forward at all times, as it does in absence of retardation (Middleton's theorem).
This remarkable property allows us to develop an analytical treatment. The model with an exponentially
decaying memory kernel is realized in Barkhausen experiments with eddy-current relaxation, and
has previously been shown numerically to account for the experimentally observed asymmetry of
Barkhausen-pulse shapes. We elucidate another qualitatively new feature: the breakup of each
avalanche of the standard ABBM model into a cluster of sub-avalanches, sharply delimited for slow
relaxation under quasi-static driving. These conditions are typical for earthquake dynamics.
With relaxation and aftershock clustering, the present model includes important ingredients
for an effective description of earthquakes. We analyze quantitatively the limits of slow and fast
relaxation for stationary driving with velocity v>0. The v-dependent power-law exponent for
small velocities, and the critical driving velocity at which the particle velocity never vanishes,
are modified. We also analyze non-stationary avalanches following a step in the driving magnetic
field. Analytically, we obtain the mean avalanche shape at fixed size, the duration distribution
of the first sub-avalanche, and the time dependence of the mean velocity. We propose to study these
observables in experiments, allowing to directly measure the shape of the memory kernel, and to
trace eddy current relaxation in Barkhausen noise.
