Spin Hall effects are a collection of relativistic spin-orbit coupling phenomena in which electrical
currents can generate transverse spin currents and vice versa. Although first observed only a decade
ago, these effects are already ubiquitous within spintronics as standard spin-current generators
and detectors. Here we review the experimental and theoretical results that have established this
sub-field of spintronics. We focus on the results that have converged to give us a clear understanding
of the phenomena and how they have evolved from a qualitative to a more quantitative measurement
of spin-currents and their associated spin-accumulation. Within the experimental framework,
we review optical, transport, and magnetization-dynamics based measurements and link them to
both phenomenological and microscopic theories of the effect. Within the theoretical framework,
we review the basic mechanisms in both the extrinsic and intrinsic regime which are linked to the
mechanisms present in their closely related phenomenon in ferromagnets, the anomalous Hall effect.
We also review the connection to the phenomenological treatment based on spin-diffusion equations
applicable to certain regimes, as well as the spin-pumping theory of spin-generation which has
proven important in the measurements of the spin Hall angle. We further connect the spin-current
generating spin Hall effect to the inverse spin galvanic effect, which often accompanies the SHE,
in which an electrical current induces a non-equilibrium spin polarization. These effects share
common microscopic origins and can exhibit similar symmetries when present in ferromagnetic/non-magnetic
structures through their induced current-driven spin torques. Although we give a short chronological
overview, the main body is structured from a pedagogical point of view, focusing on well-established
and accepted physics.
