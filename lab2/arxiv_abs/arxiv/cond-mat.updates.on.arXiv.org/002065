The creation of moir\'e patterns in crystalline solids is a powerful approach to manipulate their
electronic properties, which are fundamentally influenced by periodic potential landscapes.
In 2D materials, a moir\'e pattern with a superlattice potential can form by vertically stacking
two layered materials with a twist and/or finite lattice constant difference. This unique approach
has led to emergent electronic phenomena, including the fractal quantum Hall effect, tunable Mott
insulators, and unconventional superconductivity. Furthermore, theory predicts intriguing
effects on optical excitations by a moir\'e potential in 2D valley semiconductors, but these signatures
have yet to be experimentally detected. Here, we report experimental evidence of interlayer valley
excitons trapped in a moir\'e potential in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. At low temperatures,
we observe photoluminescence near the free interlayer exciton energy but with over 100 times narrower
linewidths. The emitter g-factors are homogeneous across the same sample and only take two values,
-15.9 and 6.7, in samples with twisting angles near 60{\deg} and 0\deg, respectively. The g-factors
match those of the free interlayer exciton, which is determined by one of two possible valley pairing
configurations. At a twist angle near 20\deg, the emitters become two orders of magnitude dimmer,
but remarkably, they possess the same g-factor as the heterobilayer near 60\deg. This is consistent
with the Umklapp recombination of interlayer excitons near the commensurate 21.8{\deg} twist
angle. The emitters exhibit strong circular polarization, which implies the preservation of three-fold
rotation symmetry by the trapping potential. Together with the power and excitation energy dependence,
all evidence points to their origin as interlayer excitons trapped in a smooth moir\'e potential
with inherited valley-contrasting physics.
