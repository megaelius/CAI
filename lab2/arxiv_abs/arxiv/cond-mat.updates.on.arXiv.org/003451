Bottle brushes are polymeric macromolecules made of a linear polymeric backbone grafted with side
chains. The choice of the grafting density {\sigma}g, the length ns the grafted side chains and their
chemical nature fully determines the properties of each macromolecule, such as its elasticity
and its folding behaviour. Typically, experimental bottle brushes are systems made of tens of thousands
of monomeric units, rendering a computational approach extremely expensive, especially in the
case of bottle brush solutions. A proper coarse graining description of these macromolecules thus
appears essential. We present here a theoretical approach able to develop a general, transferable
and analytical multi-scale coarse graining of homopolymeric bottle brush polymers under good
solvent conditions. Starting from scaling theories, each macromolecule is mapped onto a chain
of tethered star polymers, whose effective potential is known from scaling predictions, computational
and experimental validations and can be expressed as a function of the number of arms f, and the length
na of each arm. Stars are then tethered to one another and the effective potential between them is
shown to only depend on the key parameters of the original bottle brush polymer ({\sigma}g, ns).
The generalised form of the effective potential is then used to reproduce properties of the macromolecules
obtained both with scaling theories and with simulations. The general form of the effective potentials
derived in the current study allows a theoretical and computational description of the properties
of homopolymeric bottle brush polymers for all grafting densities and all lengths of both backbone
and grafted arms, opening the path for a manifold of applications.
