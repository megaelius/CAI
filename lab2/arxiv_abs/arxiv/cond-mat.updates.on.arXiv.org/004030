Silver and copper monohalides can be viewed as a class of compounds in the neutral zone between predominantly
covalent and ionic compounds, thereby exhibiting neither strong ionicity nor strong covalency.
We show ab initio calculation evidence that silver and copper monohalides entail relatively low
transition barriers between the non-polar rock-salt phase and the polar zinc-blende phase, due
largely to their unique chemical nature of modest iconicity or covalency. Notably, the low transition
barriers endow both monohalides with novel mechanical and electronic properties, i.e., coupled
ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity with large polarizations and relatively low switching
barriers at ambient conditions. Several halides even possess very similar lattice constants and
structures as the prevailing semiconductors such as silicon, thereby enabling epitaxial growth
on silicon. Moreover, based on extensive structural search, we find that the most stable two-dimensional
(2D) polymorphs of the monolayer halides are close or even greater in energy than their bulk counterparts,
a feature not usually seen in the family of rock-salt or zinc-blende semiconductors. The low transition
barrier between zinc-blende phase and 2D phase is predicted. Moreover, several 2D monolayer halides
also exhibit multiferroicity with coupled ferroelasticity or ferroelectricity, thereby rendering
their potential applications as high-density integrated memories for efficient data reading
and writing. Their surfaces, covered by halides, also provide oxidation resistance and give low
cleave energy from layered structure, suggesting high likelihood of experimental synthesis of
these 2D polymorphs.
