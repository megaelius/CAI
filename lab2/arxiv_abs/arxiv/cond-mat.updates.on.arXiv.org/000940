We investigate the effects of long-ranged Coulomb interactions in a tilted Dirac semimetal in two
dimensions by using the perturbative renormalization-group method. Depending on the magnitude
of the tilting parameter, the undoped system can have either Fermi points (type-I) or Fermi lines
(type-II). Previous studies usually performed the renormalization-group transformations by
integrating out the modes with large momenta. This is problematic when the Fermi surface is open,
like type-II Dirac fermions. In this work, we study the effects of Coulomb interactions, following
the spirit of Shankar\cite{Shankar}, by introducing a cutoff in the energy scale around the Fermi
surface and integrating out the high-energy modes. For type-I Dirac fermions, our result is consistent
with that of the previous work. On the other hand, we find that for type-II Dirac fermions, the magnitude
of the tilting parameter increases monotonically with lowering energies. This implies the stability
of type-II Dirac fermions in the presence of Coulomb interactions, in contrast with previous results.
Furthermore, for type-II Dirac fermions, the velocities in different directions acquire different
renormalization even if they have the same bare values. By taking into account the renormalization
of the tilting parameter and the velocities due to the Coulomb interactions, we show that while the
presence of a charged impurity leads only to charge redistribution around the impurity for type-I
Dirac fermions, for type-II Dirac fermions, the impurity charge is completely screened, albeit
with a very long screening length. The latter indicates that the temperature dependence of physical
observables are essentially determined by the RG equations we derived. We illustrate this by calculating
the temperature dependence of the compressibility and specific heat of the interacting tilted
Dirac fermions.
