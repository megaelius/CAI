Doping Bi$_2$Se$_3$ by magnetic ions represents an interesting problem since it may break the time
reversal symmetry needed to maintain the topological insulator character. Mn dopants in Bi$_2$Se$_3$
represent one of the most studied examples here. However, there is a lot of open questions regarding
their magnetic ordering. In the experimental literature different Curie temperatures or no ferromagnetic
order at all are reported for comparable Mn concentrations. This suggests that magnetic ordering
phenomena are complex and highly susceptible to different growth parameters, which are known to
affect material defect concentrations. So far theory focused on Mn dopants in one possible position,
and neglected relaxation effects as well as native defects. We have used ab initio methods to calculate
the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ electronic structure influenced by magnetic Mn dopants, and exchange interactions
between them. We have considered two possible Mn positions, the substitutional and interstitial
one, and also native defects. We have found a sizable relaxation of atoms around Mn, which affects
significantly magnetic interactions. Surprisingly, very strong interactions correspond to
a specific position of Mn atoms separated by van der Waals gap. Based on the calculated data we performed
spin dynamics simulations to examine systematically the resulting magnetic order for various
defect contents. We have found under which conditions the experimentally measured Curie temperatures
${T_{\rm{C}}}$ can be reproduced, noticing that interstitial Mn atoms appear to be important here.
Our theory predicts the change of ${T_{\rm{C}}}$ with a shift of Fermi level, which opens the way
to tune the system magnetic properties by selective doping.
