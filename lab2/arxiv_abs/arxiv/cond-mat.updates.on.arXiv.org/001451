Coulomb interactions famously drive three dimensional quadratic band crossing semimetals into
a non-Fermi liquid phase of matter. In a previous work, Phys. Rev. B 95, 205106 (2017), the effect
of disorder on this non-Fermi liquid phase was investigated, assuming that the bandstructure was
isotropic, assuming that the conduction and valence bands had the same band mass, and assuming that
the disorder preserved exact time-reversal symmetry and statistical isotropy. It was shown that
the non-Fermi liquid fixed point is unstable to disorder, and that a runaway flow to strong disorder
occurs. In this work, we extend that analysis by relaxing the assumption of time-reversal symmetry
and allowing the electron and hole masses to differ (but continuing to assume isotropy of the low
energy bandstructure). We first incorporate time-reversal symmetry breaking disorder, and demonstrate
that there do not appear any new fixed points. Moreover, while the system continues to flow to strong
disorder, time-reversal-symmetry-breaking disorder grows asymptotically more slowly than
time-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder, which we therefore expect should dominate the
strong-coupling phase. We then allow for unequal electron and hole masses. We show that whereas
asymmetry in the two masses is irrelevant in the clean system, it is relevant in the presence of disorder,
such that the 'effective masses' of the conduction and valence bands should become sharply distinct
in the low-energy limit. We calculate the RG flow equations for the disordered interacting system
with unequal band masses, and demonstrate that the problem exhibits a runaway flow to strong disorder.
Along the runaway flow, time-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder grows asymptotically more
rapidly than both time-reversal-symmetry-breaking disorder and the Coulomb interaction.
