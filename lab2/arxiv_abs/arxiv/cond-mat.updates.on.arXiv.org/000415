In many cases, the relativistic spin-orbit (SO) interaction is regarded to be small and can be treated
using perturbation theory. The major obstacle on this route comes from the fact that the SO interaction
can also polarize the electron system and produce additional contributions to the perturbation
theory, arising from the electron-electron interactions. In electronic structure calculations,
it may even lead to necessity to abandon the perturbation theory and return to the self-consistently
solution of Kohn-Sham-like equations with the effective potential $\hat{v}$, incorporating
the effects of the electron-electron interactions and the SO coupling, even though the latter is
small. In this work, we present the theory of self-consistent linear response (SCLR), which allows
us to get rid of numerical self-consistency and formulate it analytically in the first order of the
SO coupling. This strategy is applied to the Hartree-Fock solution of the effective Hubbard model,
derived from electronic structure calculations in the Wannier basis. By using $\hat{v}$, obtained
from SCLR, one can successfully reproduce results of ordinary calculations for the orbital magnetization
and other properties in the first order of the SO coupling. Particularly, SCLR appears to be extremely
useful for calculations of antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions based on the
magnetic force theorem. Furthermore, due to the powerful 2n+1 theorem, the SCLR theory allows us
to calculate the magnetic anisotropy energy up to the third order of the SO coupling. The fruitfulness
of this approach is illustrated on a number of example, including the spin canting in YTiO$_3$ and
LaMnO$_3$, formation of spiral magnetic order in BiFeO$_3$, and the magnetic inversion symmetry
breaking in BiMnO$_3$, which gives rise to both ferroelectric activity and DM interactions, responsible
for the ferromagnetism.
