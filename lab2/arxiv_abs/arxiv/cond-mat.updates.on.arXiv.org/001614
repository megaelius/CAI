Experiments of the recrystallization processes in two-dimensional complex plasmas are analyzed
in order to rigorously test a recently developed scale-free phase transition theory. The "Fractal-Domain-Structure"
(FDS) theory is based on the kinetic theory of Frenkel. It assumes the formation of homogeneous domains,
separated by defect lines, during crystallization and a fractal relationship between domain area
and boundary length. For the defect number fraction and system energy a scale free power-law relation
is predicted. The long range scaling behavior of the bond order correlation function shows clearly
that the complex plasma phase transitions are not of KTHNY type. Previous preliminary results obtained
by counting the number of dislocations and applying a bond order metric for structural analysis
are reproduced. These findings are supplemented by extending the use of the bond order metric to
measure the defect number fraction and furthermore applying state-of-the-art analysis methods,
allowing a systematic testing of the FDS theory with unprecedented scrutiny: A morphological analysis
of lattice structure is performed via Minkowski tensor methods. Minkowski tensors form a complete
family of additive, motion covariant and continuous morphological measures that are sensitive
to non-linear properties. The FDS theory is rigorously confirmed and predictions of the theory
are reproduced extremely well. The predicted scale-free power law relation between defect fraction
number and system energy is verified for one more order of magnitude at high energies compared to
the inherently discontinuous bond order metric. Minkowski Tensor analysis turns out to be a powerful
tool for investigations of crystallization processes. It is capable to reveal non-linear local
topological properties, however, still provides easily interpretable results founded on a solid
mathematical framework.
