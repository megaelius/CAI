We propose a Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) theory to describe stochastic fluctuation and relaxation
processes of lattice vibration at a wide range of conditions, including those beyond the phonon
gas (PG) limit. Using the time-dependent, multiple state-variable probability function of a FPE,
we first derive time-correlation functions of lattice heat currents in terms of correlation functions
among multiple vibrational modes, and subsequently predict the thermal conductivity based on
the Green-Kubo formalism. When the kinetic transport theories are valid, this FPE not only predicts
a thermal conductivity that is identical to the one predicted by the phonon Boltzmann transport
equation, but also provides additional microscopic details on the multiple-mode correlation
functions. More importantly, when the kinetic theories become insufficient due to the breakdown
of the PG approximation, this FPE theory remains valid to study the correlation functions among
vibrational modes in highly anharmonic lattices with significant mode-mode interactions and/or
in disordered lattices with strongly localized modes. At the limit of weak mode-mode interactions,
we can adopt quantum perturbation theories to derive the drift/diffusion coefficients based on
the anharmonicity data derived from first-principles methods. As temperature elevates to the
classical regime, we can perform molecular dynamics simulations to directly compute the coefficients.
Because these coefficients are defined as ensemble averages at the short time limit, we can implement
massive parallel simulation algorithms to take full advantage of the paralleled high-performance
computing platforms. A better understanding of the temperature-dependent coefficients up to
melting temperatures will provide new insights on microscopic mechanisms that govern the heat
conduction through anharmonic and/or disordered lattices beyond the PG model.
