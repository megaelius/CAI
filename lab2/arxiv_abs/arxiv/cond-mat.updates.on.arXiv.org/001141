We show that pure surface effects could be utilized to systematically reduce the losses experienced
by surface plasma waves (SPWs) supported on the interface between a metal and a dielectric (usually
the vacuum). These effects occur in a double-fold way: first through a self-consistent treatment
of the role played by surface in charge dynamics and then by means of translation symmetry breaking.
A generic charge density wave theory is set up to take care of these aspects, with inlcusion of real-world
complications such as inter-band transition and dielectric effects. Existing theories impose
artificial boundary conditions at the surface and have totally missed such effects. A unified view
of and a comparison among various existing models, including the classical Drude model, the hydrodynamic
model and the specular reflection model as well as the semi-classical model, are presented in light
of the theory. Some historical misconceptions are clarified concerning these models. Experimental
consequences, in regard to the possibility of overcompensating for the energy losses suffered
by SPWs, are exemplified for two common plasmonic materials: silver (Ag) and aluminum (Al). In both
metals, the losses are argued to have been substantially reduced because of the surface effects
but not overcompensated. In Ag, the inter-band transition effects significantly weaken such effects
and make them unable to beat the losses, while in Al the loss rate is too high. Nevertheless, we find
it possible to enhance the surface effects by replacing the vacuum with a moderate dielectric so
that the losses can be overcompensated in Ag. This prediction calls for experimental scrutiny.
