Macroscopic magnetic properties and microscopic magnetic structure of Rb$_2$Mn$_3$(MoO$_4$)$_3$(OH)$_2$
(space group $Pnma$) are investigated by magnetization, heat capacity and single-crystal neutron
diffraction measurements. The compound's crystal structure contains bond-alternating [Mn$_3$O$_{11}$]$^{\infty}$
chains along the $b$-axis, formed by isosceles triangles of Mn ions occupying two crystallographically
nonequivalent sites (Mn1 site on the base and Mn2 site on the vertex). These chains are only weakly
linked to each other by nonmagnetic oxyanions. Both SQUID magnetometry and neutron diffraction
experiments show two successive magnetic transitions as a function of temperature. On cooling,
it transitions from a paramagnetic phase into an incommensurate phase below 4.5~K with a magnetic
wavevector near ${\bf k}_{1} = (0,~0.46,~0)$. An additional commensurate antiferromagnetically
ordered component arises with ${\bf k}_{2} = (0,~0,~0)$, forming a complex magnetic structure
below 3.5~K with two different propagation vectors of different stars. On further cooling, the
incommensurate wavevector undergoes a lock-in transition below 2.3~K. The experimental results
suggest that the magnetic superspace group is $Pnma.1'(0b0)s0ss$ for the single-${\bf k}$ incommensurate
phase and is $Pn'ma(0b0)00s$ for the 2-${\bf k}$ magnetic phase. We propose a simplified magnetic
structure model taking into account the major ordered contributions, where the commensurate ${\bf
k}_{2}$ defines the ordering of the $c$-axis component of Mn1 magnetic moment, while the incommensurate
${\bf k}_{1}$ describes the ordering of the $ab$-plane components of both Mn1 and Mn2 moments into
