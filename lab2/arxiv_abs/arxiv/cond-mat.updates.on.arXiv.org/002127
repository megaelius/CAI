We investigate the finite bending and the associated bending instability of an incompressible
dielectric slab subject to a combination of applied voltage and axial compression, using nonlinear
electro-elasticity theory and its incremental version. We first study the static finite bending
deformation of the slab. We then derive the three-dimensional equations for the onset of small-amplitude
wrinkles superimposed upon the finite bending. We use the surface impedance matrix method to build
a robust numerical procedure for solving the resulting dispersion equations and determining the
wrinkled shape of the slab at the onset of buckling. Our analysis is valid for dielectrics modeled
by a general free energy function. We then present illustrative numerical calculations for ideal
neo-Hookean dielectrics. In that case, we provide an explicit treatment of the boundary value problem
of the finite bending and derive closed-form expressions for the stresses and electric field in
the body. For the incremental deformations, we validate our analysis by recovering existing results
in more specialized contexts. We show that the applied voltage has a destabilizing effect on the
bending instability of the slab, while the effect of the axial load is more complex: when the voltage
is applied, changing the axial loading will influence the true electric field in the body, and induce
competitive effects between the circumferential instability due to the voltage and the axial instability
due to the axial compression. We even find circumstances where both instabilities cohabit to create
two-dimensional patterns on the inner face of the bent sector.
