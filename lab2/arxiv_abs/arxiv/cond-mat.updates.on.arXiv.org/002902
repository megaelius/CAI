We provide a classification of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of many-body localized
(MBL) spin and fermionic systems in one dimension. For spin systems, using tensor networks we show
that all eigenstates of these phases have the same topological index as defined for symmetry-protected
ground states. For unitary on-site symmetries, the MBL phases are thus labeled by the elements of
the second cohomology group of the symmetry group. A similar classification is obtained for anti-unitary
on-site symmetries, time-reversal symmetry being a special case with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification
(cf. [Phys. Rev. B 98, 054204 (2018)]). For the classification of fermionic MBL phases, we propose
a fermionic tensor network diagrammatic formulation. We show that fermionic MBL systems with an
(anti-)unitary symmetry are classified by the elements of the (generalized) second cohomology
group if parity is included into the symmetry group. An important consequence is that the famous
$\mathbb{Z}_8$ classification of fermionic ground states with time reversal symmetry breaks
down to a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ classification in the MBL case. We explicitly derive the corresponding
topological invariants shared by all eigenstates. Finally, we show that all those phases are stable
given the symmetry unless the system ceases to be fully many-body localized. Conversely, different
topological phases must be separated by a transition marked by delocalized eigenstates. We demonstrate
that the classification is complete in the sense that there cannot be any additional topological
indices pertaining to the properties of individual eigenstates.
