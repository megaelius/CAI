Borosilicones (e.g., Silly Putty) have been known for 70 years, but their peculiar behaviors have
remain unexplained. In this work, experiment and theory are used to show that they are network liquids---dynamic
macromolecules that appear elastic on short timescales but exhibit flow on longer timescales.
Each borosilicone is a vast covalent network of silicone polymer chains joined by trifunctional
boron crosslinks. At any instant, the borosilicone is a highly-crosslinked elastic material.
Because the boron crosslinks are temporary, however, the network evolves with time and the borosilicone
exhibits liquid behavior. A simple borosilicone exemplifies a classic transient network model
and behaves as a simple (Lodge) elastic fluid. Its measured moduli and viscosities fit those predicted
by the transient network model and the Maxwell viscoelastic model: a spring in series with a dashpot,
including the observed exponential relaxation processes. When a borosilicone includes permanent
crosslinks, however, it no longer behaves as a simple elastic fluid. Its measured moduli and viscosities
fit those predicted by the Fractional Maxwell viscoelastic model: a spring in series with a the spring-pot,
including the observed slower-than-exponential relaxation processes. Beyond the gelation threshold,
a borosilicone becomes a viscoelastic silicone rubber (VSR). With a permanent network that spans
the material coupled to a temporary network that also spans the material, the VSR is a network liquid
piggybacking on a network solid. The Fractional Zener viscoelastic model: an elastic spring in
parallel to the Fractional Maxwell model, accurately predicts the measured moduli of VSRs. The
temporary nature of boron crosslinks is due to exchange reactions. Because the mean lifetime of
temporary crosslinks is a borosilicone's only significant timescale, it exhibits thermo-rheological
simplicity.
