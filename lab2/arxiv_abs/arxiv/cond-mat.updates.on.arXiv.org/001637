Chemically-reduced graphene-oxide-supported gold nanoparticles are considered here as catalytic
materials for the reduction of oxygen in alkaline medium. Gold nanoparticles are prepared by the
chemical reduction method, in which the NaBH4-prereduced Keggin-type phosphomolybdate heteropolyblue
acts as the reducing agent for the precursor (HAuCl4). Polyoxmetallate (PMo12O403-) capping ligands
stabilize gold nanoparticle deposits, facilitate their dispersion and attachment to carbon supports.
Indeed, it is apparent from the independent diagnostic voltammetric experiments (in 0.5 mol dm-3
H2SO4) that heteropolymolybdates form readily stable adsorbates on nanostructures of both gold
and carbon (reduced graphene oxide and Vulcan). It is reasonable to expect that the polyoxometallate-assisted
nucleation of gold has occurred in the proximity of oxygenated defects existing on carbon substrates.
Under conditions of electrochemical diagnostic experiments (performed in 0.1 mol dm-3 KOH): (i)
the phosphomolybdate adsorbates are removed from the interface as they undergo dissolution in
alkaline medium; and (ii) the Au nanoparticles (Au loading, 30 {\mu}g cm-2) remain well-dispersed
on the carbon as evident from transmission electron microscopy. High electrocatalytic activity
of the reduced-graphene oxide-supported Au nanoparticles toward reduction of oxygen in alkaline
medium is demonstrated using cyclic and rotating ring-disk voltammetric experiments. Among important
issues are possible activating interactions between gold and the support, as well as presence of
structural defects existing on poorly organized graphitic structure of reduced graphene oxide
(as evident from Raman spectroscopy).
