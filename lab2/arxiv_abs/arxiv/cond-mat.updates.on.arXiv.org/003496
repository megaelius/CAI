Control and manipulation of electric current and, especially, its degree of spin polarization
(spin filtering) across single molecules are currently of great interest in the field of molecular
spintronics. We explore one possible strategy based on the modification of nanojunction symmetry
which can be realized, for example, by a mechanical strain. Such modification can activate new molecular
orbitals which were inactive before due to their orbital mismatch with the electrode's conduction
states. This can result in several important consequences such as (i) quantum interference effects
appearing as Fano-like features in electron transmission and (ii) the change in molecular level
hybridization with the electrode's states. We argue that the symmetry change can affect very differently
two majority- and minority-spin conductances and thus alter significantly the resulting spin-filtering
ratio as the junction symmetry is modified. We illustrate the idea for two basic molecular junctions:
Ni/benzene/Ni (perpendicular vs tilted orientations) and Ni/Si chain/Ni (zigzag vs linear chains).
In both cases, one highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and one lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) (out of HOMO and LUMO doublets) are important. In particular, their destructive
interference with other orbitals leads to dramatic suppression of majority-spin conductance
in low-symmetry configurations. For a minority-spin channel, on the contrary, the conductance
is strongly enhanced when the symmetry is lowered due to an increase in hybridization strength.
We believe that our results may offer a potential route for creating molecular devices with a large
on-off ratio of spin polarization via quantum interference effects.
