We present the results of a combined study by band theory and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) of the purple bronze, Li$_{1-x}$Mo$_{6}$O$_{17}$. Structural and electronic origins
of its unusually robust quasi-one dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior are investigated in detail.
The band structure, in a large energy window around the Fermi energy, is basically 2D and formed by
three Mo $t_{2g}$-like extended Wannier orbitals, each one giving rise to a 1D band running at a 120$^\circ$
angle to the two others. A structural "dimerization" from $\mathbf{c}/2$ to $\mathbf{c}$ gaps
the $xz$ and $yz$ bands while leaving the $xy$ bands metallic in the gap, but resonantly coupled to
the gap edges and, hence, to the other directions. The resulting complex shape of the quasi-1D Fermi
surface (FS), verified by our ARPES, thus depends strongly on the Fermi energy position in the gap,
implying a great sensitivity to Li stoichiometry of properties dependent on the FS, such as FS nesting
or superconductivity. The strong resonances prevent either a two-band tight-binding model or
a related real-space ladder picture from giving a valid description of the low-energy electronic
structure. We use our extended knowledge of the electronic structure to newly advocate for framing
LiMo$_{6}$O$_{17}$ as a weak-coupling material and in that framework can rationalize both the
robustness of its quasi-1D behavior and the rather large value of its Luttinger liquid (LL) exponent
$\alpha$. Down to a temperature of 6$\,$K we find no evidence for a theoretically expected downward
renormalization of perpendicular single particle hopping due to LL fluctuations in the quasi-1D
chains.
