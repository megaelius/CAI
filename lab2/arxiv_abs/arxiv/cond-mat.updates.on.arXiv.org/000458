There has been great interest in two-dimensional materials, beyond graphene, for both fundamental
sciences and technological applications. Silicene, a silicon counterpart of graphene, has been
shown to possess some better electronic properties than graphene. However, its thermal transport
properties have not been fully studied. In this paper, we apply the first-principles-based phonon
Boltzmann transport equation to investigate the thermal conductivity of silicene as well as the
phonon scattering mechanisms. Although both graphene and silicene are two-dimensional crystals
with similar crystal structure, we find that phonon transport in silicene is quite different from
that in graphene. The thermal conductivity of silicene shows a logarithmic increase with respect
to the sample size due to the small scattering rates of acoustic in-plane phonon modes, while that
of graphene is finite. Detailed analysis of phonon scattering channels shows that the linear dispersion
of the acoustic out-of-plane (ZA) phonon modes, which is induced by the buckled structure, makes
the long-wavelength longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon modes in silicene not as efficiently scattered
as that in graphene. Compared with graphene, where most of the heat is carried by the acoustic out-of-plane
(ZA) phonon modes, the ZA phonon modes in silicene only have ~10% contribution to the total thermal
conductivity, which can also be attributed to the buckled structure. This systematic comparison
of phonon transport and thermal conductivity of silicene and graphene using the first-principle-based
calculations shed some light on other two-dimensional materials, such as two-dimensional transition
metal dichalcogenides.
