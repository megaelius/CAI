In this paper, the spin transfer torque (STT) and the exchange coupling of the Josephson junctions
containing interesting cases of diffusive/ballistic-triplet/singlet ferromagnetic superconductor
materials together with diffusive Josephson junction of the form S$_{1}$/F$_{1}$/I$_1$/N/I$_2$/F$_2$
with I being insulating barrier are investigated. Using the Nazarov quantum circuit theory, it
is found that for the diffusive FS$_1$/N/FS$_2$ structure the only emerged torque in normal direction
to the plane of the exchange fields of F$_1$ and F$_2$ results in antiparallel/parallel or vice versa
parallel/antiparallel transition of favorable exchange coupling depending on the considered
parameters of the system, including the nonmagnetic spacer thickness, the superconducting phase
difference, the length and the exchange field of the ferromagnets. Furthermore, the analyze of
the width of the transitions, the phase difference interval in which an interlayer length-induced
antiparallel/parallel transition can be occurred, is performed. For instance, as the exchange
field or the temperature increases, the interval of phase difference gets larger. On the other hand,
ballistic Josephson junction containing the triplet ferromagnetic superconductor reservoirs
solving the 16$\times$16 Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equation is studied. It is found that although
the exchange fields of the FS are laid in the z and y direction, the STT interestingly exists in all
three directions of x, y and z. This exciting finding suggests that the favorable equilibrium configuration
concerning the least exchange coupling occurs in the relative exchange field direction different
from 0 or $\pi$. To the best of our knowledge it is for the first time that the occurrence of the in-plane
STT is reported. Moreover, the occurrence of the beat like behavior with two oscillation period
for the out-of-plane STT is interestingly acquired.
