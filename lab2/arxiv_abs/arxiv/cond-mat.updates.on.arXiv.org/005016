Hydrated excess protons under hydrophobic confinement are a critical component of charge transport
behavior and reactivity in nanoporous materials and biomolecular systems. Herein excess proton
confinement effects are computationally investigated for sub-2 nm hydrophobic nanopores by varying
the diameters (d = 0.81, 0.95, 1.09, 1.22, 1.36, 1.63, and 1.90 nm), lengths (l ~3 and ~5 nm), curvature,
and chirality of cylindrical carbon nanotube (CNT) nanopores. CNTs with a combination of different
diameter segments are also explored. The spatial distribution of water molecules under confinement
are diameter-dependent; however, proton solvation and transport is consistently found to occur
in the water layer adjacent to the pore wall, showing an "amphiphilic" character of the hydrated
excess proton hydronium-like structure. The proton transport free energy barrier also decreases
significantly as the nanopore diameter increases and proton transport becomes almost barrierless
in the d > 1 nm nanopores. Among the nanopores studied, the Zundel cation (${H_{5}O_{2}}^{+}$) is
populated only in the d = 0.95 nm CNT (7,7) nanopore. The presence of the hydrated excess proton and
$K^{+}$ inside the CNT (7,7) nanopore induces a water density increase by 40 and 20%, respectively.
The $K^{+}$ transport through CNT nanopores is also consistently higher in free energy barrier
than proton transport. Interestingly, the evolution of excess protonic charge defect distribution
reveals a "frozen" single water wire configuration in the d = 0.81 nm CNT (6,6) nanopore (or segment),
through which hydrated excess protons can only shuttle via the Grotthuss mechanism. Vehicular
diffusion becomes relevant to proton transport in the "flat" free energy regions and in the wider
nanopores, where protons do not primarily shuttle in the axial direction.
