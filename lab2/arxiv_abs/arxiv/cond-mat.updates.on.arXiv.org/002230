In order to theoretically identify the factors governing superconductivity in multi-layer cuprates,
a three-layer Hubbard model is studied with the two-particle self-consistent (TPSC) approach
so as to incorporate electron correlations. The linearized Eliashberg equation is then solved
for the gap function in a matrix form to resolve the role of outer CuO$_2$ planes (OPs) and inner plane
(IP). We show that OPs dominate IP in the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave superconductivity, while IP dominates
in the antiferromagnetism. This comes from an electron correlation effect in that the correlation
makes the doping rates different between OPs and IP (i.e., a self-doping effect), which occurs in
intermediate and strong correlation regimes. Namely, the antiferromagnetic fluctuations in
IP are stronger due to a stronger electron correlation, which simultaneously reduces the quasiparticle
density of states in IP with a suppressed $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave superconductivity. Intriguingly,
while the off-diagonal (inter-layer) elements in the gap function matrix are tiny, {\it inter-layer
pair scattering} processes are in fact at work in enhancing the superconducting transition temperature
$T_{\text{c}}$ through the inter-layer Green's functions. This actually causes the trilayer
system to have higher $T_{\text{c}}$ than the single-layer in a weak- and intermediate-coupling
regimes. This picture holds for a range of the on-site Hubbard repulsion $U$ that contains those
estimated for the cuprates. The present result is qualitatively consistent with nuclear magnetic
resonance experiments in multi-layer cuprates superconductors.
