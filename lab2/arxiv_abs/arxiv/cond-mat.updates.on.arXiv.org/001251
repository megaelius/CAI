We derive the universal relations for an ultracold two-component Fermi gas with spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) $\sum_{\alpha,\beta=x,y,z}\lambda_{\alpha\beta}\sigma_{\alpha}p_{\beta}$, where
$p_{x,y,z}$ and $\sigma_{x,y,z}$ are the single-atom momentum and Pauli operators for pseudo
spin, respectively, and the SOC intensity $\lambda_{\alpha\beta}$ could take arbitrary value.
We consider the system with an s-wave short-range interspecies interaction, and ignore the SOC-induced
modification for the value of the scattering length. Using the first-quantized approach developed
by S. Tan (Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{107}, 145302 (2011)), we obtain the short-range and high-momentum
expansions for the one-body real-space correlation function and momentum distribution function,
respectively. For our system these functions are $2\times2$ matrix in the pseudo-spin basis. We
find that the leading-order ($1/k^{4}$) behavior of the diagonal elements of the momentum distribution
function (i.e., $n_{\uparrow\uparrow}({\bf k})$ and $n_{\downarrow\downarrow}({\bf k})$)
are not modified by the SOC. However, the SOC can significantly modify the behavior of the \textit{non-diagonal
elements} of the momentum distribution function, i.e., $n_{\uparrow\downarrow}({\bf k})$ and
$n_{\downarrow\uparrow}({\bf k})$, in the large-$k$ limit. In the absence of the SOC, the leading
order of these elements is ${\cal O}(1/k^{6})$. When SOC appears, it can induce a term on the order
of $1/k^{5}$. We further derive the adiabatic relation and the energy functional. Our results show
the SOC can induce a new term in the energy functional, which simply describe the contribution from
the SOC to the total energy. The form of the adiabatic relation for our system is not modified by the
SOC.
