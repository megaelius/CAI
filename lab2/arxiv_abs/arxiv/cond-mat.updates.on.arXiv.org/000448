We report studies of CaCo{1.86}As2 single crystals. The electronic structure is probed by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of CaCo{1.86}As2 and by full-potential linearized
augmented-plane-wave calculations for the supercell Ca8Co15As16 (CaCo{1.88}As2). Our XRD crystal
structure refinement is consistent with the previous combined refinement of x-ray and neutron
powder diffraction data showing a collapsed-tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure with 7(1)% vacancies
on the Co sites corresponding to the composition CaCo{1.86}As2 [D. G. Quirinale et al., Phys. Rev.
B 88, 174420 (2013)]. The anisotropic magnetic susceptibility chi(T) data are consistent with
the magnetic neutron diffraction data of Quirianale et al. that demonstrate the presence of A-type
collinear antiferromagnetic order below the Neel temperature TN = 52(1) K with the easy axis being
the tetragonal c axis. However, no clear evidence from the resistivity rho(T) and heat capacity
Cp(T) data for a magnetic transition at TN is observed. A metallic ground state is demonstrated from
band calculations and the rho(T), Cp(T) and ARPES data, and spin-polarized calculations indicate
a competition between the A-type AFM and FM ground states. The Cp(T) data exhibit a large Sommerfield
electronic coefficient reflecting a large density of states at the Fermi energy D(EF), consistent
with the band structure calculations which also indicate a large D(EF) arising from Co 3d bands.
At 1.8 K the M(H) data for H|| c exhibit a well-defined first-order spin-flop transition at an applied
field of 3.5 T. The small ordered moment of 0.3 muB/Co obtained from the M(H) data at low T, the large
exchange enhancement of chi and the lack of a self-consistent interpretation of the chi(T) and M(H,T)
data in terms of a local moment Heisenberg model together indicate that the magnetism of CaCo{1.86}As2
is itinerant.
