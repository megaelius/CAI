Use of amorphous silicon ($a$-Si) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon ($a$-Si:H) in photovoltaics
has been limited by light-induced degradation (the Staebler-Wronski effect) and low hole mobilities,
and voids have been implicated in both problems. Accurately modeling the void microstructure is
critical to theoretically understanding the cause of these issues. Previous methods of modeling
voids have involved removing atoms according to an {\it a priori} idea of void structure and/or using
computationally expensive molecular dynamics. We propose a new fast and unbiased approach based
on the established and efficient Wooten-Winer-Weaire (WWW) Monte Carlo method, by using a range
of fixed densities to generate equilibrium structures of $a$-Si and $a$-Si:H that maintain 4-coordination.
We find a smooth evolution in bond lengths, bond angles, and bond angle deviations $\Delta \theta$
as the density is changed around the equilibrium value of $4.9\times10^{22}\ $atoms/cm$^3$. However,
a significant change occurs at densities below $4.3\times10^{22}\ $atoms/cm$^3$, where voids
begin to form to relieve tensile stress, akin to a cavitation process in liquids. We find both small
voids (radius $\sim$3~\AA) and larger ones (up to 7 \AA), which compare well with available experimental
data. The voids have an influence on atomic structure up to 4 \AA\ beyond the void surface and are associated
with decreasing structural order, measured by $\Delta\theta$. We also observe an increasing medium-range
dihedral order with increasing density. Our method allows fast generation of statistical ensembles,
resembles a physical process during experimental deposition, and provides a set of void structures
for further studies of their effects on degradation, hole mobility, two-level systems, thermal
transport, and elastic properties.
