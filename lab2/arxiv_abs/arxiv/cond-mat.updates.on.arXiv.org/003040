In this work, we revisit the issue of the nature of electronic transport in nickel oxide (NiO) and
show that the widely used model of free small polaron hopping, initially raised to characterize
transport in high-purity samples, is not appropriate for modeling intrinsically doped NiO. Instead,
we present extensive evidence, collected by means of temperature- and frequency-dependent measurements
of the electrical conductivity $\sigma$, that the model of polaronic inter-acceptor hopping can
be used to consistently explain the electronic conduction process. In this framework, holes are
localized to acceptors (Ni vacancies), forming a strongly bound, polaron-like state. They can
only move through the film by hopping to a neighboring, at least partially unoccupied, acceptor.
This renders the spatial overlap between neighboring polaronic wave functions a highly critical
parameter. The signature of this process is the occurrence of two temperature regions of the DC conductivity,
separated by about half the Debye temperature $\theta_D/2 \approx 200 K$. For $T > \theta_D/2$,
holes are transferred by phonon-assisted hopping over the potential barrier between two sites,
whereas phonon-assisted tunneling through the barrier dominates below that temperature. We also
show that the degree of structural and electronic disorder plays a vital role in determining the
characteristics of the transport process: high disorder leads to strong energetic broadening
of the acceptor states such that hopping to more distant sites may be favored over transfer to nearest
neighbors (variable range hopping). The assumption of high binding energies of the charge carriers
at VNi is in accordance with the recent paradigm shift regarding the understanding of the electronic
structure of NiO: holes doped into NiO couple to Ni 3d spins, thereby occupying deep polaron-like
states within the band gap (Zhang-Rice bound doublets).
