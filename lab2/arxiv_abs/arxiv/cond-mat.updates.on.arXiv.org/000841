We investigate the short time quantum critical dynamics in the imaginary time relaxation processes
of finite size systems. Universal scaling behaviors exist in the imaginary time evolution and in
particular, the system undergoes a critical initial slip stage characterized by an exponent $\theta$,
in which an initial power-law increase emerges in the imaginary time correlation function when
the initial state has zero order parameter and vanishing correlation length. Under different initial
conditions, the quantum critical point and critical exponents can be determined from the universal
scaling behaviors. We apply the method to the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models
using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the one-dimensional case, we locate the quantum critical
point at $(h/J)_{c}=1.00003(8)$ \thirdrevise{in the thermodynamic limit}, and estimate the
critical initial slip exponent $\theta=0.3734(2)$, static exponent $\beta/\nu=0.1251(2)$
\thirdrevise{by analyzing data on chains of length $L=32\sim 256$ and $L=48\sim 256$, respectively}.
For the two-dimensional square-lattice system, the critical coupling ratio is given by $3.04451(7)$
\thirdrevise{in the thermodynamic limit} while the critical exponents are \thirdrevise{$\theta=0.209(4)$
and $\beta/\nu=0.518(1)$ estimated by data on systems of size $L=24\sim 64$ and $L=32\sim 64$,
correspondingly.} Remarkably, the critical initial slip exponents obtained in both models are
notably distinct from their classical counterparts, owing to the essential differences between
classical and quantum dynamics. The short time critical dynamics and the imaginary time relaxation
QMC approach can be readily adapted to various models.
