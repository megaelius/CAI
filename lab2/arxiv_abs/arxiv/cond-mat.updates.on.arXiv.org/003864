The cumulant representation is common in classical statistical physics for variables on the real
line and the issue of closures of cumulant expansions is well elaborated. The case of phase variables
significantly differs from the case of linear ones; the relevant order parameters are the Kuramoto-Daido
ones but not the conventional moments. One can formally introduce `circular' cumulants for Kuramoto-Daido
order parameters, similar to the conventional cumulants for moments. The circular cumulant expansions
allow to advance beyond the Ott-Antonsen theory and consider populations of real oscillators.
First, we show that truncation of circular cumulant expansions, except for the Ott-Antonsen case,
is forbidden. Second, we compare this situation to the case of the Gaussian distribution of a linear
variable, where the second cumulant is nonzero and all the higher cumulants are zero, and elucidate
why keeping only the second cumulant is admissible for a linear variable, but forbidden for circular
cumulants. Third, we discuss the implication of this truncation issue to populations of quadratic
integrate-and-fire neurons [E. Montbri\'o, D. Paz\'o, A. Roxin, Phys. Rev. X, vol. 5, 021028 (2015)],
where within the framework of macroscopic description, the firing rate diverges for any finite
truncation of the cumulant series, and discuss how one should handle these situations. Fourth,
we consider the cumulant-based low-dimensional reductions for macroscopic population dynamics
in the context of this truncation issue. These reductions are applicable, where the cumulant series
exponentially decay with the cumulant order, i.e., they form a geometric progression hierarchy.
Fifth, we demonstrate the formation of this hierarchy for generic distributions on the circle and
experimental data for coupled biological and electrochemical oscillators.
