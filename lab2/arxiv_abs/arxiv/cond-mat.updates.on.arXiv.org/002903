Topological insulators have stimulated tremendous interest in quantum materials with exotic
bulk and edge states that may have applications in spintronics and quantum computation. Recently,
it was predicted and observed that an insulator with a quantized quadrupole moment hosts gapped
edge states and in-gap corner states, demonstrating a new paradigm of higher-order topology. Such
quadrupole band topology, however, is exclusive to conventional band topology based on electric
dipole polarizations. Here, we discover a new topological system, denoted as the hierarchical
multipole topological insulator, which exhibits multiplexing topological phenomena with concurrent
dipole and quadrupole band topologies, in sonic crystals with nonsymmorphic p4g symmetry. Unlike
electronic systems where topological phenomena are constrained by the band filling, acoustic
systems allow access to multiple topological band gaps by changing the frequency. In our sonic crystals,
the first band gap has dipolar topology which can realize acoustic quantum spin Hall effect and topological
helical edge states, while the second band gap realizes a novel anomalous quadrupole topological
insulator protected by the nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. We observe the experimental signatures
of the dipolar and quadrupolar band topologies through measurements of the corner and edge states.
Our study establishes a bridge between multipole topology and subwavelength metamaterials based
on multiple Bragg scattering mechanisms, and demonstrates an instance that classical systems
can serve as powerful and elegant simulators for the discovery of novel topological quantum states.
