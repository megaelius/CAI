In this work, we consider the phase-space picture of quantum mechanics. We then introduce non-negative
Wigner-like distributions \widetilde{W}_{\rho;\alpha}(x,p)'s corresponding to the density
operator \hat{\rho} and being proportional to {W_{\rho^{\alpha/2}}(x,p)\}^2, where {W_{\rho}(x,p)}^2
denotes the Wigner function. In doing so, we utilize the formal symmetry between the purity measure
Tr({\rho}^2) and its Wigner representation (2\pi\hbar \int dx dp {W_{\rho}(x,p)}^2 and then consider,
as a generalization, such symmetry between the fractional moments Tr(\hat{\rho}^{\alpha}) and
their Wigner representations 2\pi\hbar \int dx dp {W_{\rho^{\alpha/2}}(x,p)}^2. Next, we build
up a framework that enables to explicitly evaluate the Renyi-Wigner entropies for the classical-like
distributions {\mathcal W}_{\rho;\alpha}(x,p) in a compact way. We also discuss the relationship
between the non-negative feature of \widetilde{\mathcal W}_{\rho;\alpha}(x,p) and the x-p uncertainty
relation with the help of the celebrated Bopp shift, as well as providing a well-defined evaluation
scheme of expectation values of observables within this formulation. To illustrate the validity
of our framework, we evaluate the distributions \widetilde{\mathcal W}_{\beta;\alpha}(x,p)
corresponding to the (non-Gaussian) thermal state \hat{\rho}_{\beta} of a single particle confined
by a one-dimensional infinite potential well with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition
and then analyze the resulting Renyi entropies. Our phase-space approach will contribute to a deeper
understanding of non-Gaussian states and their transitions either in the semiclassical limit
(\hbar \to 0) or in the high-temperature limit (\beta \to 0), as well as enabling to systematically
discuss the quantal-classical Second Law of thermodynamics on the single footing.
