We develop a generalization of the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) + Hubbard $U$ (DFT+$U$)
method to the excited-state regime. This has the form of Hubbard $U$ corrected linear-response
time-dependent DFT, or `TDDFT+$U$'. Combined with calculated linear-response Hubbard $U$ parameters,
it may provide a computationally light, first-principles method for the simulation of tightly-bound
excitons on transition-metal ions. Our presented implementation combines linear-scaling DFT+$U$
and linear-scaling TDDFT, but the approach is broadly applicable. In detailed benchmark tests
on two Ni-centred diamagnetic coordination complexes with variable $U$ values, it is shown that
the Hubbard $U$ correction to an approximate adiabatic semi-local exchange-correlation interaction
kernel lowers the excitation energies of transitions exclusively within the targeted localized
subspace, by increasing the exciton binding of the corresponding electron-hole pairs. This partially
counteracts the Hubbard $U$ correction to the exchange-correlation potential in KS-DFT, which
increases excitation energies into, out of, and within the targeted localised subspace by modifying
the underlying KS-DFT eigenspectrum. This compensating effect is most pronounced for optically
dark transitions between localized orbitals of the same angular momentum, for which experimental
observation may be challenging and theoretical approaches are at their most necessary. Overall,
our results point to shortcomings in the contemporary DFT+$U$ corrective potential, either in
its functional form, or when applied to transition-metal orbitals but not to ligand ones, or both.
