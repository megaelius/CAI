Active matter consists of self-propelled elements exhibits fascinating collective motions ranging
from biological to artificial systems. Among wide varieties of active matter systems, reconstituted
bio-filaments moving on molecular motor turf interacting purely by physical interactions provides
the fundamental test ground for understanding biological motility. However, until now, multi-filament
collisions,depletion agents or binding molecules has been required for the emergence of ordered
patterns in motility assay. Thus, whether simple physical interactions during collisions such
as steric effect without depletion nor binding agents are sufficient or not for producing ordered
patterns in motility assays remains still elusive. In this article, we constructed a motility assay
purely consists of kinesin motor and microtubule in which the frequency of binary collision can
be controlled without using depletion nor binding agents. By controlling strength of steric interaction
and density of microtubules, we found different states; disordered state, long-range orientationally
ordered state, liquid-gas-like phase separated state, and transitions between them. We found
that a balance between cross over and aligning events in collisions controls transition from disorder
to global ordered state, while excessively strong steric effect leads to the phase separated clusters.
Furthermore, macroscopic chiral symmetry breaking observed as a global rotation of nematic order
observed in this experiment could be attributed to the chirality at molecular level. Numerical
simulations in which we change strength of volume exclusion reproduce these experimental results.
Moreover, it reveals the transition from long-range alignment to nematic bands then to aggregations.
This study may provide new insights into dynamic ordering by self-propelled elements through a
purely physical interaction.
