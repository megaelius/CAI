In recent years, efficient inter-atomic potentials approaching the accuracy of density functional
theory (DFT) calculations have been developed using rigorous atomic descriptors satisfying strict
invariances, for example, to translation, rotation, permutation of homonuclear atoms, among
others. However, most such potential development efforts have largely focused on simple elemental
systems. In this work, we generalize the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) model to bcc-fcc
binary alloy systems. We demonstrate that machine-learned SNAP models can yield significant improvements
even over well-established, high-performing embedded atom method (EAM) and modified EAM (MEAM)
potentials for fcc Cu and Ni. We also report on the development of a SNAP model for the fcc Ni-bcc Mo
binary system by machine learning a carefully-constructed large computed data set of elemental
and intermetallic compounds. We demonstrate that this binary Ni-Mo SNAP model can achieve excellent
agreement with experiments in the prediction of Ni-Mo phase diagram as well as near-DFT accuracy
in the prediction of many key properties such as elastic constants, formation energies, melting
points, etc., across the entire binary composition range. In contrast, the existing Ni-Mo EAM has
significant errors in the prediction of the phase diagram and completely fails in binary compounds.
This work provides a systematic model development process for multi-component systems, including
an efficient procedure to optimize the hyper-parameters in the model fitting, and paves the way
to long-time, large-scale simulations of non-elemental systems.
