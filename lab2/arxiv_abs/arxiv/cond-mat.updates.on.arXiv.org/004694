We present a framework which unifies classical phenomenological $J_2$ and crystal plasticity
theories with quantitative dislocation mechanics. The theory allows the computation of stress
fields of arbitrary dislocation distributions and, coupled with minimally modified classical
($J_2$ and crystal plasticity) models for the plastic strain rate of statistical dislocations,
results in a versatile model of finite deformation mesoscale plasticity. We demonstrate some capabilities
of the framework by solving two outstanding challenge problems in mesoscale plasticity: 1) recover
the experimentally observed power-law scaling of stress-strain behavior in constrained simple
shear of thin metallic films inferred from micropillar experiments which all strain gradient plasticity
models overestimate and fail to predict; 2) predict the finite deformation stress and energy density
fields of a sequence of dislocation distributions representing a progressively dense dislocation
wall in a finite body, as might arise in the process of polygonization when viewed macroscopically,
with one consequence being the demonstration of the inapplicability of current mathematical results
based on $\mathrm{\Gamma}$-convergence for this physically relevant situation. Our calculations
in this case expose a possible `phase transition' - like behavior for further theoretical study.
We also provide a quantitative solution to the fundamental question of the volume change induced
by dislocations in a finite deformation theory, as well as show the massive non-uniqueness in the
solution for the (inverse) deformation map of a body inherent in a model of finite strain dislocation
mechanics, when approached as a problem in classical finite elasticity.
