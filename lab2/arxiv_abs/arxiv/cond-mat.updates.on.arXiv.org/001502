In response to a concentration gradient of nutrient, E. coli bacterium modulates the rotational
bias of flagellar motors which control its run-and-tumble motion, to migrate towards regions of
high nutrient concentration. Presence of stochastic noise in the biochemical pathway of the cell
has important consequence on the switching mechanism of motor bias, which in turn affects the runs
and tumbles of the cell. We model the intra-cellular reaction network in terms of coupled time-evolution
of three stochastic variables, kinase activity, methylation level and CheY-P protein level, and
study the effect of methylation noise on the chemotactic performance of the cell. In presence of
a spatially varying nutrient concentration profile, a good chemotactic performance allows the
cell to climb up the concentration gradient fast and localize in the nutrient-rich regions in the
long time limit. Our simulations show that the best performance is obtained at an optimal noise strength.
While it is expected that chemotaxis will be weaker for very large noise, it is counter-intuitive
that the performance worsens even when noise level falls below a certain value. We explain this striking
result by detailed analysis of CheY-P protein level statistics for different noise strengths.
We show that when the CheY-P level falls below a certain (noise-dependent) threshold, the cell tends
to move down the concentration gradient of the nutrient, which has a detrimental effect on its chemotactic
response. This threshold value decreases as noise is increased, and this effect is responsible
for noise-induced enhancement of chemotactic performance. In a harsh chemical environment, when
the nutrient degrades with time, the amount of nutrient intercepted by the cell trajectory, is an
effective performance criterion. In this case also, we find an optimum noise strength, depending
on the nutrient lifetime.
