Colloids that interact via a short-range attraction serve as the primary building blocks for a broad
range of self-assembled materials. However, one of the well-known drawbacks to this strategy is
that these building blocks rapidly and readily condense into a metastable colloidal gel. Using
computer simulations, we illustrate how the addition of a small fraction of purely repulsive self-propelled
colloids, a technique referred to as active doping, can prevent the formation of this metastable
gel state and drive the system toward its thermodynamically favored crystalline target structure.
The simplicity and robust nature of this strategy offers a systematic and generic pathway to improving
the self-assembly of a large number of complex colloidal structures. We discuss in detail the process
by which this feat is accomplished and provide quantitative metrics for exploiting it to modulate
self-assembly. We provide evidence for the generic nature of this approach by demonstrating that
it remains robust under a number of different anisotropic short-ranged pair interactions in both
two and three dimensions. In addition, we report on a novel microphase in mixtures of passive and
active colloids. For a broad range of self-propelling velocities, it is possible to stabilize a
suspension of fairly monodisperse finite-size crystallites. Surprisingly, this microphase
is also insensitive to the underlying pair interaction between building blocks. The active stabilization
of these moderately-sized monodisperse clusters is quite remarkable and should be of great utility
in the design of hierarchical self-assembly strategies. This work further bolsters the notion
that active forces can play a pivotal role in directing colloidal self-assembly.
