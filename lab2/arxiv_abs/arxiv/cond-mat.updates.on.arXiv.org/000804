The origin of room temperature (RT) ferromagnetism (FM) in Ni doped ZnO samples are systematically
investigated through physical, optical, and magnetic properties of nanostructure, prepared
by simple low-temperature wet chemical method. Reitveld refinement of X-ray diffraction pattern
displays an increase in lattice parameters with strain relaxation and contraction in Zn/O occupancy
ratio by means of Ni-doping. Similarly scanning electron microscope demonstrates modification
in the morphology from nanorods to nanoflakes with Ni doping, suggests incorporation of Ni ions
in ZnO. More interestingly, XANES (X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy) measurements confirm
that Ni is being incorporated in ZnO as Ni2+. EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) analysis
reveals that structural disorders near the Zn sites in the ZnO samples upsurges with increasing
Ni concentration. Raman spectroscopy exhibits additional defect driven vibrational mode at 275
cm-1, appeared with Ni-doped sample only and the shift with broadening in 580 cm-1 peak, which manifests
the presence of the oxygen vacancy (VO) related defects. Moreover, in photoluminescence (PL) spectra
we observed peak appears at 524 nm, indicates the presence of singly ionized VO+, which may activate
bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). Magnetization measurements
indicate weak ferromagnetism at RT, which rises with increasing Ni consolidation. It is therefore
proposed that effect of the Ni-ions as well as the inherent exchange interactions rising from VO+
assist to produce BMPs, which are accountable for the RT-FM in Zn1-xNixO (0<x<0.125) system.
