The applications of plasmonics to energy transfer from free-space radiation to molecules are currently
limited to the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum due to the intrinsic optical properties
of bulk noble metals that support strong electromagnetic field confinement only close to their
plasma frequency in the visible/ultraviolet range. In this work, we show that nanoporous gold can
be exploited as plasmonic material for the mid-infrared region to obtain strong electromagnetic
field confinement, co-localized with target molecules into the nanopores and resonant with their
vibrational frequency. The effective optical response of the nanoporous metal enables the penetration
of optical fields deep into the nanopores, where molecules can be loaded thus achieving a more efficient
light-matter coupling if compared to bulk gold. In order to realize plasmonic resonators made of
nanoporous gold, we develop a nanofabrication method based on polymeric templates for metal deposition
and we obtain antenna arrays resonating at mid-infrared wavelengths selected by design. We then
coat the antennas with a thin (3 nm) silica layer acting as target dielectric layer for optical energy
transfer. We study the strength of the light-matter coupling at the vibrational absorption frequency
of silica at 1250 cm-1 through the analysis of the experimental Fano lineshape that is benchmarked
against identical structures made of bulk gold. The boost of optical energy transfer from free-space
mid-infrared radiation to molecular vibrations in nanoporous 3D nanoantenna arrays can open new
application routes for plasmon-enhanced physical-chemical reactions.
