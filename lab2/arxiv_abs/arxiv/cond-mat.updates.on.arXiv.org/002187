Recent research has led to the discovery of fundamental new phenomena in network synchronization,
including chimera states, explosive synchronization, and asymmetry-induced synchronization.
Each of these phenomena has thus far been observed only in systems designed to exhibit that one phenomenon,
which raises the questions of whether they are mutually compatible and of what the required conditions
really are. Here, we introduce a class of remarkably simple oscillator networks that concurrently
exhibit all of these phenomena, thus ruling out previously assumed conditions. The dynamical units
consist of pairs of non-identical phase oscillators, which we refer to as Janus oscillators by analogy
with Janus particles and the mythological figure from which their name is derived. In contrast to
previous studies, these networks exhibit: i) explosive synchronization in the absence of any correlation
between the network structure and the oscillator's frequencies; ii) extreme multi-stability
of chimera states, including traveling, intermittent, and bouncing chimeras; and iii) asymmetry-induced
synchronization in which synchronization is promoted by random oscillator heterogeneity. These
networks also exhibit the previously unobserved possibility of inverted synchronization transitions,
in which transition to a more synchronous state is induced by a reduction rather than increase in
coupling strength. These various phenomena are shown to emerge under rather parsimonious conditions,
and even in locally connected ring topologies, which has the potential to facilitate their use to
control and manipulate synchronization in experiments.
