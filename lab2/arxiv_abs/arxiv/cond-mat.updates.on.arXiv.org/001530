The forward transformation from face centered cubic austenite to body centered cubic/tetragonal
martensite in ferrous alloys can significantly in- fluence the microstructure and mechanical
properties of the material. Inferring possible high temperature crystal orientations from observations
of ambient temperature transformation microstructures is hindered by parent austenite- twin
interactions and scatter in the orientation relationship. This creates a major limitation for
studying variant selection phenomena and characteriz- ing microstructural response to high temperature
thermomechanical process- ing conditions. In this work, composition tables are developed that
detail the product variant boundary misorientation relationships for parent-parent, parent-twin
and twin-twin boundary intersections for the Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS), Nishiyama-Wassermann (NW),
and an experimentally determined irra- tional orientation relationship. The frequently referenced
KS and NW ori- entation relationships produce significantly different results from experimental
observations. Furthermore, the introduction of a twin into the parent austenite introduces a substantially
larger number of misorientation relationships when the orientation relationship is irrational.
The effects of crystal symmetry on misorientation results are determined by considering both body
centered cu- bic and body centered tetragonal martensite structures. Lastly, it is observed that
some shared variants are found between twins and parents when assuming cubic symmetry but not tetragonal
symmetry. The results and relationships may be useful towards accurate and consistent reconstructions
of the parent austenite microstructure from observations of martensite.
