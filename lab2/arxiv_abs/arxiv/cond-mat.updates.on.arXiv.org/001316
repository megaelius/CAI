A numerical algorithm to calculate exact finite-temperature spectra of many-body lattice Hamiltonians
is formulated by combining the typicality approach and the shifted Krylov subspace method. The
combined algorithm, which we name finite-temperature shifted Krylov subspace method for simulating
spectra (FTK$\omega$), efficiently reproduces the canonical-ensemble probability distribution
at finite temperatures with the computational cost proportional to the Fock space dimension. The
present FTK$\omega$ enables us to exactly calculate finite-temperature spectra of many-body
systems whose system sizes are twice larger than those handled by the canonical ensemble average
and allows us to access the frequency domain without sequential real-time evolution often used
in previous studies. By employing the reweighting method with the present algorithm, we obtain
significant reduction of the numerical costs for temperature sweeps. Application to the Kiteav-Heisenberg
model (KHM) on a honeycomb lattice demonstrates the capability of the FTK$\omega$. The KHM shows
quantum phase transitions from the quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase to magnetically ordered phases
when the finite Heisenberg exchange coupling is introduced. We examine temperature dependence
of dynamical spin structure factors of the KHM in proximity to the QSL. It is clarified that the crossover
from a spin-excitation continuum, which is a characteristic of the QSL, to a damped high-energy
magnon mode occurs at temperatures higher than the energy scale of the Heisenberg couplings or the
spin gap that is a signature of the QSL at zero temperature. The crossover and the closeness to the
Kitaev's QSL are quantitatively measured by the width of the excitation continuum or the magnon
spectrum. The present results shed new light on analysis of neutron scattering and other spectroscopy
measurements on QSL candidates.
