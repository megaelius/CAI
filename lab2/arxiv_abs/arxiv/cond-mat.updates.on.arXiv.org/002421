The quantum behaviour of electrons in materials lays the foundation for modern electronic and information
technology. Quantum materials with novel electronic and optical properties have been proposed
as the next frontier, but much remains to be discovered to actualize the promise. Here we report the
first observation of topological quantum properties of chiral crystals in the RhSi family. We demonsrate
that this material hosts novel phase of matter exhibiting nearly ideal topological surface properties
that emerge as a consequence of the crystals' structural chirality or handedness. We also demonstrate
that the electrons on the surface of this crystal show a highly unusual helicoid structure that spirals
around two high-symmetry momenta signalling its topological electronic chirality. Such helicoid
Fermi arcs on the surface experimentally characterize the topological charges of $\pm{2}$, which
arise from the bulk chiral fermions. The existence of bulk high-fold degenerate fermions are guaranteed
by the crystal symmetries, however, in order to determine the topological charge in the chiral crystals
it is essential to identify and study the helical arc states. Remarkably, these topological conductors
we discovered exhibit helical Fermi arcs which are of length $\pi$, stretching across the entire
Brillouin zone and orders of magnitude larger than those found in all known Weyl semimetals. Our
results demonstrate novel electronic topological state of matter on a structurally chiral crystal
featuring helicoid Fermi arc surface states. The exotic electronic chiral fermion state realised
in these materials can be used to detect a quantised photogalvanic optical response or the chiral
magnetic effect and its optical version in future devices as described by G. Chang \textit{et.al.,}
