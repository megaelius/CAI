It has been predicted theoretically and indirectly confirmed experimentally that single-layer
CrX$_3$ (X=Cl, Br, I) might be the prototypes of topological magnetic insulators (TMI). In this
work, by using first-principles calculations combined with atomistic spin dynamics we provide
a complete picture of the magnetic interactions and magnetic excitations in CrX$_3$. The focus
is here on the two most important aspects for the actual realization of TMI, namely the relativistic
magnetic interactions and the finite-size (edge) effects. We compute the full interaction tensor,
which includes both Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms, which are considered as the most likely
mechanisms for stabilizing topological magnons. First, we instigate the properties of bulk CrI$_3$
and compare the simulated magnon spectrum with the experimental data [Phys. Rev. X 8, 041028 (2018)].
Our results suggest that a large size of topological gap, seen in experiment ($\approx$ 4 meV), can
not be explained by considering pair-wise spin interactions only. We identify several possible
reasons for this disagreement and suggest that a pronounced magneto-elastic coupling should be
expected in this class of materials. The magnetic interactions in the monolayers of CrX$_3$ are
also investigated. The strength of the anisotropic interactions is shown to scale with the position
of halide atom in the Periodic Table, the heavier the element the larger is the anisotropy. Comparing
the magnons for the bulk and single-layer CrI$_3$, we find that the size of the topological gap becomes
smaller in the latter case. Finally, we investigate finite-size effects in monolayers and demonstrate
that the anisotropic couplings between Cr atoms close to the edges are much stronger than those in
ideal periodic structure. This should have impact on the dynamics of the magnon edge modes in this
class of materials.
