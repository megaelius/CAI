We study the phases of a spin system on the Kagome lattice with nearest-neighbor $XXZ$ interactions
with anisotropy ratio $\Delta$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions with strength $D$. In
the classical limit where the spin $S$ at each site is very large, we find a rich phase diagram of the
ground state as a function of $\Delta$ and $D$. There are five distinct phases which correspond to
different ground state spin configurations in the classical limit. We use spin wave theory to find
the bulk energy bands of the magnons in some of these phases. We also study a strip of the system which
has infinite length and finite width; we find modes which are localized on one of the edges of the strip
with energies which lie in the gaps of the bulk modes. In the ferromagnetic phase in which all the spins
point along the $+ \hat z$ or $- \hat z$ direction, the bulk bands are separated from each other by finite
energy gaps. This makes it possible to calculate the Berry curvature at all momenta, and hence the
Chern numbers for every band; the number of edge states is related to the Chern numbers. Interestingly,
we find that there are four different regions in this phase where the Chern numbers are different.
Hence there are four distinct topological phases even though the ground state spin configuration
is identical in all these phases. We calculate the thermal Hall conductivity of the magnons as a function
of the temperature in the above ferromagnetic phase; we find that this can distinguish between the
various topological phases. These results are valid for all values of $S$.In the other phases, there
are no gaps between the different bands; hence the edge states are not topologically protected.
