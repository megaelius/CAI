Recently, there has been considerable interest in the study of spontaneous synchronization, particularly
within the framework of the Kuramoto model. The model comprises oscillators with distributed natural
frequencies interacting through a mean-field coupling, and serves as a paradigm to study synchronization.
In this review, we put forward a general framework in which we discuss in a unified way known results
with more recent developments obtained for a generalized Kuramoto model that includes inertial
effects and noise. We describe the model from a different perspective, highlighting the long-range
nature of the interaction between the oscillators, and emphasizing the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium
aspects of its dynamics from a statistical physics point of view. In the first main section, we introduce
the model and discuss for the noiseless and noisy dynamics and unimodal frequency distributions
the synchronization transition that occurs in the stationary state. In the second section, we introduce
the generalized model, and discuss its synchronization phase diagram for unimodal frequency distributions.
In the third section, we describe deviations from the mean-field setting of the Kuramoto model by
considering the generalized dynamics on a one-dimensional periodic lattice on the sites of which
the oscillators reside and interact with a coupling that decays as an inverse power-law of their
separation. For two specific cases, namely, in the absence of noise and inertia, and in the case when
the natural frequencies are the same for all the oscillators, we discuss how the long-time transition
to synchrony is governed by the dynamics of the mean-field mode (zero Fourier mode) of the spatial
distribution of the oscillator phases.
