Heterostructures of superconducting and ferromagnetic materials are of fundamental interest
because of the mutual interaction of antagonistic kinds of ordering at the S-F interface. Normally,
the superconducting transition temperature Tc should be strongly suppressed at the S-F interface
owing to the penetration of Cooper pairs into the ferromagnetic side. Nevertheless, constructive
interactions between S and F orders have been suggested to occur via the modification of ferromagnetic
order by the superconducting state. This may induce an inhomogeneous magnetic state, often called
a cryptoferromagnetic state, and the relevant domain wall effect, which will lead to a local decrease
of the pair-breaking parameter. However, the domain wall effect, even if it exists, is quite subtle
from the experimental view point and is normally difficult to observe. Here we show that the defect-related
d0 ferromagnetism in MgO and the superconductivity in MgB2 do not antagonize, but rather enhance
the superconducting transition temperature Tc to any significant degree. We found in superconducting
MgB2-d0 ferromagnetic MgO composites that the superconducting transition proceeds in two steps.
The first at the S-F interface, between 110-120 K, then in the rest of the bulk at 39 K, which is the Tc
of single phase MgB2 superconductor. Moreover, the additional transition emerges at 60 K at the
S-F interface especially in the ferromagnetic side, showing a spin-glass-like magnetic state.
Our findings reveal that the proximity effect in the superconductor-d0 ferromagnet heterostructures
will provide the knowledge and basis to enhance the Tc value of the existing superconductors.
