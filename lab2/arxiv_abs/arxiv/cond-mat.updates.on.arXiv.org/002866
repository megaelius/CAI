We investigate non-perturbative corrections to the large $N$ expansion of the homogeneous electron
gas. These are associated with instanton solutions to the effective action of the plasmon field.
We show that, although the large field behavior of that action dominates the quadratic bare Coulomb
term, there are no solutions at large field, and consequently none at large density. We argue that
solutions would exist at low density if the large $N$ theory had a Wigner crystal (WC) phase. However,
we argue that this is not the case. Together with the implied convergence of the large $N$ expansion,
this implies that the homogeneous electron gas with $N$ component spins and a Coulomb interaction
scaling like $1/N$ can only have a WC phase below a curve in the plane of $N$ and density, which asymptotes
to zero density at infinite $N$. We argue that for systems with a semi-classical expansion for order
parameter dynamics, and a first order quantum transition between fluid and crystal phases, there
are instantons associated with the decays of meta-stable fluid and crystal phases in the appropriate
regions of the phase diagram. We argue that the crystal will decay into one or more colloidal or bubble
phases\cite{kivspiv} rather than directly into the fluid. The transition to a translationally
invariant phase is likely to be second order. Unfortunately, the HEG does not have a crystal phase
at large $N$, where these semi-classical ideas could be examined in detail. We suggest that the evidence
for negative dielectric function at intermediate densities for $N = 2$ is an indicator of this second
order transition. It is possible that the closed large $N$ equation for the plasmon two point function,
derived in\cite{ergheg} might capture at least the qualitative features of the second order transition.
