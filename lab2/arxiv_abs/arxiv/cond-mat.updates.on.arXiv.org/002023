While time-resolved pump-probe differential reflectivity and transmitivity measurements are
routinely used to monitor the population relaxation dynamics on the subpicosecond time scale,
it is also known that the signal in the negative delay can yield direct signatures of the perturbed-free-induction-decay
of polarization. Yet this technique, especially in reflection geometry, has never been popular
because the experiment is conceptually not very intuitive. Coherent dynamics is therefore usually
studied using the more complex four-wave-mixing experiments. Here we derive from first principles
the simplest possible but mathematically complete framework for the negative delay signal in both
the time and the spectral domains. The calculation involving the optical Bloch equations to describe
the induced polarization and the Ewald-Oseen idea to calculate the reflected signal as a consequence
of the free oscillations of perturbed dipoles, also explicitly includes the process of lock-in
detection of a double-chopped signal after it has passed through a monochromator. The theory is
compared with experiments on high quality GaAs quantum well sample. The dephasing time inferred
experimentally at 4 K compares remarkably well with the inverse of the absorption linewidth of the
continuous-wave photoluminescence excitation spectrum. Spectrally resolved signal at negative
delay calculated from our theoretical expression nicely reproduces the coherent spectral oscillations,
although exact fitting of the experimental spectra with the theoretical expression is difficult.
This is on account of additional resonances present in the sample corresponding to lower energy
bound states.
