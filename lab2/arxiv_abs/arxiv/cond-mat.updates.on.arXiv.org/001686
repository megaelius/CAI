Large scale molecular dynamics simulations for bidisperse nanoparticle suspensions with an explicit
solvent are used to investigate the effects of evaporation rates and volume fractions on the nanoparticle
distribution during drying. Our results show that ``small-on-top'' stratification can occur
when ${\rm Pe}_s\phi_s \gtrsim c$ with $c\sim 1$, where ${\rm Pe}_s$ is the P\'{e}clet number and
$\phi_s$ is the volume fraction of the smaller particles. This threshold of ${\rm Pe}_s\phi_s$
for ``small-on-top'' is larger by a factor of $\sim\alpha^2$ than the prediction of the model treating
solvent as an implicit viscous background, where $\alpha$ is the size ratio between the large and
small particles. Our simulations further show that when the evaporation rate of the solvent is reduced,
the ``small-on-top'' stratification can be enhanced, which is not predicted by existing theories.
This unexpected behavior is explained with thermophoresis associated with a positive gradient
of solvent density caused by evaporative cooling at the liquid-vapor interface. For ultrafast
evaporation the gradient is large and drives the nanoparticles toward the liquid/vapor interface.
This phoretic effect is stronger for larger nanoparticles and consequently the ``small-on-top''
stratification becomes more distinct when the evaporation rate is slower (but not too slow such
that a uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the drying film is produced), as thermophoresis
that favors larger particles on the top is mitigated. A similar effect can lead to ``large-on-top''
stratification for ${\rm Pe}_s\phi_s$ above the threshold when ${\rm Pe}_s$ is large but $\phi_s$
is small. Our results reveal the importance of including the solvent explicitly when modeling evaporation-induced
particle separation and organization and point to the important role of density gradients brought
about by ultrafast evaporation.
