Flexible electronics is an emerging field in many applications ranging from in vivo biomedical
devices to wearable smart systems. The capability of conforming to curved surfaces opens the door
to add electronic components to miniaturized instruments, where size and weight are critical parameters.
Given their prevalence on the sensors market, flexible magnetic sensors play a major role in this
progress. For many high-performance applications, magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have become
the first choice, due to their high sensitivity, low power consumption etc. MTJs are also promising
candidates for non-volatile next-generation data storage media and, hence, could become central
components of wearable electronic devices. In this work, a generic low-cost regenerative batch
fabrication process is utilized to transform rigid MTJs on a 500 {\mu}m silicon wafer substrate
into 5 {\mu}m thin, mechanically flexible silicon devices, and ensuring optimal utilization of
the whole substrate. This method maintains the outstanding magnetic properties, which are only
obtained by deposition of the MTJ on smooth high-quality silicon wafers. The flexible MTJs are highly
reliable and resistive to mechanical stress. Bending of the MTJ stacks with a diameter as small as
500 {\mu}m is possible without compromising their performance and an endurance of over 1000 cycles
without fatigue has been demonstrated. The flexible MTJs were mounted onto the tip of a cardiac catheter
with 2 mm in diameter without compromising their performance. This enables the detection of magnetic
fields and the angle which they are applied at with a high sensitivity of 4.93 %/Oe and a low power consumption
of 0.15 {\mu}W, while adding only 8 {\mu}g and 15 {\mu}m to the weight and diameter of the catheter,
respectively.
