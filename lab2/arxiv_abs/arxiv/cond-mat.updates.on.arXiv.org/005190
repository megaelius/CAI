Different types of ordering phenomena may occur during phase transitions, described within the
universal framework of the Landau theory through the evolution of one, or several, symmetry-breaking
order parameter h. In addition, many systems undergo phase transitions related to an electronic
instability, in the absence of a symmetry-breaking and eventually described through the evolution
of a totally symmetric order parameter q linearly coupled to volume change. Analyzing the coupling
of a non-symmetry-breaking electronic instability, responsible for volume strain, to symmetry-breaking
phenomena is of importance for many systems in nature and here we show that the symmetry-allowed
qh2 coupling plays a central role. We use as case study the rubidium manganese hexacyanoferrate
Prussian blue analogue, exhibiting phase transitions with hysteresis that may exceed 100 K, and
based on intermetallic charge transfer (CT). During the phase transition, the intermetallic CT
described through the evolution of q is coupled to cubic-tetragonal ferroelastic symmetry-breaking
described through the evolution of h. In this system, the symmetry-breaking and non-symmetry breaking
deformations have similar amplitudes but the large volume strain is mainly due to CT. We analyze
both the ferroelastic and the CT features of the phase transition within the frame of the Landau theory,
taking into account the qh2 coupling, stabilizing concomitant CT and Jahn-Teller distortion.
The phase diagrams obtained with this model are in good qualitative agreement with various experimental
findings and apply to diverse families of materials undergoing Mott transition, spin-crossover,
neutral-ionic transition, for which isostructural electronic instability driving volume strain
can couple to symmetry-breaking or not, create phase transition lines and drive cooperative phenomena.
