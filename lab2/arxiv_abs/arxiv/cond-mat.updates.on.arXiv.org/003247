In this work, we have simulated the processes of broadening the first exciton band in optical absorption
spectra (OA) for InP/ZnS ensembles of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). A phenomenological model has
been proposed that takes into account the effects of the exciton-phonon interaction and allows
one to analyze the influence of the static and dynamic types of atomic disorder on the temperature
changes in the spectral characteristics in question. To vary the degree of static disorder in the
model system, we have used a parameter ${\delta}$, which characterizes the QD dispersion in size
over the ensemble. Also, we have calculated the temperature shifts of the maxima and changes in the
half-width for the exciton peaks in single nanocrystals (${\delta}$ = 0), as well as for the integrated
OA bands in the QD ensembles with different values of ${\delta}$ = 0.6 - 17%. The simulation results
and the OA spectra data measured for InP/ZnS nanocrystals of 2.1 nm (${\delta}$ = 11.1%) and 2.3 nm
(${\delta}$ = 17.3%) are in good mutual agreement in the temperature range of 6.5 K - RT. It has been
shown that the contribution of static disorder to the observed inhomogeneous broadening of the
OA bands for the QDs at room temperature exceeds 90%. The computational experiments performed indicate
that the temperature shift of the maximum for the integrated OA band coincides with that for the exciton
peak in a single nanocrystal. In this case, a reliable estimate of the parameters of the fundamental
exciton-phonon interaction can be made. Simultaneously, the values of the specified parameters,
calculated from the temperature broadening of the OA spectra, can be significantly different from
the true ones due to the effects of static atomic disorder in real QD ensembles.
