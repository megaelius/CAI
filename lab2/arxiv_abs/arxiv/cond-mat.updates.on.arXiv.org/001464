We experimentally characterize the impact response of concentrated suspensions of cornstarch
and water. We hypothesize that the dynamically jammed region that propagates ahead of the impactor
is responsible for the strong stress response to impact when it spans between solid boundaries.
Using surface imaging and particle tracking at the boundary opposite the impactor, we observed
that a visible structure and particle flow at the boundary occur with a delay after impact. We show
the delay time is about the same time as the the strong stress response, confirming that the strong
stress response results from deformation of the dynamically jammed structure once it spans between
the impactor and a solid boundary. A characterization of this strong stress response is reported
in a companion paper (arXiv:1407.0719). We also elaborate on the structure of the dynamically jammed
region once it spans from the impactor to a solid boundary. We observed particle flow in the outer
part of the dynamically jammed region at the bottom boundary, with a net transverse displacement
of up to about 5\% of the impactor displacement, indicating shear at the boundary. Direct imaging
of the surface of the outer part of the dynamically jammed region reveals a change in surface structure
that appears the same as the result of dilation in other cornstarch suspensions. Imaging also reveals
cracks, like a brittle solid. These observations suggest the dynamically jammed structure can
temporarily support stress according to an effective modulus, like a soil or dense granular material,
along a network of frictional contacts between the impactor and solid boundary.
