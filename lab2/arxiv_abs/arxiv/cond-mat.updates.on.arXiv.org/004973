Developing angular trapping methods, which will enable optical tweezers to rotate a micronized
bead, is of great importance for the studies of biomacromolecules during a wide range of torque-generation
processes. Here we report a novel controlled angular trapping method based on composite Janus particles.
We used a chemically synthesized Janus particle, which consists of two hemispheres made of polystyrene
(PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) respectively, as a model system to demonstrate this
method. Through computational and experimental studies, we demonstrated the feasibility to control
the rotation of a Janus particle in a linearly polarized laser trap. Our results showed that the Janus
particle aligned its two hemisphere's interface parallel to the laser propagation direction as
well as the laser polarization direction. In our experiments, the rotational state of the particle
can be easily and directly visualized by using a CMOS camera, and does not require complex optical
detection system. The rotation of the Janus particle in the laser trap can be fully controlled in
real time by controlling the laser polarization direction. Our newly developed angular trapping
technique has the great advantage of easy implementation and real time controllability. Considering
the easy chemical synthesis of Janus particles and implementation of the angular trapping, this
novel method has the potential of becoming a general angular trapping method. We anticipate that
this new method will significantly broaden the availability of angular trapping in the biophysics
community, and expand the scope of the research that can be enabled by the angular trapping approach.
