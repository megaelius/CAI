Zeolites are nanoporous crystalline materials with abundant industrial applications. Despite
sustained research, only 235 different zeolite frameworks have been realized out of millions of
hypothetical ones predicted by computational enumeration. Structure-property relationships
in zeolite synthesis are very complex and only marginally understood. Here, we apply structure
and graph-based unsupervised machine learning to gain insight on zeolite frameworks and how they
relate to experimentally observed polymorphism and phase transformations. We begin by describing
zeolite structures using the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions method, which clusters crystals
with similar cages and density in a way consistent with traditional hand-selected composite building
units. To also account for topological differences, zeolite crystals are represented as multigraphs
and compared by isomorphism tests. We find that fourteen different pairs and one trio of known frameworks
are graph isomorphic. Based on experimental interzeolite conversions and occurrence of competing
phases, we propose that the availability of kinetic-controlled transformations between metastable
zeolite frameworks is related to their similarity in the graph space. When this description is applied
to enumerated structures, over 3,400 hypothetical structures are found to be isomorphic to known
frameworks, and thus might be realized from their experimental counterparts. Using a continuous
similarity metric, the space of known zeolites shows additional overlaps with experimentally
observed phase transformations. Hence, graph-based similarity approaches suggest a venue for
realizing novel zeolites from existing ones by providing a relationship between pairwise structure
similarity and experimental transformations.
