It is shown that the temperature of the resistive transition $T_r$ of a superconducting film can
be increased by a thin superconducting or normal overlayer. For instance, deposition of a highly
conductive thin overlayer onto a dirty superconducting film can give rise to an "anti-proximity
effect" which manifests itself in an initial increase of $T_r(d_2)$ with the overlayer thickness
$d_2$ followed by a decrease of $T_r(d_2)$ at larger $d_2$. Such a nonmonotonic thickness dependence
of $T_r(d_2)$ results from the interplay of the increase of a net superfluid density mitigating
phase fluctuations and the suppression of the critical temperature $T_c$ due to the conventional
proximity effect. This behavior of $T_r(d_2)$ is obtained by solving the Usadel equations to calculate
the temperature of the Berezinskii-Kosterletz-Thouless transition, and the temperature of the
resistive transition due to thermally-activated hopping of single vortices in dirty bilayers.
The theory incorporates relevant materials parameters such as thicknesses and conductivities
of the layers, interface contact resistance between them and the subgap quasiparticle states which
affect both phase fluctuations and the proximity effect suppression of $T_c$. The transition temperature
$T_r$ can be optimized by tuning the overlayer parameters, which can significantly weaken vortex
fluctuations and nearly restore the mean-field critical temperature. The calculated behavior
of $T_r(d_2)$ may explain the nonmonotonic dependence of $T_r(d_2)$ observed on (Ag, Au, Mg, Zn)-coated
Bi films, Ag-coated Ga and Pb films or NbN and NbTiN films on AlN buffer layers. These results suggest
that bilayers can be used as model systems for systematic investigations of optimization of fluctuations
in superconductors.
