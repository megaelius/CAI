We report a detailed theoretical study of the electronic structure, spectral properties, and lattice
parameters of bulk FeSe under pressure using a fully charge self-consistent implementation of
the density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory method (DFT+DMFT). In particular,
we perform a structural optimization and compute the evolution of the lattice parameters (volume,
$c/a$ ratio, and the internal $z$ position of Se) and the electronic structure of the tetragonal
(space group $P4/nmm$) paramagnetic FeSe. Our results for the lattice parameters are in good quantitative
agreement with experiment. The $c/a$ ratio is slightly overestimated by about $3$~\%, presumably
due to the absence of the van der Waals interactions between the FeSe layers in our calculations.
The lattice parameters determined within DFT are off the experimental values by a remarkable $\sim$$6$-$15$~\%,
implying a crucial importance of electron correlations. Upon compression to $10$~GPa, the $c/a$
ratio and the lattice volume show a decrease by $2$ and $10$~\%, respectively, while the Se $z$ coordinate
weakly increases by $\sim$$2$~\%. Most importantly, our results reveal a topological change of
the Fermi surface (Lifshitz transition) which is accompanied by a two- to three-dimensional crossover.
Our results indicate a small reduction of the quasiparticle mass renormalization $m^*/m$ by about
$5$~\% for the $e$ and less than $1$~\% for the $t_2$ states, as compared to ambient pressure. The
behavior of the momentum-resolved magnetic susceptibility $\chi({\bf q})$ shows no topological
changes of magnetic correlations under pressure, but demonstrates a reduction of the degree of
the in-plane $(\pi,\pi)$ stripe-type nesting. Our results for the electronic structure and lattice
parameters of FeSe are in good qualitative agreement with recent experiments on its isoelectronic
counterpart FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$.
