In this minireview we will discuss recent progress in the analytical study of current-carrying
non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) that can be constructed in terms of a matrix product ansatz.
We will focus on one-dimensional exactly solvable strongly correlated cases, and will study both
quantum models, and classical models which are deterministic in the bulk. The only source of classical
stochasticity in the time-evolution will come from the boundaries of the system. Physically, these
boundaries may be understood as Markovian baths, which drive the current through the system. The
examples studied include the open XXZ Heisenberg spin chain, the open Hubbard model, and a classical
integrable reversible cellular automaton, namely the Rule 54 of Bobenko {\em et al}. [Commun. Math.
Phys. {\bf 158}, 127 (1993)] with stochastic boundaries. The quantum NESS can be at least partially
understood through the Yang-Baxter integrability structure of the underlying integrable bulk
Hamiltonian, whereas for the Rule 54 model NESS seems to come from a seemingly unrelated integrability
theory. In both the quantum and the classical case, the underlying matrix product ansatz defining
the NESS also allows for construction of novel conservation laws of the bulk models themselves.
In the classical case, a modification of the matrix product ansatz also allows for construction
of states beyond the steady state (i.e., some of the decay modes -- Liouvillian eigenvectors of the
model). We hope that this article will help further the quest to unite different perspectives of
integrability of NESS (of both quantum and classical models) into a single unified framework.
