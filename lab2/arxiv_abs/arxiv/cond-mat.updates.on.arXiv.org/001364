Individual electron spins have been observed using magnetic resonance in combination with a number
of distinct detection approaches. The coordinates of an individual electron spin can then in principle
be determined by introducing a 10 to 100 nm diameter magnetic needle, scanning the needle, and collecting
signal as a function of the needle's position. Although individual electrons have recently been
localized with nanometer precision in this way using a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as the
spin detector, the experiment's low signal-to-noise ratio limited acquisition to two-dimensional
scanning of just a few dozen data points and was incompatible with nitroxide spin labels widely used
to label proteins and nucleic acids. We introduce and numerically simulate a protocol for detecting
and imaging individual nitroxide electron spins mechanically with high spatial resolution. In
our protocol a scanned magnet-tipped cantilever is brought near the sample, modulated microwaves
are applied to resonantly excite electron spins, and changes in spin magnetization are detected
as a shift in the mechanical frequency of the cantilever. By carefully applying resonant microwaves
in short bursts in synchrony with the cantilever's oscillation, we propose to retain high spatial
resolution even at large cantilever amplitude where sensitivity is highest. Numerical simulations
reveal nanometer-diameter rings of frequency-shift signal as the tip is scanned. Our primary finding
is that it is possible --- using a Bayesian, reverse Monte Carlo algorithm introduced here --- to
obtain the full three-dimensional distribution of electron coordinates from the signal rings
revealed in a two-dimensional frequency-shift map. This reduction in dimensionality brings within
reach, on a practical timescale, the angstrom-resolution three-dimensional imaging of spin-labeled
macromolecules.
