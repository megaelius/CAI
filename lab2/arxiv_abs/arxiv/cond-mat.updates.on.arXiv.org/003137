Owing to their exceptional semiconducting properties, hybrid inorganic-organic perovskites
show great promise as photovoltaic absorbers. In these materials, long-range diffusion of charge
carriers allows for most of the photogenerated carriers to contribute to the photovoltaic efficiency.
Here, time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) microscopy is used to directly probe ambipolar carrier
diffusion and recombination kinetics in hybrid perovskites. This technique is applied to thin
films of methylammonium lead tri-iodide MAPbI$_3$ obtained with two different fabrication routes,
methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr$_3$), and an alloy of formamidinium lead tri-iodide (FAPbI$_3$)
and methylammonium lead bromide FA$_{0.85}$MA$_{0.15}$Pb(I$_{0.85}$Br_${0.15}$)$_3$. Average
diffusion coefficients in the films leading to the highest device efficiencies and longest lifetimes,
i.e., in FA$_{0.85}$MA$_{0.15}$Pb(I$_{0.85}$Br$_{0.15}$)$_3$ and acetonitrile-processed
MAPbI$_3$, are found to be several orders of magnitude lower than in the other films. Further examination
of the time-dependence shows strong evidence for non-diffusive transport. In particular, acetonitrile-processed
MAPbI$_3$ shows distinct diffusion regimes on short and long timescales with an effective diffusion
constant varying over 2 orders of magnitude. Our results also highlight the fact that increases
in carrier lifetime in this class of materials are not necessarily concomitant with increased diffusion
lengths and that the PL quantum efficiency under solar cell operating conditions is a greater indication
of material, and ultimately device, quality.
