Stochastic thermodynamics provides an important framework to explore small physical systems
where thermal fluctuations are inevitable. Although the thermodynamic quantities associated
with the complete Langevin equation (the Kramers equation) are often assumed to converge to those
associated with the overdamped Langevin equation (the Smoluchowski equation) in the high-damping-coefficient
limit under the overdamped approximation, a rigorous mathematical proof has not been reported
so far. Here we give the required conditions under which the overdamped approximation is valid in
stochastic thermodynamics. In the high-damping-coefficient limit, we rigorously prove the convergence
of the extended Fokker-Planck equations including work using a multiple time-scale expansion
approach. By taking the linearly dragged harmonic oscillator as an exactly solvable example, we
analytically calculate the work distribution associated with the Kramers equation, and verify
its convergence to that associated with the Smoluchowski equation in the high-damping-coefficient
limit. We quantify the accuracy of the overdamped approximation as a function of the damping coefficient.
In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that the work distribution of a levitated silica nanosphere
agrees with the overdamped approximation in the high-damping-coefficient limit, but deviates
from the overdamped approximation in the low-damping-coefficient case. Our work clarifies the
relation between the stochastic thermodynamics based on the complete Langevin equation (the Kramers
equation) and the overdamped Langevin equation (the Smoluchowski equation), and deepens our understanding
of the overdamped approximation in stochastic thermodynamics.
