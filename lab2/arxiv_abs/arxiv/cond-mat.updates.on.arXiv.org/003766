We evaluate the accuracy of varying thermal expansion models for the quasi-harmonic approximation
(QHA) relative to molecular dynamics (MD) for 10 sets of enantiotropic organic polymorphs. Relative
to experiment we find that MD, using an off-the-shelf point charge potential gets the sign of the
enthalpic contributions correct for 6 of the 10 pairs of polymorphs and the sign of the entropic contributions
correct for all pairs. We find that anisotropic QHA provides little improvement to the error in free
energy differences from MD relative to isotropic QHA, but does a better job capturing the thermal
expansion of the crystals. A form of entropy-enthalpy compensation allows the free energy differences
of QHA to deviate less than 0.1 kcal/mol from MD for most polymorphic pairs, despite errors up to 0.4
kcal/mol in the entropy and enthalpy. Much of the error previously found between QHA and MD for these
flexible molecules is reduced when QHA is run from a lattice minimum consistent with the same basin
as MD, rather than the energy-minimized experimental crystal structure. Specifically, performing
anisotropic QHA on lattice minimum quenched from low-temperature replica exchange simulations
reduced the error previously found by 0.2 kcal/mol on average. However, these conformationally
flexible molecules can have many low-temperature conformational minima, and the choice of an inconsistent
minima causes free energies estimated from QHA to deviate from MD at temperatures as low as 10 K. The
errors between MD and experiment are 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than those seen between QHA and
MD, so the quality of the force field used is still of primary concern, but this study illustrates
a number of other important factors that must be considered to obtain quantitative organic crystal
thermodynamics.
