Ferrites are distinct material for electromagnetic applications due to its unique spin precession.
In this paper, Casimir pressure effect by deploying magnetically tunable surface plasmon quanta
in stratified structure of using ferrite and metal wires is presented. Previously, oscillating
surface plasmon quanta were successfully included to modify first reflection and first transmission
characteristics. The oscillating surface plasmon quanta in the modified reflection in such a system,
not only does resolve in a typical matter in metamaterial, but also provide new applications such
as creating Casimir pressure effects through the metamaterial composite shown in this paper. The
Casimir pressure flips from attractive state to repulsive state is referred to actual cause mechanism
of radiation from surface plasmon quanta. Both Casimir force analysis and the measured data of radiations
indicate us the system develops quantized states by electric flux induced by ferromagnetic resonance,
so we also carried quantum analysis to the discrete radiations spectra for our experimental measurement.
The discrete radiations are also reproduced by using time dependent Schr\"odinger representation.
As result, we find the Josephson frequency and Josephson current representations at room temperature
and we used them for extrapolating voltage induced in excited ferrites. The discrete radiation
spectrum by Josephson frequency at X-band is able to differentiate micron volt differences and
it allows us to report the data for voltage induced by ferromagnetic resonance in ferrite at room
temperature. It is understood that the radiation intensity depends on density of final states and
excitation probability when we come to think the energy matter. It seems possible to create as high
as 20mW microwave power inside waveguide at X-band.
