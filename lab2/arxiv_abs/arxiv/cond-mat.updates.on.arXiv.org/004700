The present study experimentally and numerically investigates the evaporation and resultant
patterns of dried deposits of aqueous colloidal sessile droplets, when the droplets are initially
elevated to a high temperature before being placed on a substrate held at ambient temperature. The
system is then released for natural evaporation without applying any external perturbation. Initially,
a significant temperature gradient exists along the liquid-gas interface as soon as the droplet
is deposited on the substrate -- the droplet remains the hottest at the top and the coolest near the
contact line. The temperature gradient induces a Marangoni recirculation flow, which is directed
from the top of the droplet towards the contact line along the liquid-gas interface -- thus, the flow
is in reverse direction to that seen in conventional substrate heating case. Interestingly, this
temperature gradient decays rapidly -- within the first 10% of the total evaporation time and the
droplet-substrate system reaches thermal equilibrium with ambient thereafter. Despite fast
decay of the temperature gradient, the coffee-ring dimensions significantly diminish, leading
to an inner deposit. The reproducibility of the observations has been confirmed by varying particle
concentrations in the aqueous suspension. This suppression of the coffee-ring effect is attributed
to the fact that the recirculation flow, generated by initial temperature gradient induced Marangoni
stress, continues till the last stage of the evaporation, even after the interfacial temperature
gradient vanishes. This is essentially a consequence of liquid inertia. Thus, the suspended colloidal
particles are advected by this recirculating flow towards the inner region of the droplet, thereby
suppressing the coffee-ring effect.
