The existence of a charge density wave (CDW) in transition metal dichalcogenide CuS$_2$ has remained
undetermined since its first experimental synthesis nearly 50 years ago. Despite conflicting
experimental literature regarding its low temperature structure, there exists no theoretical
study of the phonon properties and lattice stability of this material. By studying the first-principles
electronic structure and phonon properties of CuS$_2$ at various electronic temperatures, we
identify temperature-sensitive soft phonon modes which unveil a previously unreported Kohn anomaly
at approximately 100K. Variation of the electronic temperature shows the presence of two distinct
phases, characterized at low temperature by a $2\times2\times2$ periodic charge modulation associated
with the motion of the S$_2$ dimers. Investigation of the Fermi surface presents a potential Fermi
surface nesting vector related to the location of the Kohn anomaly and observed band splittings
in the unfolded bandstructure. The combination of these results suggests a strong possibility
of CDW order in CuS$_2$. Further study of CuS$_2$ in monolayer form finds no evidence of a CDW phase,
as the identified bulk periodic distortions cannot be realized in 2D. This behavior sets this material
apart from other transition metal dichalcogenide materials, which exhibit a charge density wave
phase down to the 2D limit. As CDW in TMDC materials is considered to compete with superconductivity,
the lack of CDW in monolayer CuS$_2$ suggests the possibility of enhanced superconductivity relative
to other transition metal dichalcogenides. Overall, our work identifies CuS$_2$ as a previously
unrealized candidate to study interplay of superconductivity, CDW order, and dimensionality.
