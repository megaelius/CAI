To date, almost all of the discussions on topological insulators (TIs) have focused on two- and three-dimensional
systems. One-dimensional (1D) TIs manifested in real materials, in which localized spin states
may exist at the end or near the junctions, have largely been unexplored. Previous studies have considered
the system of gapped graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) possessing spatial symmetries (e.g. inversion)
with only termination patterns commensurate with inversion- or mirror-symmetric unit cells.
In this work, we prove that a symmetry-protected $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological classification
exists for any type of termination. In these cases the Berry phase summed up over all occupied bands
turns out to be $\pi$-quantized in the presence of the chiral symmetry. However, it does not always
provide the correct corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ as one would have expected. We show that only
the origin-independent part of the Berry phase gives the correct bulk-boundary correspondence
by its $\pi$-quantized values. The resulting $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant depends on the choice
of the 1D unit cell (defined by the nanoribbon termination) and is shown to be connected to the symmetry
eigenvalues of the wave functions at the center and boundary of the Brillouin zone. Using the cove-edged
GNRs as examples, we demonstrate the existence of localized states at the end of some GNR segments
and at the junction between two GNRs based on a topological analysis. The current results are expected
to shed light on the design of electronic devices based on GNRs as well as the understanding of the
topological features in 1D systems.
