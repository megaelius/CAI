In condensed matter systems, higher temperature typically disfavors ordered phases leading to
an upper critical temperature for magnetism, superconductivity, and other phenomena. A notable
exception is the Pomeranchuk effect in 3He, in which the liquid ground state freezes upon increasing
the temperature. The anomalous transition arises due to the large spin entropy of the paramagnetic
solid phase, which can overcome the ground state energy difference at finite temperature. Here
we show that a similar mechanism describes the finite temperature dynamics of spin- and valley-
isospins in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. In the vicinity of one hole per superlattice
unit cell, quantum oscillations show the ground state to be an isospin unpolarized Fermi liquid.
Tilted field magnetotransport measurements show that increasing the Zeeman energy, E_Z, drives
a transition from the Fermi liquid to a spin- and valley- polarized isospin ferromagnetic state.
The same transition can be actuated by raising the temperature. Remarkably, the temperature required
to drive the transition at E_Z=0 is comparable to E_Z required to drive the transition at low temperature,
implying an entropy change per moir'e unit cell of order 1 k_B. In this picture, the finite temperature
phase, while not characterized by long-range ferromagnetic order, is distinguished from the low-temperature
Fermi liquid by the presence of large local isospin moments that fluctuate on the scale of the moire
lattice spacing. Our findings suggest that the isospin stiffness in the ferromagnetic phases of
twisted bilayer graphene is exceptionally small, with implications for the nature of finite temperature
transport as well as the mechanisms underlying isospin ordering and superconductivity in twisted
bilayer graphene and related systems.
