We present recent theoretical results on superconductivity in correlated-electron systems,
especially in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and the three-band d-p model. The mechanism of
superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors has been extensively studied on the basis
of various electronic models and also electron-phonon models. In this study we investigate the
properties of superconductivity in correlated-electron systems by using numerical methods such
as the variational Monte Carlo method and the quantum Monte Carlo method. The Hubbard model is one
of basic models for strongly correlated electron systems, and is regarded as the model of cuprate
high temperature superconductors. The d-p model is more realistic model for cuprates. The superconducting
condensation energy obtained by adopting the Gutzwiller ansatz is in reasonable agreement with
the condensation energy estimated for YBa_2Cu_3O_7. We show the phase diagram of the ground state
using this method. We have further investigated the stability of striped and checkerboard states
in the under-doped region. The relationship of the hole density x and incommensurability \delta,
\delta\sim x, is satisfied in the lower doping region, as indicated by the variational Monte Carlo
calculations. We have performed a variational Monte Carlo simulation on a two-dimensional t-t'-t"-U
Hubbard model with a Bi-2212 type band structure and found that the 4\times 4 period checkerboard
spin modulation, that is characterized by multi Q vectors, is stabilized. We also present a new algorithm
of the diagonalization quantum Monte Carlo method that is a method for the evaluation of expectation
values without the negative sign difficulty. We show that the pair correlation function is not enhanced
at half-filling, and is indeed enhanced with hole doping.
