High temperature superconductivity (HTS) in Cu-based materials is generated by strong electronic
correlations due to proximity of the Mott insulator phase. By contrast, the undoped phase proximate
to Fe-based HTS is never an insulator. But this striking distinction may be deceptive because, while
only a single Cu d-orbital is active in the former compounds, up to five Fe d-orbitals are active in
the latter. In theory, such orbital multiplicity allows an unusual new state, referred to as an orbital-selective
Hund's metal, to appear. In this state, strong Hund's coupling aligns the Fe spins thereby suppressing
the inter-orbital charge fluctuations. The result is orbital selectivity of correlations wherein
electrons associated with some orbitals become strongly incoherent but coexist with coherent
quasiparticles associated with other orbitals of the same atom. A distinguishing experimental
signature would be that quasiparticle spectral weights $Z_m$ associated with each different orbital
m would be highly distinct, effectively resulting in orbital selectivity of quasiparticles. To
search for such effects associated with Fe-based HTS, we visualize quasiparticle interference
resolved by orbital content in FeSe, and discover strong orbitally selective differences of quasiparticle
$Z_m$ on all detectable bands. Measurement of QPI amplitudes on the \alpha-, \epsilon- and \delta-bands
of FeSe reveals that $Z_{xy}<Z_{xz}<<Z_{yz}$ for a wide energy range and throughout k-space. Moreover,
the magnitudes and ratios of these quasiparticle weights are consistent with those deduced independently
from the properties of orbital-selective Cooper pairing. All these data indicate that orbital-selective
strong correlations dominate the Hund's metal state underpinning superconductivity in FeSe,
a situation that would be of broad fundamental significance if true for Fe-based superconductors
in general.
