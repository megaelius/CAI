Quantum Hall systems are characterized by the quantization of the Hall conductance -- a bulk property
rooted in the topological structure of the underlying quantum states. In condensed matter devices,
material imperfections hinder a direct connection to simple topological models, and restrict
the existence of fragile topological phases to defect-free samples. Artificial systems, as realized
with photonic platforms or cold atomic gases, open novel possibilities by enabling specific probes
of topology or flexible manipulation e.g. using synthetic dimensions encoded in internal degrees
of freedom. However, the sizes of synthetic dimensions realized so far remain moderate, making
the notion of a bulk irrelevant. Here, we realize a %disorder-free quantum Hall system using ultracold
dysprosium atoms, in a two-dimensional geometry formed by one spatial dimension and one synthetic
dimension encoded in the atomic spin $J=8$. We demonstrate that the large number, $2J+1=17$, of
magnetic sublevels leads to distinct behaviors in the bulk, where motion is inhibited due to a flattened
energy band, and along the edges, where the particles are free to move in only one direction. We also
show that the low-energy excitations take the form of cyclotron and skipping orbits. Furthermore,
we measure the transverse drift induced by a weak force, and find a uniform Hall response in the bulk,
reaching 98(5)% of the quantized value expected for a topological system. Our findings pave the
way towards the realization of quantum many-body systems with non-trivial topology, such as mean-field
Abrikosov vortex lattices or fractional quantum Hall states, as supported by numerical simulations
of interacting bosons in our setting.
