Wadsley--Roth crystallographic shear phases form a family of compounds that have attracted attention
due to their excellent performance as lithium-ion battery electrodes. The complex crystallographic
structure of these materials poses a challenge for first-principles computational modelling
and hinders the understanding of their structural, electronic and dynamic properties. In this
article, we study three different niobium-tungsten oxide crystallographic shear phases (Nb$_{12}$WO$_{33}$,
Nb$_{14}$W$_{3}$O$_{44}$, Nb$_{16}$W$_5$O$_{55}$) using an enumeration-based approach and
first-principles density-functional theory calculations. We report common principles governing
the cation disorder, lithium insertion mechanism, and electronic structure of these materials.
Tungsten preferentially occupies tetrahedral and block-central sites within the block-type
crystal structures. The lithium insertion proceeds via a three-step mechanism, associated with
an anisotropic evolution of the host lattice. Our calculations reveal an important connection
between long-range and local structural changes: in the second step of the mechanism, the removal
of local structural distortions leads to the contraction of the lattice along specific crystallographic
directions, buffering the volume expansion of the material. Niobium-tungsten oxide shear structures
host small amounts of localised electrons during initial lithium insertion due to the confining
effect of the blocks, but quickly become metallic upon further lithiation. We argue that the combination
of local, long-range, and electronic structural evolution over the course of lithiation is beneficial
to the performance of these materials as battery electrodes. The mechanistic principles we establish
arise from the compound-independent crystallographic shear structure, and are therefore likely
to apply to Ti/Nb oxide or pure Nb oxide shear phases.
