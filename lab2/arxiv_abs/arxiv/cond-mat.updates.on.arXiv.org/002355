We investigate the mutual influence of tilt, disorder and Coulomb interaction in a type-I Dirac
semimetal by performing a renormalization group analysis. The interplay between disorder and
ordinary tilt generates an effective tilt, which is physically observable. We found that random
scale potential and $x$-component of random vector potential increase the effective tilt, but
they also induce a phase transition from the Dirac semimetal to the compressible diffusive metal.
The diffusive phase transition precedes the tilt-driven topological phase, and the surface of
the original Dirac cone in compressible diffusive metal is just slightly tilted. Surprisingly,
the Dirac point is replaced by a bulk nodal arc in the diffusive metal. The $y$-component of random
vector potential and random mass both reduce the effective tilt and stabilize the type-I Dirac fermions.
The Coulomb interaction always decreases the effective tilt. When interplays with random scale
potential, it generates a phase separation of the semimetal and diffusive metal phase. The original
conical surface are also slightly tilted in both phases. However, the Dirac point only exists in
the semimetal phase while it is replaced by the bulk nodal arc in the diffusive metal phase. Interplay
between Coulomb interaction and any other disorder gives rise to a random stable fixed state where
the effective tilt and velocity anisotropy vanish and the type-I Dirac fermions keep stable. Particularly,
Coulomb interaction destroys the bulk nodal arc generated by $x$-component of the random vector
potential. Our results show that interplay between tilt, disorder, and Coulomb interaction results
in rich low-energy properties of tilted Dirac fermions.
