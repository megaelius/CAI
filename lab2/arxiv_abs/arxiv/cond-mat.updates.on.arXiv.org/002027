Alcohol is widely believed to have an effect on diabetes, often considered beneficial in small amounts
but detrimental in excess. The reasons are not fully known but questions have been asked about the
stability of insulin oligomers in the presence of ethanol. We compute the free energy surface (FES)
and the pathway of insulin dimer dissociation in water and in 5% and 10% water-ethanol mixture. We
find that in the presence of ethanol the barrier energy of dissociation reaction decreases by about
40% even in 5% water-ethanol solution. In addition, ethanol induces a significant change in the
reaction pathway. We obtain estimates of the rate of reaction and binding energy for all the three
systems and those agree well with the previous experimental results for the insulin dimer dissociation
in water. The computed FES in water exhibits ruggedness due to the existence of a number of intermediate
states surrounded by high and broad transition state region. However, the presence of ethanol smoothens
out the ruggedness. We extracted the conformations of the intermediate states along the minimum
energy pathway in all the three systems and analyzed the change in microscopic structures in the
presence of ethanol. Interestingly, we discover a stable intermediate state in water-ethanol
mixtures where the monomers are separated (center-to-center) by about 3 nm and the contact order
parameter is close to zero. This intermediate is stabilized by the distribution of ethanol and water
molecules at the interface and which, significantly, serves to reduce the dissociation rate constant
.The solvation of the two monomers during the dissociation and proteins' departure from native
state configuration are analyzed to obtain insight into the dimer dissociation processes.
