Metal-string complexes in the quasi-1D framework may play an important role in molecular electronics
by serving not only as nanoscale interconnects but also as active functional elements for nanoelectronic
devices. However, because of the potential volumetric heat generation across such nanojunctions,
the circuit stability becomes often a major concern, which necessitates to study the heat transport
properties at the molecular-scale. Here we report the thermoelectric behavior of various tr-nuclear
metal-string complexes, $[M-M-M](dpa)_4(NCS)_2$ for $M \in \{Cr,Ru\}$, bridging Au(111) nanowires
as nanoelectrodes. Based on our charge transport analysis from \textit{first-principles}, we
find that the dominant transmission peaks tend to move away from the Fermi level upon systematic
rutheniation in chromium-based metal-string complexes due mainly to the coupling of $\pi^{*}$
orbitals from Ru and $\sigma_{nb}$ orbitals from Cr. Such type of a metal-string junction can also
exhibit strong Coulomb interaction so that its thermoelectric behavior begins to deviate from
the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results further suggest that metal-string complexes can render better
thermoelectric devices especially at the molecular-scale with the thermopower as high as 172 $\mu
V/K$ at 300 K. Considering the contributions from both electrons and phonons, even a high \textit{figure
of merit} of $ZT \sim 2$ may be attained for Cr-Cr-Cr based metal-string molecular junctions at room
temperature. Resonant enhancement in the thermoelectric efficiency appears to occur in such systems
through alteration of inter-dot electrostatic interactions, which can be controlled by incorporating
Cr and Ru atoms in such tri-nuclear metal-string complexes.
