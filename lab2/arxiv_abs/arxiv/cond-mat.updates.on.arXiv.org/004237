Soft colloids are increasingly used as model systems to address fundamental issues such as crystallisation
and the glass and jamming transitions. Among the available classes of soft colloids, microgels
are emerging as the gold standard. Since their great internal complexity makes their theoretical
characterization very hard, microgels are commonly modelled, at least in the small-deformation
regime, within the simple framework of linear elasticity theory. Here we show that there exist conditions
where its range of validity can be greatly extended, providing strong numerical evidence that microgels
adsorbed at an interface follow the two-dimensional Hertzian theory, and hence behave like 2D elastic
particles, up to very large deformations. We are also able to estimate the Young's modulus of the
individual particles and, appropriately comparing with its counterpart in bulk conditions, we
demonstrate a significant stiffening of the polymer network at the interface. Finally, by analyzing
dynamical properties, we predict multiple reentrant melting phenomena in experimentally accessible
conditions: by a continuous increase of particle density, microgels first arrest and then re-fluidify
due to the high penetrability of their extended coronas. The present work establishes microgels
at interfaces as a new model system for fundamental investigations, paving the way for the experimental
synthesis and research on unique high-density liquid-like states. In addition, these results
can guide the development of novel assembly and patterning strategies on surfaces and the design
of novel materials with desired interfacial behavior.
