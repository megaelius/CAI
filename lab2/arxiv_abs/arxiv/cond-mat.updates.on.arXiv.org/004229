Many complex phenomena occurring in physics, chemistry, finance, etc. can be reduced, by some projection
process, to a 1-d SDE for the variable of interest. Typically, this SDE results both non linear and
non Markovian, thus an exact equivalent Fokker Planck equation (FPE), for the probability density
function (PDF), is not generally obtainable. However, the FPE is desirable because it is the main
tool to obtain important analytical statistical information as the stationary PDF and the First
Passage Time. Several techniques have been developed to deal with the finite correlation time $\tau$
of the noise in nonlinear SDE, with the aim of obtaining an effective FPE. The main results are the
"best" FPE (BFPE) of Lopez et al. and the FPE obtained by using the "local linearization assumption"
(LLA) introduced by Grigolini and Fox. In principle the BFPE is the best FPE obtainable by using a
perturbation approach, where the noise is weak, but the correlation time can be large. However,
when compared with numerical simulations of the SDE, the LLA FPE usually performs better than the
BFPE. Moreover, the BFPE gives often "unphysical" results that reveal some flaws, problems that
do not affect the LLA FPE. The common step of the perturbation approaches that lead to the BFPE is the
interaction picture. In this work, that is presented in two companion papers, we prove that this
issue affecting the BFPE is due to a non correct use of the interaction picture, a consequence of the
pitfalls of non-linear dissipative systems. We will show how to cure this problem, so as to arrive
to the real best FPE obtainable from a erturbation approach. However, the LLA FPE for 1d-SDE continue
to be preferable for different reasons. In this first paper we shall consider nonlinear systems
of interest perturbed by additive Gaussian colored noises.
