Employing both theoretical and experimental techniques, we discover that the paradigmatic quasi-1D
material (TaSe4)2I, which at room temperature respects the body-centered tetragonal, chiral
space group (SG) 97 (I422), is actually a Weyl semimetal whose Weyl points become gapped by a charge-density
wave (CDW). Using first-principles calculations, we determine that the Fermi surface of (TaSe4)2I
is dominated by topological contributions from bulk Weyl points, which appear near the kz = 2$\pi$/c
planes and lie within a narrow energy range of EF. To elucidate the origin of the CDW, we compute the
electronic susceptibility, whose real part diverges at several high-density spots that correspond
to Fermi-surface "nesting vectors" that link Weyl points with opposite chiral charges. We then
use X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ARPES probes on (TaSe4)2I samples to experimentally confirm the
CDW phase. In our XRD probes, we observe satellite reflections consistent with a body-centered
tetragonal CDW-modulated structure. Crucially, the experimentally observed satellite reflections
exhibit close agreement with the high-density spots (Weyl-point nesting vectors) in the electronic
susceptibility. Calculating the conventional-cell (110)-surface states, we observe pairs of
well-isolated topological Fermi arcs on both the TaSe4-chain and I-atom terminations. We then
calculate the QPI patterns of the Fermi arcs. Because crystals in SG 97 are structurally chiral,
then (TaSe4)2I in its high-temperature phase is also a strong candidate for the experimental observation
of the quantized circular photogalvanic and chiral magnetic effects. Furthermore because its
CDW couples Weyl points with opposite chiral charges, then the low-temperature phase of (TaSe4)2I
provides a venue for examining topological insulating phases with strong interactions, such as
axion insulators.
