We consider the subdiffusion-reaction process with reactions of type A+B\arrow B (in which particles
A are assumed to be mobile whereas B - to be static) in comparison to the subdiffusion-reaction process
with A\arrow B reactions which was studied by I.M. Sokolov, M.G.W. Schmidt and F. Sagu\'es in Phys.
Rev. E 73, 031102 (2006). In both processes a rule that reactions can occur only between the particles
which continue to exist is taken into account. Although in both processes a probability of the vanishing
of particle A due to a reaction, is independent of variables of time and space (assuming that in the
system with the A+B\arrow B reactions, particles B are distributed homogeneously), we show that
subdiffusion-reaction equations describing these processes as well as their Green's functions
are qualitatively different. The reason for this difference is as follows. In the case of the former
reaction, particles A and B have to meet with some probability before the reaction occurs, in complete
contradiction to the case of the latter reaction. For the subdiffusion process with the A+B\arrow
B reactions, we consider three models which differ in some details concerning a description of the
reactions. In general, we base the method utilized on the analysis of the process under consideration
on a random walk model in a system with both discrete time and space variables. These discrete variables
are next transformed into the system with both continuous time and space variables. We present the
formulae of transforming functions and parameters describing the system from discrete variables
to continuous variables. We also discuss two methods of describing the subdiffusion-reaction
process by using the model with both discrete time and space variables. Employing a simple phenomenological
model, we also derive equations related to the reaction parameters used in the considered models.
