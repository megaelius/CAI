We perform linear stability analysis and nonlinear slender filament simulations of extensional
necking in complex fluids and soft solids, during the stress relaxation process following an interrupted
strain ramp. We start by deriving analytical criteria for necking within a highly simplified and
generalised scalar constitutive model. Here, we find two different possible modes of necking:
one associated with an upward curvature in the stress relaxation function on a log-linear plot,
and another related to a carefully defined `elastic' derivative of the tensile force with respect
to an imagined sudden strain increment. We showed these two criteria to agree fully with simulations
of the Oldroyd B and Giesekus models of polymeric solutions, and with the RoliePoly model of more
concentrated polymeric solutions and melts, without polymer chain stretch. With chain stretch
included, we find a slightly more complicated analytical criterion for necking during the stress
relaxation, with key ingredients that closely mirror counterpart ingredients of the simpler criteria
obtained within the scalar model. We show this criterion to agree fully with slender filament simulations
of the RoliePoly model with chain stretch, and with the scenario discussed by the Copenhagen group
in Refs. [1, 2]. In particular, we see delayed necking after strain ramps with an accumulated strain
exceeding ~ 0.7, for ramp rates exceeding the inverse chain stretch relaxation timescale. We discuss
finally an analogy between this delayed necking following an interrupted extensional strain ramp
and delayed shear banding following an interrupted shear strain ramp [3]. This work provides the
counterpart, for interrupted extensional strain ramps, to earlier papers giving criteria for
necking in the protocols of constant imposed Hencky strain rate [4] and of constant imposed tensile
stress or constant imposed tensile force [5].
