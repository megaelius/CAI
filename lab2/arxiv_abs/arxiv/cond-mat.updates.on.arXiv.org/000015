We present results of extensive theoretical studies concerning stability, morphology, and band
structure of single wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) covalently functionalized by -CHn(for n=2,3,4),-NHn(for
n=1,2,3,4),-COOH and -OH groups. Our studies are based on ab initio calculations in the framework
of the density functional theory. We determine the dependence of the binding energies on the concentration
of the adsorbed molecules, critical densities of adsorbed molecules, global and local changes
in the morphology, and electronic structure paying particular attention to the functionalization
induced changes of the band gaps. These studies reveal physical mechanisms that determine stability
and electronic structure of those systems and also provide valuable theoretical predictions relevant
for application. Functionalization of CNTs causes generally their elongation and locally sp2
-> sp3 rehybridization in the neighborhood of chemisorbed groups. For adsorbants making particularly
strong covalent bonds with the CNTs(-CH2), we observe formation of the 5/7 defects. In CNTs functionalized
with -CH2,-NH4, and -OH, we determine critical density of molecules that could be covalently bound
to CNTs. Functionalization of CNTs can be utilized for band gap engineering and also lead to changes
in their metallic/semiconductor character. In semiconducting CNTs, adsorbants such as -CH3,-NH2,-OH
and -COOH, introduce 'impurity' bands in the band gap of pristine CNTs. In the case of -CH3,-NH2,
the induced band gaps are typically smaller than in the pure CNT and depend strongly on the concentration
of adsorbants. However, functionalization of semiconducting CNTs with -OH leads to the metallization
of CNTs. On the other hand, the functionalization of semi-metallic (9,0)CNT with -CH2 causes the
increase of the band gap and induces semi-metal to semiconductor transition.
