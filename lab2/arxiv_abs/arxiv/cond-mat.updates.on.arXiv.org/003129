This paper considers the stress-induced phase transitions of shape memory alloy cylinder with
finite length, and analytically studies the phase transition process from homogeneous deformations
to localized inhomogeneous deformations. We adopt a phenomenological model with an internal variable.
The three-dimensional (3D) system is first reduced to piece-wise 1D linear systems of two strains
in three different regions (austenite, martensite and phase transition regions), with suitable
boundary conditions and connection conditions on interfaces. Theoretically, this is a tricky
free boundary problem, as the position and shape of interfaces between regions are unknown. Then,
we focus on planar interfaces (which are energetically favored), and a symmetric case when phase
transition starts in the middle. For given applied stress, two-region solutions, three-region
solutions and the connecting solutions between them are obtained analytically or semianalytically.
Either period-k solutions are found analytically, or the solution for strains is reduced to one
or two nonlinear algebraic equations. Two-region solutions show that phase transition does not
take place at one point, but simultaneously in a small region. The width of phase transition region
is found analytically, revealing the roles of the material and geometrical parameters. Three-region
solutions capture the fact that the stress always stays near the Maxwell stress. The transition
process is systematically studied based on the stress-elongation curve, which captures the stress
drop and transition from homogeneous deformation to period-1 inhomogeneous deformation. When
the radius is smaller than a critical value (given by material constants), the stress drop is very
sharp due to transition of solutions in a snap-back bifurcation. Many features show good agreement
with experimental observations.
