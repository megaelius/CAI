Fourth-order strong-coupling degenerate perturbation theory is used to derive an effective low-energy
Hamiltonian for the Kondo-lattice model with a depleted system of localized spins. In the strong-J
limit, completely local Kondo singlets are formed at the spinful sites which bind a fraction of conduction
electrons. The low-energy theory describes the scattering of the excess conduction electrons
at the Kondo singlets as well as their effective interactions generated by virtual excitations
of the singlets. Besides the Hubbard term, already discussed by Nozieres, we find a ferromagnetic
Heisenberg interaction, an antiferromagnetic isospin interaction, a correlated hopping and,
in more than one dimensions, three- and four-site interactions. The interaction term can be cast
into highly symmetric and formally simple spin-only form using the spin of the bonding orbital symmetrically
centered around the Kondo singlet. This spin is non-local. We show that, depending on the geometry
of the depleted lattice, spatial overlap of the non-local spins around different Kondo singlets
may cause ferromagnetic order. This is sustained by a rigorous argument, applicable to the half-filled
model, by a variational analysis of the stability of the fully polarized Fermi sea of excess conduction
electrons as well as by exact diagonalization of the effective model. A similar fourth-order perturbative
analysis is performed for the depleted Anderson lattice in the limit of strong hybridization. Even
in a parameter regime where the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation does not apply, this yields the
same effective theory albeit with a different coupling constant.
