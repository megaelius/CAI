Anomalous diffusion, manifest as a nonlinear temporal evolution of the position mean square displacement,
and/or non-Gaussian features of the position statistics, is prevalent in biological transport
processes. Likewise, collective behavior is often observed to emerge spontaneously from the mutual
interactions between constituent motile units in biological systems. Examples where these phenomena
can be observed simultaneously have been identified in recent experiments on bird flocks, fish
schools and bacterial swarms. These results pose an intriguing question, which cannot be resolved
by existing theories of active matter: How is the collective motion of these systems affected by
the anomalous diffusion of the constituent units? Here, we answer this question for a microscopic
model of active L\'evy matter -- a collection of active particles that perform superdiffusion akin
to a L\'evy flight and interact by promoting polar alignment of their orientations. We present in
details the derivation of the hydrodynamic equations of motion of the model, obtain from these equations
the criteria for a disordered or ordered state, and apply linear stability analysis on these states
at the onset of collective motion. Our analysis reveals that the disorder-order phase transition
in active L\'evy matter is critical, in contrast to ordinary active fluids where the phase transition
is, instead, first-order. Correspondingly, we estimate the critical exponents of the transition
by finite size scaling analysis and use these numerical estimates to relate our findings to known
universality classes. These results highlight the novel physics exhibited by active matter integrating
both anomalous diffusive single-particle motility and inter-particle interactions.
