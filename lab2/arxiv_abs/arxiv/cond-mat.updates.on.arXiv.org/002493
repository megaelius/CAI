The electronic properties of heterostructures of atomically-thin van der Waals (vdW) crystals
can be modified substantially by Moir\'e superlattice potentials arising from an interlayer twist
between crystals. Moir\'e-tuning of the band structure has led to the recent discovery of superconductivity
and correlated insulating phases in twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) near the so-called "magic
angle" of $\sim$1.1{\deg}, with a phase diagram reminiscent of high T$_c$ superconductors. However,
lack of detailed understanding of the electronic spectrum and the atomic-scale influence of the
Moir\'e pattern has so far precluded a coherent theoretical understanding of the correlated states.
Here, we directly map the atomic-scale structural and electronic properties of TBLG near the magic
angle using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). We observe two distinct
van Hove singularities (vHs) in the LDOS which decrease in separation monotonically through 1.1{\deg}
with the bandwidth (t) of each vHs minimized near the magic angle. When doped near half Moir\'e band
filling, the conduction vHs shifts to the Fermi level and an additional correlation-induced gap
splits the vHs with a maximum size of 7.5 meV. We also find that three-fold (C$_3$) rotational symmetry
of the LDOS is broken in doped TBLG with a maximum symmetry breaking observed for states near the Fermi
level, suggestive of nematic electronic interactions. The main features of our doping and angle
dependent spectroscopy are captured by a tight-binding model with on-site (U) and nearest neighbor
Coulomb interactions. We find that the ratio U/t is of order unity, indicating that electron correlations
are significant in magic angle TBLG. Rather than a simple maximization of the DOS, superconductivity
arises in TBLG at angles where the ratio U/t is largest, suggesting a pairing mechanism based on electron-electron
interactions.
