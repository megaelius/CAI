It is well-known that the zero-range contact potential approximation for the mean-field interaction
of a many-atom system breaks down when the atoms interact through a scattering resonance. At present,
there exists no standard model interaction potential that can accurately describe resonant or
strong atom-atom interactions at low energy. More than 65 years ago, Jost and Kohn [R. Jost and W.
Kohn, {Phys. Rev.} {\bf 87}, 977 (1952)] derived an explicit expression for a class of short-range
model potentials from a given effective range expansion with the $s$-wave scattering length $a_s$
being negative. For $a_s >0$, they calculated another class of short-range model potentials [R.
Jost and W. Kohn, { Dan. Mat. Fys. Medd} {\bf 27}, 1 (1953)] using a method based on an adaptation from
Gelfand-Levitan theory [I. M. Gel'fand and B. M. Levitan, { Dokl. Akad. Nauk. USSR} {\bf 77}, 557-560
(1951)] of inverse scattering. We here revisit the methods of Jost and Kohn in order to explore the
possibility of modeling resonant interactions at low energy. We show that the Jost-Kohn potentials
can account for zero-energy resonances. The $s$-wave phase shift for positive scattering length
is expressed in an analytical form as a function of the binding energy of a bound state. We show that,
for small binding energy, both the scattering length and the effective range are strongly influenced
by the binding energy; and below a critical binding energy the effective range becomes negative
provided the scattering length is large. We further demonstrate that Jost-Kohn potentials are
useful to describe range- and energy-dependence of Feshbach resonances of ultracold atoms, and
able to reproduce the standard results of contact interaction in the limit of the effective range
going to zero.
