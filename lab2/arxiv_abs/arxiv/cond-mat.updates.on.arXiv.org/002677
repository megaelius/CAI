The conformational statistics of ring polymers in melts or dense solutions is strongly affected
by their quenched microscopic topological state. The effect is particularly strong for untangled
(i.e. non-concatenated and unknotted) rings, which are known to crumple and segregate. Here we
study these systems using a computationally efficient multi-scale approach, where we combine
massive simulations on the fiber level with the explicit construction of untangled ring melt configurations
based on theoretical ideas for their large scale structure. We find (i) that topological constraints
may be neglected on scales below the standard entanglement length, $L_e$, (ii) that rings with a
size $1 \le L_r/L_e \le 30$ exhibit nearly ideal lattice tree behavior characterized by primitive
paths which are randomly branched on the entanglement scale, and (iii) that larger rings are compact
with gyration radii $\langle R_g^2(L_r) \rangle \propto L_r^{2/3}$. The detailed comparison
between equilibrated and constructed ensembles allows us to perform a `Feynman test' of our understanding
of untangled rings: can we convert ideas for the large-scale ring structure into algorithms for
constructing (nearly) equilibrated ring melt samples? We show that most structural observables
are quantitatively reproduced by two different construction schemes: hierarchical crumpling
and ring melts derived from the analogy to interacting branched polymers. However, the latter fail
the `Feynman test' with respect to the magnetic radius, $R_m$, which we have defined based on an analogy
to magnetostatics. While $R_m$ is expected to vanish for double-folded structures, the observed
values of $\langle R_m^2(L_r) \rangle \propto \langle R_g^2(L_r) \rangle$ provide a simple and
computationally convenient measure of the presence of a non-negligible amount of local loop opening
in crumpled rings.
