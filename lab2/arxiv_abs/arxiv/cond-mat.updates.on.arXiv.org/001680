We propose graphene based moir\'e super-lattice systems to realize nearly flat Chern bands. We
study a number of systems of twisted double layers with small twist angle. Each layer is chosen to
be either AB stacked bilayer graphene (BG), ABC stacked trilayer graphene (TG), or hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) (specifically the following twisted systems: BG/h-BN, TG/h-BN, BG/BG, TG/TG,
TG/BG.). In these systems a vertical applied electric field enables control of the bandwidth, and
interestingly also the Chern number. We find that Chern numbers of the bands associated with each
of the two microscopic valleys can be $\pm 0,\pm 1,\pm 2, \pm 3$ depending on the specific system and
vertical electrical field. Fully filling these bands ($\nu_T = 4$ electrons/moir\'e site) leads
to a Quantum Valley Hall state. At partial band filling, Coulomb interactions are expected to play
an important role. At integer electron fillings (per moir\'e site) $\nu_T= 1, 2,3$, the natural
states are spontaneous spin/valley polarized to give fully filled bands. This leads to Anomalous
Integer Quantum (Valley) Hall states with Chern number $C \geq 1$. At fractional filling, Fractional
Quantum Anomalous Hall insulators or Fractional Quantum Valley Hall insulators (both abelian
and non-abelian) are possible when interaction is strong enough. %Besides a series of Abelian states,
$SU(N)_C$ non-Abelian states are also possible candidates for fractional filling of bands with
Chern number $C>1$. For Chern number $|C|=2$, unconventional superconductivity may arise from
condensation of charge $2e$ bosonic skyrmions upon doping the spin and valley polarized Integer
Quantum Anomalous Hall insulator with Hall conductivity $\sigma^c_{xy}=2\frac{e^2}{h}$ at
filling $\nu_T= 1,3$. We also discuss conceptual similarities and implications for modeling twisted
bilayer graphene systems.
