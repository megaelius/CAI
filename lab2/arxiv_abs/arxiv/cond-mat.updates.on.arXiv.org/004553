The practical applications of lithium selenium (Li-Se) batteries are impeded primarily due to
the dissolution and migration of higher order polyselenides (Li2Sen) into the electrolyte (known
as shuttle effect) and inactive deposition of lower order polyselenides. The high electrical conductivity
and mechanical strengths of MXenes make them a suitable candidate to provide adequate anchoring
to prevent polyselenides dissolution and improved electrochemical performance. Herein, we used
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the binding mechanism of Li2Sen on
graphene and surface functionalized Ti3C2 MXenes. We used graphene as reference material to assess
Li2Sen binding strengths on functionalized Ti3C2X2 (where X = S, O, F, and Cl). We observed that Ti3C2S2
and Ti3C2O2 exhibit superior anchoring behavior compared to graphene, Ti3C2F2, and Ti3C2Cl2.
The calculated Li2Sen adsorption strength provided by S and O terminated Ti3C2 are stronger than
the commonly used ether-based electrolyte, which is a requisite for effective suppression of the
Li2Sen shuttling. The adsorbed Li2Sen on Ti3C2X2 and graphene retains their structural integrity
without a chemical decomposition. The density of states (DOS) analysis exhibits that the conductive
behavior of the Ti3C2X2 is preserved even after Li2Sen adsorption, which can stimulate the electrochemical
activity of involved Li2Sen chemistry. Based on our unprecedented results, Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2
are found to exhibit superior anchoring behavior for Li2Sen adsorption, which can be leveraged
for designing effective selenium-based cathode materials to boost the electrochemical performance
of the Li-Se battery system
