X-ray diffraction pressure studies at room temperature demonstrate that the spinel FeAl$_{2}$O$_{4}$
transforms to a tetragonal phase at ~18 GPa. This tetragonal phase has a highly irregular unit-cell
volume versus pressure dependence up to ~45 GPa, after which a transformation to a Cmcm post-spinel
phase is onset. This is attributable to pressure driven Fe-Al site inversion at room temperature,
corroborated by signatures in the 57Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy pressure data. At the tetragonal
to post-spinel transition, onset in the range 45-50 GPa, there is a concurrent emergence of a non-magnetic
spectral component in the M\"ossbauer data at variable cryogenic temperatures. This is interpreted
as spin crossover at sixfold coordinated Fe locations emanated from site inversion. Spin crossover
commences at the end of the pressure range of the tetragonal phase and progresses in the post-spinel
structure. There is also a much steeper volume change dV/V ~ 10% in the range 45-50 GPa compared to
the preceding pressure regime, from the combined effects of the structural transition and spin
crossover electronic change. At the highest pressure attained, ~106 GPa, the M\"ossbauer data
evidences a diamagnetic Fe low-spin abundance of ~50%. The rest of the high-spin Fe in eightfold
coordinated sites continue to experience a relatively small internal magnetic field of ~33 T. This
is indicative of a magnetic ground state associated with strong covalency, as well as substantive
disorder from site inversion and the mixed spin-state configuration. Intriguingly magnetism
survives in such a spin-diluted post-spinel lattice at high densities. The R(300 K) data decreases
by only two orders of magnitude from ambient pressure to the vicinity of ~100 GPa. Despite a ~26% unit-cell
volume densification from the lattice compressibility, structural transitions and spin crossover.
