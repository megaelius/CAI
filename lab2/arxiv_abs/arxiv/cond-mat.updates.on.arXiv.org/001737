Magnetic skyrmions are mesmerizing spin textures with peculiar topological and dynamical properties,
typically the product of competing interactions in ferromagnets, and with great technological
potential [1-5]. Researchers have long wondered whether analogous electric skyrmions might exist
in ferroelectrics, maybe featuring novel behaviors and possibilities for electric and mechanical
control. The results thus far are modest, though: an electric equivalent of the most typical magnetic
skyrmion (which would rely on a counterpart of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction) seems all
but impossible; further, the exotic ferroelectric orders observed or predicted to date [6-8] rely
on very specific nano-structures (composites, superlattices), which limits the generality and
properties (e.g., mobility) of the possible associated skyrmions. Here we propose an original
approach to write electric skyrmions in simple ferroelectric lattices in a customary manner. Our
second-principles simulations [9] of columnar ferroelectric nano-domains, in prototype compound
PbTiO3 , show that it is possible to harness the Bloch-type internal structure of the domain wall
[10] and hence create a genuine skyrmion. We check that the object thus obtained displays the usual
skyrmion-defining features; further, it also presents unusual ones, including a symmetry-breaking
skyrmion-skyrmion transition driven by strain, various types of topological transformations
induced by external fields and temperature, and potentially very small sizes. Our results suggest
countless possibilities for creating and manipulating electric textures with non-trivial topologies,
using standard experimental tools and materials, effectively inaugurating the field of electric
skyrmions.
