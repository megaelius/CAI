We study thermal effects on pinning and creep in type-II superconductors where vortices interact
with a low density $n_p$ of strong point-like defects with pinning energy $e_p$ and extension $\xi$,
the vortex core size. Defects are classified as strong if the interaction between a single pin and
an individual vortex leads to the appearance of bistable solutions describing pinned and free vortex
configurations. Extending the strong pinning theory to account for thermal fluctuations, we provide
a quantitative analysis of vortex depinning and creep. We determine the thermally activated transitions
between bistable states using Kramer's rate theory and find the non-equilibrium steady-state
occupation of vortex states. The latter depends on the temperature $T$ and vortex velocity $v$ and
determines the current--voltage (or force--velocity) characteristic of the superconductor
at finite temperatures. We find that the $T=0$ linear excess-current characteristic $v \propto
(j-j_c) \, \Theta(j-j_c)$ with its sharp transition at the critical current density $j_c$, keeps
its overall shape but is modified in three ways due to thermal creep: a downward renormalization
of $j_c$ to the thermal depinning current density $j_\mathrm{dp}(T) < j_c$, a smooth rounding of
the characteristic around $j_\mathrm{dp}(T)$, and the appearance of thermally assisted flux
flow (TAFF) ${v \propto j \exp(-U_0/k_{\rm \scriptscriptstyle B} T)}$ at small drive $j \ll j_c$,
with the activation barrier $U_0$ defined through the energy landscape at the intersection of free
and pinned branches. This characteristic emphasizes the persistence of pinning of creep at current
densities beyond critical.
