Ionic transport processes govern performance in many classic and emerging devices, ranging from
battery storage to modern mixed-conduction electrochemical transistors. Here, we study local
ion transport dynamics in polymer films using time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (trEFM).
We establish a correspondence between local and macroscopic measurements using local trEFM and
macroscopic electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We use polymer films doped with lithium
bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) as a model system where the polymer backbone has oxanorbornenedicarboximide
repeat units with an oligomeric ethylene oxide side chain of length n. Our results show that the local
polymer response measured in the time domain with trEFM follows stretched exponential relaxation
kinetics, consistent with the Havriliak-Negami relaxation we measure in the frequency-domain
EIS data for macroscopic samples of the same polymers. Furthermore, we show that the trEFM results
capture the same trends as the EIS results-changes in ion dynamics with increasing temperature,
increasing salt concentration, and increasing volume fraction of ethylene oxide side chains in
the polymer matrix evolve with the same trends in both measurement techniques. We conclude from
this correlation that trEFM data reflect, at the nanoscale, the same ionic processes probed in conventional
EIS at the device level. Finally, as an example application for emerging materials syntheses, we
use trEFM and infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) to image a novel diblock copolymer
electrolyte for next-generation solid-state energy storage applications.
