Recent experimental evidence for the quantum spin Hall (QSH) state in monolayer WTe$_2$ has bridged
two of the most active fields of condensed matter physics, 2D materials and topological physics.
This 2D topological crystal also displays unconventional spin-torque and gate-tunable superconductivity.
While the realization of QSH has demonstrated the nontrivial topology of the electron wavefunctions
of monolayer WTe$_2$, the geometrical properties of the wavefunction, such as the Berry curvature,
remain unstudied. On the other hand, it has been increasingly recognized that the Berry curvature
plays an important role in multiple areas of condensed matter physics including nonreciprocal
electron transport, enantioselective optical responses, chiral polaritons and even unconventional
superconductivity. Here we utilize mid-infrared optoelectronic microscopy to investigate the
Berry curvature in monolayer WTe$_2$. By optically exciting electrons across the inverted QSH
gap, we observe an in-plane circular photogalvanic current even under normal incidence. The application
of an out-of-plane displacement field further systematically controls the direction and magnitude
of the photocurrent. Our observed photocurrent reveals a novel Berry curvature dipole that arises
from the nontrivial wavefunctions near the inverted gap edge. These previously unrealized Berry
curvature dipole and strong electric field effect are uniquely enabled by the inverted band structure
and tilted crystal lattice of monolayer WTe$_2$. Such an electrically switchable Berry curvature
dipole opens the door to the observation of a wide range of quantum geometrical phenomena, such as
quantum nonlinear Hall, orbital-Edelstein and chiral polaritonic effects.
