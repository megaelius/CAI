We report the electronic density of states for computationally-generated bulk samples of amorphous
chalcogenide alloys As$_{x}$Se$_{100-x}$, which belong to the technologically important family
of phase-change materials. The samples were generated using a novel algorithm reported in the first
paper of the series. The calculated density of states is in good agreement with experiment, including
the trend of the mobility gap with arsenic content. The sample-to-sample variation in the band edges
is quantitatively consistent with the width of the exponential (Urbach) tail of band-edge states
observed in experiment. Importantly, our samples consistently exhibit very deep-lying midgap
electronic states that are delocalized in one direction significantly more than what would be expected
for a deep impurity or defect state. These properties are consistent with those of the topological
midgap electronic states that have been proposed by Zhugayevych and Lubchenko as an explanation
for several puzzling opto-electronic anomalies observed in the chalcogenides, including light-induced
midgap absorption and ESR signal, and anomalous photoluminescence. In a complement to the traditional
view of the Urbach states as a generic consequence of disorder in atomic positions, the present results
suggest these states can be also thought of as intimate pairs of topological midgap states that cannot
recombine. Finally, samples with an odd number of electrons exhibit neutral, spin $1/2$ midgap
states as well as polaron-like configurations that consist of a charge carrier bound to an intimate
pair of midgap states; the polaron's identity---electron or hole---depends on the preparation
protocol of the sample.
