Liquids and solids are two fundamental states of matter. Although the structure of crystalline
solids has long been solved by crystallography, our understanding of the 3D atomic structure of
liquids and amorphous materials remained speculative. In 1952, Frank hypothesized that icosahedral
order is the prevalent atomic motif in monatomic liquids. Over the past six decades, there have been
a great deal of experimental, computational and theoretical studies to understand the structure
of liquids and amorphous materials. A polytetrahedral packing model was proposed to explain the
3D atomic structure of monatomic liquids and amorphous materials, in which icosahedral order is
a key feature. The icosahedral order has also been found to play an important role in the structure
of metallic glasses and quasicrystals. Here we advance atomic electron tomography to determine
for the first time the 3D atomic positions in monatomic amorphous materials, including a Ta thin
film and two Pd nanoparticles. Despite the different chemical composition and synthesis methods,
we observe that pentagonal bipyramids are the most abundant atomic motifs in these amorphous materials.
Contrary to the traditional understanding, the pentagonal bipyramids do not assemble full icosahedra,
but are closely connected with each other to form networks that extend to medium-range scale. Our
molecular dynamic simulations, coupled with experimental results, further reveal that the 3D
atomic structure of monatomic liquids is similar to the experimental amorphous material. Moreover,
we find that the pentagonal bipyramid networks, prevalent in monatomic liquids, rapidly grow in
size and form a fraction of full icosahedra during the quench from a liquid to a metallic glass state,
providing a possible new picture of structural evolution through the glass transition.
