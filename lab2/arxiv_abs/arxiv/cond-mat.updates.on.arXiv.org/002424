Depositing thin and thick films by different coating technology units is the beauty of deposition
technology where every synthesis deals the chamber pressure. In hot-filaments reactor, chamber
also deals heat and photon energy in addition to pressure settling into the available mass. Temperature
of the substrate material and hot-filaments under fixed input power vary as per residence time of
entered dissociating CH4 and H2 gases under set flow rates. Rates of dissociating entered gases
and conversion rate of gas state carbon atoms into graphite and diamond states carbon atoms vary
largely under the varying chamber pressure which influence the deposition of their carbon films
in terms of quality and growth rate. The increase in the chamber pressure from 3.3 kPa to 14 kPa influences
the morphology of carbon films comprising tiny grains, grains and particles. The increase in the
chamber pressure upto 8.6 kPa increases the growth rate of a carbon film along with discernible features
of grains and particles. In the range of different intermediate chamber pressures, gas state carbon
atoms are converted into diamond state carbon atoms at high rate. In the range of high pressures,
gaseous carbon atoms converted to graphite state in a large number. Here, a low growth rate of the
films is obtained. For different chamber pressures, typical energies arriving at substrate surface
involved the different rate as influenced by the gas collisions developing carbon films of different
featured grains and particles. Deposited carbon films are investigated under the investigation
of original line of experimental results opening abundant avenues of materials research.
