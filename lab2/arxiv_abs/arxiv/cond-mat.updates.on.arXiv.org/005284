The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), demonstrated in diverse chiral molecules by numerous
experimental and theoretical groups, has been attracting extensive and ongoing interest in recent
years. As the secondary structure of DNA, the charge transfer along DNA hairpins has been widely
studied for more than two decades, finding that DNA hairpins exhibit spin-related effects as reported
in recent experiments. Here, we propose a setup to demonstrate directly the CISS effect in DNA hairpins
contacted by two nonmagnetic leads at both ends of the stem. Our results indicate that DNA hairpins
present pronounced CISS effect and the spin polarization could be enhanced by using conducting
molecules as the loop. In particular, DNA hairpins show several intriguing features, which are
different from other chiral molecules. First, the local spin currents can flow circularly and assemble
into a number of vortex clusters when the electron energy locates in the left/right electronic band
of the stem. The chirality of vortex clusters in each band is the same and will be reversed by switching
the electron energy from the left band to the right one, inducing the sign reversal of the spin polarization.
Interestingly, the local spin currents can be greater than the corresponding spin component of
the source-drain current. Second, both the conductance and the spin polarization can increase
with molecular length as well as dephasing strength, contrary to the physical intuition that the
transmission ability of molecular wires should be poorer when suffering from stronger scattering.
Third, we unveil the optimal contact configuration of efficient electron transport and that of
the CISS effect, which are distinct from each other and can be controlled by dephasing strength.
The underlying physical mechanism is illustrated.
