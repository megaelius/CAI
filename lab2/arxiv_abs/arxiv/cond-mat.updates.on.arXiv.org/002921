The MolMod database is presented, which is openly accessible at this http URL and contains presently
intermolecular force fields for over 150 pure fluids. It was developed and is maintained by the Boltzmann-Zuse
Society for Computational Molecular Engineering (BZS). The set of molecular models in the MolMod
database provides a coherent framework for molecular simulations of fluids. The molecular models
in the MolMod database consist of Lennard-Jones interaction sites, point charges, and point dipoles
and quadrupoles, which can be equivalently represented by multiple point charges. The force fields
can be exported as input files for the simulation programs ms2 and ls1 mardyn, Gromacs, and LAMMPS.
To characterise the semantics associated with the numerical database content, a force-field nomenclature
is introduced that can also be used in other contexts in materials modelling at the atomistic and
mesoscopic levels. The models of the pure substances that are included in the data base were generally
optimised such as to yield good representations of experimental data of the vapour-liquid equilibrium
with a focus on the vapour pressure and the saturated liquid density. In many cases, the models also
yield good predictions of caloric, transport, and interfacial properties of the pure fluids. For
all models, references to the original works in which they were developed are provided. The models
can be used straightforwardly for predictions of properties of fluid mixtures using established
combination rules. Input errors are a major source of errors in simulations. The MolMod database
contributes to reducing such errors.
