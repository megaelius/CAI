The Dirac delta-function version of the one-dimensional Kronig-Penney model of the electronic
band structure for an electron in a ring containing a large number N of positive ions with period a
is considered, following the outlines of the formalism previously described [J.C. Wolfe, Am. J.
Phys. 46, 1012 (1978)]. After an introduction to the finite-potential-width case, the relationship
between the electron wavevector k and the energy E is derived for the delta-function case which is
valid for energies within the energy bands with real k values as well as within the energy gaps with
complex k values. From numerical calculations, the band structure E(k) is obtained and presented
in the extended-zone, periodic-zone, and reduced-zone schemes. We find that the bottom of the bands
are free-electron-like and we obtain an exact analytic expression for their energies. Quantitative
calculations of the band dispersions and energy gaps are obtained for a particular value of the parameter
P in the theory. The general form of the wave function versus E and versus the linear dimension x is
derived, which is applicable to both the real-valued (for band energies) and complex-valued (for
energies in the energy gaps) k values. An expression for the energy-dependent wave-function normalization
factor is derived, which allows quantitative calculations of the wave function and electron probability
density versus energy and position around the ring to be carried out. Plots of the real and imaginary
parts of wave functions for representative energies within the electron bands and within the band
gaps and of the associated probability densities versus E and x are presented and discussed.
