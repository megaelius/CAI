While the thermodynamics of DNA hybridization is well understood, much less is known about the kinetics
of this classic system. Filling this gap in our understanding has new urgency because DNA nanotechnology
often depends critically on binding rates. Here we use a coarse-grained model to explore the hybridization
kinetics of DNA oligomers, finding that strand association proceeds through a complex set of intermediate
states. Successful binding events start with the formation of a few metastable base-pairing interactions,
followed by zippering of the remaining bonds. However, despite reasonably strong interstrand
interactions, initial contacts frequently fail to lead to zippering because the typical configurations
in which they form differ from typical states of similar enthalpy in the double-stranded equilibrium
ensemble. Therefore, if the association process is analyzed on the base-pair (secondary structure)
level, it shows non-Markovian behavior. Initial contacts must be stabilized by two or three base
pairs before full zippering is likely, resulting in negative effective activation enthalpies.
Non-Arrhenius behavior is observed as the number of base pairs in the effective transition state
increases with temperature. In addition, we find that alternative pathways involving misbonds
can increase association rates. For repetitive sequences, misaligned duplexes frequently rearrange
to form fully paired duplexes by two distinct processes which we label `pseudoknot' and `inchworm'
internal displacement. We show how the above processes can explain why experimentally observed
association rates of GC-rich oligomers are higher than rates of AT-rich equivalents. More generally,
we argue that association rates can be modulated by sequence choice.
