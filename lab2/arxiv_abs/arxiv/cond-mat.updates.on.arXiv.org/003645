In recent years there was a huge experimental progress towards the development of prototypes of
algorithmic quantum processors. These quantum machines are not free from imperfections and various
technological and scientific problems remain to be solved in the following years. Until that moment
computational schemes different from the digital approach can be used in order to perform calculations
using state-of-the-art quantum hardware. A prospective idea is to combine positive aspects of
both digital and analog computation. Particularly, it is possible to use qubit-qubit interaction
embedded in architecture in order to replace those parts of algorithms which are responsible for
the quantum entanglement. In this paper, we provide an example of such an approach based on unwanted
couplings between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits (crosstalks). These couplings are
normally considered as a source of errors in standard digital quantum computation, but we argue
that they can be utilized instead of two-qubit gates in some quantum algorithms thus avoiding an
accumulation of errors associated with these gates. We illustrate our ideas with quantum processors
of IBM Quantum Experience, which are used by us for simulating the dynamics of spin clusters through
the Trotterized evolution. We demonstrate a significant improvement in the quality of results
compared to the conventional digital approach with the same processor. We also show that crosstalks
result in a highly non-markovian dynamics of qubits. This fact must be taken into account while developing
error-correction strategies with qubits of this type.
