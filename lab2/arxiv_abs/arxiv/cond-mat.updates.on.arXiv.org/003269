When a magnetic impurity exists in a metal, conduction electrons form a spin cloud that screens the
impurity spin. This basic phenomenon is called the Kondo effect. Contrary to electric charge screening,
the spin screening cloud occurs quantum coherently, forming spin-singlet entanglement with the
impurity. Although the spins interact locally around the impurity, the cloud can spread out over
micrometers. The Kondo cloud has never been detected to date, and its existence, a fundamental aspect
of the Kondo effect, remains as a long-standing controversial issue. Here we present experimental
evidence of a Kondo cloud extending over a length of micrometers comparable to the theoretical length
$\xi_\mathrm{K}$. In our device, a Kondo impurity is formed in a quantum dot (QD), one-sided coupling
to a quasi-one dimensional channel~\cite{Theory_Proposal_HS} that houses a Fabry-Perot (FP)
interferometer of various gate-defined lengths $L > 1 \, \mu$m. When we sweep a voltage on the interferometer
end gate separated from the QD by the length $L$ to induce FP oscillations in conductance, we observe
oscillations in measured Kondo temperature $T_\mathrm{K}$, a sign of the cloud at distance $L$.
For $L \lesssim \xi_\mathrm{K}$ the $T_\mathrm{K}$ oscillation amplitude becomes larger for
the smaller $L$, obeying a scaling function of a single parameter $L/ \xi_\mathrm{K}$, while for
$L>\xi_\mathrm{K}$ the oscillation is much weaker. The result reveals that $\xi_\mathrm{K}$
is the only length parameter associated with the Kondo effect, and that the cloud lies mostly inside
the length $\xi_\mathrm{K}$ which reaches microns. Our experimental method of using electron
interferometers offers a way of detecting the spatial distribution of exotic non-Fermi liquids
formed by multiple magnetic impurities or multiple screening channels and solving long-standing
issues of spin-correlated systems.
