The 2D crystal structure of MoS$_2$ gives rise to interesting properties for applications such
as solid lubricants, optoelectronics, sensors and catalysis. Transition-metal doping has been
shown to enhance performance in solid lubrication and catalysis. However, the mechanism for improvement,
especially in coefficient of friction and reduction in wear for lubrication is unclear, which we
address in this paper with theoretical calculations. Our previous work investigated Ni-doped
MoS$_2$ in the bulk 2H phase with structure, elasticity, thermodynamics, and Raman/IR spectroscopy.
This work now explores other polytypes (1H and 1T monolayer, and 3R bulk) to determine favorable
sites for Ni, the doping effect on crystal structure, electronic properties and the layer dissociation
energy. The doping formation energy for Mo and S substitution or intercalation/adsorption shows
the most favorable are tetrahedral intercalation, Mo-atop and hollow site in bulk phases, 1H and
1T respectively and suggests a possibility of phase change from 2H to 3R under substitution. In-plane
change in lattice parameters were small but lattice parameters out of plane change notably. We find
metallic behavior in 3R and 2H under Mo substitution, and in-gap states for Mo and S substitution
in 1H, which could have interesting optoelectronic applications. Doping the 1T phase resulted
in reconstructions leading to a metal-semiconductor transition. We find that Ni doping strengthens
the layer binding which can explain the mechanism of low wear. Our systematic study shows the effect
of doping concentration. This work gives insight into the previously unclear structure of Ni-doped
MoS$_2$, the relation of energy and structures of doped monolayers and bulk systems, the electronic
properties under doping, and the effect of doping on interlayer interactions.
