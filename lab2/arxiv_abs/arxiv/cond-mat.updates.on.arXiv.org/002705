Symmetries play a central role in single-particle localization. Recent research focused on many-body
localized (MBL) systems, characterized by new kind of integrability, and by the area-law entanglement
of eigenstates. We investigate the effect of a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ symmetry on the dynamical properties
of a disordered Heisenberg chain. While $SU(2)$ symmetry is inconsistent with the conventional
MBL, a new non-ergodic regime is possible. In this regime, the eigenstates exhibit faster than area-law,
but still a strongly sub-thermal scaling of entanglement entropy. Using exact diagonalization,
we establish that this non-ergodic regime is indeed realized in the strongly disordered Heisenberg
chains. We use real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to construct approximate excited eigenstates,
and show their accuracy for systems of size up to $L=26$. As disorder strength is decreased, a crossover
to the thermalizing phase occurs. To establish the ultimate fate of the non-ergodic regime in the
thermodynamic limit, we develop a novel approach for describing many-body processes that are usually
neglected by RSRG, accessing systems of size $L>2000$. We characterize the resonances that arise
due to such processes, finding that they involve an ever growing number of spins as the system size
is increased. The probability of finding resonances grows with the system size. Even at strong disorder,
we can identify a large lengthscale beyond which resonances proliferate. Presumably, this eventually
would drive the system to a thermalizing phase. However, the extremely long thermalization time
scales indicate that a broad non-ergodic regime will be observable experimentally. Our study demonstrates
that symmetries control dynamical properties of disordered, many-body systems. The approach
introduced here provides a versatile tool for describing a broad range of disordered many-body
systems.
