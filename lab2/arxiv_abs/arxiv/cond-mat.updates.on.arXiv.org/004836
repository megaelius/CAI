We perform a unitary renormalization group (URG) study of the 1D fermionic Hubbard model. The formalism
generates a family of effective Hamiltonians and many-body eigenstates arranged holographically
across the tensor network from UV to IR. The URG is realized as a quantum circuit, leading to the entanglement
holographic mapping (EHM) tensor network description. A topological $\Theta$-term of the projected
Hilbert space of the degrees of freedom at the Fermi surface are shown to govern the nature of RG flow
towards either the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid or gapped quantum liquid phases. This results
in a nonperturbative version of the Berezenskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) RG phase diagram,
revealing a line of intermediate coupling stable fixed points, while the nature of RG flow around
the critical point is identical to that obtained from the weak-coupling RG analysis. This coincides
with a phase transition in the many-particle entanglement, as the entanglement entropy RG flow
shows distinct features for the critical and gapped phases depending on the value of the topological
$\Theta$-term. We demonstrate the Ryu-Takyanagi entropy bound for the many-body eigenstates
comprising the EHM network, concretizing the relation to the holographic duality principle. The
scaling of the entropy bound also distinguishes the gapped and gapless phases, implying the generation
of very different holographic spacetimes across the critical point. Finally, we treat the Fermi
surface as a quantum impurity coupled to the high energy electronic states. A thought-experiment
is devised in order to study entanglement entropy generated by isolating the impurity, and propose
ways by which to measure it by studying the quantum noise and higher order cumulants of the full counting
statistics.
