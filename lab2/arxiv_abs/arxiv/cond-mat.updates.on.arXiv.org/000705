For every physical model defined on a generic graph or factor graph, the Bethe $M$-layer construction
allows building a different model for which the Bethe approximation is exact in the large $M$ limit
and it coincides with the original model for $M=1$. The $1/M$ perturbative series is then expressed
by a diagrammatic loop expansion in terms of so-called fat-diagrams. Our motivation is to study
some important second-order phase transitions that do exist on the Bethe lattice but are either
qualitatively different or absent in the corresponding fully connected case. In this case the standard
approach based on a perturbative expansion around the naive mean field theory (essentially a fully
connected model) fails. On physical grounds, we expect that when the construction is applied to
a lattice in finite dimension there is a small region of the external parameters close to the Bethe
critical point where strong deviations from mean-field behavior will be observed. In this region,
the $1/M$ expansion for the corrections diverges and it can be the starting point for determining
the correct non-mean-field critical exponents using renormalization group arguments. In the
end, we will show that the critical series for the generic observable can be expressed as a sum of Feynman
diagrams with the same numerical prefactors of field theories. However, the contribution of a given
diagram is not evaluated associating Gaussian propagators to its lines as in field theories: one
has to consider the graph as a portion of the original lattice, replacing the internal lines with
appropriate one-dimensional chains, and attaching to the internal points the appropriate number
of infinite-size Bethe trees to restore the correct local connectivity of the original model.
