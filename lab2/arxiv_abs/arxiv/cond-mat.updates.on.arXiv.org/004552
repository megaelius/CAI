The effect of a lateral electric current on the photoluminescence H-band of an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure
is investigated. The photoluminescence intensity and optical orientation of electrons contributing
to the H-band are studied by means of continuous wave and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy
and time-resolved Kerr rotation. It is shown that the H-band is due to recombination of the heavy
holes localized at the heterointerface with photoexcited electrons attracted to the heterointerface
from the GaAs layer. Two lines with significantly different decay times constitute the H-band:
a short-lived high-energy one and a long-lived low-energy one. The high-energy line originates
from recombination of electrons freely moving along the structure plane, while the low-energy
one is due to recombination of donor-bound electrons near the interface. Application of the lateral
electric field of ~ 100-200 V/cm results in a quenching of both lines. This quenching is due to a decrease
of electron concentration near the heterointerface as a result of a photocurrent-induced heating
of electrons in the GaAs layer. On the contrary, electrons near the heterointerface are effectively
cooled, so the donors near the interface are not completely empty up to ~ 100 V/cm, which is in stark
contrast with the case of bulk materials. The optical spin polarization of the donor-bound electrons
near the heterointerface weakly depends on the electric field. Their polarization kinetics is
determined by the spin dephasing in the hyperfine fields of the lattice nuclei. The long spin memory
time (> 40 ns) can be associated with suppression of the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism of spin relaxation
for electrons.
