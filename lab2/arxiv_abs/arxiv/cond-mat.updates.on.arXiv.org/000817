It is very interesting to bring plasmonic circular dichroism spectroscopy to the mid-infrared
spectral interval, and there are two reasons for this. This spectral interval is very important
for thermal bio-imaging and, simultaneously, this spectral range includes vibrational lines
of many chiral biomolecules. Here we demonstrate that graphene plasmons indeed offer such opportunity.
In particular, we show that chiral graphene assemblies consisting of a few graphene nanodisks can
generate strong circular dichroism (CD) in the mid-infrared interval. The CD signal is generated
due to the plasmon-plasmon coupling between adjacent nanodisks in the specially designed chiral
graphene assemblies. Because of the large dimension mismatch between the thickness of a graphene
layer and the incoming light's wavelength, three-dimensional configurations with a total height
of a few hundred nanometers are necessary to obtain a strong CD signal in the mid-infrared range.
The mid-infrared CD strength is mainly governed by the total dimensions (total height and helix
scaffold radius) of the graphene nanodisk assembly, and by the plasmon-plasmon interaction strength
between its constitutive nanodisks. Both positive and negative CD bands can be observed in the graphene
assembly array. The frequency interval of the plasmonic CD spectra overlaps with the vibrational
modes of some important biomolecules, such as DNA and many different peptides, giving rise to the
possibility of enhancing the vibrational optical activity of these molecular species by attaching
them to the graphene assemblies. Simultaneously the spectral range of chiral mid-infrared plasmons
in our structures appears near the typical wavelength of the human-body thermal radiation and,
therefore, our chiral metastructures can be potentially utilized as optical components in thermal
imaging devices.
