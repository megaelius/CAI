A defining feature of topologically ordered states of matter is the existence of locally indistinguishable
states on spaces with non-trivial topology. These degenerate states form a representation of the
mapping class group (MCG) of the space, which is generated by braids of defects or anyons, and by Dehn
twists along non-contractible cycles. These operations can be viewed as fault-tolerant logical
gates in the context of topological quantum error correcting codes. Here we show that braids and
Dehn twists can in general be implemented by a constant depth quantum circuit, with a depth that is
independent of code distance $d$ and system size. The circuit consists of a constant depth local
quantum circuit (LQC) implementing a local geometry deformation of the quantum state, followed
by a permutation on (relabelling of) the qubits. We further show that (i) applying a given braid or
Dehn twist $k$ times can be achieved with $\mathcal{O}(\log k)$ time overhead, independent of code
distance and system size, which implies an exponential speedup for certain logical gate sequences
by trading space for time, and (ii) an arbitrary element of the MCG can be implemented by a constant
depth (independent of $d$) LQC followed by a permutation, where in this case the range of interactions
of the LQC grows with the number of generators in the presentation of the group element. Applying
these results to certain non-Abelian codes implies that a fault-tolerant universal gate set can
be achieved with constant time overhead by using a local quantum circuit together with qubit permutations.
This provides a factor of $d$ improvement over other approaches in the asymptotic scaling of space-time
overhead for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation.
