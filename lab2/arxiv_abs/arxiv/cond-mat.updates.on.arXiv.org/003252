The abundance of different species in a community often follows the log series distribution. Other
ecological patterns also have simple forms. Why does the complexity and variability of ecological
systems reduce to such simplicity? Common answers include maximum entropy, neutrality, and convergent
outcome from different underlying biological processes. This article proposes a more general
answer based on the concept of invariance, the property by which a pattern remains the same after
transformation. Invariance has a long tradition in physics. For example, general relativity emphasizes
the need for the equations describing the laws of physics to have the same form in all frames of reference.
By bringing this unifying invariance approach into ecology, one can see that the log series pattern
of species abundances dominates when the consequences of density dependent processes are invariant
to addition or multiplication. The lognormal pattern dominates when the total of the density independent
processes obeys rotational invariance (symmetry) with respect to the summing up of the individual
processes acting on abundance. Recognizing how these invariances connect pattern to process leads
to a synthesis of previous approaches. First, invariance provides a simpler and more fundamental
maximum entropy derivation of the log series distribution. Second, invariance provides a simple
derivation of the key result from neutral theory: the log series at the metacommunity scale and a
clearer form of the skewed lognormal at the local community scale. The invariance expressions of
those patterns are easy to understand because they uniquely describe the basic underlying components
that shape pattern.
