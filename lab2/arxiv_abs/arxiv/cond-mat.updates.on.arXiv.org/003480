The interplay between electronic correlations and topological protection may offer a rich avenue
for discovering emergent quantum phenomena in condensed matter. However, electronic correlations
have so far been little investigated in Weyl semimetals (WSMs) by experiments. Here, we report a
combined optical spectroscopy and theoretical calculation study on the strength of electronic
correlations in a kagome magnet Co3Sn2S2 and the influence of electronic correlations on its WSM
state expected within a single-particle picture. The electronic kinetic energy estimated from
our optical data is about half of that obtained from single-particle ab initio calculations, which
indicates intermediate-strength electronic correlations in this system. Furthermore, comparing
the energy ratios between the interband-transition peaks at high energies in the experimental
and single-particle-ab-initio-calculation derived optical conductivity spectra with the electronic
bandwidth renormalization factors obtained by many-body calculations enables us to estimate
the Coulomb-interaction strength (U ~ 4 eV) of electronic correlations in Co3Sn2S2. Our many-body
calculations with U ~ 4 eV show that a WSM state, which is characterized by bulk Weyl cones and surface
Fermi arcs, survives in this correlated electron system. More importantly, a sharp experimental
optical conductivity peak at low energy, which is absent in the single-particle-ab-initio-calculation-derived
optical conductivity spectrum but is consistent with the optical conductivity peaks obtained
by many-body calculations, indicates that an electronic band connecting the two Weyl cones is flattened
by electronic correlations and emerges near the Fermi energy in Co3Sn2S2. Our work not only provides
a paradigm for identifying WSM phase in correlated materials, but also paves the way for exploring
flat-band-generated quantum phenomena in WSMs.
