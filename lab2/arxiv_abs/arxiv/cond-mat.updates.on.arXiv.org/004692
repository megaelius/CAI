Higher superconducting critical temperature and large-area epsilon-near-zero interfaces are
two long-standing goals of Condensed Matter Physics and Optics. Motivated by the recent advancements
of experimental interests on metallic nanostructures, we have theoretically investigated some
selected bimetallic FCC combinations starting from large-area interface to embedded and doped
two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures. Using different first-principles techniques, encompassing
density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), phonon and DFT-coupled quantum
transport, we propose the prospects of some selective bimetallic nanostructures like Au/Ag and
Pt/Pd to exhibit exotic electronic phenomena. For 2D doped and embedded nanostructures of these
systems, non-trivial band-structure and Fermi-surface topology may be emblematic to the presence
of instabilities like charge density waves. We specifically highlight the optical attributes
extracted from the TDDFT calculations for these systems, where interfacial morphology induced
band-localization leads to near-zero behavior of both real and imaginary parts of the dynamical
dielectric response is observed in the ultra-violet to visible (UV-vis) optical range. Low-energy
intra-band plasmonic oscillations present for individual metallic surfaces are completely suppressed
for embedded and doped nanostructures. Phonon-dispersion of the model systems indicates the presence
of soft phonons and dynamical instabilities. Quantum transport calculations on simplest possible
device made out of these bimetallic systems reveals generation of highly transmitting pockets
over the cross-sectional area for some selected device geometry. We envisage that, if observed
experimentally, such systems may lead to many fascinating physics and applications in many diverse
fields ranging from condensed matter physics to optics or even more.
