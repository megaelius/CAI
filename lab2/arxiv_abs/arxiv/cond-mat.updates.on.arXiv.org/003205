SrTiO$_3$ is a model perovskite compound with unique properties and technological relevance.
At 105 K it undergoes a transition from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with characteristic antiferrodistortive
rotations of the TiO$_6$ octahedra. Here we study systematically the effect of different exchange
correlation functionals on the structural, electronic and optical properties of cubic and tetragonal
STO by comparing the recently implemented strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN)
meta-GGA functional with the generalized gradient approximation (PBE96 and PBEsol) and the hybrid
functional (HSE06). SCAN is found to significantly improve the description of the structural properties,
in particular the rotational angle of the tetragonal phase, comparable to HSE06 at a computational
cost similar to GGA. The addition of a Hubbard $U$-term (SCAN+$U$, $U=7.45$ eV) allows to achieve
the experimental band gap of 3.25 eV with a moderate increase in the lattice constant, whereas within
GGA+$U$ the gap is underestimated even for high $U$ values. The effect of the exchange-correlation
functional on the optical properties is progressively reduced from 1.5 eV variance in the onset
of the spectrum in the independent particle picture to 0.3 eV upon inclusion of many-body effects
within the framework of the $GW$ approximation (single-shot $G_0W_0$) and excitonic corrections
by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Moreover, a model BSE approach is shown to reproduce
the main features of the optical spectrum at a lower cost compared to $G_0W_0$+BSE. Strong excitonic
effects are found in agreement with previous results and their origin is analyzed based on the contributing
interband transitions. Last but not least, the effect of the tetragonal distortion on the optical
spectrum is discussed and compared to available experimental data.
