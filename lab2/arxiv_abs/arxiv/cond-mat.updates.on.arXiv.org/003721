The nonlinear Luttinger liquid phenomenology of one-dimensional correlated Fermi systems is
an attempt to describe the effect of the band curvature beyond the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid paradigm.
It relies on the observation that the dynamical structure factor of the interacting electron gas
shows a logarithmic threshold singularity when evaluated to first order perturbation theory in
the two-particle interaction. This term was interpreted as the linear one in an expansion which
was conjectured to resum to a power law. A field theory, the mobile impurity model, which is constructed
such that it provides the power law in the structure factor, was suggested to be the proper effective
model and used to compute the single-particle spectral function. This forms the basis of the nonlinear
Luttinger liquid phenomenology. Surprisingly, the second order perturbative contribution to
the structure factor was so far not studied. We first close this gap and show that it is consistent
with the conjectured power law. Secondly, we critically assess the steps leading to the mobile impurity
Hamiltonian. We show that the model does not allow to include the effect of the momentum dependence
of the (bulk) two-particle potential. This dependence was recently shown to spoil power laws in
the single-particle spectral function which previously were believed to be part of the Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquid universality. Although our second order results for the structure factor are consistent
with power-law scaling, this raises doubts that the conjectured nonlinear Luttinger liquid phenomenology
can be considered as universal. We conclude that more work is required to clarify this.
