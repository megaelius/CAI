We perform computational studies of jammed particle packings in two dimensions undergoing isotropic
compression using the well-characterized soft particle (SP) model and the deformable particle
(DP) model that we developed for compressed bubbles and emulsions. In the SP model, circular particles
are allowed to overlap, generating purely repulsive forces. In the DP model, particles minimize
their perimeter, while deforming at fixed area to avoid overlap during compression. We directly
compare the structural and mechanical properties of jammed particle packings generated using
the SP and DP models as a function of the true packing fraction $\rho$, instead of the reduced number
density $\phi$. We show that near jamming onset the excess contact number $\Delta z=z-z_J$ and shear
modulus ${\cal G}$ scale as $\Delta \rho^{0.5}$ in the large system limit for both the SP and DP models,
where $\Delta \rho = \rho-\rho_J$ and $z_J \approx 4$ and $\rho_J \approx 0.842$ are the values at
jamming onset. $\Delta z$ and ${\cal G}$ for the SP and DP models begin to differ for $\rho \gtrsim
0.88$. In this regime, $\Delta z \sim {\cal G}$ can be described by a sum of two power-laws in $\Delta
\rho$, i.e. $\Delta z \sim {\cal G} \sim C_0\Delta \rho^{0.5} +C_1\Delta \rho^{1.0}$ to lowest
order. We show that the ratio $C_1/C_0$ is much larger for the DP model compared to to that for the SP
model. We also characterize the void space in jammed packings as a function of $\rho$. We find that,
unlike the SP model, the DP model is able to describe the formation of Plateau borders as the system
approaches $\rho = 1$. We further show that the results for $z$ and the shape factor ${\cal A}$ versus
$\rho$ for the DP model agree with recent experimental studies of compressed foams and emulsions.
