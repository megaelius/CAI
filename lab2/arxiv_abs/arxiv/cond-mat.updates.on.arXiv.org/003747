We study the magnetic structure of the "stuffed" (Tb-rich) pyrochlore iridate Tb$_{2+x}$Ir$_{2-x}$O$_{7-y}$,
using resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS). In order to disentangle contributions from Tb
and Ir magnetic sublattices, experiments were performed at the Ir $L_3$ and Tb $M_5$ edges, which
provide selective sensitivity to Ir $5d$ and Tb $4f$ magnetic moments, respectively. At the Ir $L_3$
edge, we found the onset of long-range ${\bf k}={\bf 0}$ magnetic order below $T_{N}^\text{Ir}\sim$
71 K, consistent with the expected signal of all-in all-out (AIAO) magnetic order. Using a single-ion
model to calculate REXS cross-sections, we estimate an ordered magnetic moment of $\mu_{5d}^{\text{Ir}}
\approx 0.34(3)\,\mu_B$ at 5 K. At the Tb $M_5$ edge, long-range ${\bf k}={\bf 0}$ magnetic order
appeared below $\sim40$ K, also consistent with an AIAO magnetic structure on the Tb site. Additional
insight into the magnetism of the Tb sublattice is gleaned from measurements at the $M_5$ edge in
applied magnetic fields up to 6 T, which is found to completely suppress the Tb AIAO magnetic order.
In zero applied field, the observed gradual onset of the Tb sublattice magnetisation with temperature
suggests that it is induced by the magnetic order on the Ir site. The persistence of AIAO magnetic
order, despite the greatly reduced ordering temperature and moment size compared to stoichiometric
Tb$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$, for which $T_{N}^{\text{Ir}} =130$ K and $\mu_{5d}^{\text{Ir}}=0.56\,\mu_B$,
indicates that stuffing could be a viable means of tuning the strength of electronic correlations,
thereby potentially offering a new strategy to achieve topologically non-trivial band crossings
in pyrochlore iridates.
