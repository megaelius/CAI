Coalescence of tiny-sized particles into large-sized particles has been an overlooked phenomenon
for a long time. This study focuses on the development of gold particles under varying precursor
concentration in a custom-built setup. Under the tuned ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time, tiny
particles of different sizes and shapes develop depending on the amount of gold precursor. Packets
of nano-energy bind gold atoms in their own shape when their ordering at solution surface is in a compact
monolayer assembly. Between 0.07 mM to 0.90 mM precursor concentration, tiny particles develop
both in triangular shape as well as non-triangular shape. Tiny particles of triangular shape develop
in a large number at precursor concentration 0.30 mM and 0.60 mM. Hence, nanoparticles and particles
also developed in different geometrical shapes. Under the application of force exertion in surface
format and prior to develop anisotropic particles, joined triangular-shaped tiny particles separated
into two triangle-shaped tiny particles. Prior to assembling under exerting force in immersing
format, atoms of 1D-array of such tiny particles elongate to form structures of smooth elements
at electronically flat solution surface. Tiny particles of non-geometrical shapes do not assemble
at common point and their assembling develops a distorted particle. This occurs when precursor
concentration is 0.05 mM and 1.20 mM. An anisotropic particle has structure different to that of
the distorted one. At 50 sccm Argon flow rate, particles developed in the same shapes as in the case
of 100 sccm. Different colors of solutions indicate different elongation rates of atoms, forming
structures of smooth elements. This study clarifies the necessary concentration of precursor
to develop particles of different sizes and shapes.
