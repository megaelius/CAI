We present an optimization study of the spin sensitivity of nanoSQUIDs based on resistively shunted
grain boundary Josephson junctions. In addition the dc SQUIDs contain a narrow constriction onto
which a small magnetic particle can be placed (with its magnetic moment in the plane of the SQUID loop
and perpendicular to the grain boundary) for efficient coupling of its stray magnetic field to the
SQUID loop. The separation of the location of optimum coupling from the junctions allows for an independent
optimization of the coupling factor $\phi_\mu$ and junction properties. We present different
methods for calculating $\phi_\mu$ (for a magnetic nanoparticle placed 10\,nm above the constriction)
as a function of device geometry and show that those yield consistent results. Furthermore, by numerical
simulations we obtain a general expression for the dependence of the SQUID inductance on geometrical
parameters of our devices, which allows to estimate their impact on the spectral density of flux
noise $S_\Phi$ of the SQUIDs in the thermal white noise regime. Our analysis of the dependence of
$S_\Phi$ and $\phi_\mu$ on the geometric parameters of the SQUID layout yields a spin sensitivity
$S_\mu^{1/2}=S_\Phi^{1/2}/\phi_\mu$ of a few $\mu_{\rm{B}}/\rm{Hz^{1/2}}$ ($\mu_B$ is the
Bohr magneton) for optimized parameters, respecting technological constraints. However, by
comparison with experimentally realized devices we find significantly larger values for the measured
white flux noise, as compared to our theoretical predictions. Still, a spin sensitivity on the order
of $10\,\mu_{\rm B}/\rm{Hz^{1/2}}$ for optimized devices seems to be realistic.
