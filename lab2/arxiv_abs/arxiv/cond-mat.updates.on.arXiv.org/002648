Recent tunneling conductance measurements on semiconductor-superconductor nanowires find
zero-bias peaks to be ubiquitous across wide ranges of chemical potential and Zeeman energy. Motivated
by this, we demonstrate that topologically-trivial Andreev abound states (ABSs) pinned near zero
energy are produced rather generically in inhomogeneous systems with multi-band occupancy in
the presence of inter-band coupling. We first investigate the inter-band coupling mechanism responsible
for the pinning within a multi-band 1D toy model, then we confirm the findings using a 3D Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson
approach that incorporates the geometric and electrostatic details of the actual device. Our analysis
shows that level-repulsion generated by inter-band coupling can lead to a rather spectacular pinning
of the lowest-energy mode near zero energy in systems (or regions) characterized by very-short
length scales ($\sim100~$nm).We show that level repulsion between the lowest energy levels can
mimic the gap opening feature (simultaneous with the emergence of a near-zero energy mode) predicted
to occur in Majorana hybrid systems. We also demonstrate that nearly-zero bias differential conductance
features exhibiting particle-hole asymmetry are due to the presence of (topologically-trivial)
ABSs pinned near zero-energy by level repulsion, not to Majorana zero modes, quasi-Majoranas,
or any other low-energy mode that involves (partially) separated Majorana bound states. Our findings
demonstrate the importance of understanding in detail multi-band physics and electrostatic effects
in the context of the ongoing search for Majorana modes in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures.
