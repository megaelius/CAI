We describe optical characterisation of a Strained Silicon Cold Electron Bolometer (CEB), operating
on a $350~\mathrm{mK}$ stage, designed for absorption of millimetre-wave radiation. The silicon
Cold Electron Bolometer utilises Schottky contacts between a superconductor and an n++ doped silicon
island to detect changes in the temperature of the charge carriers in the silicon, due to variations
in absorbed radiation. By using strained silicon as the absorber, we decrease the electron-phonon
coupling in the device and increase the responsivity to incoming power. The strained silicon absorber
is coupled to a planar aluminium twin-slot antenna designed to couple to $160~\mathrm{GHz}$ and
that serves as the superconducting contacts. From the measured optical responsivity and spectral
response, we calculate a maximum optical efficiency of $50~\%$ for radiation coupled into the device
by the planar antenna and an overall noise equivalent power (NEP), referred to absorbed optical
power, of $1.1 \times 10^{-16}~\mathrm{\mbox{W Hz}^{-1/2}}$ when the detector is observing a
$300~\mathrm{K}$ source through a $4~\mathrm{K}$ throughput limiting aperture. Even though
this optical system is not optimised we measure a system noise equivalent temperature difference
(NETD) of $6~\mathrm{\mbox{mK Hz}^{-1/2}}$. We measure the noise of the device using a cross-correlation
of time stream data measured simultaneously with two junction field-effect transistor (JFET)
amplifiers, with a base correlated noise level of $300~\mathrm{\mbox{pV Hz}^{-1/2}}$ and find
that the total noise is consistent with a combination of photon noise, current shot noise and electron-phonon
thermal noise.
