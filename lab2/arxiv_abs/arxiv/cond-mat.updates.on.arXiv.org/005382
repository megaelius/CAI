The periodically driven O(N) model is studied near the critical line separating a disordered paramagnetic
phase from a period doubled phase, the latter being an example of a Floquet time crystal. The time
evolution of one-point and two-point correlation functions are obtained within the Gaussian approximation
and perturbatively in the drive amplitude. The correlations are found to show not only period doubling,
but also power-law decays at large spatial distances. These features are compared with the undriven
O(N) model in the vicinity of the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic critical point. The algebraic decays
in space are found to be qualitatively different in the driven and the undriven cases. In particular,
the spatio-temporal order of the Floquet time crystal leads to position-momentum and momentum-momentum
correlation functions which are more long-ranged in the driven than in the undriven model. The light-cone
dynamics associated with the correlation functions is also qualitatively different as the critical
line of the Floquet time crystal shows a light-cone with two distinct velocities, with the ratio
of the two velocities scaling as the square-root of the dimensionless drive amplitude. The Floquet
unitary, which describes the time evolution due to a complete cycle of the drive, is constructed
for modes with small momenta compared to the drive frequency, but having a generic relationship
with the square-root of the drive amplitude. At intermediate momenta, which are large compared
to the square-root of the drive amplitude, the Floquet unitary is found to simply rotate the modes.
On the other hand, at momenta which are small compared to the square-root of the drive amplitude,
the Floquet unitary is found to primarily squeeze the modes, to an extent which increases upon increasing
the wavelength of the modes, with a power-law dependence on it.
