The observation of vortices in superconductors was a major breakthrough in developing the conceptual
background for superconducting applications. Each vortex carries a flux quantum, and the magnetic
field radially decreases from the center. Techniques used to make magnetic field maps, such as magnetic
decoration, give vortex lattice images in a variety of systems. However, strong type II superconductors
allow penetration of the magnetic field over large distances, of order of the magnetic penetration
depth \lambda. Superconductivity survives up to magnetic fields where, for imaging purposes,
there is nearly no magnetic contrast. Static and dynamic properties of vortices are largely unknown
at such high magnetic fields. Reciprocal space studies using neutron scattering give insight into
the collective behavior. But the microscopic details of vortex arrangements and their motion remain
difficult to obtain. Direct real space visualization can be made using scanning tunneling microscopy
and spectroscopy (STM/S). Instead of using magnetic contrast, the electronic density of states
describes spatial variations of the quasiparticle and pair wavefunction properties. These are
of order of the superconducting coherence length \xi, which is much smaller than \lambda. In principle,
individual vortices can be imaged using STM up to the upper critical field where vortex cores, of
size \xi, overlap. In this review, we describe recent advances in vortex imaging made with scanning
tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We introduce the technique and discuss vortex images which
reveal the influence of the Fermi surface distribution of the superconducting gap on the internal
structure of vortices, the collective behavior of the lattice in different materials and conditions,
and the observation of vortex lattice melting.
