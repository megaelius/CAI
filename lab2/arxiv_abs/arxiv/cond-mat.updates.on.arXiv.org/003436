We demonstrate several explicit duality mappings between elasticity of two-dimensional crystals
and fracton tensor gauge theories, expanding on recent works by two of the present authors. We begin
by dualizing the quantum elasticity theory of an ordinary commensurate crystal, which maps directly
onto a fracton tensor gauge theory, in a natural tensor analogue of the conventional particle-vortex
duality transformation of a superfluid. The transverse and longitudinal phonons of a crystal map
onto the two gapless gauge modes of the tensor gauge theory, while the topological lattice defects
map onto the gauge charges, with disclinations corresponding to isolated fractons and dislocations
corresponding to dipoles of fractons. We use the classical limit of this duality to make new predictions
for the finite-temperature phase diagram of fracton models, and provide a simpler derivation of
the Halperin-Nelson-Young theory of thermal melting of two-dimensional solids. We extend this
duality to incorporate bosonic statistics, which is necessary for a description of the quantum
melting transitions. We thereby derive a hybrid vector-tensor gauge theory which describes a supersolid
phase, hosting both crystalline and superfluid orders. The structure of this gauge theory puts
constraints on the quantum phase diagram of bosons, and also leads to the concept of symmetry enriched
fracton order. We formulate the extension of these dualities to systems breaking time-reversal
symmetry. We also discuss the broader implications of these dualities, such as a possible connection
between fracton phases and the study of interacting topological crystalline insulators.
