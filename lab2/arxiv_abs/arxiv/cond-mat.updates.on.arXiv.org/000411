Observing constituent particles with fractional quantum numbers in confined and deconfined states
is an interesting and challenging problem in quantum many-body physics. Here we further explore
a computational scheme [Y. Tang and A. W. Sandvik, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 107}, 157201 (2011)] based
on valence-bond quantum Monte Carlo simulations of quantum spin systems. Using several different
one-dimensional models, we characterize $S=1/2$ spinon excitations using the spinon size and
confinement length (the size of a bound state). The spinons have finite size in valence-bond-solid
states, infinite size in the critical region, and become ill-defined in the N\'eel state. We also
verify that pairs of spinons are deconfined in these uniform spin chains but become confined upon
introducing a pattern of alternating coupling strengths (dimerization) or coupling two chains
(forming a ladder). In the dimerized system an individual spinon can be small when the confinement
length is large---this is the case when the imposed dimerization is weak but the ground state of the
corresponding uniform chain is a spontaneously formed valence-bond-solid (where the spinons
are deconfined). Based on our numerical results, we argue that the situation $\lambda \ll \Lambda$
is associated with weak repulsive short-range spinon-spinon interactions. In principle both
the length-scales can be individually tuned from small to infinite (with $\lambda \le \Lambda$)
by varying model parameters. In the ladder system the two lengths are always similar, and this is
the case also in the dimerized systems when the corresponding uniform chain is in the critical phase.
In these systems the effective spinon-spinon interactions are purely attractive and there is only
a single large length scale close to criticality, which is reflected in the standard spin correlations
as well as in the spinon characteristics.
