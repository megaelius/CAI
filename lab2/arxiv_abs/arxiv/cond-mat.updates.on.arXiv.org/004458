Exciton dynamics can be strongly affected by lattice vibrations through electron-phonon (e-ph)
coupling, which can be described by the formation of exciton-polarons -- composite quasiparticles
with excitons dressed by a cloud of polar phonons. The recently discovered 2D magnetic semiconductor,
$\mathrm{CrI_3}$, provides a new platform to explore exciton physics beyond the well-studied
2D transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors because of its localized orbitals and intrinsic
long-range magnetic order. However, the nature of excitons as well as the roles of magnetic ordering
and e-ph coupling in the exciton dynamics remain elusive in 2D $\mathrm{CrI_3}$. Here in bilayer
$\mathrm{CrI_3}$, we first performed temperature-dependent photoluminescence and linear absorption
measurements to show the presence of strong e-ph coupling. We then carried out careful temperature
and magnetic field-dependent resonant micro-Raman spectroscopy measurements and discovered
a rare Raman feature of periodic broad modes up to as high as the $8^{th}$ order, providing direct
evidence of the polaronic character of excitons. We establish that the formation of polarons in
$\mathrm{CrI_3}$ is dominated by the strong Fr\"{o}hlich interactions between the bright exciton
at $\sim$1.96 eV and a longitudinal optical phonon at 120 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. We further show that
the emergence of long-range magnetic order below $T_C$ = 45 K enhances the e-ph coupling and that
the transition from layered antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order across $B_C$ = 0.7 T tunes
the polaron spectra, suggesting a strong coupling among the lattice, charge and spin degrees of
freedom in 2D $\mathrm{CrI_3}$. Our study opens up new avenues for tailoring light-matter interactions
in 2D semiconductors with long-range orders and strong correlations.
