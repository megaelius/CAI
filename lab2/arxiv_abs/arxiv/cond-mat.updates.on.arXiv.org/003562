Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac cone materials exhibit linear energy dispersion at the Fermi level,
where the effective masses of carriers are very close to zero and the Fermi velocity is ultrahigh,
only 2 ~ 3 orders of magnitude lower than the light velocity. Such the Dirac cone materials have great
promise in high-performance electronic devices. Herein, we have employed the genetic algorithms
methods combining with first-principles calculations to propose a new 2D anisotropic Dirac cone
material, that is, orthorhombic boron phosphide (BP) monolayer named as borophosphene. Molecular
dynamics simulation and phonon dispersion have been used to evaluate the dynamic and thermal stability
of borophosphene. Because of the unique arrangements of B-B and P-P dimers, the mechanical and electronic
properties are highly anisotropic. Of great interest is that the Dirac cone of the borophosphene
is robust, independent of in-plane biaxial and uniaxial strains, and can also be observed in its
one-dimensional (1D) zigzag nanoribbons and armchair nanotubes. The Fermi velocities are ~ 105
m/s, the same order of magnitude with that of graphene. By using a tight-binding model, the origin
of the Dirac cone of borophosphene is analyzed. Moreover, a unique feature of self-doping can be
induced by the in-plane biaxial and uniaxial strains of borophosphene and the Curvature effect
of nanotubes, which is great beneficial to realizing high speed carriers (holes). Our results suggest
that the borophosphene holds a great promise in high-performance electronic devices, which could
promote the experimental and theoretical studies to further explore the potential applications
of other 2D Dirac cone sheets.
