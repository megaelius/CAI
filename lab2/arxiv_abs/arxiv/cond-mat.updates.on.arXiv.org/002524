We demonstrate how the boundary-driven reconstruction of the superconducting order parameter
can be employed to manipulate the zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBSs) occurring in a topological
Josephson junction. We focus on an interface of two p-wave superconductors, which are described
by a spin-vector order parameter $\bf{d}$. Apart from the sensitivity of $\bf{d}$ to external Zeeman/exchange
fields, here, we show that the orientation of $\bf{d}$ throughout the junction can be controlled
by electrically gating the weak link. The remarkable local character of this knob is a manifestation
of the edge reconstruction of the order parameter, which takes place whenever different $\bf{d}$-vector
configurations in each superconductor compete and are close in energy. As a consequence, the spin-dependent
superconducting-phase difference across the junction is switchable from $0$ to $\pi$. Moreover,
in the regime where multiple edge MBSs occur for each superconductor, the Andreev-bound-state
(ABS) spectra can be twisted by the application of either a charge- or spin-phase difference across
the interface, and give rise to a rich diversity of nonstandard ABS dispersions. Interestingly,
some of these dispersions show band crossings protected by fermion parity, despite their $2\pi$-periodic
character. These crossings additionally unlock the possibility of nontrivial topology in synthetic
spaces, when considering networks of such 1D junctions. Lastly, the interface MBSs induce a distinct
elecronic spin polarization near the junction, which possesses a characteristic spatial pattern
that allows the detection of MBSs using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. These findings
unveil novel paths to mechanisms for ABS engineering and single-out signatures relevant for the
experimental detection and manipulation of MBSs.
