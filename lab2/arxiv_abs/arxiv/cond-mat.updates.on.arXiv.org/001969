The layered {\beta}-NaMnO2, a promising Na-ion energy-storage material has been investigated
for its triangular lattice capability to promote complex magnetic configurations that may release
symmetry restrictions for the coexistence of ferroelectric and magnetic orders. The complexity
of the neutron powder diffraction patterns underlines that the routinely adopted commensurate
structural models are inadequate. Instead, a single-phase superspace symmetry description is
necessary, demonstrating that the material crystallizes in a compositionally modulated q= (0.077(1),
0, 0) structure. Here, Mn3+ Jahn-Teller distorted MnO6 octahedra form corrugated layer stacking
sequences of the {\beta}-NaMnO2 type, which are interrupted by flat sheets of the {\alpha}-like
oxygen topology. Spontaneous long-range collinear antiferromagnetic order, defined by the propagation
vector k= (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), appears below TN1= 200 K. Moreover, a second transition into a spatially
modulated proper-screw magnetic state (k+-q) is established at TN2= 95 K, with an antiferromagnetic
order parameter resembling that of a two-dimensional (2D) system. The evolution of 23Na NMR spin-lattice
relaxation identifies a magnetically inhomogene-ous state in the intermediate T-region (TN2
<T< TN1), while its strong suppression below TN2 indicates that a spin-gap opens in the excitation
spectrum. High-resolution neutron inelastic scattering confirms that the magnetic dynamics
are indeed gapped ({\Delta}~5 meV) in the low-temperature magnetic phase, while simulations on
the basis of the single-mode approximation suggest that Mn-spins residing on ad-jacent antiferromagnetic
chains, establish sizable 2D correlations. Our analysis points that novel struc-tural degrees
of freedom promote, cooperative magnetism and emerging dielectric properties in this non-perovskite-type
of manganite.
