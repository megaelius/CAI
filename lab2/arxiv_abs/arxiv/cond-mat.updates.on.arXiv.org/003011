Inspired by recent experiments showing a minimum of electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR/EPR)
line width as a function of inverse temperature, we studied the motional narrowing effect by considering
a combined model of carrier transitions and static dispersion of the angular frequency giving rise
to an inhomogeneous broadening in the spectrum. The dispersion of the angular frequency results
from the distribution of the local field. The transition between the sites under inhomogeneous
static local field induces adiabatic relaxation of the spin. We also considered the on-site inherent
(nonadiabatic) relaxation of the spin. We obtained the exact solution of the spin correlation function
by explicitly considering transitions between two sites for both Markovian and non-Markovian
transition processes. The absorption line shape is expressed in terms of the Voigt function, which
is a convolution of a Gaussian function and a Lorentzian function. Using the known properties of
the Voigt function, we discuss the correlation between the change in the full-width at half-maximum
and the change in line shape, both of which are induced by motional narrowing. By assuming thermal
activation processes for both the hopping transition and the on-site inherent relaxation, we show
that the minimum of the width appears as a function of inverse temperature as observed experimentally
in organic materials.Contrary to the general belief, we also show that the narrowing of the Gaussian
line shape under a local random field did not necessarily lead to a Lorentzian line shape in particular
under the presence of heavy tail property in the waiting time distribution of hopping transitions.
