The physical behavior of glass-forming liquids presents complex features of both dynamic and thermodynamic
nature. Some studies indicate the presence of thermodynamic anomalies and of crossovers in the
dynamic properties, but their origin and degree of universality is difficult to assess. Moreover,
conventional simulations are barely able to cover the range of temperatures at which these crossovers
usually occur. To address these issues, we simulate the Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones mixture using
efficient protocols based on multi-CPU and multi-GPU parallel tempering. Our setup enables us
to probe the thermodynamics and dynamics of the liquid at equilibrium well below the critical temperature
of mode-coupling theory, $T_{\rm MCT} = 0.435$. We find that below $T=0.4$ the analysis is hampered
by partial crystallization of the metastable liquid, which nucleates extended regions populated
by large particles arranged in an fcc structure. By filtering out crystalline samples, we reveal
that the specific heat grows in a regular manner down to $T=0.38$. Possible thermodynamic anomalies
suggested by previous studies can thus occur only in a region of the phase diagram where the system
is highly metastable. Using the equilibrium configurations obtained from the parallel tempering
simulations, we perform molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations to probe the equilibrium
dynamics down to $T=0.4$. A temperature-derivative analysis of the relaxation time and diffusion
data allows us to assess different dynamic scenarios around $T_{\rm MCT}$. Hints of a dynamic crossover
come from analysis of the four-point dynamic susceptibility. Finally, we discuss possible future
numerical strategies to clarify the nature of crossover phenomena in glass-forming liquids.
