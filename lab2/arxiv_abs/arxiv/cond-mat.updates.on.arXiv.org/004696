Motivated by the rising importance of understanding various competing mechanisms to current-induced
torque in complex magnets, we develop a unified theory of current-induced spin-orbital coupled
dynamics, which tracks the transfer of angular momentum between different degrees of freedom in
solids: spin and orbital of the electron, lattice, and local magnetic moment. From the continuity
equations for the spin and orbital angular momenta, we derive equations of motion that relate spin
and orbital current fluxes and torques describing the transfer of angular momentum between different
degrees of freedom, in a steady state under an external electric field. We apply our formalism to
two different magnetic bilayers, Fe/W(110) and Ni/W(110), where the orbital and spin Hall effects
in W have opposite sign and the resulting spin- and orbital-mediated torques can compete with each
other. We find that while the torque arising from the spin Hall effect of W is the dominant mechanism
of the current-induced torque in Fe/W(110), the dominant mechanism in Ni/W(110) is the orbital
torque originating in the orbital Hall effect of W. It leads to negative and positive effective spin
Hall angles, respectively, which can be directly identified in experiments. This clearly demonstrates
that our formalism is ideal for studying the angular momentum transfer dynamics in spin-orbit coupled
systems as it goes beyond the "spin current picture" by incorporating the spin and orbital degrees
of freedom on an equal footing. Our calculation reveals that, in addition to the spin and orbital
torque, other contributions such as the interfacial torque and self-induced anomalous torque
within the ferromagnet are not negligible in both material. We propose a classification scheme
for the mechanisms of current-induced torque in magnetic bilayers and discuss experimental implications
of our findings.
