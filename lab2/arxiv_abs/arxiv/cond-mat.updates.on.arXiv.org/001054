Entanglement entropy is now widely accepted as having deep connections with quantum gravity. It
is therefore desirable to understand it in the context of causal sets, especially since they provide
in a natural manner the UV cutoff needed to render entanglement entropy finite. Formulating a notion
of entanglement entropy in a causal set is not straightforward because the type of canonical hypersurface-data
on which its definition typically relies is not available. Instead, we appeal to the more global
expression given in arXiv:1205.2953 which, for a gaussian scalar field, expresses the entropy
of a spacetime region in terms of the field's correlation function within that region (its "Wightman
function" $W(x,x')$). Carrying this formula over to the causal set, one obtains an entropy which
is both finite and of a Lorentz invariant nature. We evaluate this global entropy-expression numerically
for certain regions (primarily order-intervals or "causal diamonds") within causal sets of 1+1
dimensions. For the causal-set counterpart of the entanglement entropy, we obtain, in the first
instance, a result that follows a (spacetime) volume law instead of the expected (spatial) area
law. We find, however, that one obtains an area law if one truncates the commutator function ("Pauli-Jordan
operator") and the Wightman function by projecting out the eigenmodes of the Pauli-Jordan operator
whose eigenvalues are too close to zero according to a geometrical criterion which we describe more
fully below. In connection with these results and the questions they raise, we also study the "entropy
of coarse-graining" generated by thinning out the causal set, and we compare it with what one obtains
by similarly thinning out a chain of harmonic oscillators, finding the same, "universal" behaviour
in both cases.
