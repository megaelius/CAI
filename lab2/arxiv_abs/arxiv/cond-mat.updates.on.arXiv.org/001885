We formulate and study the general boundary conditions dictating the magnetization profile in
the vicinity of an interface between magnets with different properties. Boundary twists in the
vicinity of an edge due to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions have been first discussed in [Wilson
et al., Phys. Rev. B 88, 214420 (2013)] and in [Rohart and Thiaville, Phys. Rev. B 88, 184422 (2013)].
A recent work [K. M. D. Hals and K. Everschor-Sitte, Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 127203 (2017)] has shown
that boundary conditions at the edge of a chiral magnets require the consideration of the full rank-3
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya tensor. Here we show that the rank-3 Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya tensor is necessary
to describe the behavior of magnetization in the vicinity of interface separating materials with
different properties. We show that in general case the boundary conditions lead to the magnetization
profile interpolating between the N\'eel- and Bloch-type twists. We further explore how such twists
can be utilized for creation of skyrmions and antiskyrmions, e.g., in a view of magnetic memory applications.
To this end, we study various scenarios how skyrmions and antiskyrmions can be created from interface
magnetization twists due to local instabilities. We also show that a judicious choice of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
tensor (hence a carefully designed material) can lead to local instabilities generating certain
types of skyrmions or antiskyrmions. The local instabilities are shown to appear in solutions of
the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations describing ellipticity of magnon modes bound to interfaces.
In one considered scenario, a skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair can be created due to instabilities at
an interface between materials with properly engineered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions.
We use micromagnetics simulations to confirm our analytical predictions.
