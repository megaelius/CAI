Some ABX3 perovskites exhibit different local environments (DLE) for the same B atoms in the lattice,
an effect referred to as disproportionation, distinguishing such compounds from perovskites
that have single local environments (SLE). The basic phenomenology of disproportionation involves
the absence of B-atom charge ordering, the creation of different B-X bond length for different local
environments, the appearance of metal (in SLE) to insulator (in DLE) transition, and the formation
of ligand holes. We point out that this phenomenology is common to a broad range of chemical bonding
patterns in ABX3 compounds, either with s-p electron B-metal cations (BaBiO3, CsTlF3), or noble
metal cation (CsAuCl3), as well as d-electron cations (SmNiO3, CaFeO3). We show that underlying
much of this phenomenology is the self-regulating response, whereby in strongly bonded metal-ligand
systems with high lying ligand orbitals, the system protects itself from creating highly charged
cations by transferring ligand electrons to the metal, thus preserving a nearly constant metal
charge in DLE, while creating B-ligand bond alternation and ligand-like conduction band (ligand
hole). We are asking what are the minimal theory ingredients needed to explain the main features
of this SLE-to-DLE phenomenology, such as its energetic driving force, bond length changes, possible
modifications in charge density and density of state changes. Using as a guide the lowering of the
total energy in DLE relative to SLE, we show that density functional calculations describe this
phenomenology across the whole chemical bonding range without resort to special strong correlation
effects, beyond what DFT naturally contains. In particular, lower total energy configurations
(DLE) naturally develop bond alternation, gaping of the metallic SLE state, and absence of charge
ordering with ligand hole formation.
