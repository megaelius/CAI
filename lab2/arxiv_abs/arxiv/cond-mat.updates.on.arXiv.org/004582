A system of confined charged electrons interacting via the long-range Coulomb force can form a Wigner
crystal due to their mutual repulsion. This happens when the potential energy of the system dominates
over its kinetic energy, i.e., at low temperatures for a classical system and at low densities for
a quantum one. At $T=0$, the system is governed by quantum mechanics, and hence, the spatial density
peaks associated with crystalline charge localization are sharpened for a lower average density.
Conversely, in the classical limit of high temperatures, the crystalline spatial density peaks
are suppressed (recovered) at a lower (higher) average density. In this paper, we study those two
limits separately using an exact diagonalization of small one-dimensional (1D) systems containing
few ($<10$) electrons and propose an approximate method to connect them into a unified effective
phase diagram for Wigner few-electron crystallization. The result is a qualitative quantum-classical
crossover phase diagram of an effective 1D Wigner crystal. We show that the spatial density peaks
associated with the quasi-crystallization should be experimentally observable in a few-electron
1D system. We find that the effective crystalline structure slowly disappears with both the crossover
average density and crossover temperature for crystallization decreasing with increasing particle
number, consistent with the absence of any true long-range 1D order. In fact, one peculiar aspect
of the effective finite-size nature of 1D Wigner crystallization we find is that even a short-range
interaction would lead to a finite-size 1D crystal, except that the crystalline order vanishes
much faster with increasing system size in the short-range interacting system compared with the
long-range interacting one.
