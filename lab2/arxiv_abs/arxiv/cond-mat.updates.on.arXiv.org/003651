With the rapid advent of biomedical and biotechnological innovations, a deep understanding of
the nature of interaction between nanomaterials and cell membranes, tissues, and organs, has become
increasingly important. Active penetration of nanoparticles through cell membranes is a fascinating
phenomenon that may have important implications in various biomedical and clinical applications.
Using a fully analytical theory supplemented by particle-based computer simulations, the penetration
process of an active particle through a planar two-dimensional elastic membrane is studied. The
membrane is modeled as a self-assembled sheet of particles, uniformly arranged on a square lattice.
A coarse-grained model is introduced to describe the mutual interactions between the membrane
particles. The active penetrating particle is assumed to interact sterically with the membrane
particles. State diagrams are presented to fully characterize the system behavior as functions
of the relevant control parameters governing the transition between different dynamical states.
Three distinct scenarios are identified. These compromise trapping of the active particle, penetration
through the membrane with subsequent self-healing, in addition to penetration with permanent
disruption of the membrane. The latter scenario is accompanied by a partial fragmentation of the
membrane and creation of a hole of a size exceeding the interaction range of the membrane components.
Our analytical theory is based on a combination of a perturbative expansion technique and a discrete-to-continuum
formulation. Our approach might be helpful for the prediction of the transition threshold between
the trapping and penetration in real-space experiments involving motile swimming bacteria or
artificial active particles.
