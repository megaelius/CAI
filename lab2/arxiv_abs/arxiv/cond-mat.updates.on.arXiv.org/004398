The antiferromagnetic topological insulator has attracted lots of attention recently, as its
intrinsic magnetism and topological property makes it a potential material to realize the quantum
anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) at relative high temperature. Until now, only MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is predicted
and grown successfully. The other MB$_2$T$_4$-family materials predicted (MB$_2$T$_4$:M=transition-metal
or rare-earth element, B=Bi or Sb, T=Te, Se, or S) with not only antiferromagnetic topological property
but also rich and exotic topological quantum states and dynamically stable (or metastable) structure
have not been realized on experiment completely. Here, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ single crystals have been
grown successfully and tested. It shows typical antiferromagnetic character, with Neel temperature
of 24.5K and a spin-flop transition at H$\thickapprox$35000 Oe, 1.8K. After obtaining MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
single crystals, we have tried to synthesize the other members of MB$_2$T$_4$-family materials,
but things are not going so well. Then it inspires us to discuss the growth mechanism of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$.
The growth mode may be the layer-inserting growth mode based on symmetry, which is supported by our
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. The XPS measurement combing with the $Ar^+$
ion sputtering is done to investigate the chemical state of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Binding energies (BE)
of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-related contributions to Mn2p and Te3d spectra agree well with those of inserting
material $\alpha$-MnTe. Rising intensity of the Mn2p satellite for divalent Mn (bound to chalcogen)
with atomic number of ligand (from MnO to MnBi$_2$Te$_4$) has been observed, thus suggesting classification
of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as the charge-transfer compound. Understanding the growth mode of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
can help us to grow the other members of MB$_2$T$_4$-family materials.
