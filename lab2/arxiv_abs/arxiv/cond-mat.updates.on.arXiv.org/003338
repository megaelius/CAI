Topological states of matter are, generally, quantum liquids of conserved topological defects.
We establish this by constructing and analyzing topological field theories which introduce gauge
fields to describe the dynamics of singularities in the original field configurations. Homotopy
groups are utilized to identify topologically protected singularities, and the conservation
of their protected number is captured by a topological action term that unambiguously obtains from
the given set of symmetries. Stable phases of these theories include quantum liquids with emergent
massless Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields, as well as topological orders with long-range quantum
entanglement, fractional excitations, boundary modes and unconventional responses to external
perturbations. This paper focuses on the derivation of topological field theories and basic phenomenological
characterization of topological orders associated with homotopy groups $\pi_n(S^n)$, $n\ge
1$. These homotopies govern monopole and hedgehog topological defects in $d=n+1$ dimensions,
and enable the generalization of both weakly-interacting and fractional quantum Hall liquids
of vortices to $d>2$. Hedgehogs have not been in the spotlight so far, but they are particularly important
defects of magnetic moments because they can be stimulated in realistic systems with spin-orbit
coupling, such as chiral magnets and $d=3$ topological materials. We predict novel topological
orders in systems with U(1)$\times$Spin($d$) symmetry in which fractional electric charge attaches
to hedgehogs. Monopoles, the analogous defects of U(1) currents, may bind to hedgehogs via Zeeman
effect, or effectively emerge in spin liquid phases of purely magnetic systems. The latter can lead
to spin liquids distinct from the RVB ones. Charge fractionalization of quarks in atomic nuclei
is also seen as possibly arising from the charge-hedgehog attachment.
