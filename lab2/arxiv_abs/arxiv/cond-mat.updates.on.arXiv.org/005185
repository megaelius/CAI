Understanding the behavior of an impurity strongly interacting with a Fermi sea is a long-standing
challenge in many-body physics. When the interactions are short-ranged, two vastly different
ground states exist: a polaron quasiparticle and a molecule dressed by the majority atoms. In the
single-impurity limit, it is predicted that at a critical interaction strength, a first-order
transition occurs between these two states. Experiments, however, are always conducted in the
finite temperature and impurity density regime. The fate of the polaron-to-molecule transition
under these conditions, where the statistics of quantum impurities and thermal effects become
relevant, is still unknown. Here, we address this question experimentally and theoretically.
Our experiments are performed with a spin-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gas with tunable interactions.
Utilizing a novel Raman spectroscopy combined with a high-sensitivity fluorescence detection
technique, we isolate the quasiparticle contribution and extract the polaron energy, spectral
weight, and the contact parameter. As the interaction strength is increased, we observe a continuous
variation of all observables, in particular a smooth reduction of the quasiparticle weight as it
goes to zero beyond the transition point. Our observation is in good agreement with a theoretical
model where polaron and molecule quasiparticle states are thermally occupied according to their
quantum statistics. At the experimental conditions, polaron states are hence populated even at
interactions where the molecule is the ground state and vice versa. The emerging physical picture
is thus that of a smooth transition between polarons and molecules and a coexistence of both in the
region around the expected transition.
