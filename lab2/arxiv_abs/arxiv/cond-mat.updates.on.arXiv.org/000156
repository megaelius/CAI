A spin-polarized current transfers its spin-angular momentum to a local magnetization, exciting
current-induced magnetization dynamics. So far, most studies in this field have focused on the
direct effect of spin transport on magnetization dynamics, but ignored the feedback from the magnetization
dynamics to the spin transport and back to the magnetization dynamics. Although the feedback is
usually weak, there are situations when it can play an important role in the dynamics. In such situations,
self-consistent calculations of the magnetization dynamics and the spin transport can accurately
describe the feedback. This review describes in detail the feedback mechanisms, and presents recent
progress in self-consistent calculations of the coupled dynamics. We pay special attention to
three representative examples, where the feedback generates non-local effective interactions
for the magnetization. Possibly the most dramatic feedback example is the dynamic instability
in magnetic nanopillars with a single magnetic layer. This instability does not occur without non-local
feedback. We demonstrate that full self-consistent calculations generate simulation results
in much better agreement with experiments than previous calculations that addressed the feedback
effect approximately. The next example is for more typical spin valve nanopillars. Although the
effect of feedback is less dramatic because even without feedback the current can induce magnetization
oscillation, the feedback can still have important consequences. For instance, we show that the
feedback can reduce the linewidth of oscillations, in agreement with experimental observations.
Finally, we consider nonadiabatic electron transport in narrow domain walls. The non-local feedback
in these systems leads to a significant renormalization of the effective nonadiabatic spin transfer
torque.
