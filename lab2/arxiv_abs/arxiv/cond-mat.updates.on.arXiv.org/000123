Applications, ranging from tracking molecular motion within cells to analyzing complex animal
foraging behavior, require algorithms for associating a collection of spot-like particles in
one image with particles contained in another image. These associations are often made via network
flow algorithms. However, it is often the case that many candidate association solutions (the output
of network flow algorithms) have nearly optimal scores; in this case, the optimal assignment solution
is of dubious quality. Algorithms for reliably computing the uncertainty of candidate association
solutions are under-developed in situations where many particles are tracked over multiple frames
of data. This is due in part to the fact that exact uncertainty quantification (UQ) in large association
problems is computationally intractable because the exact computation exhibits exponential
dependence on the number of particles tracked. We introduce a technique that can accurately and
efficiently quantify association ambiguity (i.e., UQ for discrete association problems) without
requiring the evaluation of the cost of each feasible association solution. Our method can readily
be wrapped around existing tracking algorithms and can efficiently handle a variety of 2D association
problems. The applications presented are focused on tracking molecules in live cells. Our method
is validated via both simulations and experiments. The experimental applications aim to accurately
form tracks and quantify diffusion of quantum dot labeled proteins from \emph{in vivo} measurements;
here association problems involving cost matrices possessing hundreds to thousands of rows/columns
are encountered. For such large-scale problems, we discuss how our approach can efficiently and
accurately quantify inherent uncertainty in candidate data associations.
