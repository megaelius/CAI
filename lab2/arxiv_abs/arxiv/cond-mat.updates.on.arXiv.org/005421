Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits a range of correlated phenomena that originate
from strong electron-electron interactions. These interactions make the Fermi surface highly
susceptible to reconstruction when $ \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$ electrons occupy each moir\' e unit cell
and lead to the formation of correlated insulating, superconducting and ferromagnetic phases.
While some phases have been shown to carry a non-zero Chern number, the local microscopic properties
and topological character of many other phases remain elusive. Here we introduce a set of novel techniques
hinging on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to map out topological phases in MATBG that emerge
in finite magnetic field. By following the evolution of the local density of states (LDOS) at the
Fermi level with electrostatic doping and magnetic field, we visualize a local Landau fan diagram
that enables us to directly assign Chern numbers to all observed phases. We uncover the existence
of six topological phases emanating from integer fillings in finite fields and whose origin relates
to a cascade of symmetry-breaking transitions driven by correlations. The spatially resolved
and electron-density-tuned LDOS maps further reveal that these topological phases can form only
in a small range of twist angles around the magic-angle value. Both the microscopic origin and extreme
sensitivity to twist angle differentiate these topological phases from the Landau levels observed
near charge neutrality. Moreover, we observe that even the charge-neutrality Landau spectrum
taken at low fields is considerably modified by interactions and exhibits an unexpected splitting
between zero Landau levels that can be as large as ${\sim }\,3-5$ meV. Our results show how strong
electronic interactions affect the band structure of MATBG and lead to the formation of correlation-enabled
topological phases.
