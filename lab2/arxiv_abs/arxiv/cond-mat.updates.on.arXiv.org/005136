Noncollinear spin textures in ferromagnetic ultrathin films are attracting a renewed interest
fuelled by the discovery of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. They are
at the origin of complex chiral spin textures such as chiral magnetic domain walls, spin spirals,
and magnetic skyrmions. We report here on the ultrafast behavior of chiral domain walls in perpendicularly
magnetized asymmetric multilayers after optical pumping probed using circular dichroism in time-resolved
x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS). In addition to the reduction of the magnetization,
we report an ultrafast change of the magnetic chirality occurring in the first few picoseconds after
optical pumping. Then the XRMS signal, related to the homochiral N\'eel domain wall periodicity
is recovered faster that the domain magnetization and subsequently accompanied by a 6 GHz oscillation
lasting up to nanosecond time scales. We attribute the short timescale XRMS dichroism reduction
in the diffracted intensity to the spin current induced coherent and incoherent torques within
the continuously varying spin texture of the domain walls. We argue that the specific demagnetization
in the domain walls induces a flow of hot spins from the interior of the domains that distort their
homochiral N\'eel shape into transient mixed Bloch-N\'eel-Bloch textures. Time-resolved circular
dichroism in XRMS can be a unique tool for studying the time evolution of the type and the chirality
of the magnetic phase of any ferroic (magnetic, electric, multiferroic) material. Similar investigations
could be profitably extended to other systems showing a non-collinear electric/magnetic ordering
such as skyrmion lattices or conical/helical phases stabilized by the DM interaction, as well as
more complex systems such as the recently observed antiskyrmion lattices, in metallic or insulating
materials.
