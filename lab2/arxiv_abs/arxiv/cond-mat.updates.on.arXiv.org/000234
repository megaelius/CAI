We report an experimental study of proximity effect-induced superconductivity in crystalline
Cu and Co nanowires and a nanogranular Co nanowire structure in contact with a superconducting W
floating electrode which we call inducer. The nanowires were grown by electrochemical deposition
in heavy-ion-track etched polycarbonate templates. The nanogranular Co structure was fabricated
by focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID), while the amorphous W inducer was obtained
by focused ion beam induced deposition (FIBID). For electrical resistance measurements up to three
pairs of Pt voltage leads were deposited by FIBID at different distances beside the inner inducer
electrode, thus allowing us to probe the proximity effect over a length of 2-12 $\mu$m. Relative
$R(T)$ drops of the same order of magnitude have been observed for the Co and Cu nanowires when sweeping
the temperature below 5.2 K ($T_c$ of the FIBID-deposited W inducer). By contrast, relative $R(T)$
drops were found to be an order of magnitude smaller for the nanogranular Co nanowire structure.
Our analysis of the resistance data shows that the superconducting proximity length in crystalline
Cu and Co is about 1 $\mu$m at low temperatures, attesting to a long-range proximity effect in the
case of ferromagnetic Co. Moreover, this long-range proximity effect has been revealed to be insusceptible
to magnetic fields up to 11 T, which is indicative of spin-triplet pairing. At the same time, in the
nanogranular Co structure proximity-induced superconductivity is strongly suppressed due to
the dominating Cooper pair scattering caused by the intrinsic microstructure of the FEBID deposit.
