Transition metal oxides such as \ce{BiVO4} are promising materials as photoelectrodes in solar-to-fuel
conversion applications. However, their performance is limited by the low carrier mobility (especially
electron mobility) due to the formation of small polarons. Recent experimental studies show improved
carrier mobility and conductivity by atomic dopings. We studied the small polaron hopping mobility
in pristine and doped \ce{BiVO4} by combining Landau-Zener theory and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC)
simulation fully from first-principles, and investigated the effect of dopant-polaron interactions
on the mobility. We found polarons are spontaneously formed at V in both pristine and Mo/W doped \ce{BiVO4},
which can only be described correctly by density function theory (DFT) with the Hubbard correction
(DFT+U) or hybrid exchange-correlation functional but not local or semi-local functionals. We
found DFT+U and dielectric dependant hybrid functional (DDH) give similar electron hopping barriers,
which are also similar between the room temperature monoclinic phase and the tetragonal phase.
The calculated electron mobility agrees well with experimental values, which is around $10^{-4}$
cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. We found the electron polaron transport in \ce{BiVO4} is neither fully
adiabatic nor nonadiabatic, and the first and second nearest neighbor hoppings have significantly
different adiabacity in spite of similar hopping barriers. We further computed polaron mobility
in the presence of different dopants and showed that Cr substitution of V is an electron trap while
Mo and W are "repulsive" centers, mainly due to the minimization of local lattice expansion by dopants
and electron polarons. The dopants with "repulsive" interactions to polarons are promising for
mobility improvement due to larger wavefunction overlap and delocalization of locally concentrated
polarons.
