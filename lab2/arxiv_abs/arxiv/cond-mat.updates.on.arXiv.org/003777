The Hubbard model, first formulated by physicist John Hubbard in the 1960s, is a simple theoretical
model of interacting quantum particles in a lattice. The model is thought to capture the essential
physics of high-temperature superconductors, magnetic insulators, and other complex emergent
quantum many-body ground states. Although the Hubbard model is greatly simplified as a representation
of most real materials, it has nevertheless proved difficult to solve accurately except in the one-dimensional
case. Physical realization of the Hubbard model in two or three dimensions, which can act as quantum
simulators, therefore have a vital role to play in solving the strong-correlation puzzle. Here
we obtain a quantum phase diagram of the two-dimensional triangular lattice Hubbard model by studying
angle-aligned WSe2/WS2 bilayers, which form moir\'e superlattices because of the difference
in lattice constant between the two two-dimensional materials. We probe both charge and magnetic
properties of the system by measuring the dependence of optical response on out-of-plane magnetic
field, and on gate-tuned carrier density. At half filling of the first hole moir\'e superlattice
band, we observe a Mott insulating state with antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss behavior as expected
for a Hubbard model in the strong interaction regime. Past half filling, our experiment suggests
an antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic quantum phase transition near 0.6 filling. Our results establish
a new solid-state platform based on moir\'e superlattices which can be used to simulate outstanding
problems in strong correlation physics that are manifested by triangular lattice Hubbard models.
