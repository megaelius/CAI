Detailed investigation of the incommensurate magnetic ordering in a single crystal of multiferroic
NdMn2O5 has been performed using both non-polarized and polarized neutron diffraction techniques.
Below TN = 30.5 K magnetic Bragg reflections corresponding to the non-chiral type magnetic structure
with propagation vector k1 = (0.5 0 kz1) occurs. Below about 27 K a new distorted magnetic modulation
with a similar vector kz2 occurs, which is attributed to the magnetization of the Nd3+ ions by the
Mn-sub-lattice. Strong temperature hysteresis in the occurrence of the incommensurate magnetic
phases in NdMn2O5 was observed depending on the cooling or heating history of the sample. Below about
20 K the magnetic structure became of a chiral type. From spherical neutron polarimetry measurements,
the resulting low-temperature magnetic structure kz3 was approximated by the general elliptic
helix. The parameters of the magnetic helix-like ellipticity and helical plane orientation in
regard to the crystal structure were determined. A reorientation of the helix occurs at an intermediate
temperature between 4 K and 18 K. A difference between the population of right- and left-handed chiral
domains of about 0.2 was observed in the as-grown crystal when cooling without an external electric
field. The magnetic chiral ratio can be changed by the application of an external electric field
of a few kV/cm, revealing strong magnetoelectric coupling. A linear dependence of the magnetic
chirality on the applied electric field in NdMn2O5 was found. The results are discussed within the
frame of the antisymmetric super-exchange model for Dzyaloshinsky-Moria interaction.
