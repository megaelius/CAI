We investigate theoretically nonequilibrium quantum transport in a quantum dot attached to a Majorana
bound state. Our approach is based on the Keldysh Green's function formalism, which allows us to
investigate the electric current continuously from the zero-bias limit up to the large bias regime.
In particular, our findings fully agree with previous results in the literature that calculate
transport using linear response theory (zero-bias) or the master equation (high bias). Our $I-V$
curves reveal a characteristic slope given by $I=(G_{0}/2)V$ in linear response regime, where
$G_0$ is the ballistic conductance $e^{2}/h$ as predicted in Phys. Rev. B 84, 201308(R) (2011).
Deviations from this behavior is also discussed when the dot couples asymmetrically to both left
and right leads. The differential conductance obtained from the left or the right currents can be
larger or smaller than $G_{0}/2$ depending on the strength of the coupling asymmetry. In particular,
the standard conductance derived from the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker equation in linear response
regime does not agree with the full nonequilibrium calculation, when the two leads couple asymmetrically
to the quantum dot. We also compare the current through the quantum dot coupled to a regular fermionic
(RF) zero-mode or to a Majorana bound state (MBS). The results differ considerably for the entire
bias voltage range analyzed. Additionally, we observe the formation of a plateau in the characteristic
$I-V$ curve for intermediate bias voltages when the dot is coupled to a MBS. Thermal effects are also
considered. We note that when the temperature of the reservoirs is large enough both RF and MBS cases
coincide for all bias voltages.
