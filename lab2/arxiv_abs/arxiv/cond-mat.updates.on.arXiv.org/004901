Motivated by the importance of understanding competing mechanisms to current-induced spin-orbit
torque in complex magnets, we develop a unified theory of current-induced spin-orbital coupled
dynamics. The theory describes angular momentum transfer between different degrees of freedom
in solids, e.g., the electron orbital and spin, the crystal lattice, and the magnetic order parameter.
Based on the continuity equations for the spin and orbital angular momenta, we derive equations
of motion that relate spin and orbital current fluxes and torques describing the transfer of angular
momentum between different degrees of freedom. We then propose a classification scheme for the
mechanisms of the current-induced torque in magnetic bilayers. Based on our first-principles
implementation, we apply our formalism to two different magnetic bilayers, Fe/W(110) and Ni/W(110),
which are chosen such that the orbital and spin Hall effects in W have opposite sign and the resulting
spin- and orbital-mediated torques can compete with each other. We find that while the spin torque
arising from the spin Hall effect of W is the dominant mechanism of the current-induced torque in
Fe/W(110), the dominant mechanism in Ni/W(110) is the orbital torque originating in the orbital
Hall effect of W. It leads to negative and positive effective spin Hall angles, respectively, which
can be directly identified in experiments. This clearly demonstrates that our formalism is ideal
for studying the angular momentum transfer dynamics in spin-orbit coupled systems as it goes beyond
the "spin current picture" by naturally incorporating the spin and orbital degrees of freedom on
an equal footing. Our calculations reveal that, in addition to the spin and orbital torque, other
contributions such as the interfacial torque and self-induced anomalous torque within the ferromagnet
are not negligible in both material systems.
