Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) emerged as a first practical algorithm for near-term quantum
computers. Its success largely relies on the chosen variational ansatz, corresponding to a quantum
circuit that prepares an approximate ground state of a Hamiltonian. Typically, it either aims to
achieve high representation accuracy (at the expense of circuit depth), or uses a shallow circuit
sacrificing the convergence to the exact ground state energy. Here, we propose the approach which
can combine both low depth and improved precision, capitalizing on a genetically-improved ansatz
for hardware-efficient VQE. Our solution, the multiobjective genetic variational quantum eigensolver
(MoG-VQE), relies on multiobjective Pareto optimization, where topology of the variational ansatz
is optimized using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). For each circuit topology,
we optimize angles of single-qubit rotations using covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
(CMA-ES) -- a derivative-free approach known to perform well for noisy black-box optimization.
Our protocol allows preparing circuits that simultaneously offer high performance in terms of
obtained energy precision and the number of two-qubit gates, thus trying to reach Pareto-optimal
solutions. Tested for various molecules (H$_2$, H$_4$, H$_6$, BeH$_2$, LiH), we observe nearly
ten-fold reduction in the two-qubit gate counts as compared to the standard hardware-efficient
ansatz. For 12-qubit LiH Hamiltonian this allows reaching chemical precision already at 12 CNOTs.
Consequently, the algorithm shall lead to significant growth of the ground state fidelity for near-term
devices.
