Macromolecular diffusion in strongly confined geometries and crowded environments is still to
a large extent an open subject in soft matter physics and biology. In this paper, we employ large-scale
Langevin dynamics simulations to investigate how the diffusion of a tracer is influenced by the
combined action of excluded-volume and weak attractive crowder-tracer interactions. We consider
two species of tracers, standard hard-core particles described by the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen
(WCA) repulsive potential and core-softened (CS) particles, that model, e.g., globular proteins,
charged colloids and nanoparticles covered by polymeric brushes. These systems are characterized
by the presence of two length scales in the interaction and can show water-like anomalies in their
diffusion, stemming from the inherent competition between different length scales. Here we report
a comprehensive study of both diffusion and structure of these two tracer species in an environment
crowded by quenched configurations of polymers at increasing density. We analyze in detail how
the tracer-polymer affinity and the system density affect transport as compared to the emergence
of specific static spatial correlations. In particular, we find that, while hardly any differences
emerge in the diffusion properties of WCA and CS particles, the propensity to develop structural
order for large crowding is strongly frustrated for CS particles. Surprisingly, for large enough
affinity for the crowding matrix, the diffusion coefficient of WCA tracers display a non-monotonic
trend as their density is increased when compared to the zero affinity scenario. This water-like
anomaly turns out to be even larger than what observed for CS particle and appears to be rooted in a
similar competition between excluded-volume and affinity effects.
