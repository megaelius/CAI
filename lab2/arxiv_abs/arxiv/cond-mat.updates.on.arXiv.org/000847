A promising trend in plasmonics involves shrinking the size of plasmon-supporting structures
down to a few nanometers, thus enabling control over light-matter interaction at extreme-subwavelength
scales. In this limit, quantum mechanical effects, such as nonlocal screening and size quantization,
strongly affect the plasmonic response, rendering it substantially different from classical
predictions. For very small clusters and molecules, collective plasmonic modes are hard to distinguish
from other excitations such as single-electron transitions. Using rigorous quantum mechanical
computational techniques for a wide variety of physical systems, we describe how an optical resonance
of a nanostructure can be classified as either plasmonic or nonplasmonic. More precisely, we define
a universal metric for such classification, the generalized plasmonicity index (GPI), which can
be straightforwardly implemented in any computational electronic-structure method or classical
electromagnetic approach to discriminate plasmons from single-particle excitations and photonic
modes. Using the GPI, we investigate the plasmonicity of optical resonances in a wide range of systems
including: the emergence of plasmonic behavior in small jellium spheres as the size and the number
of electrons increase; atomic-scale metallic clusters as a function of the number of atoms; and
nanostructured graphene as a function of size and doping down to the molecular plasmons in polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons. Our study provides a rigorous foundation for the further development of
ultrasmall nanostructures based on molecular plasmonics
