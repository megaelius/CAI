Controlling shape and structure of metallic colloids is an important topic Here, different morphology
and structure of colloidal particles are controlled under the investigation of different parameters
in pulse-based process. Different tiny-shaped particles of gold are developed where packets of
nano shape energy converted monolayer assembly into their own shape depending on the ratio of pulse
OFF to ON time. Tiny particles in joint triangular-shape developed under the certain ratio of bipolar
pulse OFF to ON time. However, under unipolar pulse, triangular-shaped tiny particles directly
developed as the packets of nano shape energy reside over them in a single triangular-shape. Atoms
of one-dimensional arrays of tiny-shaped particles elongate converting them into structure of
smooth elements, on packing at a common centre, they assemble from their tips to develop mono-layer
in shape of developing particle of different anisotropy and geometry. When the ratio of bipolar
pulse OFF to ON time was very large, the resulted particles developed in distorted shapes while those
developed at smaller values of this ratio possess geometric anisotropic shapes. When the ratio
of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time was 3, resulted particles developed in low aspect ratio to those developed
at the inverse value of this ratio. For longer pulse ON time, structures of smooth elements for tiny
particles developed in width less than their inter-spacing distance where increased density of
travelling high energy photons along the interface sharpen them. On more misalignment of elongated
atoms of tiny particles, they do not recover for structure of smooth elements while travelling of
photons along the interface, so, their structure is messed up. Morphology and structure of particles
under different conditions is discussed here opening multiple routes of research.
