We give a microscopic description of the optical bistability, where the transmission coefficient
has two different values as a function of input light intensity, and the system exhibits a discontinuous
jump with a hysteresis loop. We developed an efficient numerical algorithm to treat the quantum
master equation for hybridized systems of many photons and a large number of two-level atoms. By
using this method, we characterize the bistability from the viewpoint of eigenmodes and eigenvalues
of the time evolution operator of the quantum master equation. We investigate the optical bistability
within the low photon-density regime, where the hybridization of photon and atom degrees of freedom
occurs and the resonance spectrum has a double peak structure. We compared it with the standard optical
bistability between the low photon-density regime and the high photon-density regime, where the
photons can be treated as a classical electromagnetic field and the resonance spectrum has a single
peak structure. We discuss the steady-state properties of the optical bistability: dependencies
of the photon number density on the intensity and the double peak structure of the photon number distribution
inside the bistable region. As for the dynamical properties, we find that the relaxation timescale
shows an exponential growth with the system size, and reveal how the hysteresis loop of the optical
bistability depends on the size of the system and the sweeping rate of the driving amplitude. Finally,
by investigating the effects of detuning frequency of the input field, we clarify the characteristic
properties of the present optical bistability within the low photon-density regime, which are
qualitatively different from the standard optical bistable phenomena.
