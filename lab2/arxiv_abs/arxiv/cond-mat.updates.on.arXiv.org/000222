To study the compressional forces exerted by a bundle of living stiff filaments pressing on a surface,
akin to the case of an actin bundle in filopodia structures, we have performed particulate Molecular
Dynamics simulations of a grafted bundle of parallel living (self-assembling) filaments, in chemical
equilibrium with a solution of their constitutive monomers. Equilibrium is established as these
filaments, grafted at one end to a wall of the simulation box, grow at their chemically active free
end and encounter the opposite confining wall of the simulation box. Further growth of filaments
requires bending and thus energy, which automatically limit the populations of longer filaments.
The resulting filament sizes distribution and the force exerted by the bundle on the obstacle are
analyzed for different grafting densities and different sub- or supercritical conditions, these
properties being compared with the predictions of the corresponding ideal confined bundle model.
In this analysis, non-ideal effects due to interactions between filaments and confinement effects
are singled out. For all state points considered at the same temperature and at the same gap width
between the two surfaces, the force per filament exerted on the opposite wall appears to be a function
of a rescaled free monomer density $\hat{\rho}_1^{\rm eff}$. This quantity can be estimated directly
from the characteristic length of the exponential filament size distribution $P$ observed in the
size domain where these grafted filaments are not in direct contact with the wall. We also analyze
the dynamics of the filament contour length fluctuations in terms of effective polymerization
($U$) and depolymerization ($W$) rates, where again it is possible to disentangle non-ideal and
confinement effects.
