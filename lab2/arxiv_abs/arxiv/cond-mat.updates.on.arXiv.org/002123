Tiny-sized particles under the scheme of monolayer assembly comprising gold atoms developed at
a different processing time in a pulse-based electron-photon-solution interface process. For
a different processing time, atoms of tiny-shaped particles bind under the packets of nanoshape
energy resulting into elongate them along opposite poles from their centers converting each one-dimensional
array into a structure of smooth element. Tiny-shaped particles pack to develop extended shapes
at a different processing time where development rate of a particle is not more than millisecond
time. Increasing the processing time of solution upto certain duration increases the number of
developing triangular-shaped tiny particles, so, their extended shapes also. Orientating of
electrons adjacently in their atoms of tiny-shaped particle are because of exerting forces as per
their gained potential energy where stretching of clamped energy knots to those electrons is remained
orientational-based. At a different processing time, inter-spacing distance of spotted intensity
spots in selective area photons reflection patterns of particles is remained the same as for the
case of their structures of smooth elements visualized in transmission microscope high-resolution
images. When the forceful coinciding of two parallel structures of smooth elements is occurred
by giving the double width of each structure of smooth element along with inter-spacing distance,
it is due to binding of electrons and unfilled energy knots of elongated atoms of each other sides
of those parallel structures of smooth elements. At this node also, this study disregards the theory
of van der Waals interactions and surface plasmons, thus, providing the understanding of the diffusion-based
processes with better insight along with alternative routes to design materials and explore their
underlying science.
