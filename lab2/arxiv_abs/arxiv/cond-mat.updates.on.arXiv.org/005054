We establish the correspondence between the fractional charge bound to a vortex in a textured lattice
and the relevant bulk band topology in two-dimensional (2D) topological crystalline insulators.
As a representative example, we consider the Kekule textured graphene whose bulk band topology
is characterized by a 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological invariant $\nu_{\rm 2D}$ protected by inversion
symmetry. The fractional charge localized at a vortex in the Kekule texture is shown to be related
to the change in the bulk topological invariant $\nu_{\rm 2D}$ around the vortex, as in the case of
the Su-Schriefer-Heeger model in which the fractional charge localized at a domain wall is related
to the change in the bulk charge polarization between degenerate ground states. We show that the
effective three-dimensional (3D) Hamiltonian, where the angle $\theta$ around a vortex in Kekule-textured
graphene is a third coordinate, describes a 3D axion insulator with a quantized magnetoelectric
polarization. The spectral flow during the adiabatic variation of $\theta$ corresponds to the
chiral hinge modes of an axion insulator and determines the accumulated charge localized at the
vortex, which is half-quantized when chiral symmetry exists. When chiral symmetry is absent, electric
charge localized at the vortex is no longer quantized, but the vortex always carries a half-quantized
Wannier charge as long as inversion symmetry exists. For the cases when magnetoelectric polarization
is quantized due to the presence of symmetry that reverses the space-time orientation, we classify
all possible topological crystalline insulators whose vortex defect carries a fractional charge.
