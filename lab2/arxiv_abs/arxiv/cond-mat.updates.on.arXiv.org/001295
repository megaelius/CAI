The multipole concept, which characterizes the spacial distribution of scalar and vector objects
by their angular dependence, has already become widely used in various areas of physics. In recent
years it has become employed to systematically classify the anisotropic distribution of electrons
and magnetization around atoms in solid state materials. This has been fuelled by the discovery
of several physical phenomena that exhibit unusual higher rank multipole moments, beyond that
of the conventional degrees of freedom as charge and magnetic dipole moment. Moreover, the higher
rank electric/magnetic multipole moments have been suggested as promising order parameters in
exotic hidden order phases. While the experimental investigations of such anomalous phases have
provided encouraging observations of multipolar order, theoretical approaches have developed
at a slower pace. In particular, a materials' specific theory has been missing. The multipole concept
has furthermore been recognized as the key quantity which characterizes the resultant configuration
of magnetic moments in a cluster of atomic moments. This cluster multipole moment has then been introduced
as macroscopic order parameter for a noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure in crystals that
can explain unusual physical phenomena whose appearance is determined by the magnetic point group
symmetry. It is the purpose of this review to discuss the recent developments in the first-principles
theory investigating multipolar degrees of freedom in condensed matter systems. These recent
developments exemplify that ab initio electronic structure calculations can unveil detailed
insight in the mechanism of physical phenomena caused by the unconventional, multipole degree
of freedom.
