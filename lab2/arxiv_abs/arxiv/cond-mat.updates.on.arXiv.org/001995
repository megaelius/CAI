Low-dimensional dynamical systems are fruitful models for mixing in fluid and granular flows.
We study a one-dimensional discontinuous dynamical system (termed "cutting and shuffling" of
a line segment), and we present a comprehensive computational study of its finite-time mixing properties
including the effect of diffusion. To explore a large parameter space, we introduce fit functions
for two mixing metrics of choice: the number of cutting interfaces (a standard quantity in dynamical
systems theory of interval exchange transformations) and a mixing norm (a more physical measure
of mixing). We compute averages of the mixing metrics across different permutations (shuffling
protocols), showing that the latter averages are a robust descriptor of mixing for any permutation
choice. If the decay of the normalized mixing norm is plotted against the number of map iterations
rescaled by the characteristic e-folding time, then universality emerges: mixing norm decay curves
across all cutting and shuffling protocols collapse onto a single stretched-exponential profile.
Next, we predict this critical number of iterations using the average length of unmixed subsegments
of continuous color during cutting and shuffling and a Batchelor-scale-type diffusion argument.
This prediction, called a "stopping time" for finite Markov chains, compares well with the e-folding
time of the stretched-exponential fit. Finally, we quantify the effect of diffusion on cutting
and shuffling through a P\'eclet number (a dimensionless inverse diffusivity), showing that the
system transitions more sharply from an unmixed initial state to a mixed final state as the P\'eclet
number becomes large. Our numerical investigation of cutting and shuffling of a line segment in
the presence of diffusion thus present evidence for the latter phenomenon, known as a "cut-off"
for finite Markov chains, in interval exchange maps.
