Moir\'e superlattices created by the twisted stacking of two-dimensional crystalline monolayers
can host electronic bands with flat energy dispersion in which interaction among electrons is strongly
enhanced. These superlattices can also create non-trivial electronic band topologies making
them a platform for study of many-body topological quantum states. Among the moir\'e systems realized
to date, there are those predicted to have band structures and properties which can be controlled
with a perpendicular electric field. The twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG), where two Bernal
bilayer graphene are stacked with a twist angle, is such a tunable moir\'e system, for which partial
filling of its flat band, transport studies have found correlated insulating states. Here we use
gate-tuned scanning tunneling spectroscopy (GT-STS) to directly demonstrate the tunability
of the band structure of TDBG with an electric field and to show spectroscopic signatures of both
electronic correlations and topology for its flat band. Our spectroscopic experiments show excellent
agreement with a continuum model of TDBG band structure and reveal signatures of a correlated insulator
gap at partial filling of its isolated flat band. The topological properties of this flat band are
probed with the application of a magnetic field, which leads to valley polarization and the splitting
of Chern bands that respond strongly to the field with a large effective g-factor. Our experiments
advance our understanding of the properties of TDBG and set the stage for further investigations
of correlation and topology in such tunable moir\'e systems.
