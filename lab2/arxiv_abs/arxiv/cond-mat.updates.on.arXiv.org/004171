A field theoretical framework is developed for the Hawkes self-excited point process with arbitrary
memory kernels. We derive the corresponding master equation for the general Hawkes process as a
field theory of probability density functionals. The Langevin dynamics of the field variables
is given by stochastic partial differential equations that are Markovian. This is in contrast to
the Hawkes process, which is non-Markovian (in general) by construction as a result of its (long)
memory kernel. For the case of a memory kernel decaying as a single exponential, we find the exact
time-dependent and steady state solutions for the probability density function (PDF) of the Hawkes
intensities, using the Laplace representation of the Master equation. For memory kernels represented
as arbitrary sums of exponential (discrete and continuous sums), we derive the exact solutions
of the Lagrange-Charpit equations for the hyperbolic master equations in the Laplace representation
in the steady state, close to the critical point $n=1$ of the Hawkes process, where $n$ is the branching
ratio. The critical condition of the original Hawkes process is found to correspond to a transcritical
bifurcation in the Lagrange-Charpit equations associated with the master equations. We predict
a power law scaling of the PDF of the intensities in an intermediate asymptotics regime, which crosses
over to an asymptotic exponential function beyond a characteristics intensity that diverges as
the critical condition is approached ($n \to 1$). The exponent of the PDF is non-universal and a function
of the background intensity $\nu_0$ of the Hawkes intensity and of the parameter $\alpha = n \langle
\tau \rangle$, where $\langle \tau \rangle$ is the first-order moment of the distribution of time
scales of the memory function of the Hawkes process. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed
by numerical simulations.
