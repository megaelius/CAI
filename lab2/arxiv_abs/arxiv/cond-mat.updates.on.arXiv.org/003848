Gate-controllable two dimensional systems with in-plane modulation of properties could serve
as highly tunable effective media. Intuitively, such systems may bring novel functionality provided
that the period of the lateral modulation is much less than the relevant scattering lengths (mean
free path, coherence length etc.). Our work experimentally demonstrates the opposite, disordered
limit of such system, defined in the macroscopically modulated metal-oxide-semiconductor structure.
The system consists of parent two-dimensional gas with periodic array of islands (dots/antidots),
filled with two-dimensional gas of different density, and surrounded by depletion regions (shells).
Carrier densities of both parent gas and islands are controlled by two independent gate electrodes,
allowing us to explore a rich phase diagram of low-temperature transport properties of this modulated
two-dimensional system, resembling various transport regimes: insulating, shell-dominated,
gas-dominated, island-dominated. These regimes can be identified by various Hall resistance
and its magnetic field dependence, temperature dependencies of the resistivity, and Shubnikov-de
Haas patterns. We also suggest the theoretical approach for description of such inhomogeneous
but periodical systems. Theory based on the classical mean field approach qualitatively describes
our system as theoretical dependencies reproduce the main features of the experimental behavior
of the effective Hall concentration from gate voltage. Thus, our work demonstrates feasibility
of the macroscopically inhomogeneous two-dimensional system as a tunable platform for novel physics
and proposes the approach for the theoretical description of such systems.
