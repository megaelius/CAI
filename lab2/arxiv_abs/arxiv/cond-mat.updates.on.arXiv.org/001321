In this work we theoretically study the interface acoustic states of resonators on a thin plate with
topologically protected and conventional designs. Topologically protected interface state
is first analyzed by employing the conception of breaking inversion symmetry within the unit cell
of a honeycomb lattice for cylindrical and spherical resonators; we further demonstrate the robustness
of the wave propagation along a zig-zag path containing sharp corners, defect and disorder. The
wave propagation ceases to be preserved if we increase the degree of disorder along the zig-zag path.
In parallel, the conventional interface state is also designed and compared to the same situations.
We found that the conventional interface state suffers back scattering in the zig-zag path while
it can show a more confined wave transport in some cases. The presence of a defect along the propagation
path scatters the conventional interface wave and in particular can prohibit a full propagation
in presence of a localized state at the defect. If the zig-zag path is made disordered, the propagation
of the conventional interface mode can be conserved at given frequencies for a low random degree
and disappears for higher random degree as the interface bands become flat in dispersion and turn
to localized states. Finally, we show that the immunity of the topologically protected design needs
the interface to be surrounded by at least two hexagons of the phononic crystals on both sides, especially
at the sharp corners in the zig-zag path, while the conventional design only needs one hexagon bulk
media with the advantage of compact wave transport. This work puts a step forward for the interface
states in micro-/nano-scale characterization and figures out the behaviors for both topologically
protected and conventional interface states.
