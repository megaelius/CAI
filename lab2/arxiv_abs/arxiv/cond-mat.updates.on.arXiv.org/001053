We study possible many body phenomena in the Quantum Anomalous Hall system of weakly interacting
spinor bosons in a square lattice. There are various novel spin-bond correlated superfluids (SF)
and quantum or topological phase transitions among these SF phases. One transition is a first order
one driven by roton droppings ( but with non-zero gaps $ \Delta_R $ ) tuned by the Zeeman field $ h $.
Another is a second order bosonic Lifshitz transition with the dynamic exponents $ z_x=z_y=2 $ and
an accompanying $ [C_4 \times C_4]_D $ symmetry breaking. It is driven by the softening of the superfluid
Goldstone mode tuned by the ratio of spin-orbit coupled (SOC) strength over the hopping strength.
The two phase boundaries meet at a topological tri-critical (TT) point which separates the $ h=0
$ line into two SF phases with $ N=2 $ and $ N=4 $ condensation momenta respectively. At the $ h=0 $ line
where the system has an anti-unitary $ Z_2 $ Reflection symmetry, there are infinite number of classically
degenerate family of states on both sides. We perform a systematic order from quantum disorder analysis
to find the quantum ground states, also calculate the roton gaps $ \Delta_R $ generated by the order
from disorder mechanism on both sides of the TT point. The $ N=2 $ and $ N=4 $ SF phases have the same spin-orbital
XY-AFM spin structure, respect the anti-unitary symmetry and break the $ [C_4 \times C_4]_D $ symmetry,
so they be distinguished only by the different topology of the BEC condensation momenta instead
of by any differences in the symmetry breaking patterns. All these novel quantum or topological
phenomena can be probed in the recent experimentally realized weakly interacting Quantum Anomalous
Hall (QAH) model of $ ^87 Rb $ by Wu, {\sl et.al}, Science 354, 83-88 (2016).
