The Fujitsu Digital Annealer is designed to solve fully-connected quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) problems. It is implemented on application-specific CMOS hardware and currently
solves problems of up to 1024 variables. The Digital Annealer's algorithm is currently based on
simulated annealing, however it differs from it in its utilization of an efficient parallel-trial
scheme and a dynamic escape mechanism. In addition, the Digital Annealer exploits the massive parallelization
that custom application-specific CMOS hardware allows. We compare the performance of the Digital
Annealer to simulated annealing and parallel tempering with isoenergetic cluster moves on two-dimensional
and fully-connected spin-glass problems with bimodal and Gaussian couplings. These represent
the respective limits of sparse versus dense problems, as well as high-degeneracy versus low-degeneracy
problems. Our results show that the Digital Annealer currently exhibits a time-to-solution speedup
of roughly two orders of magnitude for fully-connected spin-glass problems with bimodal or Gaussian
couplings, over the single-core implementations of simulated annealing and parallel tempering
Monte Carlo used in this study. The Digital Annealer does not appear to exhibit a speedup for sparse
two-dimensional spin-glass problems, which we explain on theoretical grounds. We also benchmarked
an early implementation of the Parallel Tempering Digital Annealer. The next generation of the
Digital Annealer is expected to be able to solve fully-connected problems up to a size of 8192 variables.
This would enable the study of fundamental physics problems and industrial applications that were
previously inaccessible using standard computing hardware or special-purpose quantum annealing
machines.
