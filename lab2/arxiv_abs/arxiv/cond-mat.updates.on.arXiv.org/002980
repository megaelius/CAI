When an extended system is coupled at its opposite boundaries to two reservoirs at different temperatures
or chemical potentials, it cannot achieve a global thermal equilibrium and is instead driven to
a set of current-carrying nonequilibrium states. Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario
to metallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement structure of the
resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental difficulty in solving realistic models
for disordered, interacting electrons. We investigate this problem by carefully analyzing two
"toy" models for coherent quantum transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated three-dimensional,
noninteracting Anderson model and a class of random quantum circuits acting on a chain of qubits,
which exactly maps to a diffusive, interacting fermion problem. Crucially, the random circuit
model can also be tuned to have no interactions between the fermions, similar to the Anderson model.
We show that the long-time states of driven noninteracting fermions exhibit volume-law mutual
information and entanglement, both for our random circuit model and for the nonequilibrium steady-state
of the Anderson model. With interactions, the random circuit model is quantum chaotic and approaches
local equilibrium, with only short-range entanglement. These results provide a generic picture
for the emergence of local equilibrium in current-driven quantum-chaotic systems, and also provide
examples of stable, highly-entangled many-body states out of equilibrium. We discuss experimental
techniques to probe these effects in low-temperature mesoscopic wires or ultracold atomic gases.
