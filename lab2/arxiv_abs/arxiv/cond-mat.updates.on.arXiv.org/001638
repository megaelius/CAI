We present a detailed theoretical study of the effects of structural disorder on LN photonic crystal
slab cavities, ranging from short to long length scales, using a fully-3D Bloch mode expansion technique.
We compute the optical density of states, quality factors and effective mode volumes of the cavity
modes, with and without disorder, and compare with the localized modes of the corresponding disordered
photonic crystal waveguide. We demonstrate how the quality factors and effective mode volumes
saturate at a specific cavity length and become bounded by the corresponding values of the Anderson
modes appearing in the disordered waveguide. By means of the intensity fluctuation criterion,
we observe Anderson localization for cavity lengths larger than around L31, and show that the field
confinement in the disordered LN cavities is mainly determined by the local characteristics of
the structural disorder as long as the confinement region is far enough from the cavity mirrors and
the effective mode localization length is much smaller than the cavity length; under this regime,
the disordered cavity system becomes insensitive to changes in the cavity boundaries and a good
agreement with the intensity fluctuation criterion is found for localization. Surprisingly,
we find that the Anderson localized modes do not appear as new disorder-induced resonances in the
main spectral region of the LN cavity modes, and, moreover, the disordered DOS enhancement is largest
for the disordered waveguide system with the same length. These results are fundamentally interesting
for applications such as lasing and cavity-QED, and provide new insights into the role of the boundary
condition on finite-size slow-light waveguides. They also point out the clear failure of using
models based on the cavity boundaries/mirrors and a single slow-light Bloch mode to describe cavity
systems with large N.
