Chemical reaction networks offer a natural nonlinear generalisation of linear Markov jump processes
on a finite state-space. In this paper, we analyse the dynamical large deviations of such models,
starting from their microscopic version, the chemical master equation. By taking a large-volume
limit, we show that those systems can be described by a path integral formalism over a Lagrangian
functional of concentrations and chemical fluxes. This Lagrangian is dual to a Hamiltonian, whose
trajectories correspond to the most likely evolution of the system given its boundary conditions.
The same can be done for a system biased on time-averaged concentrations and currents, yielding
a biased Hamiltonian whose trajectories are optimal paths conditioned on those observables. The
appropriate boundary conditions turn out to be mixed, so that, in the long time limit, those trajectories
converge to well-defined attractors. We are then able to identify the largest value that the Hamiltonian
takes over those attractors with the scaled cumulant generating function of our observables, providing
a non-linear equivalent to the well-known Donsker-Varadhan formula for jump processes. On that
basis, we prove that chemical reaction networks that are deterministically multistable generically
undergo first-order dynamical phase transitions in the vicinity of zero bias. We illustrate that
fact through a simple bistable model called the Schl\"ogl model, as well as multistable and unstable
generalisations of it, and we make a few surprising observations regarding the stability of deterministic
fixed points, and the breaking of ergodicity in the large-volume limit.
