Depositing thin and thick films by different coating technology units is the beauty of deposition
technology where every synthesis is under the chamber pressure. In hot-filaments reactor, in addition
to flow rates of gases, chamber pressure does consider heat and photon energy settling for available
mass. Temperature of the substrate material and hot-filaments at fixed input power vary as per residence
time of entered dissociating CH4 and H2 gases under set flow rates. Rates of dissociating entered
gases and conversion rate of gas-state carbon atoms into graphite- and diamond-state carbon atoms
vary largely under the varying chamber pressure. This influences the deposition of carbon films
in terms of quality and growth rate. The increase in the chamber pressure from 3.3 kPa to 14 kPa forms
different morphology-structure of carbon films comprising tiny grains, grains and particles.
The increase in the chamber pressure upto 8.6 kPa increases the growth rate of a carbon film along
with discernible features of its grains and particles. In the range of different intermediate chamber
pressures, gas-state carbon atoms are converted into diamond-state carbon atoms at high rate.
In the range of high pressures, gas-state carbon atoms converted into graphite-state carbon atoms
in a large number. Here, a low growth rate of the film is obtained. At different chamber pressure,
a different amount of typical energy is arrived at substrate surface as result of different collision
rates of gases and self-arching of temperature over the time. So, a carbon film of different grains
and particles is deposited. Varied amount of dissociated atomic hydrogen at different chamber
pressures etch photon energy into typical energy for different rates.
