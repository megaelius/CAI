We study the relation between the microscopic properties of a many-body system and the electron
spectra, experimentally accessible by photoemission. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114,
236402 (2015)], we introduced the "fluctuation diagnostics" approach, to extract the dominant
wave vector dependent bosonic fluctuations from the electronic self-energy. Here, we first reformulate
the theory in terms of fermionic modes, to render its connection with resonance valence bond (RVB)
fluctuations more transparent. Secondly, by using a large-U expansion, where U is the Coulomb interaction,
we relate the fluctuations to real space correlations. Therefore, it becomes possible to study
how electron spectra are related to charge, spin, superconductivity and RVB-like real space correlations,
broadening the analysis of an earlier work [Phys. Rev. B 89, 245130 (2014)]. This formalism is applied
to the pseudogap physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, studied in the dynamical cluster
approximation. We perform calculations for embedded clusters with up to 32 sites, having three
inequivalent K-points at the Fermi surface. We find that as U is increased, correlation functions
gradually attain values consistent with an RVB state. This first happens for correlation functions
involving the antinodal point and gradually spreads to the nodal point along the Fermi surface.
Simultaneously a pseudogap opens up along the Fermi surface. We relate this to a crossover from a
Kondo-like state to an RVB-like localized cluster state and to the presence of RVB and spin fluctuations.
These changes are caused by a strong momentum dependence in the cluster bath-couplings along the
Fermi surface. We also show, from a more algorithmic perspective, how the time-consuming calculations
in fluctuation diagnostics can be drastically simplified.
