Many studies have been performed for understanding the underlying rich physics for various anomalous
physical properties of FeSi. The origin of the properties are of great interest due to their still
elusive theoretical understandings. Moving into this direction, we are studying the effects of
pressure and temperature on the electrical and magnetic properties of FeSi. For the study, electronic
structure calculations of FeSi are carried out by using DFT+DMFT method with spin-orbit coupling
inclusion. The self-consistently calculated values of \textit{U} and \textit{J} are used. Using
the free energy obtained from DMFT technique at 300 K, the calculated values of lattice parameter
(a$_0$) and bulk modulus (B$_0$) are $\sim$ 4.32 \text{\AA} and 110 GPa, respectively, and they
are found to lie in the range of experimental values. At DFT level, the bandgap of the material is found
to be increasing with pressure increment say $\sim$ 59 meV to 102 meV corresponding to unit cell volumes
of $\sim$ 612 to 507 Bohr$^3$, respectively. However at DMFT level, the bandgap is filled with incoherent
states at 300 K, but with the application of pressure decrement of charge carriers ($n$) around the
Fermi level is observed. Thus, predicting metal-insulator transition (MIT) to occur at $\sim$
300 K with increase in pressure. From momentum resolved spectral functions, the excitations are
found to be more coherent with increasing pressure. This study reveals the unusual behavior of the
magnetic susceptibility around 100-300 K region. The decrement behavior in spin susceptibility
($\chi$) is found to be similar to $n$ decrement with rise in pressure, and appears to follow $\frac{\chi^3}{n}=constant$
relation for $\sim$100 K; suggesting FeSi to be Pauli paramagnetic at $\sim$ 100 K while not the case
around 300 K and above.
