This work describes the microstructure and transport properties of GeBiTe films with emphasis
on their out-of-equilibrium behavior. Persistent-photoconductivity (PPC), previously studied
in the phase-change compound GeSbTe is also quite prominent in this system. Much weaker PPC response
is observed in the pure GeTe compound and when alloying GeTe with either In or Mn. Films made from these
compounds share the same crystallographic structure, the same p-type conductivity, a similar
compositional disorder extending over mesoscopic scales, and similar mosaic morphology. The
enhanced PPC response exhibited by the Sb and Bi alloys may therefore be related to their common chemistry.
PPC is observable in GeBiTe films at the entire range of sheet resistances studied in this work. The
excess conductance produced by a brief exposure to infrared illumination decays with time as a stretched-exponential
(Kohlrausch law). Intrinsic electron-glass effects on the other hand, are observable in thin films
of GeBiTe only for samples that are strongly-localized just like it was noted with the seven electron-glasses
previously studied. These include a memory-dip which is the defining attribute of the phenomenon.
The memory-dip in GeBiTe is the widest among the germanium-telluride alloys studied to date consistent
with the high carrier-concentration of this compound. The thermalization process exhibited in
either, the PPC-state or in the electron-glass regime is sluggish but the temporal law of the relaxation
from the out-of-equilibrium state is distinctly different. Coexistence of the two phenomena give
rise to some non-trivial effects, in particular, the visibility of the memory-dip is enhanced in
the PPC-state. The relation between this effect and the dependence of the memory-effect magnitude
on the ratio between the interparticle-interaction and quench-disorder is discussed.
