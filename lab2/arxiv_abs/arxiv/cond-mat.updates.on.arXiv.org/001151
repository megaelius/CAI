In the present note, we suggest a simple closed form approximate solution to the adhesive contact
problem under the so-called JKR regime. The derivation is based on generalizing the original JKR
energetic derivation assuming calculation of the strain energy in adhesiveless contact, and unloading
at constant contact area. The underlying assumption is that the contact area distributions are
the same as under adhesiveless conditions (for an appropriately increased normal load), so that
in general the stress intensity factors will not be exactly equal at all contact edges. The solution
is simply that the indentation is D=D1-Sqrt(2w A'/P") where w is surface energy, D1 is the adhesiveless
indentation, A' is the first derivative of contact area and P" the second derivative of the load with
respect to indentation. The solution only requires macroscopic quantities, and not very elaborate
local distributions, and is exact in many configurations like axisymmetric contacts. It permits
also an estimate of the full solution for elastic rough solids with Gaussian multiple scales of roughness,
which so far was lacking, using known adhesiveless simple results. The solution turns out to depend
only on rms amplitude and slopes of the surface, and in the fractal limit, slopes would grow without
limit, tends to the adhesiveless result - although in this limit the JKR model is inappropriate.
However, a more solid result is that the solution would also go to adhesiveless result for large rms
amplitude of roughness h_{rms}, irrespective of the small scale details, and in agreement with
common sense and previous models by the author.
