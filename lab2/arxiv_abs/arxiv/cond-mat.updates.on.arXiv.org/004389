Bulk superconductivity (SC) has recently been observed in the Al-Zn-Mg quasicrystal (QC). To settle
the several fundamental issues on the SC on the QC, we perform a systematic study on an attractive
Hubbard model on the Penrose lattice. The first issue is the Cooper instability under an infinitesimal
attractive interaction on the QC without a Fermi surface. We start from the two-electron problem
outside the filled Fermi-sea, where we vigorously prove that an infinitesimal Hubbard attraction
can lead to the Cooper instability as long as the density of state is nonzero at the Fermi level, which
provides the basis for the SC on the QC. Our numerical results yield that the Cooper pairing always
takes place between a time-reversal partner, satisfying the Anderson's theorem. On this basis,
we perform a mean-field (MF) study on the system, at both the zero and finite temperatures. The MF
study also shows that an arbitrarily weak attraction can lead to the pairing order, with the resulting
pairing state well described by the BCS theory. The second issue is about the superfluid density
on the QC without translational symmetry. It's clarified that although the normal state of the system
locates at the critical point of the metal-insulator transition, the pairing state exhibits real
SC, carrying finite superfluid density that can be verified by the Meissner effect. Further more,
our study reveals a fundamental difference between the SC on the periodic lattice and that on the
QC: while the paramagnetic superfluid density in the former case vanishes at zero temperature,
that in the latter case is nonzero due to the lack of translational symmetry, reflecting the consumption
of superfluid density from the scattering by the non-periodic structure. These properties of the
SC on the Penrose lattice revealed here are universal for all QC lattices.
