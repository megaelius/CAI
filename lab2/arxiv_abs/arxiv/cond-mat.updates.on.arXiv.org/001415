The quantum phase transitions of dipoles confined to the vertices of two dimensional (2D) lattices
of square and triangular geometry is studied using path integral ground state quantum Monte Carlo
(PIGS). We analyze the phase diagram as a function of the strength of both the dipolar interaction
and a transverse electric field. The study reveals the existence of a class of orientational phases
of quantum dipolar rotors whose properties are determined by the ratios between the strength anisotropic
dipole-dipole interaction, the strength of the applied transverse field, and the rotational constant.
For the triangular lattice, the generic orientationally disordered phase found at zero and weak
values of both dipolar interaction strength and applied field, is found to show a transition to a
phase characterized by net polarization in the lattice plane as the strength of the dipole-dipole
interaction is increased, independent of the strength of the applied transverse field, in addition
to the expected transition to a transverse polarized phase as the electric field strength increases.
The square lattice is also found to exhibit a transition from a disordered phase to an ordered phase
as the dipole-dipole interaction strength is increased, as well as the expected transition to a
transverse polarized phase as the electric field strength increases. In contrast to the situation
with a triangular lattice, on square lattices the ordered phase at high dipole-dipole interaction
strength possesses a striped ordering. The properties of these quantum dipolar rotor phases are
dominated by the anisotropy of the interaction and provide useful models for developing quantum
phases beyond the well-known paradigms of spin Hamiltonian models, realizing in particular a novel
physical realization of a quantum rotor-like Hamiltonian that possesses an anisotropic long range
interaction.
