The enhancement of the spin-space symmetry from the usual $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ to $\mathrm{SU}(N)$
with $N>2$ is promising for finding nontrivial quantum spin liquids, but the realization of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$
spin systems in real materials is still challenging. Although there is a proposal in cold atomic
systems, in magnetic materials with a spin-orbital degree of freedom it is difficult to achieve
the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ symmetry by fine tuning. Here we propose a new mechanism by which the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$
symmetry emerges in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit. In $d^1$ transition metal compounds
with edge-sharing anion octahedra, the spin-orbit coupling gives rise to strongly bond-dependent
and apparently $\mathrm{SU}(4)$-breaking hopping between the $J_\textrm{eff}=3/2$ quartets.
However, in the honeycomb structure, a gauge transformation maps the system to an $\mathrm{SU}(4)$-symmetric
Hubbard model, which means that the system has a hidden symmetry in spite of its large spin-orbit
coupling. In the strong repulsion limit at quarter filling, as expected in $\alpha$-ZrCl$_3,$
the low-energy effective model is the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice,
which cannot have a trivial gapped ground state and is expected to host a gapless spin-orbital liquid.
In such quantum spin-orbital liquids, both the spin and orbital degrees of freedom become fractionalized
and correlated together at low temperature due to the strong frustrated interactions between them.
Similarly to spinons in pure quantum spin liquids, quantum spin-orbital liquids can host not only
spinon excitations, but also fermionic "orbitalon" excitations at low temperature, which we have
named here in distinction from orbitons in the symmetry-broken Jahn-Teller phases.
