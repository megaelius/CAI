The weak itinerant magnetic properties of $A_2$Ni$_7$ compounds with $A$ = {Y, La} have been investigated
using electronic band structure calculations in the relation with their polymorphic crystal structures.
These compounds crystallizes in two structures resulting from the stacking of two and three blocks
of [$A_2$Ni$_4$ + 2 $A$Ni$_5$] units for hexagonal $2H$-La$_2$Ni$_7$ (Ce$_2$Ni$_7$ type) and
rhombohedral $3R$-Y$_2$Ni$_7$ (Gd$_2$Co$_7$ type) respectively. Experimentally, $2H$-La$_2$Ni$_7$
is a weak itinerant antiferromagnet whereas $3R$-Y$_2$Ni$_7$ is a weak itinerant ferromagnet.
From the present first principles calculation within non-spin polarized state, both compounds
present an electronic density of state with a sharp and narrow peak centered at the Fermi level corresponding
to flat bands from $3d$-Ni. This induces a magnetic instability and both compounds are more stable
in a ferromagnetic (FM) order compared to a paramagnetic state ($\Delta E \simeq$ -35 meV/f.u.).
The magnetic moment of each of the five Ni sites varies with their positions relative to the [$A_2$Ni$_4$]
and [$A$Ni$_5$] units: they are minimum in the [$A_2$Ni$_4$] unit and maximum at the interface between
two [$A$Ni$_5$] units. For $2H$-La$_2$Ni$_7$, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure has been
proposed and found with an energy comparable to that of the FM state. This AFM structure is described
by two FM unit blocks of opposite Ni spin sign separated by a non-magnetic layer at z = 0 and $\frac12$.
The Ni ($2a$) atoms belonging to this intermediate layer are located in the [La$_2$Ni$_4$] unit
and are at a center of symmetry of the hexagonal cell ($P6_3/mmc$) where the resultant molecular
field is cancelled. Further non-collinear spin calculations have been performed to determine
the Ni moment orientations which are found preferentially parallel to the $c$ axis for both FM and
AFM structures.
