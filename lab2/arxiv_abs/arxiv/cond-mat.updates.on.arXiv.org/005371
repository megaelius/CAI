Localisation phenomena in highly disordered metals close to the extreme conditions determined
by the Mott-Ioffe-Regel (MIR) limit when the electron mean free path is approximately equal to the
interatomic distance is a challenging problem. Here, to shed light on these localisation phenomena,
we studied the dc transport and optical conductivity properties of nanoscaled multilayered films
composed of disordered metallic Ta and magnetic FeNi nanoisland layers, where ferromagnetic FeNi
nanoislands have giant magnetic moments of 10^3-10^5 Bohr magnetons (\mu_B). In these multilayered
structures, FeNi nanoisland giant magnetic moments are interacting due to the indirect exchange
forces acting via the Ta electron subsystem. We discovered that the localisation phenomena in the
disordered Ta layer can be associated with electronic inhomogeneities leading to the appearance
of the low-energy excitations strongly superimposed in the optical conductivity with the Drude
contribution of free charge carriers. From the consistent results of the dc transport and optical
studies we found that with an increase in the FeNi layer thickness across the percolation threshold
evolution from the superferromagnetic to ferromagnetic behaviour within the FeNi layer leads
to the delocalisation of Ta electrons from the associated electronic inhomogeneities. On the contrary,
we discovered that when the FeNi layer is discontinuous and represented by randomly distributed
superparamagnetic FeNi nanoislands, the Ta layer normalized resistivity falls down below the
MIR limit by about 60%. The discovered effect leading to the resistivity fall below the MIR limit
can be associated with non-ergodicity and purely quantum localisation phenomena, which need to
be challenged further.
