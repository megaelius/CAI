Multi-point probability measures along with the dielectric function of Dirac Fermions in mono-layer
graphene containing particle-particle and white-noise (out-plane) disorder interactions on
an equal footing in the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac approximation is investigated. By calculating the
one-body carrier density probability measure of the graphene sheet, we show that the density fluctuation
($\zeta^{-1}$) is related to the disorder strength ($n_i$), the interaction parameter ($r_s$)
and the average density ($\bar{n}$) via the relation $\zeta^{-1}\propto r_sn_i^2\bar{n}^{-1}$
for which $\bar{n}\rightarrow 0$ leads to strong density inhomogeneities, i.e. electron-hole
puddles (EHPs), in agreement with the previous works. The general equation governing the two-body
distribution probability is obtained and analyzed. We present the analytical solution for some
limits which is used for calculating density-density response function. We show that the resulting
function shows power-law behaviors in terms of $\zeta$ with fractional exponents which are reported.
The disorder-averaged polarization operator is shown to be a decreasing function of momentum like
ordinary 2D parabolic band systems. It is seen that a disorder-driven momentum $q_{\text{ch}}$
emerges in the system which controls the behaviors of the screened potential. We show that in small
densities an instability occurs in which imaginary part of the dielectric function becomes negative
and the screened potential changes sign. Corresponding to this instability, some oscillations
in charge density along with a screening-anti-screening transition are observed. These effects
become dominant in very low densities, strong disorders and strong interactions, the state in which
EHPs appear. The total charge probability measure is another quantity which has been investigated
in this paper.
