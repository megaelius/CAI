We perform a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the sheet resistance in Bi-films and the LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$
interface in the presence and absence of a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the system. Our
main aim is to explore the occurrence of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and quantum phase
transition behavior in the presence of limited size, stemming from the finite extent of the homogeneous
domains or the magnetic field. Moreover we explore the implications thereof. Above an extrapolated
BKT transition temperature, modulated by the thickness $d$, gate voltage $%V_{g}$ or magnetic
field $H$, we identify a temperature range where BKT behavior occurs. Its range is controlled by
the relevant limiting lengths,which are set by the extent of the homogeneous domains or the magnetic
field. The extrapolated BKT transition lines $T_{c}\left(d,V_{g},H\right) $ uncover compatibility
with the occurrence of a quantum phase transition where $T_{c}\left( d_{c},V_{gc},H_{c}\right)
=0$. However, an essential implication of the respective limiting length is that the extrapolated
phase transition lines $T_{c}\left( d,V_{g},H\right) $ are unattainable. Consequently, given
a finite limiting length, BKT and quantum phase transitions do not occur. Nevertheless, BKT and
quantum critical behavior is observable, controlled by the extent of the relevant limiting length.
Additional results and implications include: the magnetic field induced finite size effect generates
a flattening out of the sheet resistance in the $T\rightarrow 0$ limit, while in zero field it exhibits
a characteristic temperature dependence and vanishes at $T=0$ only. The former prediction is confirmed
in both, the Bi-films and the LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ interface, as well as in previous studies.
The latter is consistent with the LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ interface data, while the Bi-films
exhibit a flattening out.
