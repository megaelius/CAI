We experimentally observe generation of high-frequency chaotic signal reaching THz range by Josephson
flux flow oscillator. Such experimental findings are confirmed by a comprehensive numerical modeling
based on the microscopic tunneling theory (MTT) and reveal the unrealized potential of such system
in applications ranging from generation of random numbers to secure communications. The observed
effect can be utilized to generate a chaotic signal with central frequencies up to about 0.7 THz and
power sufficient to drive on-chip superconducting circuit elements. The system design is based
on the established technology of flux-flow oscillator (FFO) where the symmetry of the standard
layout is broken by presence of an additional Josephson transmission line coupled via a T-junction.
Despite the apparent simplicity of our modification, it drastically alters the familiar regular
dynamics of Josephson fluxons in the system. Remarkably, while the conventional FFO provides the
narrowest-linewidth Terahertz radiation as compared to the currently existing ones, introduction
of a T-junction drives the system to the opposite extreme of a dynamic chaos with unexpectedly broad
radiation spectrum prevailing in the whole flux-flow current-voltage characteristics. Whereas
our experiments reveal a broad spectrum of the emitted Terahertz radiation weakly related to the
value of the Josephson frequency, our numerical results with the use of the MTT reliably confirm
the presence of chaotic dynamics by demonstrating the positive Lyapunov exponents, in full agreement
with the experimental results. Moreover, our results imply that the a Josephson junction exhibits
a previously unstudied phenomenon of coupling of superconducting and quasiparticle tunnel currents
to a chaotic spectrum of the generated ac electric field. We term this effect the chaotic self-coupling.
