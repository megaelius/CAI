The extended Falicov-Kimball model is analyzed exactly for finite temperatures ($T\geq0$) in
the limit of large dimensions. Onsite and intersite density-density interactions $U$ and $V$ are
included in the model. Using the dynamical mean field theory formalism on the Bethe lattice we find
rigorously the temperature dependent density of states (DOS) at half-filling. At $T=0$ the system
is ordered to form the checkerboard pattern and the DOS has the gap $\Delta(\varepsilon_F) > 0$ at
the Fermi level, if only $U\neq 0$ or $V\neq 0$. If $U <0$ or $U > 2V$, two additional subbands develop
inside the principal energy gap. They become wider with increasing $T$ and at a certain $U$- and $V$-dependent
temperature $T_{MI}$ they join with each other at $\varepsilon_F$. Since above $T_{MI}$ the DOS
is positive at $\varepsilon_F$, we interpret $T_{MI}$ as the transformation temperature from
insulator to metal. Moreover, we show that if $V\lesssim 0.54$ then $T_{MI}=0$ at two quasi-quantum
critical points $U_{cr}^{\pm}$ (one positive and the other negative), whereas for $V\gtrsim 0.54$
there is only one negative $U^-_{cr}$. Having calculated the temperature dependent DOS we study
thermodynamic properties of the system starting from its free energy and then we construct the phase
diagrams in the variables $T$ and $U$ for a few values of $V$. Our calculations give that inclusion
of the intersite coupling $V$ causes the finite temperature phase diagrams to become asymmetric
with respect to a change of sign of $U$. On these phase diagrams we detected stability regions of eight
different kinds of ordered phases, where both charge-order and antiferromagnetism coexists (five
of them are insulating and three are conducting) and three different nonordered phases (two of them
are insulating and one is conducting). Moreover, both continuous and discontinuous transitions
between various phases were found.
