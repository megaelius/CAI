In contrast to interband excitons in undoped quantum wells, doped quantum wells do not display sharp
resonances due to excitonic bound states. In these systems the effective Coulomb interaction between
electrons and holes typically only leads to a depolarization shift of the single-electron intersubband
transitions. Non-perturbative light-matter interaction in solid-state devices has been investigated
as a pathway to tune optoelectronic properties of materials. A recent theoretical work [Cortese
et al., Optica 6, 354 (2019)] predicted that, when the doped quantum wells are embedded in a photonic
cavity, emission-reabsorption processes of cavity photons can generate an effective attractive
interaction which binds electrons and holes together, leading to the creation of an intraband bound
exciton. Spectroscopically, this bound state manifests itself as a novel discrete resonance which
appears below the ionisation threshold only when the coupling between light and matter is increased
above a critical value. Here we report the first experimental observation of such a bound state using
doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells embedded in metal-metal resonators whose confinement is high
enough to permit operation in strong coupling. Our result provides the first evidence of bound states
of charged particles kept together not by Coulomb interaction, but by the exchange of transverse
photons. Light-matter coupling can thus be used as a novel tool in quantum material engineering,
tuning electronic properties of semiconductor heterostructures beyond those permitted by mere
crystal structures, with direct applications to mid-infrared optoelectronics.
