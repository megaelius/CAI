Organic molecules such as steroids or amino acids form crystals that can facilitate the formation
of ice -- arguably the most important phase transition on earth. However, the origin of the ice nucleating
ability of organic crystals is still largely unknown. Here, we combine experiments and simulations
to unravel the microscopic details of ice formation on cholesterol, a prototypical organic crystal
widely used in cryopreservation. We find that cholesterol -- which is also a substantial component
of cell membranes -- is an ice nucleating agent more potent than many inorganic substrates, including
the mineral feldspar (one of the most active ice nucleating material in the atmosphere). Scanning
electron microscopy measurements reveal a variety of morphological features on the surfaces of
cholesterol crystals: this suggests that the topography of the surface is key to the broad range
of ice nucleating activity observed (from -4 to -20 C\degree). In addition, we show via molecular
simulations that cholesterol crystals aid the formation of ice nuclei in a unconventional fashion.
Rather than providing a template for a flat ice-like contact layer (as found in the case of many inorganic
substrates), the flexibility of the cholesterol surface and its low density of hydrophilic functional
groups leads to the formation of molecular cages involving both water molecules and terminal hydroxyl
groups of the cholesterol surface. We argue that the phenomenal ice nucleating activity of steroids
such as cholesterol (and potentially of many other organic crystals) is due to (i) the ability of
flexible hydrophilic surfaces to form unconventional ice-templating structures and (ii) the
different nucleation sites offered by the diverse topography of the crystalline surfaces.
