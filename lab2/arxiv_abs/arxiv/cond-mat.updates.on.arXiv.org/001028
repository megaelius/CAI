Electrons that are confined to a single Landau level in a two dimensional electron gas realize the
effects of strong electron-electron repulsion in its purest form. The kinetic energy of individual
electrons is completely quenched and all physical properties are dictated solely by many-body
effects. A remarkable consequence is the emergence of new quasiparticles with fractional charge
and exotic quantum statistics of which the most exciting ones are non-Abelian quasiparticles.
A non-integer quantized thermal Hall conductance $\kappa_{xy}$ (in units of temperature times
the universal constant $\pi^2 k_B^2 /3 h$; $h$ is the Planck constant and $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant)
necessitates the existence of such quasiparticles. It has been predicted, and verified numerically,
that such states are realized in the clean half-filled first Landau level of electrons with Coulomb
repulsion, with $\kappa_{xy}$ being either $3/2$ or $7/2$. Excitingly, a recent experiment has
indeed observed a half-integer value, which was measured, however, to be $\kappa_{xy}=5/2$. We
resolve this contradiction within a picture where smooth disorder results in the formation of mesoscopic
puddles with locally $\kappa_{xy}=3/2$ or $7/2$. Interactions between these puddles generate
a coherent macroscopic state, which is reflected in an extended plateau with quantized $\kappa_{xy}=5/2$.
The topological properties of quasiparticles at large distances are determined by the macroscopic
phase, and not by the microscopic puddle where they reside. In principle, the same mechanism might
also allow non-Abelian quasiparticles to emerge from a system comprised of microscopic Abelian
puddles.
