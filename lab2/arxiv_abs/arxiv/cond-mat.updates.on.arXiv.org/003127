Stochastic oscillators play a prominent role in different fields of science. Their simplified
description in terms of a phase has been advocated by different authors using distinct phase definitions
in the stochastic case. One notion of phase that we put forward previously, the \emph{asymptotic
phase of a stochastic oscillator}, is based on the eigenfunction expansion of its probability density.
More specifically, it is given by the complex argument of the eigenfunction of the backward operator
corresponding to the least negative eigenvalue. Formally, besides the `backward' phase, one can
also define the `forward' phase as the complex argument of the eigenfunction of the forward Kolomogorov
operator corresponding to the least negative eigenvalue. Until now, the intuition about these
phase descriptions has been limited. Here we study these definitions for a process that is analytically
tractable, the two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with complex eigenvalues. For this
process, (i) we give explicit expressions for the two phases; (ii) we demonstrate that the isochrons
are always the spokes of a wheel, but that (iii) the spacing of these isochrons (their angular density)
is different for backward and forward phases; (iv) we show that the isochrons of the backward phase
are completely determined by the deterministic part of the vector field, whereas the forward phase
also depends on the noise matrix; and (v) we demonstrate that the mean progression of the backward
phase in time is always uniform, whereas this is not true for the forward phase except in the rotationally
symmetric case. We illustrate our analytical results for a number of qualitatively different cases.
