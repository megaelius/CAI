The formation of crystalline calcium sulfate (CaSO4*xH2O) polymorphs from aqueous solutions
is assumed to occur via a single-step process following the classical nucleation paradigm. However,
although recent research contradicts this classical picture and indicates that CaSO4*2H2O forms
at room temperature through multiple steps at different length and time-scales, these steps have
so far not been quantified. By using in situ and fast time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS), we demonstrate that the nucleation and growth of CaSO4*2H2O involves at the very initial
stages the formation of well-defined, primary species of < 3 nm in length (stage I). Stage II of the
reaction is characterized by the arrangement of these primary species into domains, while in stage
III these domains condense into larger aggregates. Based on volume fractions and electron density
considerations we propose that the fast forming primary species from supersaturated aqueous CaSO4
solutions are composed of anhydrous Ca-SO4-cores. The first three stages of nucleation and aggregation
of the primary species are followed by a final stage (stage IV), where the primary species grow within
the aggregates, and eventually transform into gypsum (CaSO4*2H2O). This final stage was also confirmed
through simultaneously collected wide-angle scattering (diffraction, WAXS) data, which clearly
show the growth of gypsum during stage IV only. Our results demonstrate that CaSO4 formation is driven
by the nucleation and aggregation of well-defined anhydrous Ca-SO4-cores that transform through
hydration into gypsum through a complex nucleation and growth pathway.
