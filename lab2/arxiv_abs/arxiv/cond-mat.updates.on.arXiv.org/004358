The ribosome is one of the largest and most complex macromolecular machines in living cells. It polymerizes
a protein in a step-by-step manner as directed by the corresponding nucleotide sequence on the template
messenger RNA (mRNA) and this process is referred to as `translation' of the genetic message encoded
in the sequence of mRNA transcript. In each successful chemo-mechanical cycle during the (protein)
elongation stage, the ribosome elongates the protein by a single subunit, called amino acid, and
steps forward on the template mRNA by three nucleotides called a codon. Therefore, a ribosome is
also regarded as a molecular motor for which the mRNA serves as the track, its step size is that of a
codon and two molecules of GTP and one molecule of ATP hydrolyzed in that cycle serve as its fuel. What
adds further complexity is the existence of competing pathways leading to distinct cycles, branched
pathways in each cycle and futile consumption of fuel that leads neither to elongation of the nascent
protein nor forward stepping of the ribosome on its track. We investigate a model formulated in terms
of the network of discrete chemo-mechanical states of a ribosome during the elongation stage of
translation. The model is analyzed using a combination of stochastic thermodynamic and kinetic
analysis based on a graph-theoretic approach. We derive the exact solution of the corresponding
master equations. We represent the steady state in terms of the cycles of the underlying network
and discuss the energy transduction processes. We identify the various possible modes of operation
of a ribosome in terms of its average velocity and mean rate of GTP hydrolysis. We also compute entropy
production as functions of the rates of the interstate transitions and the thermodynamic cost for
accuracy of the translation process.
