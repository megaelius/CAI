The binary Voronoi mixture is a fluid model whose interactions are local and many-body. Here we perform
molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of an equimolar mixture that is weakly polydisperse and additive.
For the first time we study the structural relaxation of this mixture in the supercooled-liquid
regime. From the simulations we determine the time- and temperature-dependent scattering functions
for a large range of wave vectors, as well as the mean-square displacements of both particle species.
We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics by comparing the MD results with the first-principles-based
idealized mode-coupling theory (MCT). To this end, we employ two approaches: fits to the asymptotic
predictions of the theory, and fit-parameter-free binary MCT calculations based on static-structure-factor
input from the simulations. We find that many-body interactions of the Voronoi mixture do not lead
to strong qualitative differences relative to similar analyses carried out for simple liquids
with pair-wise interactions. For instance, the fits give an exponent parameter $\lambda \approx
0.746$ comparable to typical values found for simple liquids, the wavevector dependence of the
Kohlrausch relaxation time is in good agreement with literature results for polydisperse hard
spheres, and the MCT calculations based on static input overestimate the critical temperature,
albeit only by a factor of about 1.2. This overestimation appears to be weak relative to other well-studied
supercooled-liquid models such as the binary Kob--Andersen Lennard-Jones mixture. Overall,
the agreement between MCT and simulation suggests that it is possible to predict several microscopic
dynamic properties with qualitative, and in some cases near-quantitative, accuracy based solely
on static two-point structural correlations, even though the system itself is inherently governed
by many-body interactions.
