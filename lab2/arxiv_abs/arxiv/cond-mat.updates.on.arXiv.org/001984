The project concerns the interplay among quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics,
in isolated quantum systems. The underlying goal is to improve our understanding of the concept
of thermal equilibrium in quantum systems. First, I investigated the role played by observables
and measurements in the emergence of thermal behaviour. This led to a new notion of thermal equilibrium
which is specific for a given observable, rather than for the whole state of the system. The equilibrium
picture that emerges is a generalization of statistical mechanics in which we are not interested
in the state of the system but only in the outcome of the measurement process. I investigated how this
picture relates to one of the most promising approaches for the emergence of thermal behaviour in
isolated quantum systems: the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Then, I applied the results
to study some equilibrium properties of many-body localised systems. Despite the localization
phenomenon, which prevents thermalization of subsystems, I was able to show that we can still use
the predictions of statistical mechanics to describe the equilibrium of some observables. Moreover,
the intuition developed in the process led me to propose an experimentally accessible way to unravel
the interacting nature of many-body localised systems. Second, I exploited the "Concentration
of Measure" phenomenon to study the macroscopic properties of the basis states of Loop Quantum Gravity.
These techniques were previously used to explain why the thermal behaviour in quantum systems is
such an ubiquitous phenomenon, at the macroscopic scale. I focused on the local properties, their
thermodynamic behaviour and interplay with the semiclassical limit. This was motivated by the
necessity to understand, from a quantum gravity perspective, how and why a classical horizon exhibits
thermal properties.
