We derive a microscopic theory of glassy dynamics based on the transport of voids by micro-string
motions, each of which involves particles arranged in a line hopping simultaneously displacing
one another. Disorder is modeled by a random energy landscape quenched in the configuration space
of distinguishable particles, but transient in the physical space as expected for glassy fluids.
We study the evolution of local regions with m coupled voids. At low temperature, energetically
accessible local particle configurations can be organized into a random tree with nodes and edges
denoting configurations and micro-string propagations respectively. Such trees defined in the
configuration space naturally describe systems defined in two- or three-dimensional physical
space. A micro-string propagation initiated by a void can facilitate similar motions by other voids
via perturbing the random energy landscape, realizing path interactions between voids or equivalently
string interactions. We obtain explicit expressions of the particle diffusion coefficient and
a particle return probability. Under our approximation, as temperature decreases, random trees
of energetically accessible configurations exhibit a sequence of percolation transitions in
the configuration space, with local regions containing fewer coupled voids entering the non-percolating
immobile phase first. Dynamics is dominated by coupled voids of an optimal group size, which increases
as temperature decreases. Comparison with a distinguishable-particle lattice model (DPLM) of
glass shows very good quantitative agreements using only two adjustable parameters related to
typical energy fluctuations and the interaction range of the micro-strings.
