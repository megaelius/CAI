Single adatoms offer an exceptional playground for studying magnetism and its associated dynamics
at the atomic scale. Here we review recent results on single adatoms deposited on metallic substrates,
based on time-dependent density functional theory. First we analyze quantum zero-point spin-fluctuations
(ZPSF) as calculated from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, and show how they affect the magnetic
stability by modifying the magnetic anisotropy energy. We also assess the impact of ZPSF in the limit
of small hybridization to the substrate characteristic of semi-insulating substrates, connecting
to recent experimental investigations where magnetic stability of a single adatom was achieved
for the first time. Secondly, we inspect further the dynamics of single adatoms by considering the
longitudinal and transverse spin-relaxation processes, whose time-scales are analyzed and related
to the underlying electronic structure of both the adatom and the substrate. Thirdly, we analyze
spin-fluctuation modes of paramagnetic adatoms, i.e., adatoms where the Stoner criterion for
magnetism is almost fulfilled. Interestingly, such modes can develop well-defined peaks in the
meV range, their main characteristics being determined by two fundamental electronic properties,
namely the Stoner parameter and the density of states at the Fermi level. Furthermore, simulated
inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy curves reveal that these spin-fluctuation modes can
be triggered by tunneling electrons, opening up potential applications also for paramagnetic
adatoms. Lastly, an overview of the outstanding issues and future directions is given.
