New computing technologies are being sought near the end of CMOS transistor scaling, meanwhile
superconducting digital, i.e., single-flux quantum (SFQ), logic allows incredibly efficient
gates which are relevant to the impending transition. In this work we present a proposed reversible
logic, including gate simulations and schematics under the name of Reversible Fluxon Logic (RFL).
In the widest sense it is related to SFQ-logic, however it relies on (some approximately) reversible
gate dynamics and promises higher efficiency than conventional SFQ which is logically irreversible.
Our gates use fluxons, a type of SFQ which has topological-particle characteristics in an undamped
Long Josephson junction (LJJ). The collective dynamics of the component Josephson junctions (JJs)
enable ballistic fluxon motion within LJJs as well as good energy preservation of the fluxon for
JJ-circuit gates. For state changes, the gates induce switching of fluxon polarity during resonant
scattering at an interface between different LJJs. Related to the ballistic nature of fluxons in
LJJ, the gates are powered, almost ideally, only by data fluxon momentum in stark contrast to conventionally
damped logic gates which are powered continuously with a bias. At first the fundamental Identity
and NOT gates are introduced. Then 2-bit gates are discussed, including the IDSN gate which actually
allows low fluxon-number inputs for more than 4 input states. A digital CNOT, an important milestone
for 2-bit reversible superconducting gates, is planned as a central result. It uses a store and launch
gate to stop and then later route a fluxon. This use of the store and launch gate allows a clocked CNOT
gate and synchronization within. The digital CNOT gate could enable high efficiency relative to
conventional irreversible gates and shows the utility of the IDSN as a reversible gate primitive.
