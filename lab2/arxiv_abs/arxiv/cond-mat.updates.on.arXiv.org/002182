Magnetically doped topological insulators enable the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) which
provides quantized edge states for lossless charge transport applications. The edge states are
hosted by a magnetic energy gap at the Dirac point but all attempts to observe it directly have been
unsuccessful. The gap size is considered crucial to overcoming the present limitations of the QAHE,
which so far occurs only at temperatures one to two orders of magnitude below its principle limit
set by the ferromagnetic Curie temperature $T_C$. Here, we use low temperature photoelectron spectroscopy
to unambiguously reveal the magnetic gap of Mn-doped Bi$_2$Te$_3$ films, which is present only
below $T_C$. Surprisingly, the gap turns out to be $\sim$90 meV wide, which not only exceeds $k_BT$
at room temperature but is also 5 times larger than predicted by density functional theory. By an
exhaustive multiscale structure characterization we show that this enhancement is due to a remarkable
structure modification induced by Mn doping. Instead of a disordered impurity system, it forms
an alternating sequence of septuple and quintuple layer blocks, where Mn is predominantly incorporated
in the septuple layers. This self-organized heterostructure substantially enhances the wave-function
overlap and the size of the magnetic gap at the Dirac point, as recently predicted. Mn-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$
forms a similar heterostructure, however, only a large, nonmagnetic gap is formed. We explain both
differences based on the higher spin-orbit interaction in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ with the most important
consequence of a magnetic anisotropy perpendicular to the films, whereas for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ the
spin-orbit interaction it is too weak to overcome the dipole-dipole interaction. Our findings
provide crucial insights for pushing the lossless transport properties of topological insulators
towards room-temperature applications.
