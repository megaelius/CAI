We consider a non-conserving zero-range process with hopping rate proportional to the number of
particles at each site. Particles are added to the system with a site-dependent creation rate, and
removed from the system with a uniform annihilation rate. On a fully-connected lattice with a large
number of sites, the mean-field geometry leads to a negative binomial law for the number of particles
at each site, with parameters depending on the hopping, creation and annihilation rates. This model
of particles is mapped to a model of population dynamics: the site label is interpreted as a level
of fitness, the site-dependent creation rate is interpreted as a selection function, and the hopping
process is interpreted as the introduction of mutants. In the limit of large density, the fraction
of the total population occupying each site approaches the limiting distribution in the house-of-cards
model of selection-mutation, introduced by Kingman. A single site can be occupied by a macroscopic
fraction of the particles if the mutation rate is below a critical value (which matches the critical
value worked out in the house-of-cards model). This feature generalises to classes of selection
functions that increase sufficiently fast at high fitness. The process can be mapped to a model of
evolving networks, inspired by the Bianconi--Barab\'asi model, but involving a large and fixed
set of nodes. Each node forms links at a rate biased by its fitness, moreover links are destroyed at
a uniform rate, and redirected at a certain rate. If this redirection rate matches the mutation rate,
the number of links pointing to nodes of a given fitness level is distributed as the numbers of particles
in the non-conserving zero-range process. There is a finite critical redirection rate if the density
of quenched fitnesses goes to zero sufficiently fast at high fitness.
