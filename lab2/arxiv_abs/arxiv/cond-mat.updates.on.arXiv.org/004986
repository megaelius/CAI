The magneto-optical (MO) effects not only are a powerful probe of magnetism and electronic structure
of magnetic solids but also have valuable applications in high-density data-storage technology.
Yttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$) (YIG) and bismuth iron garnet (Bi$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$)
(BIG) are two widely used magnetic semiconductors with strong magneto-optical effects and have
also attracted the attention for fundamental physics studies. In particular, YIG has been routinely
used as a spin current injector. In this paper, we present a thorough theoretical investigation
on magnetism, electronic, optical and MO properties of YIG and BIG, based on the density functional
theory with the generalized gradient approximation plus onsite Coulomb repulsion. We find that
both semiconductors exhibit large MO effects with their Kerr and Faraday rotation angles being
comparable to that of best-known MO materials such as MnBi. Especially, the MO Kerr rotation angle
for bulk BIG reaches -1.2$ ^{\circ}$ at photon energy $\sim2.4$ eV, and the MO Faraday rotation angle
for BIG film reaches -74.6 $ ^{\circ}/\mu m$ at photon energy $\sim2.7$ eV. Furthermore, we also
find that both valence and conduction bands across the MO band gap in BIG are purely spin-down states,
i.e., BIG is a single spin semiconductor. These interesting findings suggest that the iron garnets
will find valuable applications in semiconductor MO and spintronic nanodevices. The calculated
optical conductivity spectra, MO Kerr and Faraday rotation angles agree well with the available
experimental data. The main features in the optical and MO spectra of both systems are analyzed in
terms of the calculated band structures especially by determining the band state symmetries and
the main optical transitions at the $\Gamma$ point in the Brillouin zone.
