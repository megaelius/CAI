Non-equilibrium active matter made up of self-driven particles exhibits collective motion and
nonequilibrium order-disorder transitions. Self-propelled rod models with short-range repulsive
interactions are a useful minimal system to study active matter. We simulated high-aspect-ratio
self-propelled rods with varying packing fraction and driving. Two characteristic phases, the
flocking and laning phases, occupy much of the phase diagram. We study the laning-flocking transition
and the emergence of the laning state from the equilibrium nematic. For low packing fraction, driving
induces formation of a clustered flocking phase, as observed previously. In flocks the average
pressure is high and structural and mechanical relaxation times are long. These results suggest
that rods in flocks are in a translating jammed state with an internal structure similar to a jammed
solid despite overall flock motion. For higher packing fraction, a laning state emerges in response
to driving, with polar domains that vary in size with the driving force. The average pressure is relatively
low and structural and mechanical relaxation times are short, showing fluid-like behavior. Both
structural and mechanical properties vary rapidly upon lowering the packing fraction from the
laning to flocking regime, suggesting an abrupt dynamic phase transition occurs in this system.
We propose that the laning-flocking transition is a type of jamming transition which, in contrast
to other jamming systems, occurs as density is decreased. In contrast, the laning state appears
to emerge continuously from the equilibrium nematic as driving is increased.
