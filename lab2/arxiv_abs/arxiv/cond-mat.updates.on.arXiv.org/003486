Coarse-grained (CG) models can provide computationally efficient and conceptually simple characterizations
of soft matter systems. While generic models probe the underlying physics governing an entire family
of free-energy landscapes, bottom-up CG models are systematically constructed from a higher-resolution
model to retain a high level of chemical specificity. The removal of degrees of freedom from the system
modifies the relationship between the relative time scales of distinct dynamical processes through
both a loss of friction and a "smoothing" of the free-energy landscape. While these effects typically
result in faster dynamics, decreasing the computational expense of the model, they also obscure
the connection to the true dynamics of the system. The lack of consistent dynamics is a serious limitation
for CG models, which not only prevents quantitatively accurate predictions of dynamical observables
but can also lead to qualitatively incorrect descriptions of the characteristic dynamical processes.
With many methods available for optimizing the structural and thermodynamic properties of chemically-specific
CG models, recent years have seen a stark increase in investigations addressing the accurate description
of dynamical properties generated from CG simulations. In this review, we present an overview of
these efforts, ranging from bottom-up parametrizations of generalized Langevin equations to
refinements of the CG force field based on a Markov state modeling framework. We aim to make connections
between seemingly disparate approaches, while laying out some of the major challenges as well as
potential directions for future efforts.
