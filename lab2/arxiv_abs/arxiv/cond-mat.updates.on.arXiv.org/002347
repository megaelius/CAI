We construct a complexity-based morphospace to study systems-level properties of conscious &
intelligent systems. The axes of this space label 3 complexity types: autonomous, cognitive & social.
Given recent proposals to synthesize consciousness, a generic complexity-based conceptualization
provides a useful framework for identifying defining features of conscious & synthetic systems.
Based on current clinical scales of consciousness that measure cognitive awareness and wakefulness,
we take a perspective on how contemporary artificially intelligent machines & synthetically engineered
life forms measure on these scales. It turns out that awareness & wakefulness can be associated to
computational & autonomous complexity respectively. Subsequently, building on insights from
cognitive robotics, we examine the function that consciousness serves, & argue the role of consciousness
as an evolutionary game-theoretic strategy. This makes the case for a third type of complexity for
describing consciousness: social complexity. Having identified these complexity types, allows
for a representation of both, biological & synthetic systems in a common morphospace. A consequence
of this classification is a taxonomy of possible conscious machines. We identify four types of consciousness,
based on embodiment: (i) biological consciousness, (ii) synthetic consciousness, (iii) group
consciousness (resulting from group interactions), & (iv) simulated consciousness (embodied
by virtual agents within a simulated reality). This taxonomy helps in the investigation of comparative
signatures of consciousness across domains, in order to highlight design principles necessary
to engineer conscious machines. This is particularly relevant in the light of recent developments
at the crossroads of cognitive neuroscience, biomedical engineering, artificial intelligence
& biomimetics.
