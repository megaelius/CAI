A theoretical investigation on the coherent Dirac-like quasiparticle dynamics in monolayer $\text{MoS}_2$
under an ultrashort optical pulse irradiation is presented. Particularly, we remain specific
features of ML-MDS associated with the mass asymmetry $\alpha$ and topological aspect $\beta$
parameters resulting in Schr$\stackrel{..}{\text{o}}$dinger type wavevector of charge carriers.
The direct band gap, spin-resolved valence band spilitting and valley degeneracy breaking due
to strong spin-orbit coupling affect ultrafast dynamics of Dirac fermions. Because the duration
of the optical pulse is less than the electron scattering time, which is $\sim 10-100\ fs$, the electron
dynamics in electric field of the optical pulse is coherent, and consequently, we can describe the
coupling of electron with strong electromagnetic field by the time-dependent Schr$\stackrel{..}{\text{o}}$dinger
equation. The conduction band and valence band coupling via the strong electric field of pulse ($0.2-2.5
\ V/\text{\AA}$) gives rise to appearance of a dipole moment during the pulse is applied. We find
that the dipole is complex, originating from the existence of band gap. We show an asymmetric singularities
in Dirac points for absolute of dipole moment. We solve the resulting coupled evolution equations
for the expansion coefficient of valence and conduction bands to obtain probability of population
transition between valence and conduction bands. The irreversible electron dynamics as a key feature
of two-dimensional Dirac matters in interacting with an ultrashort pulse strongly depends on the
electronic structure of $\text{MoS}_2$. Furthermore, we present conduction band population
distribution with an asymmetric exhibition at the each pair of Dirac points ($K$ and $K'$), when
the pulse ends. This leads to valley polarization effect.
