Disorder effects on three-dimensional second-order topological insulators (3DSOTIs) are investigated
numerically and analytically. The study is based on a tight-binding Hamiltonian for non-interacting
electrons on a cubic lattice with a reflection symmetry that supports a 3DSOTI in the absence of disorder.
Interestingly, unlike the disorder effects on a topological trivial system that can only be either
a diffusive metal (DM) or an Anderson insulator (AI), disorders can sequentially induce four phases
of 3DSOTIs, three-dimensional first-order topological insulators (3DFOTIs), DMs and AIs. At
a weak disorder when the on-site random potential of strength $W$ is below a low critical value $W_{c1}$
at which the gap of surface states closes while the bulk sates are still gapped, the system is a disordered
3DSOTI characterized by a constant density of states and a quantized integer conductance of $e^2/h$
through its chiral hinge states. The gap of the bulk states closes at a higher critical disorder $W_{c2}$,
and the system is a disordered 3DFOTI in the lower intermediate disorder between $W_{c1}$ and $W_{c2}$
in which electron conduction is through the topological surface states. The system becomes a DM
in a higher intermediate disorder between $W_{c2}$ and $W_{c3}$ above which the states at the Fermi
level are localized. It undergoes a normal three-dimension metal-to-insulator transition at
$W_{c3}$ and becomes the conventional Anderson insulator for $W>W_{c3}$. Our results can be understood
from the self-consistent Born approximation that allows one to reveal how the original Hamiltonian
been modified by the on-site disorders.
