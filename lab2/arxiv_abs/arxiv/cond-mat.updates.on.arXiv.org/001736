We analyze the ground-state energy, magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and Kondo screening
cloud of the symmetric single-impurity Anderson model (SIAM) that is characterized by the band
width $W$, the impurity interaction strength $U$, and the local hybridization $V$. We compare Gutzwiller
variational and magnetic Hartree-Fock results in the thermodynamic limit with numerically exact
data from the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method on large rings. To improve the
DMRG performance, we use a canonical transformation to map the SIAM onto a chain with half the system
size and open boundary conditions. We compare to Bethe-Ansatz results for the ground-state energy,
magnetization, and spin susceptibility that become exact in the wide-band limit. Our detailed
comparison shows that the field-theoretical description is applicable to the SIAM on a ring for
a broad parameter range. Hartree-Fock theory gives an excellent ground-state energy and local
moment for intermediate and strong interactions. However, it lacks spin fluctuations and thus
cannot screen the impurity spin. The Gutzwiller variational energy bound becomes very poor for
large interactions because it does not describe properly the charge fluctuations. Nevertheless,
the Gutzwiller approach provides a qualitatively correct description of the zero-field susceptibility
and the Kondo screening cloud. The DMRG provides excellent data for the ground-state energy and
the magnetization for finite external fields. At strong interactions, finite-size effects make
it extremely difficult to recover the exponentially large zero-field susceptibility and the mesoscopically
large Kondo screening cloud.
