The curing reaction of condensed epoxy resin systems is reproduced using a novel modeling framework
combining Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and ab initio Quantum Chemical (QC) calculation
in which a reaction probability is realized via the Monte Carlo (MC) approach. Using this atomistic
simulation procedure, the evolution of network formations is examined using various ingredient
monomers of epoxy resin. Further, the emergence of atomistic branched structures around functional
groups, and correlations between their progress and the thermal and mechanical characteristics
of the polymer are investigated. The results suggest that a two-branched structure of ingredient
monomer makes a dominant contribution to the coarsening of the network formation. For a system with
a base resin having four functional groups, more than three-branched ingredients rapidly increase
at the late stage of curing conversion to increase the cross-linked density. This result has a clear
correlation with the glass transition temperature, although density and Young's modulus are affected
mainly by the backbone structure of the ingredient monomer and the degree of conversions. This modeling
framework is validated by comparing experimentally measured curing characteristics, and thermal
and mechanical properties. Our study concludes that to select the appropriate thermosetting resin
for structural materials it is necessary to consider both the rigidity of the ingredient monomer
and the number of functional groups in the monomer, which strongly affects the formation of a hydrogen
bonding network by electrostatic interaction and a cross-linked network by covalent bonding.
