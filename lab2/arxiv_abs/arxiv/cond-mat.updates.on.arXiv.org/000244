Motivated by recent experimental and theoretical progress on the Er2Ti2O7 pyrochlore XY antiferromagnet,
we study the problem of quantum order-by-disorder in pyrochlore XY systems. We consider the most
general nearest-neighbor pseudo spin-1/2 Hamiltonian for such a system characterized by anisotropic
spin-spin couplings J_e = [J_\pm, J_{\pm\pm}, J_{z\pm}, J_{zz}] and construct zero-temperature
phase diagrams. Combining symmetry arguments and spin-wave calculations, we show that the ground
state phase boundaries between the two candidate ground states of the \Gamma_5 irreducible representation,
the \psi_2 and \psi_3 (basis) states, are rather accurately determined by a cubic equation in J_{\pm}J_{\pm\pm})/J_{z\pm}^2.
Depending on the value of J_{zz}, there can be one or three phase boundaries that separate alternating
regions of \psi_2 and \psi_3 states. In particular, we find for sufficiently small J_{zz}/J_{\pm}
a narrow \psi_2 sliver sandwiched between two \psi_3 regions in the J_{\pm\pm}/J_\pm vs J_{z\pm}/J_\pm
phase diagram. Our results further illustrate the very large potential sensitivity of the ground
state of XY pyrochlore systems to minute changes in their spin Hamiltonian. Using the experimentally
determined J_3 and g-tensor values for Er2Ti2O7, we show that the heretofore neglected long-range
1/r^3 magnetostatic dipole-dipole interactions do not change the conclusion that Er2Ti2O7 has
a \psi_2 ground state induced via a quantum order-by-disorder mechanism. We propose that the CdDy2Se4
chalcogenide spinel, in which the Dy^{3+} ions form a pyrochlore lattice and may be XY-like, could
prove interesting to investigate.
