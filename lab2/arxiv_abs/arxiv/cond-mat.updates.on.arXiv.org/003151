We have extended the canonical tree tensor network (TTN) method, which was initially introduced
to simulate the zero-temperature properties of quantum lattice models on the Bethe lattice, to
finite temperature simulations. By representing the thermal density matrix with a canonicalized
tree tensor product operator, we optimize the TTN and accurately evaluate the thermodynamic quantities,
including the internal energy, specific heat, and the spontaneous magnetization, etc, at various
temperatures. By varying the anisotropic coupling constant $\Delta$, we obtain the phase diagram
of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ model on the Bethe lattice, where three kinds of magnetic ordered
phases, namely the ferromagnetic, XY and antiferromagnetic ordered phases, are found in low temperatures
and separated from the high-$T$ paramagnetic phase by a continuous thermal phase transition at
$T_c$. The XY phase is separated from the other two phases by two first-order phase transition lines
at the symmetric coupling points $ \Delta=\pm 1$. We have also carried out a linear spin wave calculation
on the Bethe lattice, showing that the low-energy magnetic excitations are always gapped, and find
the obtained magnon gaps in very good agreement with those estimated from the TTN simulations. Despite
the gapped excitation spectrum, Goldstone-like transverse fluctuation modes, as a manifestation
of spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking, are observed in the ordered magnetic phases with
$|\Delta|\le 1$. One remarkable feature there is that the prominent transverse correlation length
reaches $\xi_c=1/\ln{(z-1)}$ for $T\leq T_c$, the maximal value allowed on a $z$-coordinated
Bethe lattice.
