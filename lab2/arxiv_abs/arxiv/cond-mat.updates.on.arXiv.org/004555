Functionally graded material (FGM) is a class of advanced materials, consisting of two (or more)
different constituents, that possesses a continuously varying composition profile. With the
advancement of nanotechnology, applications of FGMs have shifted from their conventional usage
towards sophisticated micro and nanoscale electronics and energy conversion devices. Therefore,
the study of mechanical and vibrational properties of different FGM nanostructures is crucial
in exploring their feasibility for different applications. In this study, for the first time, we
employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the mechanical and vibrational properties
of radially graded Cu-Ni FGM nanowires (NW). Distribution of Cu and Ni along the radial direction
follows power-law, exponential and sigmoid functions for FGM NWs under consideration. Our results
demonstrate that, distribution function parameters play an important role in modulating the mechanical
(elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength) and vibrational (natural frequency and quality
factor) properties of FGM NWs. The study also suggests that, elastic moduli of FGM NWs can be predicted
with relatively good accuracy using Tamura and Reuss micromechanical models, regardless of NW
diameter. We found that, Euler-Bernoulli beam theory under-predicts the natural frequencies
of FGM NWs, whereas He-Lilley model closely approximates the MD results. Interestingly, FGM NWs
are always found to exhibit beat vibration because of their asymmetrical cross sections. Finally,
this is the first atomistic scale study of FGMs that directly compares MD simulations with continuum
theories and micromechanical models to understand the underlying mechanisms that govern the mechanical
and vibrational properties of FGM NWs in nanoscale.
