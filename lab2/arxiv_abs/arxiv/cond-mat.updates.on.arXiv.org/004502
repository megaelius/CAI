Frustrated three dimensional quantum magnets are notoriously impervious to theoretical analysis.
Here we use a combination of three computational methods to investigate the three dimensional pyrochlore
$S=1/2$ quantum antiferromagnet, an archetypical frustrated magnet, at finite temperature,
$T$: canonical typicality for a finite cluster of $2\times 2 \times 2$ unit cells (i.e. $32$ sites),
a finite-$T$ matrix product state method on a larger cluster with $48$ sites, and the numerical linked
cluster expansion (NLCE) using clusters up to $25$ lattice sites, which include non-trivial hexagonal
and octagonal loops. We focus on thermodynamic properties (energy, specific heat capacity, entropy,
susceptibility, magnetisation) next to the static structure factor. We find a pronounced maximum
in the specific heat at $T = 0.57 J$, which is stable across finite size clusters and converged in the
series expansion. This is well-separated from a residual amount of spectral weight of $0.47 k_B
\ln 2$ per spin which has not been released even at $T\approx0.25 J$, the limit of convergence of our
results. This is a large value compared to a number of highly frustrated models and materials, such
as spin ice or the kagome $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We also find a non-monotonic dependence
on $T$ of the magnetisation at low magnetic fields, reflecting the dominantly non-magnetic character
of the low-energy spectral weight. A detailed comparison of our results to measurements for the
$S=1$ material NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ yields rough agreement of the functional form of the specific heat
maximum, which in turn differs from the sharper maximum of the heat capacity of the spin ice material
Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, all of which are yet qualitatively distinct from conventional, unfrustrated
magnets.
