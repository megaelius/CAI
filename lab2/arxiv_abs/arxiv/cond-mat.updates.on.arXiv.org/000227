We compute the temperature-dependent barrier for alpha-relaxations in several liquids, without
adjustable parameters, using experimentally determined elastic, structural, and calorimetric
data. We employ the random first order transition(RFOT) theory, in which relaxation occurs via
activated reconfigurations between distinct, aperiodic minima of the free energy. Two different
approximations for the mismatch penalty between the distinct aperiodic states are compared, one
due to Xia and Wolynes, which scales universally with temperature as for hard spheres, and one due
to Rabochiy and Lubchenko, which employs measured elastic and structural data for individual substances.
The agreement between the predictions and experiment is satisfactory, given the uncertainty in
the measured experimental inputs. The explicitly computed barriers are used to calculate the glass
transition temperature for each substance---a kinetic quantity---from the static input data
alone. The temperature dependence of both the elastic and structural constants enters the temperature
dependence of the barrier over an extended range to a degree that varies from substance to substance.
The lowering of the configurational entropy, however, seems to be the dominant contributor to the
barrier increase near the laboratory glass transition, consistent with previous experimental
tests of the RFOT theory using the XW approximation. In addition, we compute the temperature dependence
of the dynamical correlation length, also without using adjustable parameters. These agree well
with experimental estimates obtained using the Berthier et al. procedure. Finally, we find the
temperature dependence of the complexity of a rearranging region is consistent with the picture
based on the RFOT theory but is in conflict with the assumptions of the Adam-Gibbs and "shoving" scenarios
for the viscous slowing down in supercooled liquids.
