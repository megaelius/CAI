We calculate the Hall viscosity and the nonlocal (i.e., dependent on wave vector $\bm q$) Hall conductivity
of "gapped graphene" (a non-topological insulator with two valleys) in the presence of a strong
perpendicular magnetic field. Using the linear-response theory at zero temperature within the
Dirac approximation for the Landau levels, we present analytical expressions for both valley and
total Hall viscosity and conductivity up to $\bm q^2$ at all frequencies. Although the final formulas
for total Hall viscosity and conductivity are similar to the ones previously obtained for gapless
graphene, the derivation reveals a significant difference between the two systems. First of all,
both the Hall viscosity and the Hall conductivity vanish when the Fermi level lies in the gap that
separates the lowest Landau level in the conduction band from the highest Landau level in the valence
band. It is only when the Fermi level {\it is not} in the gap that the familiar formulas of gapless graphene
are recovered. Second, in the case of gapped graphene, it is not possible (at least within our present
approach) to define a single-valley Hall viscosity: this quantity diverges with a strength proportional
to the magnitude of the gap. It is only when both valleys are included that the diverging terms, having
opposite signs in the two valleys, cancel out and the familiar result is recovered. In contrast to
this, the nonlocal Hall conductivity is finite in each valley. These results indicate that the Hoyos-Son
formula connecting the Hall viscosity to the coefficient of $q^2$ in the small-$q$ expansion of
the $q$-dependent Hall conductivity cannot be applied to each valley, but only to the system as a
whole. The problem of defining a "valley Hall viscosity" remains open.
