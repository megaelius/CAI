We study periodically driven closed systems with a long-ranged Hamiltonian by considering a generalized
Kitaev chain with pairing terms which decay with distance as a power law characterized by exponent
$\alpha$. Starting from an initial unentangled state, we show that all local quantities relax to
well-defined steady state values in the thermodynamic limit and after $n \gg 1$ drive cycles for
any $\alpha$ and driving frequency $\omega$. We introduce a distance measure, $\mathcal{D}_l(n)$,
that characterizes the approach of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem of $l$ sites to its final
steady state. We chart out the $n$ dependence of ${\mathcal D}_l(n)$ and identify a critical value
$\alpha=\alpha_c$ below which they generically decay to zero as $(\omega/n)^{1/2}$. For $\alpha
> \alpha_c$, in contrast, ${\mathcal D}_l(n) \sim (\omega/n)^{3/2}[(\omega/n)^{1/2}]$ for
$\omega \to \infty [0]$ with at least one intermediate dynamical transition. We also study the mutual
information propagation to understand the nature of the entanglement spreading in space with increasing
$n$ for such systems. We point out existence of qualitatively new features in the space-time dependence
of mutual information for $\omega < \omega^{(1)}_c$, where $\omega^{(1)}_c$ is the largest critical
frequency for the dynamical transition for a given $\alpha$. One such feature is the presence of
{\it multiple} light cone-like structures which persists even when $\alpha$ is large. We also show
that the nature of space-time dependence of the mutual information of long-ranged Hamiltonians
with $\alpha \le 2$ differs qualitatively from their short-ranged counterparts with $\alpha >
2$ for any drive frequency and relate this difference to the behavior of the Floquet group velocity
of such driven system.
