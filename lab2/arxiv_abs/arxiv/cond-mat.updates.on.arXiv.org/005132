Metasurfaces allow for the spatiotemporal variation of amplitude, phase, and polarization of
optical wavefronts. Implementation of active tunability of metasurfaces promises compact flat
optics capable of reconfigurable wavefront shaping. Phase-change materials (PCMs), such as germanium
telluride or germanium antimony telluride, are a prominent material class enabling reconfigurable
metasurfaces due to their large refractive index change upon structural transition. However,
commonly employed laser-induced switching of PCMs limits the achievable feature sizes and thus,
restricts device miniaturization. Here, we propose thermal scanning-probe-induced local switching
of germanium telluride to realize near-infrared metasurfaces with feature sizes far below what
is achievable with diffraction-limited optical switching. Our design is based on a planar multilayer
stack and does not require fabrication of protruding dielectric or metallic resonators as commonly
applied in the literature. Instead, we numerically demonstrate that a broad-band tuning of perfect
absorption could be realized by the localized and controlled tip-induced crystallization of the
PCM layer. The spectral response of the metasurface is explained using simple resonance mode analysis
and numerical simulations. To facilitate experimental realization, we provide a detailed theoretical
description of the tip-induced crystallization employing multiphysics simulations to demonstrate
the great potential for fabricating compact reconfigurable metasurfaces. Our concept allows
for tunable perfect absorption and can be applied not only for thermal imaging or sensing, but also
for spatial frequency filtering.
