We develop and extend a method presented in [S. Patinet, D. Vandembroucq, and M. L. Falk, Phys. Rev.
Lett., 117, 045501 (2016)] to compute the local yield stresses at the atomic scale in model two-dimensional
Lennard-Jones glasses produced via differing quench protocols. This technique allows us to sample
the plastic rearrangements in a non-perturbative manner for different loading directions on a
well-controlled length scale. Plastic activity upon shearing correlates strongly with the locations
of low yield stresses in the quenched states. This correlation is higher in more structurally relaxed
systems. The distribution of local yield stresses is also shown to strongly depend on the quench
protocol: the more relaxed the glass, the higher the local plastic thresholds. Analysis of the magnitude
of local plastic relaxations reveals that stress drops follow exponential distributions, justifying
the hypothesis of an average characteristic amplitude often conjectured in mesoscopic or continuum
models. The amplitude of the local plastic rearrangements increases on average with the yield stress,
regardless of the system preparation. The local yield stress varies with the shear orientation
tested and strongly correlates with the plastic rearrangement locations when the system is sheared
correspondingly. It is thus argued that plastic rearrangements are the consequence of shear transformation
zones encoded in the glass structure that possess weak slip planes along different orientations.
Finally, we justify the length scale employed in this work and extract the yield threshold statistics
as a function of the size of the probing zones. This method makes it possible to derive physically
grounded models of plasticity for amorphous materials by directly revealing the relevant details
of the shear transformation zones that mediate this process.
