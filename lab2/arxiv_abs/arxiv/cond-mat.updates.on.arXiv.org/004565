Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are nowadays one of the most studied semiconductors due to their
exceptional performance as active layers in solar cells. Although MHPs are excellent solid-state
semiconductors, they are also ionic compounds, where ion migration plays a decisive role in their
formation, their photovoltaic performance and their long-term stability. Given the above-mentioned
complexity, molecular dynamics simulations based on classical force fields are especially suited
to study MHP properties, such as lattice dynamics and ion migration. In particular, the possibility
to model mixed compositions is important since they are the most relevant to optimize the optical
band gap and the stability. With this intention, we employ DFT calculations and a genetic algorithm
to develop a fully transferable classical force field valid for the benchmark inorganic perovskite
compositional set CsPb(Br_xI_(1-x))_3 (x = 0,1/3,2/3,1). The resulting force field reproduces
correctly, with a common set of parameters valid for all compositions, the experimental lattice
parameter as a function of bromide/iodide ratio, the ion-ion distances and the XRD spectra of the
pure and mixed structures. The simulated thermal conductivities and ion migration activation
energies of the pure compounds are also in good agreement with experimental trends. Our molecular
dynamics simulations make it possible to predict the compositional dependence of the ionic diffusion
coefficient on bromide/iodide ratio and vacancy concentration. For vacancy concentrations of
around 9 10^21 cm^-3, we obtained ionic diffusion coefficients at ambient temperature of 10^-11
and 10^-13 cm2/s for CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, respectively. Interestingly, in comparison with the pure
compounds, we predict a significantly lower activation energy for vacancy migration and faster
diffusion for the mixed perovskites.
