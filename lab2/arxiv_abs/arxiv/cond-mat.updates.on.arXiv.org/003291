We report systematic studies of CeCu$_9$In$_2$, which appears to be a new Kondo lattice system.
Electrical resistivity exhibits a logarithmic law characteristic of Kondo systems with a broad
maximum at $T_{coh}\approx$45 K and it obeys the Fermi liquid theory at low temperature. Specific
heat of CeCu$_9$In$_2$ is well described by the Einstein and Debye models with electronic part at
high temperature. Fitting of the Schottky formula to low temperature 4f contribution to specific
heat yielded crystal field splitting of 50.2 K between a doublet and quasi-quartet. The Schotte-Schotte
model estimates roughly Kondo temperature as $T_K\approx$5 K, but does not reproduce well the data
due to a sharp peak at 1.6 K. This structure should be attributed to a phase transition, a nature of
which is possibly antiferromagnetic. Specific heat is characterized with increased Sommerfeld
coefficient estimated as $\gamma\approx$132 mJ/(mole$\cdot$K$^2$). Spectra of the valence
band, which have been collected with ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), show a peak
at binding energy$\approx$250 meV, which originates from the Ce 4f electrons and is related to the
4f$^1$$_{7/2}$ final state. Extracted 4f contribution to the spectral function exhibits also
the enhancement of intensity in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Satellite structure of the Ce 3d
levels spectra measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been analyzed within the
framework of the Gunnarsson-Sch\"onhammer theory. Theoretical calculations based on density
functional theory (FPLO method with LDA+U approach) delivered densities of states, band structures
and Fermi surfaces for CeCu$_9$In$_2$ and LaCu$_9$In$_2$. The results indicate that Fermi surface
nesting takes place in CeCu$_9$In$_2$.
