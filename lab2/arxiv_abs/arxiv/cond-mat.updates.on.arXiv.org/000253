We study the non-adiabatic dynamics of a 2D p+ip superfluid following a quantum quench of the BCS
coupling constant. The model describes a topological superconductor with a non-trivial BCS (trivial
BEC) phase appearing at weak (strong) coupling strengths. We extract the exact long-time asymptotics
of the order parameter \Delta(t) by exploiting the integrability of the classical p-wave Hamiltonian,
which we establish via a Lax construction. Three different types of behavior can occur depending
upon the strength and direction of the quench. In phase I, the order parameter asymptotes to zero.
In phase II, \Delta(t) goes to a non-zero constant. Phase III is characterized by persistent oscillations
of \Delta(t). For quenches within I and II, we determine the topological character of the asymptotic
states. We show that two different formulations of the bulk topological winding number, although
equivalent in the ground state, must be regarded as independent out of equilibrium. The first number
Q characterizes the Anderson pseudospin texture of the initial state; we show that it is conserved.
For non-zero Q, this leads to the prediction of a "gapless topological" state when \Delta(t) goes
to zero. The presence or absence of Majorana edge modes in a sample with a boundary is encoded in the
second winding number W, formulated in terms of the retarded Green's function. We show that W can
change following a quench across the quantum critical point. We discuss the implications for the
(dis)appearance of Majorana edge modes. Finally, we show that the parity of zeros in the bulk out-of-equilibrium
Cooper pair distribution function constitutes a Z2-valued quantum number, which is non-zero whenever
W differs from Q. The pair distribution can in principle be measured using RF spectroscopy in an ultracold
atom realization, allowing direct experimental detection of the bulk Z2 number.
