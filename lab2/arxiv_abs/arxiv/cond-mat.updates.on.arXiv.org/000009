We study theoretically magnetoresistance (MR) of graphene with different types of disorder. For
short-range disorder, the key parameter determining magnetotransport properties---a product
of the cyclotron frequency and scattering time---depends in graphene not only on magnetic field
$H$ but also on the electron energy $\varepsilon$. As a result, a strong, square-root in $H$, MR arises
already within the Drude-Boltzmann approach. The MR is particularly pronounced near the Dirac
point. Furthermore, for the same reason, "quantum" (separated Landau levels) and "classical"
(overlapping Landau levels) regimes may coexist in the same sample at fixed $H.$ We calculate the
conductivity tensor within the self-consistent Born approximation for the case of relatively
high temperature, when Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are suppressed by thermal averaging. We
predict a square-root MR both at very low and at very high $H:$ $[\varrho_{xx}(H)-\varrho_{xx}(0)]/\varrho_{xx}(0)\approx
C \sqrt{H},$ where $C$ is a temperature-dependent factor, different in the low- and strong-field
limits and containing both "quantum" and "classical" contributions. We also find a nonmonotonic
dependence of the Hall coefficient both on magnetic field and on the electron concentration. In
the case of screened charged impurities, we predict a strong temperature-independent MR near the
Dirac point. Further, we discuss the competition between disorder- and collision-dominated mechanisms
of the MR. In particular, we find that the square-root MR is always established for graphene with
charged impurities in a generic gated setup at low temperature.
