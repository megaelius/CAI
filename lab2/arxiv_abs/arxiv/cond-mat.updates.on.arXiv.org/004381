Multilayer graphene lattices allow for an additional tunability of the band structure by the strong
perpendicular electric field. In particular, the emergence of the new multiple Dirac points in
ABA stacked trilayer graphene subject to strong transverse electric fields was proposed theoretically
and confirmed experimentally. These new Dirac points dubbed "gullies" emerge from the interplay
between strong electric field and trigonal warping. In this work we first characterize the properties
of new emergent Dirac points and show that the electric field can be used to tune the distance between
gullies in the momentum space. We demonstrate that the band structure has multiple Lifshitz transitions
and higher-order singularity of "monkey saddle" type. Following the characterization of the band
structure, we consider the spectrum of Landau levels and structure of their wave functions. In the
limit of strong electric fields when gullies are well separated in momentum space, they give rise
to triply degenerate Landau levels. In the second part of this work, we investigate how degeneracy
between three gully Landau levels is lifted in presence of interactions. Within the Hartree-Fock
approximation we show that the symmetry breaking state interpolates between fully gully polarized
state that breaks $C_3$ symmetry at high displacement field, and the gully symmetric state when
the electric field is decreased. The discontinuous transition between these two states is driven
by enhanced inter-gully tunneling and exchange. We conclude by outlining specific experimental
predictions for the existence of such a symmetry-breaking state.
