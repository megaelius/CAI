The Preisach model has been useful as a null-model for understanding memory formation in periodically
driven disordered systems. In amorphous solids for example, the athermal response to shear is due
to localized plastic events (soft spots). As shown recently by one of us, the plastic response to
applied shear can be rigorously described in terms of a directed network whose transitions correspond
to one or more soft spots changing states. The topology of this graph depends on the interactions
between soft-spots and when such interactions are negligible, the resulting description becomes
that of the Preisach model. A first step in linking transition graph topology with the underlying
soft-spot interactions is therefore to determine the structure of such graphs in the absence of
interactions. Here we perform a detailed analysis of the transition graph of the Preisach model.
We highlight the important role played by return point memory in organizing the graph into a hierarchy
of loops and sub-loops. Our analysis reveals that the topology of a large portion of this graph is
actually not governed by the values of the switching fields that describe the individual hysteretic
behavior of the individual elements, but by a coarser parameter, a permutation $\rho$ which prescribes
the sequence in which the individual hysteretic elements change their states as the main hysteresis
loop is traversed. This in turn allows us to derive combinatorial properties, such as the number
of major loops in the transition graph as well as the number of states $| \mathcal{R} |$ constituting
the main hysteresis loop and its nested subloops. We find that $| \mathcal{R} |$ is equal to the number
of increasing subsequences contained in the permutation $\rho$.
