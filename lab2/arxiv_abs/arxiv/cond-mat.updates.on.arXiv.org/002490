When an amorphous material is strained beyond the point of yielding it enters a state of continual
reconfiguration via dissipative, avalanche-like slip events that relieve built-up local stress.
However, how the statistics of such events depend on local interactions among the constituent units
remains debated. To address this we perform experiments on granular material in which we use particle
shape to vary the interactions systematically. Granular material, confined under constant pressure
boundary conditions, is uniaxially compressed while stress is measured and internal rearrangements
are imaged with x-rays. We introduce volatility, a quantity from economic theory, as a powerful
new tool to quantify the magnitude of stress fluctuations, finding systematic, shape-dependent
trends. For all 22 investigated shapes the magnitude $s$ of relaxation events is well-fit by a truncated
power law distribution $P(s)\sim {s}^{-\tau} exp(-s/s^*)$, as has been proposed within the context
of plasticity models. The power law exponent $\tau$ for all shapes tested clusters around $\tau=$
1.5, within experimental uncertainty covering the range 1.3 - 1.7. The shape independence of $\tau$
and its compatibility with mean field models indicate that the granularity of the system, but not
particle shape, modifies the stress redistribution after a slip event away from that of continuum
elasticity. Meanwhile, the characteristic maximum event size $s^*$ changes by two orders of magnitude
and tracks the shape dependence of volatility. Particle shape in granular materials is therefore
a powerful new factor influencing the distance at which an amorphous system operates from scale-free
criticality. These experimental results are not captured by current models and suggest a need to
reexamine the mechanisms driving mesoscale plastic deformation in amorphous systems.
