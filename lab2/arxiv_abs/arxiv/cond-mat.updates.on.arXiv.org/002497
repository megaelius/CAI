Specimen- and grain-size effects on nanoscale plastic deformation mechanisms and mechanical
properties of polycrystalline yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia (YSTZ) nanopillars are
studied by molecular dynamics simulations. Through uniaxial compression of YSTZ columnar nanopillars,
intergranular and transgranular deformation mechanisms are investigated. Cooperative intergranular
deformations including grain boundary sliding and migration, grain rotation, and amorphous phase
formation at grain boundaries are revealed. Results also reveal formation of partial dislocations,
which act as splitters of large grains and play a significant role in facilitating the rotation of
grains, and consequently promote amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition in-between neighboring
grains. An increase in free surface-to-volume ratio is found to be responsible for specimen size-induced
softening phenomenon, where a decrease in Young modulus and strength is observed when the specimen
width decreases from 30 nm to 10 nm. Also, a decrease in Young modulus and strength is revealed with
the decrease of average grain size from 15 nm to 5 nm. Grain boundary density is identified to be responsible
for the observed grain size-induced softening behavior in polycrystalline YSTZ nanopillars.
A transition in dominant deformation mechanism is observed from amorphous phase formation at grain
boundaries to a competition between intergranular grain boundary sliding and transgranular phase
transformation. Furthermore, an inverse Hall-Petch relationship is revealed describing the
correlation between grain size and strength for polycrystalline YSTZ nanopillars with grain sizes
below 15 nm.
