We propose experimentally feasible ways to probe universal features of absorbing phase transitions
from two different approaches, both based on numerical validations. On one hand, we numerically
study a probability distribution of duration/length of intervals of local inactive state in quasi-steady
state, which has been very commonly used in experiments, in a case of the contact process. We show
that the distributions obey the universal scaling ansatz expected from phenomenological scaling
argument, but that care must be taken in order to suppress a bias caused by censoring due to a finite
observation window. To demonstrate the latter point, we compare the distributions for the temporal
intervals estimated through conventional histograms with those through the estimator which properly
takes account of censoring and sampling bias. On the other hand, we also propose that, if a system
is subject to uniform advection as is often the case with flowing systems, a correlation length and
a correlation time near the transition point can be easily quantified by supplying the system with
an active boundary condition. In order to support our proposal, we introduce a new model whose advection
strength can be arbitrarily controlled. The results of numerical simulations on our model suggest
that a correlation time, which is difficult to measure through the interval distributions without
the aforementioned bias, can be measured through characteristic decay length of an order parameter.
Crossovers between two different power-law behaviors are also identified in this case, and the
universal scaling ans\"{a}tze associated with the crossovers are discussed.
