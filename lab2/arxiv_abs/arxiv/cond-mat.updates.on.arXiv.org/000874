We consider two-dimensional (2D) Dirac quantum ring systems formed by the infinite mass constraint.
When an Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux is present, e.g., through the center of the ring domain, persistent
currents, i.e., permanent currents without dissipation, can arise. In real materials, impurities
and defects are inevitable, raising the issue of robustness of the persistent currents. Using localized
random potential to simulate the disorders, we investigate how the ensemble averaged current magnitude
varies with the disorder density. For comparison, we study the nonrelativistic quantum counterpart
by analyzing the solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation under the same geometrical and disorder
settings. We find that, for the Dirac ring system, as the disorder density is systematically increased,
the average current decreases slowly initially and then plateaus at a finite nonzero value, indicating
remarkable robustness of the persistent currents. The physical mechanism responsible for the
robustness is the emergence of a class of boundary states - whispering gallery modes. In contrast,
in the Schr\"{o}dinger ring system, such boundary states cannot form and the currents diminish
rapidly to zero with increase in the disorder density. We develop a physical theory based on a quasi
one-dimensional approximation to understand the striking contrast in the behaviors of the persistent
currents in the Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger rings. Our 2D Dirac ring systems with disorders can be
experimentally realized, e.g., on the surface of a topological insulator with natural or deliberately
added impurities from the fabrication process.
