We study the motion of several types of domain wall profiles in spin-orbit coupled magnetic nanowires
and also the influence of spin-orbit interaction on the ferromagnetic resonance of uniform magnetic
films. We extend previous studies by fully considering not only the field-like contribution from
the spin-orbit torque, but also the recently derived Slonczewski-like spin-orbit torque. We show
that the latter interaction affects both the domain wall velocity and the Walker breakdown threshold
non-trivially, which suggests that it should be accounted in experimental data analysis. We find
that the presence of multiple spin-orbit torques may render the Walker breakdown to be universal
in the sense that the threshold is completely independent on the material-dependent Gilbert damping,
non-adiabaticity, and the chirality of the domain wall. We also find that domain wall motion against
the current injection is sustained in the presence of multiple spin-orbit torques and that the wall
profile will determine the qualitative influence of these different types of torques (e.g. field-like
and Slonczewski-like). In addition, we consider a uniform ferromagnetic layer under a current
bias, and find that the resonance frequency becomes asymmetric against the current direction in
the presence of Slonczewski-like spin-orbit coupling. This is in contrast with those cases where
such an interaction is absent, where the frequency is found to be symmetric with respect to the current
direction. This finding shows that spin-orbit interactions may offer additional control over
pumped and absorbed energy in a ferromagnetic resonance setup by manipulating the injected current
direction.
