We propose an efficient microscopic design procedure of electronic band structures having intrinsic
spin and momentum dependences in spin-orbit-coupling free antiferromagnets. Our bottom-up design
approach to creating desired spin-split and reshaped band structures could result in further findings
of practical spin-orbit-coupling free materials exhibiting a giant spin-dependent and/or nonreciprocal
transport, magneto-electric and elastic responses as a consequence of such band structures. We
establish a systematic guideline to construct symmetric/antisymmetric spin-split and antisymmetrically
deformed spin-independent band structures in spin-orbit-coupling free systems by using two polar
multipole degrees of freedom, electric and magnetic toroidal multipoles. The two polar multipoles
describe arbitrary degrees of freedom in the hopping Hamiltonian, whose onsite and offsite degrees
of freedom in a cluster are described as the cluster and bond multipoles, respectively, and another
degree of freedom connecting between clusters is expressed as momentum multipoles. By using these
multipole descriptions, we elucidate simple microscopic conditions to realize intrinsic band
deformations in magnetically ordered states: The symmetric spin splitting is realized in collinear
magnets when cluster and bond multipoles contain the same symmetry of multipoles. The antisymmetric
spin splitting occurs in noncollinear antiferromagnets when a bond-type magnetic toroidal multipole
is present. Furthermore, the antisymmetric band deformation with spin degeneracy is realized
in noncoplanar antiferromagnets. We exemplify three lattice systems in order to demonstrate the
band deformations under the magnetic ordering. On the basis of the proposed procedure, we list up
various candidate materials showing intrinsic band deformations in accordance with MAGNDATA,
magnetic structures database.
