Optical second-harmonic generation is demonstrated to be a sensitive probe of the buried interface
between the lattice matched semiconductors gallium phosphide and silicon with (001) orientation.
Rotational anisotropy measurements of SHG from GaP/Si show a strong isotropic component of the
response not present for pure Si(001) or GaP(001). The strength of the overlaying anisotropic response
directly correlates with the quality of the interface as determined by atomically resolved scanning
transmission electron microscopy.Optical second-harmonic generation is demonstrated to be

of samples fabricated with different growth modes in metal organic vapor phase epitaxy reveals
that the anisotropy for different polarization combinations can be used as a selective fingerprint
for the occurrence of anti-phase domains and twins. This all-optical technique can be applied as
an {\it in-situ} and non-invasive monitor even during growth. Systematic comparison of samples
