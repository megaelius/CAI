A thermoelectric voltage is induced in a junction, constituted of two dissimilar materials under
a temperature gradient. Similarly, a thermosize voltage is expected to be induced in a junction
made by the same material but having different sizes, so-called thermosize junction. This is a consequence
of dissimilarity in Seebeck coefficients due to differences in classical and/or quantum size effects
in the same materials with different sizes. The studies on thermosize effects in literature are
mainly based on semi-classical models under relaxation time approximation or even simpler local
equilibrium ones where only very general ideas and results have been discussed without considering
quantum transport approaches and specific materials. To make more realistic predictions for a
possible experimental verification, here, we consider ballistic thermosize junctions made by
narrow and wide ($n$-$w$) pristine graphene nanoribbons with perfect armchair edges and calculate
the electronic contribution to the thermosize voltage, at room temperature, by using the Landauer
formalism. The results show that the maximum thermosize voltage can be achieved for semiconducting
nanoribbons and it is about an order of magnitude larger than that of metallic nanoribbons. In the
semiconducting case, the thermosize voltage forms a characteristic plateau for a finite range
of gating conditions. We demonstrate, through numerical calculations, that the induced thermosize
voltage per temperature difference can be in the scale of mV/K, which is high enough for experimental
measurements. Owing to their high and persistent thermosize voltage values, graphene nanoribbons
are expected to be good candidate for device applications of thermosize effects.
