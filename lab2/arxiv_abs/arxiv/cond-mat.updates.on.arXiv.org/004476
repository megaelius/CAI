Two-dimensional transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDCs) have shown great potential as good
quality thermoelectric materials at high temperature since past few years due to their suitable
band gap tunabilty, low dimensionality and fantastic combination of electrical conductivity
and lattice thermal conductivity. Here, a first principles calculations of electronic and thermoelectric
performance of two dimensional monolayer HfS 2 , HfSe 2 and their Janus monolayer HfSSe has been performed
with the help of density functional theory and Boltzmann transport equation. Thermodynamical
stability of all three structures has been confirmed from phonon dispersion curves. The thermoelectric
parameters such as Seebeck coefficient, power factor and electrical conductivity have been calculated
at 300K, 400K and 500K. The lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature has been found very
low in monolayer HfS 2 , HfSe 2 and HfSSe Janus monolayer as compared to very popular TMDCs such as MoS
2 and WS 2 . An ultralow value of lattice thermal conductivity of the value of 0.36 W/mK at room temperature
in Janus monolayer HfSSe has been found which is lower than that of monolayer HfS 2 and HfSe 2 because
of the very low group velocity and short phonon lifetime in HfSSe. This ultralow lattice thermal
conductivity in Janus monolayer HfSSe results a very high thermoelectric figure of merit close
to the value of 1 at room temperature. By constructing the Janus monolayer of HfS 2 and HfSe 2 the thermoelectric
performances significantly enhanced. Our theoretical investigation predicts that Janus monolayer
HfSSe can be a revolutionary candidate for the fabrication of next generation wearable thermoelectric
power generator to convert human body heat into electricity.
