Quantum chaotic and integrable systems are known to exhibit a characteristic $1/f$ and $1/f^{2}$
noise, respectively, in the power spectrum associated to their spectral fluctuations. This can
be exploited through the $\delta_{n}$ statistic. Theoretical expected values for both the integrable
and the chaotic case have been derived and known for fifteen years. Recently [R. Riser, V. A. Osipov,
and E. Kanzieper, Power Spectrum of Long Eigenlevel Sequences in Quantum Chaotic Systems, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 118, 204101 (2017)] a restriction on the mathematical conditions under which these curves
should be obtained has been published, which seemingly supposed an invalidation of the traditional
picture previously admitted for the power spectrum of this spectral statistic. This work treats
the current scenario for the integrable and chaotic regularity classes separately. For the integrable
case, we propose one protocol to follow if one wishes to successfully perform quantum spectral analyses
based on formerly established results, which actually do remain valid. The theoretical expression
for the chaotic case is only known up to a good approximation and is methodologically centered around
the assumption that two-point correlations are enough to account for the dynamics. The abovementioned
work introduced a new approach by which corrections beyond two-point correlations should be accommodated.
By means of a rigorous statistical test on the chaotic theoretical curve, we show the original approximation
provides a sufficiently safe and accurate description for this class of quantum systems and its
correct application is indeed guaranteed for the vast majority of situations. Finally, we display
an explicit tranisition from the chaotic to the integrable regime for a real, transiting, physical
system, to which we apply the protocol we devise in this work, which yields excellent results.
