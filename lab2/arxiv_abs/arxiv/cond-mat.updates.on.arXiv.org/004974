The ultra-wide bandgap, high breakdown electric field, and large-area affordable substrates
make \b{eta}-Ga2O3 promising for applications of next-generation power electronics while its
thermal conductivity is at least one order of magnitude lower than other wide/ultrawide bandgap
semiconductors. To avoid the degradation of device performance and reliability induced by the
localized Joule-heating, aggressive thermal management strategies are essential, especially
for high-power high-frequency applications. This work reports a scalable thermal management
strategy to heterogeneously integrate wafer-scale monocrystalline \b{eta}-Ga2O3 thin films
on high thermal conductivity SiC substrates by ion-cutting technique. The thermal boundary conductance
(TBC) of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3-SiC interfaces and thermal conductivity of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3 thin
films were measured by Time-domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR) to evaluate the effects of interlayer
thickness and thermal annealing. Materials characterizations were performed to understand the
mechanisms of thermal transport in these structures. The results show that the \b{eta}-Ga2O3-SiC
TBC values increase with decreasing interlayer thickness and the \b{eta}-Ga2O3 thermal conductivity
increases more than twice after annealing at 800 oC due to the removal of implantation-induced strain
in the films. A Callaway model is built to understand the measured thermal conductivity. Small spot-to-spot
variations of both TBC and Ga2O3 thermal conductivity confirm the uniformity and high-quality
of the bonding and exfoliation. Our work paves the way for thermal management of power electronics
and \b{eta}-Ga2O3 related semiconductor devices.
