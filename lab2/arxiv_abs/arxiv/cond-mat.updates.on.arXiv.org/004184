Active matter exhibits various forms of non-equilibrium states in the absence of external forcing,
including macroscopic steady-state currents. Such states are often too complex to be modelled
from first principles and our understanding of their physics relies heavily on minimal models.
These have mostly been studied in the case of "dry" active matter, where particle dynamics are dominated
by friction with their surroundings. Significantly less is known about systems with long-range
hydrodynamic interactions that belong to "wet" active matter. Dilute suspensions of motile bacteria,
modelled as self-propelled dipolar particles interacting solely through long-ranged hydrodynamic
fields, are arguably the most studied example from this class of active systems. Their phenomenology
is well-established: at sufficiently high density of bacteria, there appear large-scale vortices
and jets comprising many individual organisms, forming a chaotic state commonly known as \emph{bacterial
turbulence}. As revealed by computer simulations, below the onset of collective motion, the suspension
exhibits very strong correlations between individual microswimmers stemming from the long-ranged
nature of dipolar fields. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenology is captured by the minimal
model of microswimmers. We develop a kinetic theory that goes beyond the commonly used mean-field
assumption, and explicitly takes into account such correlations. Notably, these can be computed
exactly within our theory. We calculate the fluid velocity variance, spatial and temporal correlation
functions, the fluid velocity spectrum, and the enhanced diffusivity of tracer particles. We find
that correlations are suppressed by particle self-propulsion, although the mean-field behaviour
is not restored even in the limit of very fast swimming.
