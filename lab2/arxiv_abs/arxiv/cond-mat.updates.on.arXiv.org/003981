Tuning the low-energy magnetic dynamics is a key element in designing novel magnetic metamaterials,
spintronic devices and magnonic logic circuits. This study uncovers a new, highly effective way
of controlling the magnetic permeability via shaping the magnonic properties in coupled magnetic
waveguides separated by current carrying spacer with strong spin-orbit coupling. The spin-orbit
torques exerted on the waveguides leads to an externally tunable enhancement of magnetic damping
in one waveguide and a decreased damping in the other, constituting so a magnetic parity-time (PT)
symmetric system with emergent magnetic properties at the verge of the exceptional point where
magnetic gains/losses are balanced. In addition to controlling the magnetic permeability, phenomena
inherent to PT-symmetric systems are identified, including the control on magnon power oscillations,
nonreciprocal magnon propagation, magnon trapping and enhancement as well as the increased sensitivity
to magnetic perturbation and abrupt spin reversal. These predictions are demonstrated analytically
and confirmed by full numerical simulations under experimentally feasible conditions. The position
of the exceptional points and the strength of the spontaneous PT symmetry breaking can be tuned by
external electric and/or magnetic fields. The roles of the intrinsic magnetic damping, and the
possibility of an electric control via Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are exposed and utilized
for mode dispersion shaping and magnon amplification and trapping. The results point to a new route
to designing optomagnonic waveguides, traps, sensors, and circuits.
