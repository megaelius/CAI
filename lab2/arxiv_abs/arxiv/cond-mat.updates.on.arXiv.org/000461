We theoretically consider transport properties of a normal metal (N)- superconducting semiconductor
nanowire (S)-normal metal (N) structure (NSN) in the context of the possible existence of Majorana
bound states in disordered semiconductor-superconductor hybrid systems in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling and Zeeman splitting induced by an external magnetic field. We study in details the transport
signatures of the topological quantum phase transition as well as the existence of the Majorana
bound states in the electrical transport properties of the NSN structure. Our theory includes the
realistic nonperturbative effects of disorder, which is detrimental to the topological phase
(eventually suppressing the superconducting gap completely), and the effects of the tunneling
barriers (or the transparency at the tunneling NS contacts), which affect (and suppress) the zero
bias conductance peak associated with the zero energy Majorana bound states. We show that in the
presence of generic disorder and barrier transparency the interpretation of the zero bias peak
as being associated with the Majorana bound state is problematic since the nonlocal correlations
between the two NS contacts at two ends may not manifest themselves in the tunneling conductance
through the whole NSN structure. We establish that a simple modification of the standard transport
measurements using conductance differences (rather than the conductance itself as in a single
NS junction) as the measured quantity can allow direct observation of the nonlocal correlations
inherent in the Majorana bound states and enables the mapping out of the topological phase diagram
(even in the presence of considerable disorder) by precisely detecting the topological quantum
phase transition point.
