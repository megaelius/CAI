Recent years have witnessed tremendous success in the discovery of topological states of matter.
Particularly, sophisticated theoretical methods in time-reversal-invariant topological phases
have been developed, leading to the comprehensive search of crystal database and the prediction
of thousands of new topological materials. In contrast, the discovery of magnetic topological
phases that break time reversal is still limited to several exemplary materials because the coexistence
of magnetism and topological electronic band structure is rare in a single compound. To overcome
this challenge, we propose an alternative approach to realize the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)
effect, a typical example of magnetic topological phase, via engineering two-dimensional (2D)
magnetic van der Waals heterojunctions. Instead of a single magnetic topological material, we
search for the combinations of two 2D (typically trivial) magnetic insulator compounds with specific
band alignment so that they can together form a type-III heterojunction with topologically non-trivial
band structure. By combining the data-driven materials search, first principles calculations,
and the symmetry-based analytical models, we identify 8 type-III heterojunctions consisting
of 2D ferromagnetic insulator materials from a family of 2D monolayer MXY compounds (M = metal atoms,
X = S, Se, Te, Y = F, Cl, Br, I) as a set of candidates for the QAH effect. In particular, we directly calculate
the topological invariant (Chern number) and chiral edge states in the MnNF/MnNCl heterojunction
with ferromagnetic stacking. This work illustrates how data-driven material science can be combined
with symmetry-based physical principles to guide the search for novel heterojunction-based quantum
materials hosting the QAH effect and other exotic quantum states in general.
