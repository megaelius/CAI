Over the last three decades a large number of experimental studies on several quasi one-dimensional
(1D) metals and quasi1D Mott-Hubbard insulators have produced evidence for distinct spectral
features identified with charge-only and spin-only fractionalized particles. They can be also
observed in ultra-cold atomic 1D optical lattices a nd quantum wires. 1D exactly solvable models
provide nontrivial tests of the approaches for these systems relying on field theories. Different
schemes such as the pseudofermion dynamical theory (PDT) and the mobile quantum impurity model
(MQIM) have revealed that the 1D correlated models high-energy physics is qualitatively different
from that of a low-energy Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL). This includes the momentum dependence
of the exponents that control the one- and two-particle dynamical correlation functions near their
spectra edges and in the vicinity of one-particle singular spectral features. On the one hand, the
low-energy charge-only and spin-only fractionalized particles are usually identified with holons
and spinons, respectively. On the other hand, `particle-like' representations in terms of {\it
pseudoparticles}, related PDT {\it pseudofermions}, and MQIM particles are suitable for the description
of both the low-energy TLL physics and high-energy spectral and dynamical properties of 1D correlated
systems. The main goal of this review is to revisit the usefulness of pseudoparticle and PDT pseudofermion
representations for the study of both static and high-energy spectral and dynamical properties
of the 1D Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, spin-$1/2$ isotropic Heisenberg chain, and 1D Hubbard model. Moreover,
the relation between the PDT and the MQIM is clarified.
