Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have Weyl nodes where conduction and valence bands meet in the absence of
inversion or time-reversal symmetry (TRS), or both. Interesting phenomena are expected in WSMs
such as the chiral magnetic effect, anomalous Hall conductivity or Nernst effect, and unique quantum
oscillations. The TRS-broken WSM phase can be driven from a topological Dirac semimetal (DSM) by
magnetic field or magnetic dopants, considering that DSMs have degenerate Weyl nodes stabilized
by rotational symmetry, i.e. Dirac nodes. Here we develop a Wannier-function-based tight-binding
(WF-TB) model to investigate the formation of Weyl nodes and nodal rings induced by B field in the
topological DSM Na$_3$Bi. The field is applied along the rotational axis. Remarkably, our study
based on the WF-TB model shows that upon B field each Dirac node is split into four separate Weyl nodes
along the rotational axis near the Fermi level; two nodes with single chiral charge (single Weyl
nodes) and two with double chiral charge (double Weyl nodes). This result is in contrast to the common
belief that each Dirac node splits into two Weyl nodes. In the effective models, the existence of
double Weyl nodes ensures nonzero cubic terms in momentum. We further examine the evolution of Fermi
arcs at a side surface as a function of chemical potential. The number of Fermi arcs is consistent
with the corresponding Fermi surface Chern numbers, corroborating our finding of the double Weyl
nodes. Furthermore, our study reveals the existence of nodal rings in the mirror plane below the
Fermi level upon B field. These nodal rings persist with spin-orbit coupling, in contrast to typical
nodal ring semimetals. Our WF-TB model can be used to compute interesting features arising from
Berry curvature such as anomalous Hall and thermal conductivities, and our findings can be applied
to other topological DSMs like Cd$_3$As$_2$.
