Zinc-blende CdSe semiconducting nanoplatelets (NPL) show outstanding quantum confinement properties
thanks to their small, atomically-controlled, thickness. For example, they display extremely
sharp absorption peaks that make them very interesting objects for optoelectronic applications.
However, the presence of a ground-state electric dipole for these nanoparticles has not yet been
investigated. We therefore used transient electric birefringence (TEB) to probe the electric
dipole of 5-monolayer thick zinc-blende CdSe NPL with a parallelepipedic shape. We studied a dilute
dispersion of isolated NPL coated with branched ligands and we measured, as a function of time, the
birefringence induced by DC and AC field pulses. The electro-optic behavior proves the presence
of a large dipolar moment (> 245 D) oriented along the length of the platelets. We then induced the
slow face-to-face stacking of the NPL by adding oleic acid. In these stacks, the in-plane dipole
components of consecutive NPL cancel whereas their normal components add. Moreover, interestingly,
the excess polarizability tensor of the NPL stacks gives rise to an electro-optic contribution
opposite to that of the electric dipole. By monitoring the TEB signal of the slowly-growing stacks
over up to a year, we extracted the evolution of their average length with time and we showed that their
electro-optic response can be explained by the presence of a 80 D dipolar component parallel to their
normal. In spite of the $\bar{4}$3m space group of bulk ZB CdSe, these NPL thus bear an important ground-state
dipole whose magnitude per unit volume is twice that found for wurtzite CdSe nanorods. We discuss
the possible origin of this electric dipole, its consequences for the optical properties of these
nanoparticles, and how it could explain their strong stacking propensity that severely hampers
their colloidal stability.
