Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to explore the dynamical crossover phenomenon
in strongly confined and mildly supercooled water in graphene oxide nanopores. In contrast to studies
where confinement is used to study the properties of bulk water, we are interested in the dynamical
transitions for strongly confined water in the absence of any bulk-like water. The influence of
the physicochemical nature of the graphene oxide surface on the dynamical transitions is investigated
by varying the extent of hydrophobicity on the confining surfaces placed at an inter-surface separation
of 10 \AA\,. All dynamical quantities show a typical slowing down as the temperature is lowered from
298 to 200 K; however, the nature of the transition is a distinct function of the surface type. Water
confined between surfaces consisting of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions exhibit
a strong-to-strong dynamical transition in the diffusion coefficients and rotational relaxation
times at a crossover temperature of 237 K and show a fragile-to-strong transition in the $\alpha$-relaxation
time at 238 K. The observed crossover temperature is much higher than the freezing point of the SPC/E
water model used in this study, indicating that these dynamical transitions can occur with mild
supercooling under strong confinement in the absence of bulk-like water. In contrast, water confined
in hydrophilic pore shows a single Arrhenius energy barrier over the entire temperature range.
Our results indicate that in addition to confinement, the nature of the surface can play a critical
role in determining the dynamical transitions for water upon supercooling.
