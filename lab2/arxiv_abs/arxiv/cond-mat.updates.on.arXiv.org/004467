In this work, we study the fluctuation relation and the second law of thermodynamics within a quantum
linear oscillator externally driven over the period of time t = tau. To go beyond the standard approach
(the two-point projective measurement one) to this subject and also render it discussed in both
quantum and classical domains on the single footing, we recast this standard approach in terms of
the Wigner function and its propagator in the phase space (x,p). With the help of the canonical transformation
from (x,p) to the angle-action coordinates (\phi,I), we can then derive a measurement-free (classical-like)
form of the Crooks fluctuation relation in the Wigner representation. This enables us to introduce
the work W_{I_0,I_{tau}} associated with a single run from (I_0) to (I_{tau}) over the period tau,
which is a quantum generalization of the thermodynamic work with its roots in the classical thermodynamics.
This quantum work differs from the energy difference e_{I_0,I_{tau}} = e(I_{tau}) - e(I_0) unless
beta, hbar --> 0. Consequently, we will obtain the quantum second-law inequality Delta F_{beta}
\leq <W>_{P} \leq <e>_{P} = Delta U, where P, Delta F_{beta}, and <W>_P denote the work (quasi)-probability
distribution, the free energy difference, and the average work distinguished from the internal
energy difference Delta U, respectively, while <W>_P --> Delta U in the limit of beta, hbar --> 0 only.
Therefore, we can also introduce the quantum heat Q_q = Delta U - W even for a thermally isolated system,
resulting from the quantum fluctuation therein. This is a more fine-grained result than <W>_P =
Delta U obtained from the standard approach. Owing to the measurement-free nature of the thermodynamic
work W_{I_0,I_{tau}}, our result can also apply to the (non-thermal) initial states rho_0 = (1-gamma)
rho_{beta} + gamma sigma with sigma \ne rho_{beta}.
