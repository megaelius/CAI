We perform computational studies of repulsive, frictionless disks to investigate the development
of stress anisotropy in mechanically stable (MS) packings. We focus on two protocols for generating
MS packings: 1) isotropic compression and 2) applied simple or pure shear strain $\gamma$ at fixed
packing fraction $\phi$. MS packings of frictionless disks occur as geometric families (i.e. parabolic
segments with positive curvature) in the $\phi$-$\gamma$ plane. MS packings from protocol 1 populate
parabolic segments with both signs of the slope, $d\phi/d\gamma >0$ and $d\phi/d\gamma <0$. In
contrast, MS packings from protocol 2 populate segments with $d\phi/d\gamma <0$ only. For both
simple and pure shear, we derive a relationship between the stress anisotropy and dilatancy $d\phi/d\gamma$
obeyed by MS packings along geometrical families. We show that for MS packings prepared using isotropic
compression, the stress anisotropy distribution is Gaussian centered at zero with a standard deviation
that decreases with increasing system size. For shear jammed MS packings, the stress anisotropy
distribution is a convolution of Weibull distributions that depend on strain, which has a nonzero
average and standard deviation in the large-system limit. We also develop a framework to calculate
the stress anisotropy distribution for packings generated via protocol 2 in terms of the stress
anisotropy distribution for packings generated via protocol 1. These results emphasize that for
repulsive frictionless disks, different packing-generation protocols give rise to different
MS packing probabilities, which lead to differences in macroscopic properties of MS packings.
