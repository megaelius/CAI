We discuss the feasibility of measurement-based braiding in semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC)
heterostructures in the so-called quasi-Majorana regime $-$ the topologically-trivial regime
due to partially-separated Andreev bound states (ps-ABSs). These low energy ABSs consist of component
Majorana bound states (quasi-Majorana modes) that are spatially separated by a length scale smaller
than the length of the system, in contrast with the Majorana zero modes (MZMs), which are separated
by the length of the wire. In the quasi-Majorana regime, the ZBCPs appear to be robust to various perturbations
as long as the energy splitting of the ps-ABS is less than the typical width $\e_w$ of the low-energy
conductance peaks $\e_w$. However, the feasibility of measurement-based braiding depends on
a different energy scale $\e_m$. In this paper we show that it is possible to prepare the SM-SC system
in the quasi-Majorana regime with energy splittings below the $\e_m$ threshold, so that measurement-based
braiding is possible in principle. Starting with ps-ABSs with energy below $\e_m$, we identify
the maximum amplitudes of different types of perturbations that are consistent with perturbation-induced
energy splittings not exceeding the $\e_m$ limit. We argue that measurements generating perturbations
larger than the threshold amplitudes appropriate for $\e_m$ cannot realize measurement-based
braiding in SM-SC heterostructures in the quasi-Majorana regime. We find that, if possible at all,
quantum computation using measurement-based braiding in the quasi-Majorana regime would be plagued
with errors introduced by the measurement processes themselves, while such errors are significantly
less likely in a scheme involving topological MZMs.
