Motivated by recent developments on the fabrication and control of semiconductor-based quantum
dot qubits, we theoretically study a finite system of tunnel-coupled quantum dots with the electrons
interacting through the long-range Coulomb interaction. When the inter-electron separation
is large and the quantum dot confinement potential is weak, the system behaves as an effective Wigner
crystal with a period determined by the electron average density with considerable electron hopping
throughout the system. For stronger periodic confinement potentials, however, the system makes
a crossover to a Mott-type strongly correlated ground state where the electrons are completely
localized at the individual dots with little inter-dot tunneling. In between these two phases,
the system is essentially a strongly correlated electron liquid with inter-site electron hopping
constrained by strong Coulomb interaction. We characterize this Wigner-Mott-liquid quantum
crossover with detailed numerical finite size diagonalization calculations of the coupled interacting
qubit system, showing that these phases can be smoothly connected by tuning the system parameters.
Experimental feasibility of observing such a hopping-tuned Wigner-Mott-liquid crossover in
currently available semiconductor quantum dot qubits is discussed. In particular, we connect
our theoretical results to recent quantum-dot-based quantum emulation experiments where collective
Coulomb blockade was demonstrated. One conclusion of our theory is that currently available realistic
quantum dot arrays are unable to explore the low-density Wigner phase with only the Mott-liquid
crossover being accessible experimentally.
