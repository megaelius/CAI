We study the Holstein model of spinless fermions, which at half-filling exhibits a quantum phase
transition from a metallic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase to an insulating charge-density-wave
(CDW) phase at a critical electron-phonon coupling strength. In our work, we focus on the real-time
evolution starting from two different types of initial states that are CDW ordered: (i) ideal CDW
states with and without additional phonons in the system and (ii) correlated ground states in the
CDW phase. We identify the mechanism for CDW melting in the ensuing real-time dynamics and show that
it strongly depends on the type of initial state. We focus on the far-from-equilibrium regime and
emphasize the role of electron-phonon coupling rather than dominant electronic correlations,
thus complementing a previous study of photo-induced CDW melting [H. Hashimoto and S. Ishihara,
Phys. Rev. B 96, 035154 (2017)]. The numerical simulations are performed by means of matrix-product-state
based methods with a local basis optimization (LBO). Within these techniques, one rotates the local
(bosonic) Hilbert spaces adaptively into an optimized basis that can then be truncated while still
maintaining a high precision. In this work, we extend the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD)
algorithm with LBO, previously applied to single-polaron dynamics, to a half-filled system. We
demonstrate that in some parameter regimes, a conventional TEBD method without LBO would fail.
Furthermore, we introduce and use a ground-state density-matrix renormalization group method
for electron-phonon systems using local basis optimization. In our examples, we account for up
to $M_{\rm ph} = 40$ bare phonons per site by working with $\mathcal{O}(10)$ optimal phonon modes.
