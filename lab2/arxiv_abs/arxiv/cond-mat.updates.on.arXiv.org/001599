We present a detailed quantum oscillatory study on the Dirac type-II semimetallic candidates PdTe$_{2}$
and PtTe$_{2}$ \emph{via} the temperature and the angular dependence of the de Haas-van Alphen
(dHvA) and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effects. In high quality single crystals of both compounds,
i.e. displaying carrier mobilities between $10^3$ and $10^4$ cm$^2$/Vs, we observed a large non-saturating
magnetoresistivity (MR) which in PtTe$_2$ at a temperature $T = 1.3$ K, leads to an increase in the
resistivity up to $5 \times 10^{4}$ % under a magnetic field $\mu_0 H = 62$ T. These high mobilities
correlate with their light effective masses in the range of 0.04 to 1 bare electron mass according
to our measurements. For PdTe$_{2}$ the experimentally determined Fermi surface cross-sectional
areas show an excellent agreement with those resulting from band-structure calculations. Surprisingly,
this is not the case for PtTe$_{2}$ whose agreement between calculations and experiments is relatively
poor even when electronic correlations are included in the calculations. Therefore, our study
provides a strong support for the existence of a Dirac type-II node in PdTe$_2$ and probably also
for PtTe$_2$. Band structure calculations indicate that the topologically non-trivial bands
of PtTe$_2$ do not cross the Fermi-level ($\varepsilon_F$). In contrast, for PdTe$_2$ the Dirac
type-II cone does intersect $\varepsilon_F$, although our calculations also indicate that the
associated cyclotron orbit on the Fermi surface is located in a distinct $k_z$ plane with respect
to the one of the Dirac type-II node. Therefore it should yield a trivial Berry-phase.
