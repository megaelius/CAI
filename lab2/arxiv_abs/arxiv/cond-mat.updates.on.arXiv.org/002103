Manipulation of material properties via precise doping affords enormous tunable phenomena to
explore. Recent advance shows that in the atomic and nano scales topological states of dopants play
crucial roles in determining their properties. However, such determination is largely unknown
due to the incredible size of topological states. Here, we present a case study of developing deep
learning algorithms to predict bandgaps of boron-nitrogen pair doped graphene with arbitrary
dopant topologies. A material descriptor system that enables to correlate structures with the
bandgaps was developed for convolutional neuron networks (CNNs). Bandgaps calculated by the ab
initio calculations and the corresponding structures were fed as input datasets to train VGG16
convolutional network, residual convolutional network, and concatenate convolutional network.
Then these trained CNNs were used to predict bandgaps of doped graphene with various dopant topologies.
All of them afford great prediction accuracy, showing square of the coefficient of correlation
(R2) of > 90% and root-mean-square errors of ~ 0.1 eV for the predicted bandgaps. They are much better
than those predicted by a shallow machine learning method - support vector machine. The transfer
learning was further performed by leveraging data generated from smaller systems to improve the
prediction for large systems. Success of this work provides a cornerstone for future investigation
of topologically doped graphene and other 2D materials. Moreover, given ubiquitous existence
of topologies in materials, this work will stimulate widespread interests in applying deep learning
algorithms to topological design of materials crossing atomic, nano-, meso-, and macro- scales.
