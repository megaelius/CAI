A systematic study is conducted on the fluorination-enriched essential properties of 2D graphene
and 1D graphene nanoribbons using the first-principles method. The combined effects, which arise
from the significant chemical bonds in C-C, F-C and F-F bonds, the finite-size quantum confinement,
and the edge structure, can greatly diversify geometric structures, electronic properties and
magnetic configurations. By the detailed analyses, the critical orbital hybridizations in determining
the essential properties are accurately identified from the atom-dominated energy bands, the
spatial charge distributions, and the orbital-projected density of states. The top-site F-C bonds,
with the multi-orbital hybridizations, create the non-uniform buckled honeycomb lattice. There
exist the C-, F- and (C, F)-dominated energy bands. Fluorinated graphene belongs either to the p-type
metals (with/without the ferromagnetic spin arrangement) or to the large-gap semiconductors
(without magnetism), depending on the concentration and distribution of adatoms. Specially,
fluorinated graphene nanoribbons, with armchair/zigzag edge, presents five kinds of spin-dependent
properties, covering the non-magnetic and ferromagnetic metals, non-magnetic semiconductors,
and anti-ferromagnetic semiconductors with/without the spin splitting. The various band-edge
states in 2D and 1D systems appear as the rich and unique structures in density of states. Part of theoretical
predictions are consistent with the experimental measurements, and the others are worthy of the
further examinations. Also, the fluorination-created diverse properties clearly indicate the
high potentials in various applications that will be discussed in detail, e.g., electronic and
spintronic nanodevices.
