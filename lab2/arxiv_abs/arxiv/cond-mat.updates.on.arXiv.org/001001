We provide a theoretical description of the optical orientation of a single Mn$^{2+}$ ion spin under
quasi-resonant excitation demonstrated experimentally by Goryca et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103,
087401 (2009)]. We build and analyze a hierarchy of models by starting with the simplest assumptions
(transfer of perfectly spin-polarized excitons from Mn-free dot to the other dot containing a single
Mn$^{2+}$ spin, followed by radiative recombination) and subsequently adding more features,
such as spin relaxation of electrons and holes. Particular attention is paid to the role of the influx
of the dark excitons and the process of biexciton formation, which are shown to contribute significantly
to the orientation process in the quasi-resonant excitation case. Analyzed scenarios show how
multiple features of the excitonic complexes in magnetically-doped quantum dots, such as the values
of exchange integrals, spin relaxation times, etc., lead to a plethora of optical orientation processes,
characterized by distinct dependencies on light polarization and laser intensity, and occurring
on distinct timescales. Comparison with experimental data shows that the correct description
of the optical orientation mechanism requires taking into account Mn$^{2+}$ spin-flip processes
occurring not only when the exciton is already in the orbital ground state of the light-emitting
dot, but also those that happen during the exciton transfer from high-energy states to the ground
state. Inspired by the experimental results on energy relaxation of electrons and holes in nonmagnetic
dots, we focus on the process of biexciton creation allowed by mutual spin-flip of an electron and
the Mn$^{2+}$ spin, and we show that by including it in the model, we obtain good qualitative and quantitative
agreement with the experimental data on quasi-resonantly driven Mn$^{2+}$ spin orientation.
