We have investigated how a strong magnetic field (B) could decipher the anisotropic interaction
in heavy quark ($Q$) and antiquark ($\bar Q$) bound states through the perturbative thermal QCD
in real-time formalism. So we thermalize Schwinger propagator for quarks in LLL and the Feynman
propagator for gluons to calculate the gluon self-energy. For the quark-loop contribution to the
self-energy, the medium does not have any temperature correction and the vacuum term gives rise
an anisotropic term whereas the gluon-loop yields temperature correction. This finding in quark-loop
contribution corroborates the equivalence of a massless QED in (1+1)-dimension with the massless
thermal QCD in strong B, which (quark sector) is reduced to (1+1)-dimension (longitudinal). Thus
the permittivity of the medium behaves like as a tensor. Thus the permittivity of medium makes the
$Q \bar Q$ potential anisotropic, which resembles with a contemporary results found in lattice
studies. As a result, potential for $Q \bar Q$-pairs aligned transverse to B is more attractive than
parallel alignment. However, potential is always more attractive compared to B=0 due to softening
of screening mass. However, the imaginary-part of potential becomes smaller compared to B=0. We
have next investigated the effects of strong ${\bf B}$ on binding energies (B.E.) and thermal widths
($\Gamma$) of ground states of $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ in a time-independent perturbation theory,
where binding energies gets increased and widths gets decreased, compared to $B =0$. Finally we
have studied the quasi-free dissociation of bound states in a strong B. The dissociation temperatures
estimated for $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ states are obtained as $1.59 \rm{T_c} $ and $2.22 \rm{T_c}$,
respectively, which are higher than the estimate in B=0 , thus preventing early dissolution of $Q
\bar Q$ bound states.
