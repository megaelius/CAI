In vitro and in vivo spiking activity clearly differ. Whereas networks in vitro develop strong bursts
separated by periods of very little spiking activity, in vivo cortical networks show continuous
activity. This is puzzling considering that both networks presumably share similar single-neuron
dynamics and plasticity rules. We propose that the defining difference between in vitro and in vivo
dynamics is the strength of external input. In vitro, networks are virtually isolated, whereas
in vivo every brain area receives continuous input. We analyze a model of spiking neurons in which
the input strength, mediated by spike rate homeostasis, determines the characteristics of the
dynamical state. In more detail, our analytical and numerical results on various network topologies
show consistently that under increasing input, homeostatic plasticity generates distinct dynamic
states, from bursting, to close-to-critical, reverberating and irregular states. This implies
that the dynamic state of a neural network is not fixed but can readily adapt to the input strengths.
Indeed, our results match experimental spike recordings in vitro and in vivo: the in vitro bursting
behavior is consistent with a state generated by very low network input (< 0.1%), whereas in vivo
activity suggests that on the order of 1% recorded spikes are input-driven, resulting in reverberating
dynamics. Importantly, this predicts that one can abolish the ubiquitous bursts of in vitro preparations,
and instead impose dynamics comparable to in vivo activity by exposing the system to weak long-term
stimulation, thereby opening new paths to establish an in vivo-like assay in vitro for basic as well
as neurological studies.
