An interacting quantum system can transition from an ergodic to a many-body localized (MBL) phase
under the presence of sufficiently large disorder. Both phases are radically different in their
dynamical properties, which are characterized by highly excited eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.
Each eigenstate can be characterized by the set of quantum numbers over the set of (local, in the MBL
phase) integrals of motion of the system. In this work we study the evolution of the eigenstates of
the disordered Heisenberg model as the disorder strength, $W$, is varied adiabatically. We focus
on the probability that two `colliding' eigenstates hybridize as a function of both the range $R$
at which they differ as well as the strength of their hybridization. We find, in the MBL phase, that
the probability of a colliding eigenstate hybridizing strongly at range $R$ decays as $Pr(R)\propto
\exp [-R/\eta]$, with a length scale $\eta(W) = 1 / (B \log(W / W_c) )$ which diverges at the critical
disorder strength $W_c$. This leads to range-invariance at the transition, suggesting the formation
of resonating cat states at all ranges. This range invariance does not survive to the ergodic phase,
where hybridization is exponentially more likely at large range, a fact that can be understood with
simple combinatorial arguments. In fact, compensating for these combinatorial effects allows
us to define an additional correlation length $\xi$ in the MBL phase which is in excellent agreement
with previous works and which takes the critical value $1 / \log(2)$ at the transition, found in previous
works to destabilize the MBL phase. Finally, we show that deep in the MBL phase hybridization is dominated
by two-level collisions of eigenstates close in energy.
