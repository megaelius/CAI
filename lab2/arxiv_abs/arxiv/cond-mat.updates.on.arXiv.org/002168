HfSe2 and ZrSe2 are newly discovered two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) with promising properties for future nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. We theoretically
revealed the electronic and optical properties of these two emerging 2D semiconductors, and evaluated
their performance for the application of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at extreme
conditions: in-plane direction versus out-of-plane direction and monolayer versus multilayer.
First, the energy band structure and dielectric constants were calculated for both the monolayer
and multilayer structures using Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with van der Waals
(vdW) corrections. A parallel-band effect observed in the monolayer band structure indicates
a strong light-matter interaction. Then, based on the calculated dielectric constants, the performance
of the LSPR excited by Au sphere nanoparticles (NPs) was quantitatively characterized, including
polarizability, scattering and absorption cross-sections, and radiative efficiency using Mie
theory. For the multilayer HfSe2 and ZrSe2, the LSPR showed very comparable intensities in both
the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, suggesting an isotropy-like light-matter interaction.
In a comparison, the LSPR excited on the monolayer HfSe2 and ZrSe2 was clearly observed in the in-plane
direction but effectively suppressed in the out-of-plane direction due to the unique anisotropic
nature. In addition to this extraordinary anisotropy-to-isotropy transition as the layer number
increases, a red-shift of the LSPR wavelength was also found. Our work has predicated the thickness-dependent
anisotropic light-matter interaction on the emerging 2D semiconducting HfSe2 and ZrSe2, which
holds great potential for broad optoelectronic applications such as sensing and energy conversion.
