In this work, Fe-Si phase diagrams were derived to identify the composition-temperature domain
where Fe$_3$Si ($\alpha{\alpha}^{''}$-(Fe, Si) D03) phase can be stabilized. Thereafter, we
developed a precipitation model capable of simulating nucleation and growth of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals
via Langer-Schwartz theory. For optimum magnetic properties, prior work suggests that it is desirable
to precipitate Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals with 10-15 nm diameter and with crystalline volume fraction
of about 70 \%. Based on our parameterized model, we simulated nucleation and growth of Fe$_3$Si
nanocrystals with the desired size range and volume fraction by isothermal annealing of a FINEMET
alloy (Fe$_{72.89}$Si$_{16.21}$B$_{6.90}$Nb$_{3}$Cu$_{1}$ in atomic \%). In numerical experiments,
the alloys were isothermally treated at 490, 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, and 550 \degree C for two hours
to study the effect of holding time not only on mean radius and volume fraction, but also on the size
distribution, nucleation rate, number density, and driving force for the growth of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals.
With increasing annealing temperature, the mean radius of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals increases, while
the volume fraction decreases. Thereafter, the composition of Fe and Si in the FINEMET alloy was
varied by $\pm$ 3 \% to check the predictions of the model for nucleation and growth of Fe$_3$Si nanocrystals
from different alloy compositions. As Fe content decreases, it is possible to achieve the desired
mean radius and volume fraction within one hour holding time. The CALPHAD approach presented here
can provide efficient exploration of the nanocrystalline morphology for most FINEMET systems,
for cases in which the optimization of one or more material properties or process variable is desired.
