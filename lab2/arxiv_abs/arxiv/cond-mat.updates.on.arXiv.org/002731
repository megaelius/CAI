The mechanical properties of Cadmium telluride (CdTe) nanowire have become focus of interest now-a-days
due to its promising application in opto-electro-mechanical nanodevices. Inthis study, molecular
dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the mechanical behavior of Zinc Blende (ZB)
crystal structured CdTe nanowires (NWs) by varying size, temperature, crystal orientation and
strain rate under tension and compression. Results show that the fracture strength of the [111]-oriented
CdTe NWs is always higher than that of the [110]-oriented CdTe NWs under tension whereas in compression,
the fracture strength of the [111]-oriented CdTe NWs is significantly lower than that of the [110]-oriented
CdTe NWs. Moreover, under tensile load, void in ZB [111]-oriented CdTe NWs has been observed which
is a new failure mechanism found in this study. It has also been observed that size has negligible
effect on the tensile behavior but in compression the behavior is clearly size dependent. Both tensile
and compressive strengths show an inverse relation with temperature. When tensile load is applied
along NWs growth direction, the [111]-oriented CdTe NWs fail by creating void in [10-1] direction
regardless of temperature and NW size. Under compression, the [111]-oriented nanowire show buckling
and plasticity. Finally, the impact of strain rate on [111]-oriented ZB CdTe NWs is also studied
where higher fracture strengths and strains at a higher strain rates have been found under both tension
and compression. With increasing the strain rate, the number of voids is also increased in the NWs.This
study will help to design CdTe NWs based devices efficiently by presenting in-depth understanding
of failure behavior of the [111]-oriented CdTe NWs.
