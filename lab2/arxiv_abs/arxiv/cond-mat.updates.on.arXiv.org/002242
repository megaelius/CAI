Constructing an effective field theory in terms of doped magnetic impurities (described by an O(3)
vector model with a random mass term), itinerant electrons of spin-orbit coupled semiconductors
(given by a Dirac theory with a relatively large mass term), and effective interactions between
doped magnetic ions and itinerant electrons (assumed by an effective Zeeman coupling term), we
perform the perturbative renormalization group analysis in the one-loop level based on the dimensional
regularization technique. As a result, we find that the mass renormalization in dynamics of itinerant
electrons acquires negative feedback effects due to quantum fluctuations involved with the Zeeman
coupling term, in contrast with that of the conventional problem of quantum electrodynamics, where
such interaction effects enhance the fermion mass more rapidly. Recalling that the applied magnetic
field decreases the band gap in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, this renormalization group
analysis shows that the external magnetic field overcomes the renormalized band gap, allowed by
doped magnetic impurities even without ferromagnetic ordering. In other words, the Weyl metal
physics can be controlled by doping magnetic impurities into spin-orbit coupled semiconductors,
even if the external magnetic field alone cannot realize the Weyl metal phase due to relatively large
band gaps of semiconductors. Furthermore, we emphasize that quasiparticles do not exist in this
emergent disordered Weyl metal phase due to correlations with strong magnetic fluctuations. This
non-Fermi liquid type Weyl metal state may be regarded to be a novel metallic phase in the respect
that a topologically nontrivial band structure appears in the vicinity of quantum criticality.
