The contact process with diffusion (PCPD) defined by the binary reactions 2 B -> 3 B, 2 B -> 0 and diffusive
particle spreading exhibits an unusual active to absorbing phase transition whose universality
class has long been disputed. Multiple studies have indicated that an explicit account of particle
pair degrees of freedom may be required to properly capture this system's effective long-time,
large-scale behavior. We introduce a two-species representation in which single particles B and
pairs A are coupled according to the stochastic reactions B + B -> A, A -> A + B, A -> 0, and A -> B + B. Mean-field
analysis reveals that the phase transition is driven by competition and balance between both species.
We employ Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that this model captures the pertinent PCPD features.
In the inactive phase, A particles rapidly go extinct, leaving the B species to undergo pure pair
annihilation kinetics. At criticality, both A and B densities decay with the same exponents as the
PCPD order parameters, and display mean-field scaling above the critical dimension 2. In one dimension,
the critical exponents for the B species obtained from seed simulations agree well with previously
reported exponent values. We demonstrate that the scaling properties of consecutive particle
pairs in the PCPD are identical with that of the A species in the coupled model. This two-species picture
resolves the conceptual difficulty for seed simulations in the original PCPD and naturally introduces
multiple length and time scales, which cause strong corrections to scaling. The extracted moment
ratios from our simulations indicate that our model displays the same temporal crossover behavior
as the PCPD, which further corroborates its full dynamical equivalence with our coupled model.
