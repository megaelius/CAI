Thermoelectric materials enables the harvest of waste heat and directly conversion into electricity.
In search of high efficient thermoelectric materials, low thermal conductivity of a material is
essential and critical. Here, we have theoretically investigated the lattice thermal conductivity
and thermoelectric properties of layered intermetallic Na$_2$MgSn and Na$_2$MgPb based on the
density functional theory and linearized Boltzmann equation with the single-mode relaxation-time
approximation. It is found that both materials exhibit very low and anisotropic intrinsic lattice
thermal conductivity. Despite of the very low mass density and simple crystal structure of Na$_2$MgSn,
its lattice thermal conductivities along $a$ and $c$ axes are only 1.75 and 0.80 W/m$\cdot$K respectively
at room temperatures. When Sn is replaced by the heavier element Pb, its lattice thermal conductivities
decrease remarkably to 0.51 and 0.31 W/m$\cdot$K respectively along $a$ and $c$ axes at room temperatures.
We show that the low lattice thermal conductivities of both materials are mainly due to their very
short phonon lifetimes, which are roughly between 0.4 to 4.5 ps. Combined with previous experimental
measurements, the metallic Na$_2$MgPb can not be a good thermoelectric material. However, we predict
that the semiconducting Na$_2$MgSn is a potential room-temperature thermoelectric material
with a considerable $ZT$ of 0.34 at 300 K. Our calculations not only imply that the intermetallic
Na$_2$MgSn is a potential thermoelectric material, but also can motivate more theoretical and
experimental works on the thermoelectric researches in simple layered intermetallic compounds.
