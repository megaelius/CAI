We present a generalized theory for studying static monomer density-density correlation function
(structure factor) in concentrated solutions and melts of dipolar as well as ionic polymers. The
theory captures effects of electrostatic fluctuations on the structure factor and provides insights
into the origin of experimentally observed enhanced scattering at ultralow wavevectors in salt-free
ionic polymers. It is shown that the enhanced scattering can originate from a coupling between fluctuations
of electric polarization and monomer density. Local and non-local effects of the polarization
resulting from finite sized permanent dipoles and ion-pairs in dipolar and charge regulating ionic
polymers, respectively, are considered. Theoretical calculations reveal that, similar to the
salt-free ionic polymers, the structure factor for dipolar polymers can also exhibit a peak at a
finite wavevector and enhanced scattering at ultralow wavevectors. Although consideration of
dipolar interactions leads to attractive interactions between monomers, the enhanced scattering
at ultralow wavevectors is predicted solely on the basis of the electrostatics of weakly inhomoge-
neous dipolar and ionic polymers without considering the effects of any aggregates or phase separation.
Thus, we conclude that neither aggregation nor phase separation is necessary for observing the
enhanced scattering at ultralow wave-vectors in salt-free dipolar and ionic polymers. For charge
regulating ionic polymers, it is shown that electrostatic interactions between charged monomers
get screened with a screening length, which depends not only on the concentration of free counterions
and coions but also on the concentration of adsorbed ions on the polymer chains. Qualitative comparisons
with the experimental scattering curves for ionic and dipolar polymer melts are presented using
the theory developed in this work.
