In this work a maximal principle driving the far from equilibrium evolution of a system of structureless
particles is derived by using the stochastic quantum hydrodynamic analogy. For a classical phase
(i.e., the quantum correlations decay on a distance smaller than the mean inter-molecular distance)
the far from equilibrium kinetic equation can be cast in the form of a Fokker-Plank equation whose
phase space velocity maximizes the dissipation of the energy-type function, named here, stochastic
free energy. Near equilibrium the maximum stochastic free energy dissipation is shown to be compatible
with the Prigogine principle of minimum entropy production. Moreover, in the case of elastic molecular
collisions and in absence of chemical reactions, in quasi-isothermal far from equilibrium states,
the theory shows that the principle reduces to the maximum free energy dissipation.Following the
tendency to reach the highgest rate of energy dissipation, the system transition to states with
higher free energy can happen. Given that in incompressible ordinary fluids such an increase of
free energy is almost given by a decrease of entropy, the matter self-organization becomes possible.
The theory highlights that when chemical reactions or thermal gradients are present, additional
dissipative contributions appear togheter with the energy one showing that the Sawada enunciation
of maximum energy dissipation is not of general value. The proposed model depicts the Prigogine
principle of minimum entropy production near-equilibrium and the far from equilibrium Sawada
principle of maximum energy dissipation as two complementary principia of a unique theory where
the latter one is a particular case of the more general of maximum stochastic free energy dissipation.
