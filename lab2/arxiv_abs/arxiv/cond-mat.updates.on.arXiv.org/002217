In the field of condensed matter, the quest to obtain an experimental realization of a Kondo lattice
has generated a tremendous effort of the community, both from the point of view of experiments and
theory. In particular, the pursuit of obtaining independent magnetic moments, via charge localization
through Coulomb interactions, is important for applications in nanotechnology. In particular,
systems with simultaneous charge and spin degrees of freedom can manifest both Kondo spin quenching
and Mott-Hubbard charge localization. A unified experimental framework illuminating the pathway
between the two phenomena is of physical and technological interest, and is (as of yet) hardly observed
in real condensed matter systems. Recent developments in the ability to control densities and temperatures
of strongly correlated Fermionic impurities on surfaces and substrates has opened up a new paradigm
of possibilities for this pathway. In particular, a milestone was obtained recently by the observation
of self-assembled super-lattice of f adatoms on metallic surfaces, such as obtained by the deposition
of Ce on Ag(111), has achieved a realization of a diluted correlated lattice where the interaction
between Kondo and Mott physics can be systematically studied. However, it remains difficult to
control the ad-atom distances and substrate densities in these systems, and the interplay between
Kondo physics and charge localization remains elusive. In this work, we systematically investigate
the phase diagram of superlattice structures of heavy f elements deposited on metallic substrates,
and assess the required conditions to obtained a realization of a Kondo lattice in superlattices.
We unveil a unique pathway between Kondo quenching and Mott localization, and identify a non-trivial
charge density wave phase emerging from the competition of charge localization and Kondo physics.
