We perform computational studies of repulsive, frictionless disks to investigate the development
of stress anisotropy in mechanically stable (MS) packings. We focus on two protocols for generating
MS packings: 1) isotropic compression and 2) applied simple or pure shear strain $\gamma$ at fixed
packing fraction $\phi$. We show that MS disk packings occur as geometric families (i.e. parabolic
segments with positive curvature) in the $\phi$-$\gamma$ plane. MS packings from protocol 1 populate
parabolic segments with both signs of the slope, $d\phi/d\gamma >0$ and $d\phi/d\gamma <0$. In
contrast, MS packings from protocol 2 populate segments with $d\phi/d\gamma <0$ only. We then derive
a relationship between the stress anisotropy and dilatancy $d\phi/d\gamma$. We show that for MS
packings prepared using isotropic compression, the stress anisotropy distribution is Gaussian
centered at zero with a standard deviation that decreases with increasing system size. For shear
jammed MS packings, the stress anisotropy distribution is a convolution of Weibull distributions
that depend on strain, which has a nonzero average and standard deviation in the large-system limit.
We also develop a framework to calculate the stress anisotropy distribution for packings generated
via protocol 2 in terms of the distribution for packings generated via protocol 1. These results
emphasize that for repulsive frictionless disks, the ensemble of MS packings is the same for these
two packing-generation protocols. Thus, macroscopic quantities, such as the stress anisotropy,
depend on the protocol, not because the ensembles of MS packings are different, but because the protocol
changes the MS packing probabilities.
