We review the behavior of the entropy per particle in various two-dimensional electronic systems.
The entropy per particle is an important characteristic of any many body system that tells how the
entropy of the ensemble of electrons changes if one adds one more electron. Recently, it has been
demonstrated how the entropy per particle of a two-dimensional electron gas can be extracted from
the recharging current dynamics in a planar capacitor geometry. These experiments pave the way
to the systematic studies of entropy in various crystal systems including novel two-dimensional
crystals such as gapped graphene, germanene and silicene. Theoretically, the entropy per particle
is linked to the temperature derivative of the chemical potential of the electron gas by the Maxwell
relation. Using this relation, we calculate the entropy per particle in the vicinity of topological
transitions in various two-dimensional electronic systems. We show that the entropy experiences
quantized steps at the points of Lifshitz transitions in a two-dimensional electronic gas with
a parabolic energy spectrum. In contrast, in doubled-gapped Dirac materials, the entropy per particles
demonstrates characteristic spikes once the chemical potential passes through the band edges.
The transition from a topological to trivial insulator phase in germanene is manifested by the disappearance
of a strong zero-energy resonance in the entropy per particle dependence on the chemical potential.
We conclude that studies of the entropy per particle shed light on multiple otherwise hidden peculiarities
of the electronic band structure of novel two-dimensional crystals.
