Communication is crucial when disasters isolate communities of people and rescue is delayed. Such
delays force citizens to be first responders and form small rescue teams. Rescue teams require reliable
communication, particularly in the first 72 hours, which is challenging due to damaged infrastructure
and electrical blackouts. We design a peer-to-peer communication network that meets these challenges.
We introduce the concept of participatory fairness: equal communication opportunities for all
citizens regardless of initial inequality in phone battery charge. Our value-sensitive design
approach achieves an even battery charge distribution across phones over time and enables citizens
to communicate over 72 hours. We apply the fairness principle to communication in an adapted standard
Barabasi-Albert model of a scale-free network that automatically (i) assigns high-battery phones
as hubs, (ii) adapts the network topology to the spatio-temporal battery charge distribution,
and (iii) self-organizes to remain robust and reliable when links fail or phones leave the network.
While the Barabasi-Albert model has become a widespread descriptive model, we demonstrate its
use as a design principle to meet values such as fairness and systemic efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that, compared to a generic peer-to-peer mesh network, the new protocol achieves (i) a longer network
lifetime, (ii) an adaptive information flow, (iii) a fair distribution of battery charge, and (iv)
higher participation rates. Hence, our protocol, Self-Organization for Survival ('SOS'), provides
fair communication opportunities to all citizens during a disaster through self-organization.
SOS enables participatory resilience and sustainability, empowering citizens to communicate
when they need it most.
