We carry out a systematic theoretical investigation of Magneto Crystalline Anisotropy (MCA) of
L10 FePt clusters with alternating Fe and Pt planes along the (001) direction. We calculate the structural
relaxation and magnetic moment of each cluster by using ab initio spin-polarized density functional
theory (DFT), and the MCA with both spin-polarized DFT (including spin-orbit coupling self-consistently)
and the torque method. We find that the MCA of any composite structure of a given size is enhanced with
respect to that of the same-sized pure Pt or pure Fe cluster as well as to that of any pair of Fe and Pt
atoms in bulk L10 FePt. This enhancement results from the hybridization we observe between the 3d
orbital of the Fe atoms and the 5d orbital of their Pt neighbors. This hybridization, however, affects
the electronic properties of the component atoms in significantly different ways. While it somewhat
increases the spin moment of the Fe atoms, it has little effect on their orbital moment; at the same
time, it greatly increases both the spin and orbital moment of the Pt atoms. Given the fact that the
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant of Pt is about 7 times greater than that of Fe, this Fe-induced
jump in the orbital moment of the Pt atoms produces the increase in MCA of the composite structures
over that of their pure counterparts. That any composite structure exhibits higher MCA than bulk
L10 FePt results from the lower coordination of Pt atoms in the cluster, whether Fe or Pt predominates
within it. We also find that bipyramidal clusters whose central layer is Pt have higher MCA than their
same-sized counterparts whose central layer is Fe. This results from the fact that Pt atoms in such
configurations are coordinated with more Fe atoms than in the latter. By thus participating in more
instances of hybridization, they contribute higher orbital moments to the overall MCA of the unit.
