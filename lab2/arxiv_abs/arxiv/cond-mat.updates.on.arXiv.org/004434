We use the DMRG to study the correlated electron states favored by the Coulomb interaction projected
onto the narrow bands of twisted bilayer graphene within a spinless one-valley model. The Hilbert
space of the narrow bands is constructed from a pair of hybrid Wannier states with opposite Chern
numbers. Depending on the parameters in the BM model, the DMRG in this basis determines the ground
state at one particle per unit cell to be either QAH state or a state with no Hall effect which is nearly
a product state. Based on this form, we then apply the variational method to study their competition,
thus identifying three states: the QAH, a gapless $C_2T$ symmetric nematic, and a gapped $C_2T$
symmetric stripe. All three states are nearly degenerate at the realistic parameters of the BM model.
The single particle spectrum of the nematic contains either a quadratic node or two close Dirac nodes
near $\Gamma$. Motivated by the Landau level degeneracy found in this state, we propose it to be the
state observed at the charge neutrality point once spin and valley degeneracies are restored. The
optimal period for the $C_2T$ stripe state is found to be $2$ unit cells. In addition, using the fact
that the topological charge of the nodes in the $C_2T$ nematic phase is no longer described simply
by their winding numbers once the translation symmetry is broken, but rather by certain elements
of a non-Abelian group that was recently pointed out, we identify the mechanism of the gap opening
within the $C_2T$ stripe state. Although the nodes at the Fermi energy are locally stable, they can
be annihilated after braiding with other nodes connecting them to adjacent (folded) bands. Therefore,
if the translation symmetry is broken, the gap at one particle per unit cell can open even if the system
preserves the $C_2T$ and valley $U(1)$ symmetries, and the gap to remote bands remains open.
