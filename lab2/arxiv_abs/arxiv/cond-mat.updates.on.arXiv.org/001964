The Hodgkin-Huxley model describes the behavior of the membrane voltage in neurons, treating each
element of the cell membrane as an electric circuit element, namely capacitors, memristors and
voltage sources. We focus on the activation channel of potassium ions, since it is simpler, while
keeping the majority of the features identified with the original model. This simplification is
physiologically meaningful, since it is related to some neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases,
which are associated with a process of demyelination in neurons. This model reduces to a memristor,
a resistor whose resistance depends on the history of charges crossing it, coupled to a voltage source
and a capacitor. Here, we use the recent quantization of the memristor to glance at the Hodgkin-Huxley
model in the quantum regime. We compare the behavior of the potassium channel conductance in both
the classical and quantum realm. In the latter, we firstly introduce classical sources to study
the quantum-classical transition, and afterwards we switch to coherent quantum sources in order
to study the effects of entanglement. Numerical simulations show an increment and adaptation depending
on the history of signals. Additionally, the response to AC sources showcases hysteretic behavior
in the I-V characteristic curve due to the presence of the memristor. We investigate the memory capacitance
represented by the area of the I-V loops, which we call memory persistence. We find that it grows with
entanglement, which can be interpreted in terms of the fundamental relation between information
and thermodynamic entropies established by Landauer's principle. These results pave the way for
the construction of quantum neuron networks inspired in the brain but capable of dealing with quantum
information, a step forward towards the design of neuromorphic quantum architectures with implications
in quantum machine learning.
