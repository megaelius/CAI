The experimentally observed nonlinearities of the current-voltage characteristics (CVCs) of
tantalum-based point homo- and hetero- contacts in both normal and superconducting states related
to electron-phonon interaction (EPI) were analyzed. It was taken into account that additional
nonlinearity of CVCs arising upon contact transition to the superconducting state (superconducting
spectral component) is formed not only near the constriction in the region roughly equal to the contact
diameter (as is the case for the normal state, and as predicted theoretically for the superconducting
state), but also in a markedly larger region that is about the size of the coherence length. In this
case, a considerable role in the formation of this superconducting component is played by nonequilibrium
phonons with low group velocity, which account for the experimentally observed sharpening of the
phonon peaks in the EPI spectra (the second derivatives of the CVCs) during the superconducting
transition of the contacts, instead of the theoretically expected peak broadening (spreading),
and for the increase in the superconducting contribution to the point contact spectrum in the low
and medium energy regions. The high-energy part of the EPI spectrum changes much less significantly
during the superconducting transition, which is attributable to suppression of the excess contact
current by nonequilibrium quasi-particles. A detailed procedure was proposed for the recovery
of the EPI spectral function from the point contact spectrum contribution (the second derivative
of the CVC) that arises during the superconducting transition of one or both contacting metals.
