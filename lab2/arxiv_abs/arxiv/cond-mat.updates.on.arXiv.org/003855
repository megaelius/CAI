The growth process of fungal hyphae involves transport of nutrients from the sub-apical region
of the fungus to the growing tip of hyphae. At the tip domain, the intracellular organelle -Spitzenkorper
uses the nutrients that are packaged as membrane bound vesicles to synthesize fresh cell wall. This
in turn leads to elongation and branching of the hyphae and formation of a single colony mycelium.
We propose a driven lattice gas model which incorporates the processes of vesicle supply dependent
linear extension and branching of the tips of the hyphae, apart from process of motor driven transport
of vesicles along the hyphae towards the growing tips. We first analyze the growth and transport
process in the primary hypha which is subject to particle loss due to presence of branching sites.
We show that the spatial profile of vesicles along the growing lattice is an exponential distribution,
while the length grows logarithmically with time. We also obtain the probability distribution
of length of the hypha, and find that it tends to a Gaussian distribution function at late times. In
contrast, we find that probability distribution function of the time required for growth to a specific
length is a broad log-normal distribution. We simulate the resultant 2-d morphology generated
by the growing primary lattice, quantifying the motility behavior and morphological characteristics
of the colony in terms of measures such as the Center of Mass, Radius of Gyration and Aspect Ratio.
Analysis of the temporal behavior and morphological characteristics of the resultant 2-d morphology
reveals a wide variability of these characteristics which depend on the input parameters which
characterize the branching and elongation dynamics of the individual hyphae. We make quantitative
comparison of the predictions of our model with experiments.
