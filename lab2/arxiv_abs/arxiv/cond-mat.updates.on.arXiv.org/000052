We present a study about AFM imaging of living, moving or self-immobilized, bacteria in their genuine
physiological liquid medium. No external immobilization protocol, neither chemical nor mechanical,
was needed. For the first time, the native gliding movements of Gram-negative Nostoc cyanobacteria
upon the surface, at speeds up to 900microns/h, were studied by AFM. This was possible thanks to an
improved combination of a gentle sample preparation process and an AFM procedure based on fast and
complete force-distance curves made at every pixel, drastically reducing lateral forces. No limitation
in spatial resolution or imaging rate was detected. Gram-positive and non-motile Rhodococcus
wratislaviensis bacteria were studied as well. From the approach curves, Young modulus and turgor
pressure were measured for both strains at different gliding speeds and are ranging from 20 to 105MPa
and 40 to 310kPa depending on the bacterium and the gliding speed. For Nostoc, spatially limited
zones with higher values of stiffness were observed. The related spatial period is much higher than
the mean length of Nostoc nodules. This was explained by an inhomogeneous mechanical activation
of nodules in the Nostoc. We also observed the presence of a soft extra cellular matrix (ECM) around
the Nostoc bacterium. Both strains left a track of polymeric slime with variable thicknesses. For
Rhodococcus, it is equal to few hundreds of nm, likely to promote its adhesion to the sample. While
gliding, the Nostoc secretes a slime layer the thickness of which is in the nanometer range and increases
with the gliding speed. These results open a large window on new studies of both dynamical phenomena
of practical and fundamental interests such as the formation of biofilms and dynamic properties
of bacteria in real physiological conditions.
