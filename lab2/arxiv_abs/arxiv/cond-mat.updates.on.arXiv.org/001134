The spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice, which is closely realized in layered Mott insulators
such as ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$, is one of the oldest and most enigmatic spin-1/2 lattice model.
While the numerical evidence has accumulated in favor of a quantum spin liquid, the debate is still
open as to whether it is a $Z_2$ spin liquid with very short-range correlations (some kind of Resonating
Valence Bond spin liquid), or an algebraic spin-liquid with power-law correlations. To address
this issue, we have pushed the program started by Rokhsar and Kivelson in their derivation of the
effective quantum dimer model description of Heisenberg models to unprecedented accuracy for
the spin-1/2 kagome, by including all the most important virtual singlet contributions on top of
the orthogonalization of the nearest-neighbor valence bond singlet basis. Quite remarkably,
the resulting picture is a competition between a $Z_2$ spin liquid and a diamond valence bond crystal
with a 12-site unit cell, as in the DMRG simulations of Yan, Huse and White. Furthermore, we found
that, on cylinders of finite diameter $d$, there is a transition between the $Z_2$ spin liquid at
small $d$ and the diamond valence bond crystal at large $d$, the prediction of the present microscopic
description for the 2D lattice. These results show that, if the ground state of the spin-1/2 kagome
antiferromagnet can be described by nearest-neighbor singlet dimers, it is a diamond valence bond
crystal, and, a contrario, that, if the system is a quantum spin liquid, it has to involve long-range
singlets, consistent with the algebraic spin liquid scenario.
