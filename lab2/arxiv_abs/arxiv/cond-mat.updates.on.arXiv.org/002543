Because of its ultrawide bandgap, high breakdown electric field, and large area affordable substrates
grown from the melt, beta Ga2O3 has attracted great attention recently for potential applications
of power electronics. However, its thermal conductivity is significantly lower than those of other
wide bandgap semiconductors, such as AlN, SiC, GaN, and diamond. To ensure reliable operation with
minimal selfheating at high power, proper thermal management is even more essential for Ga2O3 devices.
Similarly to the past approaches aiming to alleviate selfheating in GaN HEMTs, a possible solution
has been to integrate thin Ga2O3 membranes with diamond to fabricate Ga2O3 on diamond lateral MESFET
or MOSFET devices by taking advantage of the ultra high thermal conductivity of diamond. Even though
the TBC between wide bandgap semiconductor devices such as GaN HEMTs and a diamond substrate is of
primary importance for heat dissipation in these devices, fundamental understanding of the Ga2O3
diamond thermal interface is still missing. In this work, we study the thermal transport across
the interfaces of Ga2O3 exfoliated onto a single crystal diamond. The Van der Waals bonded Ga2O3
diamond TBC is measured to be 17 MWm2K1, which is comparable to the TBC of several physical vapor deposited
metals on diamond. A Landauer approach is used to help understand phonon transport across perfect
Ga2O3 diamond interface, which in turn sheds light on the possible TBC one could achieve with an optimized
interface. A reduced thermal conductivity of the Ga2O3 nanomembrane is also observed due to additional
phonon membrane boundary scattering. The impact of the Ga2O3substrate TBC and substrate thermal
conductivity on the thermal performance of a power device are modeled and discussed.
