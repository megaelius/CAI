Rare earth pyrochlore Iridates (RE2Ir2O7) consist of two interpenetrating cation sublattices,
the RE with highly-frustrated magnetic moments, and the Iridium with extended conduction orbitals
significantly mixed by spin-orbit interactions. The coexistence and coupling of these two sublattices
create a landscape for discovery and manipulation of quantum phenomena such as the topological
Hall effect, massless conduction bands, and quantum criticality. Thin films allow extended control
of the material system via symmetry-lowering effects such as strain. While bulk Pr2Ir2O7 shows
a spontaneous hysteretic Hall effect below 1.5K, we observe the effect at elevated temperatures
up to 15K in epitaxial thin films on (111) YSZ substrates synthesized via solid phase epitaxy. Similar
to the bulk, the lack of observable long-range magnetic order in the thin films points to a topological
origin. We use synchrotron-based element-specific x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray magnetic
circular dichroism (XMCD) to compare powders and thin films to attribute the spontaneous Hall effect
in the films to localization of the Ir moments. We link the thin film Ir local moments to lattice distortions
absent in the bulk-like powders. We conclude that the elevated-temperature spontaneous Hall effect
is caused by the topological effect originating either from the Ir or Pr sublattice, with interaction
strength enhanced by the Ir local moments. This spontaneous Hall effect with weak net moment highlights
the effect of vanishingly small lattice distortions as a means to discover topological phenomena
in metallic frustrated magnetic materials.
