Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the characterization of the atomic-level
structure and dynamics of materials. Nevertheless, the use of this technique is often limited by
its lack of sensitivity, which can prevent the observation of surfaces, defects or insensitive
isotopes. Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) has been shown to improve by one to three orders of
magnitude the sensitivity of NMR experiments on materials under Magic-Angle Spinning (MAS), at
static magnetic field $B_0 \ge 5$ T, conditions allowing for the acquisition of high-resolution
spectra. The field of DNP-NMR spectroscopy of materials has undergone a rapid development in the
last ten years, spurred notably by the availability of commercial DNP-NMR systems. We provide here
an in-depth overview of MAS DNP-NMR studies of materials at high $B_0$ field. After a historical
perspective of DNP of materials, we describe the DNP transfers under MAS, the transport of polarization
by spin diffusion and the various contributions to the overall sensitivity of DNP-NMR experiments.
We discuss the design of tailored polarizing agents and the sample preparation in the case of materials.
We present the DNP-NMR hardware and the influence of key experimental parameters, such as microwave
power, magnetic field, temperature and MAS frequency. We give an overview of the isotopes that have
been detected by this technique, and the NMR methods that have been combined with DNP. Finally, we
show how MAS DNP-NMR has been applied to gain new insights into the structure of organic, hybrid and
inorganic materials with applications in fields, such as health, energy, catalysis,optoelectronics
etc.
