Acting as artificial synapses, two-terminal memristive devices are considered fundamental building
blocks for the realization of artificial neural networks. Organized into large arrays with a top-down
approach, memristive devices in conventional crossbar architecture demonstrated the implementation
of brain-inspired computing for supervised and unsupervised learning. Alternative way using
unconventional systems consisting of many interacting nano-parts have been proposed for the realization
of biologically plausible architectures where the emergent behavior arises from a complexity
similar to that of biological neural circuits. However, these systems were unable to demonstrate
bio-realistic implementation of synaptic functionalities with spatio-temporal processing
of input signals similarly to our brain. Here we report on emergent synaptic behavior of biologically
inspired nanoarchitecture based on self-assembled and highly interconnected nanowire (NW) networks
realized with a bottom up approach. The operation principle of this system is based on the mutual
electrochemical interaction among memristive NWs and NW junctions composing the network and regulating
its connectivity depending on the input stimuli. The functional connectivity of the system was
shown to be responsible for heterosynaptic plasticity that was experimentally demonstrated and
modelled in a multiterminal configuration, where the formation of a synaptic pathway between two
neuron terminals is responsible for a variation in synaptic strength also at non-stimulated terminals.
These results highlight the ability of nanowire memristive architectures for building brain-inspired
intelligent systems based on complex networks able to physically compute the information arising
from multi-terminal inputs.
