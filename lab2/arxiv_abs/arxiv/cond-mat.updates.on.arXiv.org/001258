Semiclassical dispersion corrections developed by Grimme and coworkers have become indispensable
in applications of Kohn-Sham density functional theory. We present an in-depth assessment of the
fit parameters present in semiclassical (D3-type) dispersion corrections by means of a statistically
rigorous analysis. We find that the choice of the cost function generally has a small effect on the
empirical parameters of D3-type dispersion corrections with respect to the reference set under
consideration. Only in a few cases, the choice of cost function has a surprisingly large effect on
the total dispersion energies. In particular, the weighting scheme in the cost function can significantly
affect the reliability of predictions. In order to obtain unbiased (data-independent) uncertainty
estimates for both the empirical fit parameters and the corresponding predictions, we carried
out a nonparametric bootstrap analysis. The mean prediction uncertainty obtained by bootstrapping
is not much larger than previously reported error measures. On the basis of a jackknife analysis,
we find that the original reference set is slightly skewed, but our results also suggest that this
feature hardly affects the prediction of dispersion energies. However, a rigorous analysis of
error accumulation arising from different parameterizations reveals that error cancellation
does not necessarily occur, leading to a monotonically increasing deviation in the dispersion
energy with increasing molecule size. We discuss this issue in detail at the prominent example of
the C60 buckycatcher. We find deviations between individual parameterizations of several tens
of kcal/mol in some cases. Hence, in combination with any calculation of dispersion energies, we
recommend to always determine the associated uncertainties for which we will provide a software
tool.
