We analyze the electron spin relaxation rate $1/T_1$ of individual ion-implanted $^{31}P$ donors,
in a large set of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) silicon nanoscale devices, with the aim of identifying
spin relaxation mechanisms peculiar to the environment of the spins. The measurements are conducted
at low temperatures ($T\approx 100$ mK), as a function of external magnetic field $B_0$ and donor
electrochemical potential $\mu_{\rm D}$. We observe a magnetic field dependence of the form $1/T_1\sim
B_0^5$ for $B_0\gtrsim 3\,$ T, corresponding to the phonon-induced relaxation typical of donors
in the bulk. However, the relaxation rate varies by up to two orders of magnitude between different
devices. We attribute these differences to variations in lattice strain at the location of the donor.
For $B_0\lesssim 3\,$T, the relaxation form changes to $1/T_1\sim B_0$ for two devices. This is
consistent with relaxation induced by evanescent-wave Johnson noise created by the metal structures
fabricated above the donors. At low fields, where $T_1>1\,$s, it becomes important to ensure that
the donor electrochemical potential is kept significantly below the Fermi level of the charge reservoir
it is tunnel-coupled to. We observe and quantify the anomalous increase of $1/T_1$ when the electrochemical
potential of the spin excited state $|\uparrow\rangle$ comes in proximity to empty states in the
charge reservoir, leading to spin-dependent tunneling that resets the spin to $|\downarrow\rangle$.
These results give precious insights into the microscopic phenomena that affect spin relaxation
in MOS nanoscale devices, and provide strategies for engineering spin qubits with improved spin
lifetimes.
