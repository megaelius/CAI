We consider the properties of the type II Weyl semimetals at low temperatures basing on the particular
tight - binding model. In the presence of electric field directed along the line connecting the Weyl
points of opposite chirality the occupied states flow along this axis giving rise to the creation
of electron - hole pairs. The electrons belong to a vicinity of one of the two type II Weyl points while
the holes belong to the vicinity of the other. This process may be considered as the manifestation
of the chiral anomaly that exists without any external magnetic field. It may be observed experimentally
through the measurement of conductivity. Next, we consider the modification of the theory in the
presence of elastic deformations. In the domain of the considered model, where it describes the
type I Weyl semimetals the elastic deformations lead to the appearance of emergent gravity. In the
domain of the type II Weyl semimetals the form of the Fermi surface is changed due to the elastic deformations,
and its fluctuations represent the special modes of the zero sound. We find that there is one - to one
correspondence between them and the sound waves of the elasticity theory. Next, we discuss the influence
of the elastic deformations on the conductivity. The particularly interesting case is when our
model describes the intermediate state between the type I and the type II Weyl semimetal. Then without
the elastic deformations there are the Fermi lines instead of the Fermi points/Fermi surface, while
the DC conductivity vanishes. However, even small elastic deformations may lead to the appearance
of large conductivity.
