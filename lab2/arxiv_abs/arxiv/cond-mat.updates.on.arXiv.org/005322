Exchange bias effects linked to surface spin freezing (SSF) are commonly found in iron oxide nanoparticles,
while signatures of SSF in low-field temperature-dependent magnetization curves have been much
less frequently reported. Here, we present magnetic properties of dense assemblies of similar-sized
(~ 8 nm diameter) particles synthesized by a magnetite (sample S1) and a maghemite (sample S2) method,
and the influence of long-term (4-year) sample aging under ambient conditions on these properties.
The size of the exchange bias field of the different sample (fresh or aged) states is found to correlate
with (a) whether a low-temperature hump feature signaling the SSF transition is detected in out-of-phase
ac susceptibility or zero-field-cooled (ZFC) dc magnetization recorded at low field and with (b)
the prominence of irreversibility between FC and ZFC curves recorded at high field. Sample S1 displays
a lower magnetization than S2, and it is in S1 where the largest SSF effects are found. These effects
are significantly weakened by aging but remain larger than the SSF effects in S2, where the influence
of aging is considerably smaller. A non-saturating component due to spin disorder in S1 also weakens
with aging, accompanied by, we infer, an increase in the superspin and the radius of the ordered nanoparticle
cores. X-ray diffraction and M\"ossbauer spectroscopy provide indication of maghemite-like
stoichiometry in both aged samples as well as thicker disordered particle shells in aged-S1 relative
to aged-S2 (crystallographically-disordered and spin-disordered according to diffraction
and M\"ossbauer, respectively). The pronounced diminution in SSF effects with aging in S1 is attributed
to a (long-term) transition, caused by ambient oxidation, from magnetite-like to maghemite-like
stoichiometry, and a concomitant softening of the spin-disordered shell anisotropy...
