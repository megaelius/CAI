We study a model of flexible block copolymers (BCPs) in which there is an enlthalpic preference for
local alignment, among like-block segments. We describe a generalization of the self-consistent
field theory (SCFT) of flexible BCPs to include inter-segment orientational interactions via
a Landau-DeGennes free energy associated with a polar or nematic order parameter for segments of
one component of a diblock copolymer. We study the equilibrium states of this model numerically,
using a pseudo-spectral approach to solve for chain conformation statistics in the presence of
a self-consistent torque generated by inter-segment alignment forces. Applying this theory to
the structure of lamellar domains composed of symmetric diblocks possessing a single block of "self-aligning",
polar segments, we show the emergence of spatially complex segment order parameters (segment director
fields) within a given lamellar domain. Because BCP phase separation gives rise to spatially inhomogeneous
orientation order of segments even in the absence of explicit intra-segment aligning forces, the
director fields of BCPs, as well as thermodynamics of lamellar domain formation, exhibit a highly
non-linear dependence on both the inter-block segregation ($\chi N$) and the enthalpy of alignment
($\varepsilon$). Specifically, we predict the stability of new phases of lamellar order in which
distinct regions of alignment coexist within a single mesodomain, and which spontaneously break
the symmetry of the lamella pattern of composition in the melt via in-plane tilt of the director in
the centers of the like-composition domains. We show further that, in analogy to a Freedericksz
transition in confined nematics, that the elastic costs to reorient segments within the domain,
as described by Frank elasticity, increase the threshold value $\varepsilon$ needed to induce
this intra-domain phase transition.
