The rheological properties of emulsions are of considerable importance in a diverse range of scenarios.
Here we describe a superposition of the effects of droplet elasticity and volume fraction on the
dynamics of emulsions. The superposition is governed by physical interactions between droplets,
and provides a new mechanism for modifying the flow behavior of emulsions, by controlling the elasticity
of the dispersed phase. We investigate the properties of suspensions of emulsified wormlike micelles
(WLM). Dense suspensions of the emulsified WLM droplets exhibit thermally responsive properties
in which the viscoelastic moduli decrease by an order of magnitude over a temperature range of 0 $^\circ$C
to 25 $^\circ$C. Surprisingly, the fragility (i.e. the volume-fraction dependence of the modulus)
of the emulsions does not change with temperature. Instead, the emulsion modulus scales as a power-law
with volume fraction with a constant exponent across all temperatures even as the droplet properties
change from elastic to viscous. Nevertheless, the underlying droplet dynamics depend strongly
on temperature. From stress relaxation experiments, we quantify droplet dynamics across the cage
breaking time scale below which the droplets are locally caged by neighbors and above which the droplets
escape their cages to fully relax. For elastic droplets and high volume fractions, droplets relax
less stress through cage rattling and the terminal relaxations are slower than for viscous droplets
and lower volume fractions. The cage rattling and cage breaking dynamics are highly correlated
for variations in both temperature and emulsion concentration, suggesting that thermal and volume
fraction effects represent independent parameters to control emulsion properties.
