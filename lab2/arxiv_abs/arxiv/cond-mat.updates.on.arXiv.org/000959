We investigate the spin of a multielectron GaAs quantum dot in a sequence of nine charge occupancies,
by exchange coupling the multielectron dot to a neighboring two-electron double quantum dot. For
all nine occupancies, we make use of a leakage spectroscopy technique to reconstruct the spectrum
of spin states in the vicinity of the interdot charge transition between a single- and a multielectron
quantum dot. In the same regime we also perform time-resolved measurements of coherent exchange
oscillations between the single- and multielectron quantum dot. With these measurements, we identify
distinct characteristics of the multielectron spin state, depending on whether the dot's occupancy
is even or odd. For three out of four even occupancies we do not observe any exchange interaction with
the single quantum dot, indicating a spin-0 ground state. For the one remaining even occupancy,
we observe an exchange interaction that we associate with a spin-1 multielectron quantum dot ground
state. For all five of the odd occupancies, we observe an exchange interaction associated with a
spin-1/2 ground state. For three of these odd occupancies, we clearly demonstrate that the exchange
interaction changes sign in the vicinity of the charge transition. For one of these, the exchange
interaction is negative (i.e. triplet-preferring) beyond the interdot charge transition, consistent
with the observed spin-1 for the next (even) occupancy. Our experimental results are interpreted
through the use of a Hubbard model involving two orbitals of the multielectron quantum dot. Allowing
for the spin correlation energy (i.e. including a term favoring Hund's rules) and different tunnel
coupling to different orbitals, we qualitatively reproduce the measured exchange profiles for
all occupancies.
