Celitement is a new type of cement that is based on hydraulic calcium-hydrosilicate (hCHS) that
possesses a potential for minimizing the ratio C/S from above 3 in OPC down to 1, which significantly
reduces the amount of CO$_2$ released during processing. The reaction kinetics of hCHS differs
from that of classical clinker phases due to the presence of highly reactive silicate species, which
involve silanol groups instead of pure calcium silicates and aluminates and aluminoferrites.
In contrast to Portland cement, no calcium hydroxide is formed during hydration, which otherwise
regulates the Ca concentration. Without the buffering role of Ca(OH)$_2$ the concentration of
the dissolved species c(Ca$^{2+}$) and c(SiO$_4^{4-}$) and the corresponding pH must be controlled
to ensure a reproducible reaction. Pure hCHS reacts isochemically with water, resulting in a C-S-H
phase with the same chemical composition as a single hydration product, with a homogeneous distribution
of the main elements Ca and Si throughout the sample. Here we study via nanoindentation the mechanical
properties of two different types of hardened pastes made out of Celitement (C/S=1.28), with varying
amounts of hCHS and variable water to cement ratio. We couple nanoindentation grids with Raman mappings
to link the nanoscale mechanical properties to individual microstructural components, yielding
in-depth insight into the mechanics of the mineralogical phases constituting the hardened cement
paste. We show that we can identify in hardened Celitement paste both fresh C-S-H with varying density,
and C-S-H from the raw material using their specific Raman spectra, while simultaneously measuring
their mechanical properties. Albeit not suitable for phase identification, EDX measurements
provide valuable information about the distribution of alkalis, thus further helping to understand
the reaction pattern of hCHS.
