By comparing with recently available experimental data from several groups, we critically discuss
the manifestation of continuum many body interaction effects in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG)
with small twist angles and low carrier densities, which arise naturally within the Dirac cone approximation
for the non-interacting band structure. We provide two specific examples of such continuum many
body theories: one involving electron-phonon interaction and one involving electron-electron
interaction. In both cases, the experimental findings are only partially quantitatively consistent
with rather clear-cut leading-order theoretical predictions based on well-established continuum
many body theories. We provide a critical discussion, based mainly on the currently available tBLG
experimental data, on possible future directions for understanding many body renormalization
involving electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions in the system. One definitive
conclusion based on the comparison between theory and experiment is that the leading order 1-loop
perturbative renormalization group theory completely fails to account for the electron-electron
interaction effects in the strong-coupling limit of flatband moir\'e tBLG system near the magic
twist angle even at low doping where the Dirac cone approximation should apply. By contrast, approximate
nonperturbative theoretical results based on Borel-Pad\'e resummation or $1/N$ expansion seems
to work well compared with experiments, indicating rather small interaction corrections to Fermi
velocity or carrier effective mass. For electron-phonon interactions, however, the leading-order
continuum theory works well except when van Hove singularities in the density of states come into
play.
