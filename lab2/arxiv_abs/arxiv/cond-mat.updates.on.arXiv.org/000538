Time-reversal symmetric topological insulator is a novel state of matter that a bulk-insulating
state carries dissipationless spin transport along the surfaces, embedded by the $Z_2$ topological
invariant. In the noninteracting limit, this exotic state has been intensively studied and explored
with realistic systems, such as HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. Yet an interacting topological
insulator is still an elusive subject, and most related analysis are relied on the Hartree-Fock
approximation and numerical simulations. Among the approaches, the Hartree-Fock approximation
fails to predict the topological phase transition, in particular at intermediate interaction
strength without spontaneously breaking symmetry. In this review, we develop an analytical approach
based on a combined perturbative and self-consistent mean-field treatment of interactions that
is capable of capturing topological phase transitions beyond either method when used independently.
As an illustration of the method, we study the effects of short-ranged interactions on the $Z_2$
topological insulator phase, also known as the quantum spin Hall phase, in three generalized versions
of the Kane-Mele model at half-filling on the honeycomb lattice. The results are in excellent agreement
with quantum Monte Carlo calculations on the same model, and cannot be reproduced by either a perturbative
treatment or a self-consistent mean-field treatment of the interactions. Our analytical approach
helps to clarify how the symmetries of the one-body terms of the Hamiltonian determine whether interactions
tend to stabilize or destabilize a topological phase. Moreover, our method should be applicable
to a wide class of models where topological transitions due to interactions are in principle possible,
but are not correctly predicted by either perturbative or self-consistent treatments.
