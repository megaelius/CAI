The near-field interaction due to a strong electromagnetic field induced by resonant localized
plasmons can result in a strong coupling of excitonic states or formation of hybrid exciton-plasmon
modes in quantum confined structures. This coupling can be strengthed by designing a system with
its vibronic states resonant to the energy of the driving field induced by the localized plasmon
excitation. Silver nanoislands nucleated on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an ideal platform
for such interaction. The influence of localized plasmons (LSP) on the formation and dissociation
of excitons due to resonant and off-resonant optical excitation of carriers to excitonic states
is studied using ultrafast optical spectroscopy. The local field due to the Ag nanoparticles (Ag-NP)
enhances the magnitude of the Raman modes in MoS2 in the presence of resonant excitation. An ultrashort
pulsed optical excitation at 2.3 eV resonantly excites the LSP modes and the optical near-field
resonantly drive the phonon modes, which leads to a coherent coupling of the A and B excitons in MoS2
with the plasmon modes. The resonant excitation of the LSP modes modulate the optical absorption
of the probe field. The resonant excitation of C exciton due to an excitation source at 3.0 eV, which
is off-resonant to the LSP mode increases the electrostatic screening in the presence of excess
carriers from Ag NPs. It results in a faster dissociation of optically generated C excitons into
free carriers that eventually increase the A and B exciton population. A 3-level density matrix
theory in the presence of dressed vibronic states induced by a localized near-field optical driving
source is applied to describe the coherent interaction process in the hybrid nano-plasmonic system.
