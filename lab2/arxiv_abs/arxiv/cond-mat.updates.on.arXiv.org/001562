The homogeneous cooling state (HCS) of a granular gas described by the inelastic Boltzmann equation
is reconsidered. As usual, particles are taken as inelastic hard disks or spheres, but now the coefficient
of normal restitution $\alpha$ is allowed to take negative values $\alpha\in[-1,1]$, a simple
way of modeling more complicated inelastic interactions. The distribution function of the HCS
is studied at the long-time limit, as well as for intermediate times. At the long-time limit, the
relevant information of the HCS is given by a scaling distribution function $\phi_s(c)$, where
the time dependence occurs through a dimensionless velocity $c$. For $\alpha\gtrsim -0.75$, $\phi_s$
remains close to the gaussian distribution in the thermal region, its cumulants and exponential
tails being well described by the first Sonine approximation. On the contrary, for $\alpha\lesssim
-0.75$, the distribution function becomes multimodal, its maxima located at $c\ne 0$, and its observable
tails algebraic. The latter is a consequence of an unbalanced relaxation-dissipation competition,
and is analytically demonstrated for $\alpha\simeq -1$ thanks to a reduction of the Boltzmann equation
to a Fokker-Planck-like equation. Finally, a generalized scaling solution to the Boltzmann equation
is also found $\phi(c,\beta)$. Apart from the time dependence occurring through the dimensionless
velocity, $\phi(c,\beta)$ depends on time through a new parameter $\beta$ measuring the departure
of the HCS from its long-time limit. It is shown that $\phi(c,\beta)$ describes the time evolution
of the HCS for almost all times. The relevance of the new scaling is also discussed.
