By means of systematic first-principles calculations based on density functional theory we search
for suitable materials that can host antiferromagnetically coupled skyrmions. We concentrate
on fcc-stacked (111)-oriented metallic $Z$/Co/Pt ($Z=4d$ series: Y$-$Pd, the noble metals: Cu,
Ag, Au, post noble metals: Zn and Cd) magnetic multilayers of films of monatomic thickness. We present
quantitative trends of magnetic properties: Magnetic moments, interlayer exchange coupling,
spin-stiffness, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and the critical
temperature. We show that some of the $Z$ elements (Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Tc, Ru, Rh, and Cd) can induce antiferromagnetic
interlayer coupling between the magnetic Co layers, and that they influence the easy magnetization
axis. Employing a multiscale approach, we transfer the micromagnetic parameters determined from
$ab$ $initio$ to a micromagnetic energy functional and search for one-dimensional spin-spiral
solutions and two-dimensional skyrmions. We determine the skyrmion radius by numerically solving
the equation of the skyrmion profile. We found an analytical expression for the skyrmion radius
that covers our numerical results and is valid for a large regime of micromagnetic parameters. Based
on this expression we have proposed a model that allows to extrapolate from the $ab$ $initio$ results
of monatomic films to multilayers with Co films consisting of several atomic layers containing
$10\,$nm skyrmions. We found thickness regimes where tiny changes of the film thickness may alter
the skyrmion radius by an orders of magnitude. We estimated the skyrmion size as function of temperature
and found that the size can easily double going from cryogenic to room temperature. We suggest promising
material systems for ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically coupled spin-spiral and skyrmion
systems.
