Helium atoms in Rydberg states have been manipulated coherently with microwave radiation pulses
near a gold surface and near a superconducting NbTiN surface at a temperature of $3 \text{K}$. The
experiments were carried out with a skimmed supersonic beam of metastable $(1\text{s})^1(2\text{s})^1\,
{}^1\text{S}_0$ helium atoms excited with laser radiation to $n\text{p}$ Rydberg levels with
principal quantum number $n$ between $30$ and $40$. The separation between the cold surface and
the center of the collimated beam is adjustable down to $250 \mu\text{m}$. Short-lived $n\text{p}$
Rydberg levels were coherently transferred to the long-lived $n\text{s}$ state to avoid radiative
decay of the Rydberg atoms between the photoexcitation region and the region above the cold surfaces.
Further coherent manipulation of the $n\text{s}$ Rydberg levels with pulsed microwave radiation
above the surfaces enabled measurements of stray electric fields and allowed us to study the decoherence
of the atomic ensemble. Adsorption of residual gas onto the surfaces and the resulting slow build-up
of stray fields was minimized by controlling the temperature of the surface and monitoring the partial
pressures of H$_2$O, N$_2$, O$_2$ and CO$_2$ in the experimental chamber during the cool-down.
Compensation of the stray electric fields to levels below $100 \text{mV}/\text{cm}$ was achieved
over a region of $6 \text{mm}$ along the beam-propagation direction which, for the $1770 \text{m}/\text{s}$
beam velocity, implies the possibility to preserve the coherence of the atomic sample for several
microseconds above the cold surfaces.
