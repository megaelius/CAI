Soft living tissues like cartilage can be considered as biphasic materials comprised of a fibrous
complex biopolymer network and a viscous background liquid. Here, we show by a combination of experiment
and theoretical analysis that both the hydraulic permeability and the elastic properties of (bio)polymer
networks can be determined with simple ramp compression experiments in a commercial rheometer.
In our approximate closed-form solution of the poroelastic equations of motion, we find the normal
force response during compression as a combination of network stress and fluid pressure. Choosing
fibrin as a biopolymer model system with controllable pore size, measurements of the full time-dependent
normal force during compression are found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical calculations.
The inferred elastic response of large-pore ($\mathrm{\mu m}$) fibrin networks depends on the
strain rate, suggesting a strong interplay between network elasticity and fluid flow. Phenomenologically
extending the calculated normal force into the regime of nonlinear elasticity, we find strain-stiffening
of small-pore (sub-$\mathrm{\mu m}$) fibrin networks to occur at an onset average tangential stress
at the gel-plate interface that depends on the polymer concentration in a power-law fashion. The
inferred permeability of small-pore fibrin networks scales approximately inverse squared with
the fibrin concentration, implying with a microscopic cubic lattice model that the thickness of
the fibrin fibers decreases with protein concentration. Our theoretical model provides a new method
to obtain the hydraulic permeability and the elastic properties of biopolymer networks and hydrogels
with simple compression experiments, and paves the way to study the relation between fluid flow
and elasticity in biopolymer networks during dynamical compression.
