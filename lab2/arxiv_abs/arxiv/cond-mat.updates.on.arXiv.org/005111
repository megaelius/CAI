Stimulated by anomalous behaviors found in non-Kramers $f$-electron systems in an applied magnetic
field, we study a two-channel Kondo lattice model by using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field
theory combined with the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method. We include the effect of the
external magnetic field in two ways: the Zeeman coupling to conduction electron spins and an effective
coupling to the quadrupole degree of freedom through the crystalline electric field splitting.
We show that the magnetic field suppresses the antiferroic-spin order (physically, corresponding
to the antiferroic-quadrupole order), and yields a channel-selective non-Fermi liquid state
where one of the two channels (physically, spin-up or -down) exhibits non-Fermi liquid behavior
while the other shows Fermi liquid behavior, before entering the Fermi liquid regime in higher fields.
This anomalous state appears in a dome-shaped region which extends from inside the antiferroic-spin
ordered phase to the paramagnetic phase. We find that the composite correlation, which is a measure
of differentiation in the Kondo coupling between the two channels, is enhanced in this dome-shaped
region. We also find that the specific heat coefficient is enhanced in this region in the paramagnetic
side, indicating heavy fermion behavior not only in the vicinity of the critical field where the
antiferroic-spin order vanishes but also in a certain region of the field and temperature. We discuss
the results in comparison with the ordinary Kondo lattice model. We also discuss the implication
of our findings to the peculiar behavior observed in the 1-2-20 compounds such as $\rm{PrIr_2Zn_{20}}$,
$\rm{PrRh_2Zn_{20}}$, and $\rm{PrV_2Al_{20}}$ under a magnetic field.
