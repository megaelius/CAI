We report on a systematic replica approach to calculate the subsystem trace distance for a generic
quantum field theory. This method has been recently introduced in [J. Zhang, P. Ruggiero, P. Calabrese,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 141602 (2019)], of which this work is a completion. The trace distance between
two reduced density matrices $\rho_A$ and $\sigma_A$ is obtained from the moments $\textrm{tr}
(\rho_A-\sigma_A)^n$ and taking the limit $n\to1$ of the traces of the even powers. We focus here
on the case of a subsystem consisting of a single interval of length $\ell$ embedded in the low lying
eigenstates of a one-dimensional critical system of length $L$, a situation that can be studied
exploiting the path integral form of the reduced density matrices of two-dimensional conformal
field theories. The trace distance turns out to be a {\it scale invariant universal function} of
$\ell/L$. Here we complete our previous work by providing detailed derivations of all results and
further new formulas for the distances between several low-lying states in two-dimensional free
massless compact boson and fermion theories. Remarkably, for one special case in the bosonic theory
and for another in the fermionic one, we obtain the exact trace distance, as well as the Schatten $n$-distance,
for an interval of arbitrary length, while in generic case we have a general form for the first term
in the expansion in powers of $\ell/L$. The analytical predictions in conformal field theories
are tested against exact numerical calculations in XX and Ising spin chains, finding perfect agreement.
As a byproduct, new results are also obtained for other entanglement-related quantities, such
as the relative entropy and the fidelity.
