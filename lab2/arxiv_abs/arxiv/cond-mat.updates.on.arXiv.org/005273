High critical temperature cuprate superconducting materials are composed of copper oxide layers
and interlayer charge reservoirs. When not doped, these cuprates are antiferromagnetic insulators.
We propose to design new materials by combining alternating layers of parents of hole-doped and
electron-doped of these cuprates and modifications thereof. Our goal is to find undoped cuprates
that can be either an antiferromagnetic insulator or a quantum metal. The term quantum metal means
a metal characterized by long range antiferromagnetic order or only strong antiferromagnetic
correlations, i.e., it is thus a stable ground state against any other perturbations. The new metallic
states sought here could be precursors to new superconducting states in the absence or presence
of doping. Using the density functional theory, we report on two compounds {La}{Pr}CuO4 and {La}{V}CuO4
that illustrate the different physics described above. The curly brackets mean that the preparation
of these compounds shall be done by depositing a layer containing Pr, then one CuO2 layer, then finally
the La layer in {La}{Pr}CuO4 for example. The configuration formed by the positions of the charge
reservoir atoms with respect to the CuO2 layer is an important factor in the new procedure we propose
here. This paper reports on the X-ray diffraction, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties
of these hypothetical materials. We found that {La}{Pr}CuO4 is a Mott insulator, but {La}{V}CuO4
is an undoped correlated quantum metal with long-range order. Our calculations were performed
using the linearized plane wave method (FP-LAPW) implemented within the Wien2k software.
