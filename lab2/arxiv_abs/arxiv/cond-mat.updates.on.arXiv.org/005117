We consider the ideal Fermi gas of indistinguishable particles without spin but with electric charge,
confined to a Euclidean plane $\mathbb R^2$ perpendicular to an external constant magnetic field
of strength $B>0$. We assume this (infinite) quantum gas to be in thermal equilibrium at zero temperature,
that is, in its ground state with chemical potential $\mu\ge B$ (in suitable physical units). For
this (pure) state we define its local entropy $S(\Lambda)$ associated with a bounded (sub)region
$\Lambda\subset \mathbb R^2$ as the von Neumann entropy of the (mixed) local substate obtained
by reducing the infinite-area ground state to this region $\Lambda$ of finite area $|\Lambda|$.
In this setting we prove that the leading asymptotic growth of $S(L\Lambda)$, as the dimensionless
scaling parameter $L>0$ tends to infinity, has the form $L\sqrt{B}|\partial\Lambda|$ up to a precisely
given (positive multiplicative) coefficient which is independent of $\Lambda$ and dependent
on $B$ and $\mu$ only through the integer part of $(\mu/B-1)/2$. Here we have assumed the boundary
curve $\partial\Lambda$ of $\Lambda$ to be sufficiently smooth which, in particular, ensures
that its arc length $|\partial\Lambda|$ is well-defined. This result is in agreement with a so-called
area-law scaling (for two spatial dimensions). It contrasts the zero-field case $B=0$, where an
additional logarithmic factor $\ln(L)$ is known to be present. We also have a similar result, with
a slightly more explicit coefficient, for the simpler situation where the underlying single-particle
Hamiltonian, known as the Landau Hamiltonian, is restricted from its natural Hilbert space $\text
L^2(\mathbb R^2)$ to the eigenspace of a single but arbitrary Landau level. Both results extend
to the whole one-parameter family of quantum R\'enyi entropies.
