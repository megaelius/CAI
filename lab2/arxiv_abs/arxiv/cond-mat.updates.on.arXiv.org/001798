We analyze optical conductivity with the goal to demonstrate experimental manifestation of a new
state of matter, the so-called fermion condensate. Fermion condensates are realized in quantum
spin liquids, exhibiting typical behavior of heavy fermion metals. Measurements of the low-frequency
optical conductivity collected on the geometrically frustrated insulator herbertsmithite provide
important experimental evidence of the nature of its quantum spin liquid composed of spinons. To
analyze recent measurements of the herbertsmithite optical conductivity at different temperatures,
we employ a model of strongly correlated quantum spin liquid located near the fermion condensation
phase transition. Our theoretical analysis of the optical conductivity allows us to expose the
physical mechanism of its temperature dependence. We also predict a dependence of the optical conductivity
on a magnetic field. We consider an experimental manifestation (optical conductivity) of a new

they exhibit typical behavior of heavy-fermion metals. Measurements of the low-frequency optical
