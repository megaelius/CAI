Two-dimensional (2D) materials have become a new territory for exploring novel properties and
functionalities because of their superior tunability. The unprecedented tunability of 2D materials
is also accompanied by many and equally great challenges, as they are susceptible to defects and
disorders. The presence of defects and disorders induces the inhomogeneity of electronic states,
often making it difficult to directly probe the intrinsic properties of materials. Therefore,
many efforts have been devoted to improve the electronic homogeneity, for example, by reducing
the density of defects and disorders in the materials and at the interface. However, little attention
is paid to the disorders embedded in underlying substrates. Here we investigate how individual
dopants in substrate interact with 2D materials and give rise to the electron-hole puddles by low
temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS). Specifically, we take
the epitaxial bilayer graphene grown on nitrogen doped silicon carbide (SiC) substrates as a model
system, which has played the essential roles in many applications and fundamental studies. The
nitrogen dopants inside SiC substrate were imaged over the epitaxial graphene by STM for the first
time. The charged nitrogen dopants from the substrate induce the electron-lack puddles in graphene
with a diameter of ~2 nm, via Coulomb interaction. The Fermi level with respect to the Dirac point
is modulated by the puddles with an amplitude of ~40 meV, causing the electronic inhomogeneity of
epitaxial graphene. Our findings on this prototype material are expected to facilitate the quality
improvement of graphene and other 2D materials in general.
