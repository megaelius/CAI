We study the real-time dynamics of local occupation numbers in a one-dimensional model of spinless
fermions with a random on-site potential for a certain class of initial states. The latter are thermal
(mixed or pure) states of the model in the presence of an additional static force, but become non-equilibrium
states after a sudden removal of this static force. For this class and high temperatures, we show
that the induced dynamics is given by a single correlation function at equilibrium, independent
of the initial expectation values being prepared close to equilibrium (by a weak static force) or
far away from equilibrium (by a strong static force). Remarkably, this type of universality holds
true in both, the ergodic phase and the many-body localized regime. Moreover, it does not depend
on the specific choice of a unit cell for the local density. We particularly discuss two important
consequences. First, the long-time expectation value of the local density is uniquely determined
by the fluctuations of its diagonal matrix elements in the energy eigenbasis. Thus, the validity
of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is not only a sufficient but also a necessary condition
for thermalization. Second, the real-time broadening of density profiles is always given by the
current autocorrelation function at equilibrium via a generalized Einstein relation. In the context
of transport, we discuss the influence of disorder for large particle-particle interactions,
where normal diffusion is known to occur in the disorder-free case. Our results suggest that normal
diffusion is stable against weak disorder, while they are consistent with anomalous diffusion
for stronger disorder below the localization transition. Particularly, for weak disorder, Gaussian
density profiles can be observed for single disorder realizations, which we demonstrate for finite
lattices up to 31 sites.
