Rapid decline in fossil fuel energy necessitates the immediate need for renewable energy resources.
Here, we report a previously unexplored class of nitrides AMN$_2$ keeping renewable energy applications
in mind. Using a detailed structure and stability analysis using first principles simulation,
we discovered twelve such compounds (few of which are already synthesized before), which are chemically,
mechanically and dynamically stable. These twelve compounds were then evaluated for their suitability
for three renewable energy applications, (i) photovoltaics, (ii) water splitting, and (iii) thermoelectrics.
Careful analysis of electronic structure reveals high optical transition strength resulting
in sharp rise in absorption. This in turn yields high short circuit current and hence excellent solar
efficiency for few compounds namely CsVN$_2$ and RbVN$_2$. Along with excellent absorption quality,
some compounds show favorable band edge positions compared to water redox levels and hence are promising
as photoelectrodes in photo(electro)chemical water splitting devices. Mixture of flat and dispersive
bands in the band structure yields both high Seebeck and electrical conductivity, thus excellent
power factor for seven compounds. Simulated lattice thermal conductivity shows moderate to ultralow
values and thus the possibility of achieving high thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT), even at lower
temperatures. From the experimental perspective, we discuss the possible challenges that may
arise while utilizing these compounds for the desired applications, and suggest possible pathways
to overcome them. We believe such theoretical prediction of promising materials are extremely
useful for new materials discovery and anticipate rapid response from the experimental community.
