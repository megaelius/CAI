We introduce the concept of a hyperuniformity disorder length that controls the variance of volume
fraction fluctuations for randomly placed windows of fixed size. In particular, fluctuations
are determined by the average number of particles within a distance $h$ from the boundary of the window.
We first compute special expectations and bounds in $d$ dimensions, and then illustrate the range
of behavior of $h$ versus window size $L$ by analyzing three different types of simulated two-dimensional
pixel pattern - where particle positions are stored as a binary digital image in which pixels have
value zero/one if empty/contain a particle. The first are random binomial patterns, where pixels
are randomly flipped from zero to one with probability equal to area fraction. These have long-ranged
density fluctuations, and simulations confirm the exact result $h=L/2$. Next we consider vacancy
patterns, where a fraction $f$ of particles on a lattice are randomly removed. These also display
long-range density fluctuations, but with $h=(L/2)(f/d)$ for small $f$. For a hyperuniform system
with no long-range density fluctuations, we consider Einstein patterns where each particle is
independently displaced from a lattice site by a Gaussian-distributed amount. For these, at large
$L$, $h$ approaches a constant equal to about half the root-mean-square displacement in each dimension.
Then we turn to grayscale pixel patterns that represent simulated arrangements of polydisperse
particles, where the volume of a particle is encoded in the value of its central pixel. And we discuss
the continuum limit of point patterns, where pixel size vanishes. In general, we thus propose to
quantify particle configurations not just by the scaling of the density fluctuation spectrum but
rather by the real-space spectrum of $h(L)$ versus $L$. We call this approach Hyperuniformity Disorder
Length Spectroscopy.
