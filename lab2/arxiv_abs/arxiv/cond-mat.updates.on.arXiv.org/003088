The influence of passivating ligand on electron-phonon relaxation dynamics of the smallest sized
gold clusters was studied using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical
modeling. The electron dynamics in Au279, Au329, and Au329 passivated with TBBT, SC2Ph and SC6,
respectively, were investigated. Ultrafast transient absorption measurements were also carried
out on Au~1400 (SC6) and Au~2000 (SC6) to understand the influence of the size on electron-phonon
relaxation with the same passivating ligand. The study has revealed interesting aspects on the
role of ligand on electron-phonon relaxation dynamics wherein the aromatic passivating ligands,
SC2Ph and TBBT, have shown smaller power dependence and higher plasmon bleach indicating dampened
plasmon resonance while the cluster with aliphatic passivating ligand has behaved similarly to
regular plasmonic gold nanoparticles. To model the effect of the ligand on the plasmonic properties
of the investigated samples , free electron density correction factor of each one was calculated
using three-layered Mie theory, and the results show that SC6 inter-acts least with core-gold while
TBBT and SC2Ph have a greater effect on the surface electronic conductivity that is attributed to
pi-interaction of the ligand with gold. The results also shed light on unusual electron-phonon
relaxation and smaller slope observed for Au329 (SC2Ph) that is ascribed to surface gold-pi interaction
creating a hybrid state. In contrast, extended pi-interaction is probably the reason for plasmonic
nature observed in Au279 (TBBT) even though its size is smaller when compared to Au329. In addition,
the results also have shown that the electron-phonon coupling has increased with an increase in
the size of the cluster and theoretical modeling has shown higher electron conductivity for larger
plasmonic gold clusters.
