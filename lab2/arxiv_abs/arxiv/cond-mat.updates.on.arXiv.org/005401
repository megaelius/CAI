This paper evaluates qualitatively as well as quantitatively the accuracy of a recently proposed
Peierls--Nabarro Finite Element (PN-FE) model for dislocations by a direct comparison with an
equivalent molecular statics simulation. To this end, a two-dimensional microstructural specimen
subjected to simple shear is considered, consisting of a central soft phase flanked by two hard-phase
regions. A hexagonal atomic structure with equal lattice spacing is adopted, the interactions
of which are described by the Lennard--Jones potential with phase specific depths of its energy
well. During loading, edge dislocation dipoles centred in the soft phase are introduced, which
progress towards the phase boundaries, where they pile up. Under a sufficiently high external shear
load, the leading dislocation is eventually transmitted into the harder phase. The homogenized
PN-FE model is calibrated to an atomistic model in terms of effective elasticity constants and glide
plane properties as obtained from simple uniform deformations. To study the influence of different
formulations of the glide plane potential, multiple approaches are employed, ranging from a simple
sinusoidal function of the tangential disregistry to a complex model that couples the influence
of the tangential and the normal disregistries. The obtained results show that, qualitatively,
the dislocation structure, displacement, strain fields, and the dislocation evolution are captured
adequately. The simplifications of the PN-FE model lead, however, to some discrepancies within
the dislocation core. Such discrepancies play a dominant role in the dislocation transmission
process, which thus cannot quantitatively be captured properly. Despite its simplicity, the PN-FE
model proves to be an elegant tool for a qualitative study of edge dislocation behaviour in two-phase
microstructures, although it may not be quantitatively predictive.
