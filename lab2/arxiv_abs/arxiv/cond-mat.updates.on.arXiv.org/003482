When two monolayers of graphene are stacked with a small relative twist angle, the resulting band
structure exhibits a remarkably flat pair of bands at a sequence of 'magic angles' where correlation
effects can induce a host of exotic phases. Here, we study a class of related models of $n$-layered
graphene with alternating relative twist angle $\pm \theta$ which exhibit magic angle flat bands
coexisting with several Dirac dispersing bands at the Moir\'e K point. Remarkably, we find that
the Hamiltonian for the multilayer system can be mapped exactly to a set of decoupled bilayers at
{\it different} angles, revealing a remarkable hierarchy mathematically relating all these magic
angles to the TBG case. For the trilayer case ($n = 3$), we show that the sequence of magic angle is obtained
by multiplying the bilayer magic angles by $\sqrt{2}$, whereas the quadrilayer case ($n = 4$) has
two sequences of magic angles obtained by multiplying the bilayer magic angles by the golden ratio
$\varphi = (\sqrt{5} + 1)/2 \approx 1.62$ and its inverse. We also show that for larger $n$, we can
tune the angle to obtain several narrow (almost flat) bands simultaneously and that for $n \rightarrow
\infty$, there is a continuum of magic angles for $\theta \lesssim 2^o$. Furthermore, we show that
tuning several perfectly flat bands for a small number of layers is possible if the coupling between
different layers is different. The setup proposed here can be readily achieved by repeatedly applying
the "tear and stack" method without the need of any extra tuning of the twist angle and has the advantage
that the first magic angle is always larger than the bilayer case.
