We theoretically study a spin-orbit-coupled nanowire proximitized by a superconductor in the
presence of an externally applied Zeeman field ("Majorana nanowire") with zero-energy Majorana
bound states localized at the two ends of the wire when the Zeeman spin splitting is large enough for
the system to enter the topological phase. The specific physics of interest in the current work is
the effect of having several tunnel probes attached to the wire along its length. Such tunnel probes
should allow, as a matter of principle, one to observe both the predicted bulk superconducting gap
closing and opening associated with the topological quantum phase transition as well as the Majorana
bound states at the wire ends showing up as zero-bias conductance peaks, depending on which probes
are used for the tunneling spectroscopy measurement. Because of the possible invasive nature of
the tunnel probes, producing local potential fluctuations in the nanowire, we find the physical
situation to be quite complex. In particular, depending on the details of the tunnel barrier operational
at the probes, the Majorana nanowire could manifest additional low-energy Andreev bound states
which will manifest their own almost-zero-bias peaks, complicating the interpretation of the
tunneling data in multiprobe Majorana nanowires. We use two complementary microscopic models
to simulate the probes, finding that the tunneling conductance spectrum depends rather sensitively
on the details of the tunnel barriers at the probes. We apply our general analysis to simulate a recent
multiprobe nanowire experiment commenting on the nature of the quasiparticle gaps likely controlling
the experimental observations.
