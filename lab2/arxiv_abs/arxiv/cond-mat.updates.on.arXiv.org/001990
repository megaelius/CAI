Structural hierarchy, in which materials possess distinct features on multiple length scales,
is ubiquitous in nature; diverse biological materials, such as bone, cellulose, and muscle, have
as many as ten hierarchical levels. Structural hierarchy confers many mechanical advantages,
including improved toughness and economy of material. However, it also presents a problem: each
hierarchical level adds a new source of assembly errors, and substantially increases the information
required for proper assembly. This seems to conflict with the prevalence of naturally occurring
hierarchical structures, suggesting that a common mechanical source of hierarchical robustness
may exist. However, our ability to identify such a unifying phenomenon is limited by the lack of a
general mechanical framework for structures exhibiting organization on disparate length scales.
Here, we use simulations to substantiate a generalized model for the tensile stiffness of hierarchical,
stretching-stabilized, filamentous networks with a nested, dilute triangular lattice structure.
Following seminal work by Maxwell and others on criteria for stiff frames, we extend the concept
of connectivity in network mechanics, and find a mathematically similar dependence of material
stiffness upon each hierarchical level. Using this model, we find that the stiffness of such networks
becomes less sensitive to errors in assembly with additional levels of hierarchy; though surprising,
we show that this result is analytically predictable from first principles, and thus likely model-independent.
More broadly, this work helps account for the success of hierarchical, filamentous materials in
biology and materials design, and offers a heuristic for ensuring that desired material properties
are achieved within the required tolerance.
