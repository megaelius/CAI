The topological classification of matter has been extended to include semimetallic phases characterized
by the presence of topologically protected band degeneracies. In Weyl semimetals, the foundational
gapless topological phase, chiral degeneracies are isolated near the Fermi level and give rise
to the Fermi-arc surface states. However, it is now recognized that chiral degeneracies are ubiquitous
in the band structures of systems with broken spatial inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) or time-reversal
($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. This leads to a broadly defined notion of topological metals, which
implies the presence of disconnected Fermi surface sheets characterized by non-zero Chern numbers
inherited from the enclosed chiral degeneracies. Here, we address the possibility of experimentally
observing surface-related signatures of chiral degeneracies in metals. As a representative system
we choose bcc iron, a well-studied archetypal ferromagnetic metal with two nontrivial electron
pockets. We find that the (110) surface presents arc-like resonances attached to the topologically
nontrivial electron pockets. These Fermi-arc resonances are due to two different chiral degeneracies,
a type-I elementary Weyl point and a type-II composite (Chern numbers $\pm 2$) Weyl point, located
at slightly different energies close to the Fermi level. We further show that these surface resonances
can be controlled by changing the orientation of magnetization, eventually being eliminated following
a topological phase transition. Our study thus shows that the intricate Fermi-arc features can
be observed in materials as simple as ferromagnetic iron, and are possibly very common in polar and
magnetic materials broadly speaking. Our study also provides methodological guidelines to identifying
Fermi-arc surface states and resonances, establishing their topological origin and designing
control protocols.
