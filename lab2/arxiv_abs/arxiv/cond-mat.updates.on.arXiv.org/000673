In conventional superconductors, very narrow superconducting fluctuation regions are observed
above $T_c$ because of the strong overlapping of Cooper pairs in a coherence volume. In the bulk form
of iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe, it is argued that the system may locate in the crossover
region of BCS to BEC, indicating a strong superconducting fluctuation. In this respect, we have
carried out measurements of magnetization, specific heat and Nernst effect on FeSe single crystals
in order to investigate the superconducting fluctuation effect near $T_c$. The region of diamagnetization
induced by superconducting fluctuation seems very narrow above $T_c$. The crossing point of temperature
dependent magnetization curves measured at different magnetic fields, which appears in many systems
of cuprate superconductors and is regarded as indication of strong critical fluctuation, is however
absent. The magnetization data can be scaled based on the Ginzburg-Landau fluctuation theory for
a quasi-two-dimensional system, but the scaling result cannot be described by the theoretical
function of the fluctuation theory because of the limited fluctuation regions. The specific heat
jump near $T_c$ is rather sharp without the trace of strong superconducting fluctuation. This is
also supported by the Nernst effect measurements which indicate a very limited region for vortex
motion above $T_c$. Associated with very small value of Ginzburg number and further analyses, we
conclude that the superconducting fluctuation is very weak above $T_c$ in this material. Our results
are strongly against the picture of significant phase fluctuation in FeSe single crystals, although
the system has a very limited overlapping of Cooper pairs in the coherence volume. This dichotomy
provides new insights into the superconducting mechanism when the system is with a dilute superfluid
density.
