The acoustic, optic, and surface polar optic phonons are the three important intrinsic and extrinsic
phononic modes that increasingly populate graphene on a substrate with rising temperatures; the
coupling of which with photoexcited hot carriers in the equipartition regime provides significant
pathways for electron-phonon relaxation. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the relative
significance of the three phononic modes in electron scattering and cooling phenomena in single
layer graphene, including their comparison with supercollision driven power loss, and obtain
analytical formulae on the energy dependence of electron-phonon scattering rate and cooling power
in the Boltzmann transport formalism. The obtained analytical solutions not only closely reproduce
the results for scattering rate and cooling power, as that obtained from the earlier reported numerically
tractable integral forms, but also enable us to derive closed-form formulae of the cooling time
and thermal conductance. The important role of Pauli blocking that prevents transition to filled
energy states has also been elucidated in the estimation of the scattering rate and cooling power
density for all the three modes. The obtained formulae provide a better insight into the dynamics
of hot electron phenomena giving an explicit view on the interplay of the different variables that
affect the transport quantities under investigation. The formulae can also be potentially useful
for performance optimization of transport quantities in numerical optimization methods since
the first and second-order derivatives are easily deducible from these formulae.
