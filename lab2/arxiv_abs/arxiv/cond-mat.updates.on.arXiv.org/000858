We present a comprehensive set of measurements of optical, dielectric, diamagnetic, elastic and
viscous properties in the nematic (N) phase formed by a liquid crystalline dimer. The studied dimer,
1,7-bis-4-(4-cyanobiphenyl) heptane (CB7CB), is composed of two rigid rod-like cyanobiphenyl
segments connected by a flexible aliphatic link with seven methyl groups. CB7CB and other nematic
dimers are of interest due to their tendency to adopt bent configurations and to form two states possessing
a modulated nematic director structure, namely, the twist bend nematic, NTB, and the oblique helicoidal
cholesteric, ChOH, which occurs when the achiral dimer is doped with a chiral additive and exposed
to an external electric or magnetic field. We characterize the material parameters as functions
of temperature in the entire temperature range of the N phase, including the pre-transitional regions
near the N-NTB and N-to-isotropic (I) transitions. The splay constant K11 is determined by two direct
and independent techniques, namely, detection of the Frederiks transition and measurement of
director fluctuation amplitudes by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The bend K33 and twist K22 constants
are measured by DLS. K33 being the smallest of the three constants, shows a strong non-monotonous
temperature dependence with a negative slope in both N-I and N-NTB pretransitional regions. The
measured ratio K11/K22 is larger than 2 in the entire nematic temperature range. The orientational
viscosities associated with splay, twist and bend fluctuations in the N phase are comparable to
those of nematics formed by rod-like molecules. All three show strong temperature dependence,
increasing sharply near the N-NTB transition.
