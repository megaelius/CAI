We show that the commonly used lowest-order theory of phonon-phonon interactions frequently fails
to accurately describe the anharmonic phonon decay rates and thermal conductivity ($\kappa$),
even among strongly bonded crystals. Applying a first principles theory that includes both the
lowest-order three-phonon and the higher-order four-phonon processes to seventeen zinc blende
semiconductors, we find that the lowest-order theory drastically overestimates the measured
$\kappa$ for many of these materials, while inclusion of four-phonon scattering gives significantly
improved agreement with measurements. We have identified new selection rules on three-phonon
processes that help explain many of these failures in terms of anomalously weak anharmonic phonon
decay rates predicted by the lowest-order theory competing with four-phonon processes. We also
show that zinc blende compounds containing boron (B), carbon (C) or nitrogen (N) atoms have exceptionally
weak four-phonon scattering, much weaker than in compounds that do not contain B, C or N atoms. This
new understanding helps explain the ultrahigh $\kappa$ in several technologically important
materials like cubic boron arsenide, boron phosphide and silicon carbide. At the same time, it not
only makes the possibility of achieving high $\kappa$ in materials without B, C or N atoms unlikely,
but it also suggests that it may be necessary to include four-phonon processes in many future studies.
Our work gives new insights into the nature of anharmonic processes in solids and demonstrates the
broad importance of higher-order phonon-phonon interactions in assessing the thermal properties
of materials.
