The sudden arrest of motion due to confinement is commonly observed via the clogging transition
in the flow of particles through a constriction, such as grains in a hopper or pedestrians exiting
a stadium. Similar behavior can be observed in the bidirectional flow of two species in the absence
of a constriction due to confinement, but little is known about the nature of this transition. As
each species attempts to pass through the other, flowing particles serve as mobile obstacles and
clogging is by necessity not a consequence of arch formation. We present results of a simple experiment
to elucidate this transition in which two species of macroscopic particles with different densities
are confined in a tube and suspended in a fluid of intermediate density. We measure the clogging or
jamming probability $J$ as a function of number of particles of each species $N$ in a fixed channel
length for channel widths $D = $ 3$-$7$d$, where $d$ is the particle diameter. $J(N)$ exhibits a sigmoidal
dependence reminiscent of clogging in hopper flow and collapse on a single curve $J(N/D^3)$ indicating
the transition occurs at a critical density. Data is well-fit by a probabilistic model which assumes
that grains enter the clogging region with a fixed probability to produce a clogging state, suggesting
that a probabilistic, geometric model may be appropriate as previously applied in hopper flows.
Using a quasi-two-dimensional experiment, we gain insight into the interface shape and behavior
at larger $D$ and identify a Rayleigh-Taylor instability at large channel widths in which variations
of particle number along the width of the channel promotes instability.
