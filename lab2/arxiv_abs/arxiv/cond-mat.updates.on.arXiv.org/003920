Soft nanoparticles hold promise as smart emulsifiers due to their high degree of deformability,
permeability and stimuli responsive properties. By means of large-scale simulations we investigate
the structural properties of nanogels at liquid-liquid (A-B) interfaces and the miscibility of
the liquids inside the nanogels, covering the whole range of interfacial strength from the limit
of single-liquid to the case of stiff interfaces. To study the role of the internal architecture
and deformability of the nanogel we simulate a realistic disordered and an ideal regular network,
for a broad range of cross-linking degrees. Unlike in previous investigations on liquid miscibility,
excluded volume interactions are considered for both the monomers and the explicit solvent particles.
The nanogel permeability is analysed by using an unbiased grid representation that accounts for
the surface fluctuations and adds to the density profiles the exact number of liquid particles inside
the nanogel. The better packing efficiency of the regular network leads to higher values of the total
liquid uptake and the invasive capacity (A-particles in B-side and viceversa than in the disordered
network, though differences vanish in the limit of rigid interfaces. Uptake and invasion are optimized
at a cross-linking degree that depends on the interfacial strength, tending to 15 - 20% for moderate
and stiff interfaces. As the interfacial strength increases, the miscibility inside the nanogel
is enhanced by a factor of up to 5 with respect to the bare interface, with the disordered networks
providing a better mixing than their ideal counterparts. The emerging scenario reported here provides
general guidelines for tuning the shape, uptake, invasive, and mixing capacities of nanogels adsorbed
at liquid-liquid interfaces.
