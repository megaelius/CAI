Complex magneto structural behaviour of rare rich intermetallic Tb$_3$Co is reported in this study.
Below the 84K (T$_N$), it undergoes a first order magnetic transition 72K confirmed from specific
heat and magnetization measurements. Detailed study using magnetization, specific heat, neuron
diffraction and ac-susceptibility measurements suggests that the compound in the question possesses
canted magnetic structure. Neutron diffraction reveals that Tb moments are aligned antiferromagnetically
(AFM) in ab plane and ferromagnetically (FM) along c direction. This study focusses on the temperature
evolution of magnetic order at low temperatures. Neutron Diffraction clearly shows that magnetic
structure remains more or less same up to 70K although low field magnetization exhibits a transition
like feature around 30K. Field dependent neutron diffraction suggests that a strong spin-lattice
coupling is present at lower temperature region (below 20K) compared to that for T above 40K. This
is responsible for the observed drop in ZFC magnetization around 30K and is not due to any change in
magnetic structure. Another important but surprising result that observed is the signature of
magnetic glass below 72K in frequency dependent ac susceptibility measurements. Real part of ac-susceptibility
data shows dispersion with frequency which on detailed analysis provides evidence for spin glass
behaviour in the compound riding on top of non-collinear AFM order. Higher order harmonics in ac
non-linear) susceptibilities, which are expected to show a well-defined behaviour for pure FM
or AFM or spin glass or cluster glass systems, were also measured. However, the non-linear susceptibilities
do not exhibit any well-known variation but show complex behaviour thus indicating Tb$_3$Co is
neither a pure AFM or FM or spin glass system but provides another evidence for non-collinear magnetic
structure.
