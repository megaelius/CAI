Allosteric signaling in biological molecules, which may be viewed as specific action at a distance
due to localized perturbation upon binding of ligands or changes in environmental cues, is pervasive
in biology. Phenomenological MWC and KNF models galvanized research for over five decades, and
these models continue to be the basis for describing the allostery in an array of systems. However,
understanding allosteric signaling and the associated dynamics between distinct allosteric
states is challenging. In this review, we first describe symmetry and rigidity as essential requirements
for allosteric proteins. The general features, with MWC and KNF as two extreme scenarios, emerge
when allosteric signaling is viewed from an energy landscape perspective. To go beyond the general
theories, we describe computational tools to predict the network of residues that carry allosteric
signals. Methods to obtain molecular insights into the dynamics of allosteric transitions are
briefly mentioned. The utility of the methods is illustrated by applications to systems ranging
from monomeric proteins to multisubunit proteins. Finally, the role allostery plays in the functions
of ATP-consuming molecular machines, bacterial chaperonin GroEL and molecular motors, is described.
Although universal molecular principles governing allosteric signaling do not exist, we can draw
the following general conclusions. (1) Multiple pathways connecting allosteric states are highly
heterogeneous. (2) Allosteric signaling is exquisitely sensitive to the architecture of the system,
which implies that the capacity for allostery is encoded in the structure itself. (3) The mechanical
modes that connect distinct allosteric states are robust to sequence variations. (4) Extensive
investigations of allostery in Hemoglobin and more recently GroEL, show that a network of salt-bridge
rearrangements serves as allosteric switches.
