The design of novel functional materials in silico is severely hampered by the lack of robust and
computationally efficient methods for describing both molecular absorbance and screening on
substrates. Here we employ our hybrid $G_0[W_0+\Delta W]$-BSE implementation, which incorporates
the substrate via its screening $\Delta W$ at both the quasiparticle $G_0W_0$ level and when solving
the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). We show this method can be used to both efficiently and accurately
describe the absorption spectra of physisorbed molecules on metal substrates and thereby tailor
the molecule's absorbance by altering the surface plasmon's energy. Specifically, we investigate
how the optical absorption spectra of three prototypical $\pi$-conjugated molecules: benzene
(C$_6$H$_6$), terrylene (C$_{30}$H$_{16}$) and fullerene (C$_{60}$), depends on the Wigner-Seitz
radius $r_s$ of the metallic substrate. To gain further understanding of the light--molecule/substrate
interaction, we also study the bright exciton's electron and hole densities and their interactions
with infrared active vibrational modes. Our results show that (1) benzene's bright $E_{1u}^1$
exciton at 7.0 eV, whose energy is insensitive to changes in $r_s$, could be relevant for photocatalytic
dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions, (2) terrylene's bright $B_{3u}$ exciton at 2.3
eV hybridizes with the surface plasmon, allowing the tailoring of the excitonic energy and optical
activation of a surface plasmon-like exciton, and (3) fullerene's $\pi-\pi^*$ bright and dark
excitons at 6.4 and 6.8 eV hybridize with the surface plasmon, resulting in the tailoring of their
excitonic energy and the activation of both a surface plasmon-like exciton and a dark quadrupolar
mode via symmetry breaking by the substrate.
