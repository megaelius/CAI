We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework to study how crystal dislocations influence
the functional properties of materials, based on the idea of quantized dislocation, namely a "dislon".
Comparing to the previous dislon works which focused on exotic phenomenology, here we focus on the
theoretical structure and computational power. We first provide a pedagogical introduction of
the necessity and benefits taking the dislon approach, that why the dislon Hamiltonian takes its
current form. Then we study the electron-dislocation and phonon-dislocation scattering problems,
respectively, using the dislon formalism. Both the effective electron and phonon theories are
derived, from which the role of dislocations on electronic and phononic transport properties are
computed. Comparing with the traditional dislocation scattering studies which are intrinsically
single-particle, low-order perturbation and classical quenched defect in nature, the dislon
theory not only allows easy incorporation of quantum many-body effects such as electron correlation,
electron-phonon interaction and higher-order scattering events, but also allows proper consideration
of dislocation's long-range strain field and the dynamic aspects from equal footing. This means
that instead of developing individual model for a specific dislocation scattering problem, the
dislon theory allows for the calculation of electronic structure and electrical transport, thermal
transport, optical and superconducting properties, etc., under one unified theory. Furthermore,
the dislon theory has another advantage comparing to empirical models since it does not require
any fitting parameter. The dislon theory could serve as a major computational tool to understand
the role of dislocations on multiple materials functional properties at an unprecedented level
of clarity, and may have wide applications in dislocated energy materials.
