We perform a magneto-optical study of a two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) in the regime of
the Stoner ferromagnetic instability for even quantum Hall filling factors on Mg$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$O/ZnO
heterostructures. Under conditions of Landau-level crossing, caused by enhanced spin susceptibility
in combination with the tilting of the magnetic field, the transition between two rivaling phases-
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic- is traced in terms of optical spectra reconstruction. Synchronous
sharp transformations are observed both in the photoluminescence structure and parameters of
collective excitations upon transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic ordering. Based on
these measurements, a phase diagram is constructed in terms of the 2D electron density and tilt angle
of the magnetic field. Apart from stable paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, an instability
region is found at intermediate parameters with the Stoner transition occurring at $\nu\approx
2$. The spin configuration in all cases is unambiguously determined by means of inelastic light
scattering by spin-sensitive collective excitations. One indicator of the spin ordering is the
intra-Landau-level spin exciton, which acquires a large spectral weight in the ferromagnetic
phases. The other - is an abrupt energy shift of the intersubband charge density excitation due to
change in the many-particle energy contribution upon spin rearrangement. From our analysis of
photoluminescence and light scattering data, we estimate the ratio of surface areas occupied by
the domains of the two phases in the vicinity of a transition point. In addition, the thermal smearing
of a phase transition is characterized.
