Graphene and its heterostructures exhibit interesting electronic properties and are explored
for quantum spin Hall effect(QSHE) and magnetism based device applications. In present work, we
propose a heterostructure of graphene encapsulated by hydrogenated graphene which could be a promising
candidate for a variety of device applications. We have carried out DFT calculations on this system
to check its feasibility to be a versatile material. We found that electronic states of multilayer
pristine graphene, especially Dirac cone, an important feature to host QSHE, can be preserved by
sandwiching it by fully hydrogenated graphene. Interference of electronic states of hydrogenated
graphene was insignificant with those of graphene. States of graphene were also found to be stable
upon application of electric field up to 2.5V/nm. For device applications, multilayer graphene
or its heterostructures are required to be deposited on a substrate, which interacts with system
opening up a gap at Dirac cone making it less suitable for QSHE applications and hydrogenated graphene
can prevent it. Magnetization in these hydrogenated graphene sandwiched graphene may be induced
by creating vacancies or distortions in hydrogenated graphene, which was found to have minimal
effect on graphenes electronic states, thus providing an additional degree of manipulation. We
also performed a set of calculations to explore its applicability for detecting some molecules.
Our results on trilayer graphene encapsulated by hydrogenated graphene indicate that all these
observations can be generalized to systems with a larger number of graphene layers, indicating
that multilayer graphene sandwiched between two hydrogenated graphene is a versatile material
that can be used in QSHE, sensor devices, etc.
