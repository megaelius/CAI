Next-generation spintronic devices will benefit from low-dimensionality, ferromagnetism,
and half-metallicity, possibly controlled by electric fields. We find these technologically-appealing
features to be combined with an exotic microscopic origin of magnetism in doped CdOHCl, a van der
Waals material from which 2D layers may be exfoliated. By means of first principles simulations,
we predict homogeneous hole-doping to give rise to $p$-band magnetism in both the bulk and monolayer
phases and interpret our findings in terms of Stoner instability: as the Fermi level is tuned via
hole-doping through singularities in the 2D-like density of states, ferromagnetism develops
with large saturation magnetization of 1 $\mu_B$ per hole, leading to a half-metallic behaviour
for layer carrier densities of the order of 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, we put forward electrostatic
doping as an additional handle to induce magnetism in monolayers and bilayers of CdOHCl. Upon application
of critical electric fields perpendicular to atomically-thin-films (as low as 0.2 V/$A{\deg}$
and 0.5 V/$A{\deg}$ in the bilayer and monolayer case, respectively), we envisage the emergence
of a magnetic half-metallic state. The different behaviour of monolayer vs bilayer systems, as
well as an observed asymmetric response to positive and negative electric fields in bilayers, are
interpreted in terms of intrinsic polarity of CdOHCl atomic stacks, a distinctive feature of the
material. In perspective, given the experimentally accessible magnitude of critical fields in
bilayer of CdOHCl, one can envisage $p$ band magnetism to be exploited in miniaturized spintronic
devices.
