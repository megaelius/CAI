A method based on the Gibbs' adsorption isotherm is developed to calculate the decrease in interfacial
free energy resulting from solute segregation at an internal interface, built on measured concentration
profiles. Utilizing atom-probe tomography (APT), we first measure a concentration profile of
the relative interfacial excess of solute atoms across an interface. To accomplish this we utilize
a new method based on J. W. Cahn's formalism for the calculation of the Gibbs interfacial excess.
We also introduce a method to calculate the decrease in interfacial free energy that is caused by
the segregating solute atoms. This method yields a discrete profile of the decrease in interfacial
free energies, which takes into account the measured concentration profile and calculated Gibbsian
excess profile. We demonstrate that this method can be used for both homo- and hetero-phase interfaces
and takes into account the actual distribution of solute atoms across an interface as determined
by APT. It is applied to the case of the semiconducting system PbTe-PbS 12 mol.%-Na 1 mol.%, where
Na segregation at the PbS/PbTe interface is anticipated to reduce the interfacial free energy of
the {100} facets. We also consider the case of the nickel-based Alloy 600, where B and Si segregation
are suspected to impede inter-granular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) at homo- (GB) and hetero-phase
metal carbide (M7C3) interfaces. The concentration profiles associated with internal interfaces
are measured by APT using an ultraviolet (wavelength = 355 nm) laser to dissect nanotips on an atom-by-atom
and atomic plane-by-plane basis.
