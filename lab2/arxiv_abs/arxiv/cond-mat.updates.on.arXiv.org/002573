It has been recently proposed by Maldacena and Qi that an eternal traversable wormhole in a two dimensional
Anti de Sitter space (${\rm AdS}_2$) is the gravity dual of the low temperature limit of two Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
(SYK) models coupled by a relevant interaction (which we will refer to as spin operator). In this
paper, we study spectral and eigenstate properties of this coupled SYK model. We have found that
level statistics in the tail of the spectrum, and for a sufficiently weak coupling, shows substantial
deviations from random matrix theory which suggests that traversable wormholes are not quantum
chaotic. By contrast, for sufficiently strong coupling, corresponding to the black hole phase,
level statistics are well described by random matrix theory. This transition in level statistics
coincides approximately with a previously reported Hawking-Page transition for weak coupling.
We have shown explicitly that this thermodynamic transition turns into a sharp crossover as the
coupling increases. Likewise, this critical coupling also corresponds with the one at which the
overlap between the ground state and the thermofield double state (TFD) is smallest. In the range
of sizes we can reach by exact diagonalization, the ground state is well approximated by the TFD state
only in the strong coupling limit. This is due to the fact that the ground state is close to the eigenstate
of the spin operator corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue which is an exact TFD state at infinite
temperature. In this region, the spectral density is separated into blobs centered around the eigenvalues
of the spin operator. For weaker couplings, the exponential decay of coefficients in a tensor product
basis, typical of the TFD, becomes power law. Finally, we have also found that the total Hamiltonian
has an additional discrete symmetry which has not been reported previously.
