Using the corner-transfer matrix renormalization group approach, we revisit the three-state
chiral Potts model on the square lattice, a model proposed in the eighties to describe commensurate-incommensurate
transitions at surfaces, and with direct relevance to recent experiments on chains of Rydberg atoms.
This model was suggested by Huse and Fisher to have a chiral transition in the vicinity of the Potts
point, a possibility that turned out to be very difficult to definitely establish or refute numerically.
Our results confirm that the transition changes character at a Lifshitz point that separates a line
of Pokrosky-Talapov transition far enough from the Potts point from a line of direct continuous
order-disorder transition close to it. Thanks to the accuracy of the numerical results, we have
been able to base the analysis entirely on effective exponents to deal with the crossovers that have
hampered previous numerical investigations. The emerging picture is that of a new universality
class with exponents that do not change between the Potts point and the Lifshitz point, and that are
consistent with those of a self-dual version of the model, namely correlation lengths exponents
$\nu_x=2/3$ in the direction of the asymmetry and $\nu_y=1$ perpendicular to it, an incommensurability
exponent $\bar \beta=2/3$, a specific heat exponent that keeps the value $\alpha=1/3$ of the three-state
Potts model, and a dynamical exponent $z=3/2$. These results are in excellent agreement with experimental
results obtained on reconstructed surfaces in the nineties, and shed light on recent Kibble-Zurek
experiments on the period-3 phase of chains of Rydberg atoms.
