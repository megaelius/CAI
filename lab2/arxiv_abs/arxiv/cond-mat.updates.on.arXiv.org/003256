High quality metal thin films and nanostructures are critical building blocks for next generation
nanotechnologies. They comprise low-loss circuit elements in nanodevices, provide new catalytic
pathways for water splitting and $CO_2$ reduction technologies, and enable the confinement of
spatially extended electromagnetic waves to be harnessed for application in information processing,
energy harvesting, engineered metamaterials, and new technologies that will operate in the quantum
plasmonics limit. However, the controlled fabrication of high-definition single-crystal subwavelength
metal nanostructures remains a significant hurdle, due to the tendency for polycrystalline metal
growth using conventional physical vapor deposition methods, and the challenges associated with
placing solution-grown nanocrystals in desired orientations and locations on a surface to fabricate
functional devices. Here, we introduce a new scalable, green, wet chemical approach to monocrystalline
noble metals that enables the fabrication of ultrasmooth, epitaxial, single-crystal films of
controllable thickness. They are ideal for the subtractive manufacture of nanostructure through
ion beam milling, and additive crystalline nanostructure via lithographic patterning to enable
large area, single-crystal metamaterials and high aspect ratio nanowires. Our single-crystal
nanostructures demonstrate improved feature quality and pattern transfer yield, reduced optical
and resistive losses, tailored local fields, and greatly improved stability compared to polycrystalline
structures, supporting greater local field enhancements and enabling new practical advances
at the nanoscale.
