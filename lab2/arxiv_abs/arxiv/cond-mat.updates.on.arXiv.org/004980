The resilience of quantum entanglement to a classicality-inducing environment is tied to fundamental
aspects of quantum many-body systems. The dynamics of entanglement has recently been studied in
the context of measurement-induced entanglement transitions, where the steady-state entanglement
collapses from a volume-law to an area-law at a critical measurement probability $p_{c}$. Interestingly,
there is a distinction in the value of $p_{c}$ depending on how well the underlying unitary dynamics
scramble quantum information. For strongly chaotic systems, $p_{c} > 0$, whereas for weakly chaotic
systems, such as integrable models, $p_{c} = 0$. In this work, we investigate these measurement-induced
entanglement transitions in a system where the underlying unitary dynamics are many-body localized
(MBL). We demonstrate that the emergent integrability in an MBL system implies a qualitative difference
in the nature of the measurement-induced transition depending on the measurement basis, with $p_{c}
> 0$ when the measurement basis is scrambled and $p_{c} = 0$ when it is not. This feature is not found
in Haar-random circuit models, where all local operators are scrambled in time. When the transition
occurs at $p_{c} > 0$, we use finite-size scaling to obtain the critical exponent $\nu = 1.3(2)$,
close to the value for 2+0D percolation. We also find a dynamical critical exponent of $z = 0.98(4)$
and logarithmic scaling of the R\'{e}nyi entropies at criticality, suggesting an underlying conformal
symmetry at the critical point. This work further demonstrates how the nature of the measurement-induced
entanglement transition depends on the scrambling nature of the underlying unitary dynamics.
This leads to further questions on the control and simulation of entangled quantum states by measurements
in open quantum systems.
