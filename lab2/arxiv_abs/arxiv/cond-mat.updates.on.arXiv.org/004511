The mechanism through which cells determine their fate is intimately related to the spreading of
certain biochemical (so-called epigenetic) marks along their genome. The mechanisms behind mark
spreading and maintenance are not yet fully understood, and current models often assume a long-range
infection-like process for the dynamics of marks, due to the polymeric nature of the chromatin fibre
which allows looping between distant sites. While these existing models typically consider antagonising
marks, here we propose a qualitatively different scenario which analyses the spreading of a single
mark. We define a 1D stochastic model in which mark spreading/infection occurs as a long-range process
whereas mark erasure/recovery is a local process, with an enhanced rate at boundaries of infected
domains. In the limiting case where our model exhibits absorbing states, we find a first-order-like
transition separating the marked/infected phase from the unmarked/recovered phase. This suggests
that our model, in this limit, belongs to the long-range compact directed percolation universality
class. The abrupt nature of the transition is retained in a more biophysically realistic situation
when a basal infection/recovery rate is introduced (thereby removing absorbing states). Close
to the transition there is a range of bistability where both the marked/infected and unmarked/recovered
states are metastable and long lived, which provides a possible avenue for controlling fate decisions
in cells. Increasing the basal infection/recovery rate, we find a second transition between a coherent
(marked or unmarked) phase, and a mixed, or random, one.
