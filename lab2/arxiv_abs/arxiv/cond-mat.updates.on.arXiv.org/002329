Traditional materials discovery approaches - relying primarily on laborious experiments - have
controlled the pace of technology. Instead, computational approaches offer an accelerated path:
high-throughput exploration and characterization of virtual structures. These ventures, performed
by automated ab-initio frameworks, have rapidly expanded the volume of programmatically-accessible
data, cultivating opportunities for data-driven approaches. Herein, a collection of robust characterization
methods are presented, implemented within the Automatic Flow Framework for Materials Discovery
(AFLOW), that leverages materials data for the prediction of phase diagrams and properties of disordered
materials. These methods directly address the issue of materials synthesizability, bridging
the gap between simulation and experiment. Powering these predictions is the AFLOW.org repository
for inorganic crystals, the largest and most comprehensive database of its kind, containing more
than 2 million compounds with about 100 different properties computed for each. As calculated with
standardized parameter sets, the wealth of data also presents a favorable learning environment.
Machine learning algorithms are employed for property prediction, descriptor development, design
rule discovery, and the identification of candidate functional materials. When combined with
physical models and intelligently formulated descriptors, the data becomes a powerful tool, facilitating
the discovery of new materials for applications ranging from high-temperature superconductors
to thermoelectrics. These methods have been validated by the synthesis of two new permanent magnets
introduced herein - the first discovered by computational approaches.
