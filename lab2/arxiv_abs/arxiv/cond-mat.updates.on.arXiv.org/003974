We study the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ on a multinode Weyl semimetal
(mWSM) of arbitrary integer monopole charge $n$, with the two Weyl multinodes separated in $\mathbf{k}$-space.
Besides type-I mWSMs, there exist type-II mWSMs which are characterized by the tilted minimal dispersion
for low-energy excitations; the Weyl points in type-II mWSMs are still protected crossings but
appears at the contact of the electron and hole pockets, after the Lifshitz transition. We find that
the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field destroys the occupation pockets due to the Landau
quantization. In this theory, the Hilbert space is spanned by a set of $n$ chiral degenerate ground
states, and a countably infinite number of particle-hole symmetric Landau levels. We calculate
the Hall conductivity for the tilt-symmetric case of type-I mWSM using the Kubo formula in the zero
frequency (DC) limit, and show that the exact $T \rightarrow 0$ expression generalizes from the
formula for elementary ($n=1$) type-I WSMs. All of the $n$ degenerate zero modes contribute to Hall
transport in effect, and the well known topologically protected anomalous vacuum contribution
is preserved. We derive an expression (valid for arbitrary $n$) for the type-II mWSM Hall conductivity
at zero temperature, which is bounded by a Landau level cutoff introduced on physical grounds and
is analogous to the momentum cutoff for the $B = 0$ case. The corresponding zero temperature thermal
Hall and Nernst conductivities are evaluated and characterized for both phases. Interestingly,
we find that the anomalous contribution is vanishing in the type-II phase, unlike its non-universal
character in the absence of the magnetic field. We show that the anomalous contribution vanishes
at finite temperature.
