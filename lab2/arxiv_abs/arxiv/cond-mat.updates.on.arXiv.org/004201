An efficient electro-optical modulation has been demonstrated here by using an edge plasmon mode
specific for the hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Our approach addresses a major obstacle of the integrated
microwave photonics caused by the polarization constraints of both active and passive components.
In addition to sub-wavelength confinement, typical for surface plasmon polaritons, the edge plasmon
modes enable exact matching of the polarization requirements for silicon based input/output grating
couplers, waveguides and electro-optical modulators. A concept of the hybrid waveguide, implemented
in a sandwich-like structure, implies a coupling of propagating plasmon modes with a waveguide
mode. The vertically arranged sandwich includes a thin layer of epsilon-near-zero material (indium
tin oxide) providing an efficient modulation at small length scales. Employed edge plasmons possess
a mixed polarization state and can be excited with horizontally polarized waveguide modes. It allows
the resulting modulator to work directly with efficient grating couplers and avoid using bulky
and lossy polarization converters. A 3D optical model based on Maxwell equations combined with
drift-diffusion semiconductor equations is developed. Numerically heavy computations involving
the optimization of materials and geometry have been performed. Effective modes, stationary state
field distribution, an extinction coefficient, optical losses and charge transport properties
are computed and analyzed. In addition to the polarization matching, the advantages of the proposed
model include the compact planar geometry of the silicon waveguide, reduced active electric resistance
R and a relatively simple design, attractive for experimental realization.
