We investigate the topological nodal structure of three-dimensional (3D) ZrTe$_5$ driven by Zeeman
splitting as a function of the direction of external magnetic (B) field by using a Wannier-function-based
tight-binding (WFTB) model obtained from first-principles calculations. It is known that small
external stimuli can drive 3D ZrTe$_5$ into different topological phases including Dirac semimetal.
In order to emphasize the effect of Zeeman splitting, we consider 3D ZrTe$_5$ in a strong TI phase
with a small band gap. With Zeeman splitting greater than the band gap, the WFTB model suggests that
a type-I nodal ring protected by (glide) mirror symmetry is formed when the B field aligns with the
crystal $a$ or $b$ axes, and that a pair of type-I Weyl nodes are formed otherwise, when conduction
and valence bands touch. We show that a pair of Weyl nodes can disappear through formation of a nodal
ring, rather than requiring two Weyl nodes with opposite chirality to come together. Interestingly,
a type-II nodal ring appears from crossings of the top two valence bands when the B field is applied
along the $c$ axis. This nodal ring gaps out to form type-II Weyl nodes when the B field rotates in the
$bc$ plane. Comparing the WFTB and linearized $k \cdot p$ model, we find inadequacy of the latter
at some B field directions. Further, using the WFTB model, we numerically compute the intrinsic
anomalous Hall conductivity ${\sigma_{ac}}$ induced by Berry curvature as a function of chemical
potential and B field direction. We find that ${\sigma_{ac}}$ increases abruptly when the B field
is tilted from the $a$ axis within the $ab$ plane. Our WFTB model also shows significant anomalous
Hall conductivity induced by avoided level crossings even in the absence of Weyl nodes.
