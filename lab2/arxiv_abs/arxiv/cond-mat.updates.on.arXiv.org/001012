Combining low-dimensional materials and a wide bandgap semiconductor opens a new playing field
for quantum optics using sub-bandgap excitation. 2D van der Waals stacked hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN) has gained considerable attention as it hosts single quantum emitters (QEs) for wavelengths
above the UV spectral range. Previously, QEs density in h-BN has been linked to the perimeters of
the system. It has been demonstrated that curvature in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
can play a key role in QE formation. We study a relatively unexplored, curvature-abundant species
of the BN system, quasi 1D BN nanotubes (BNNTs) fabricated via a catalyst-free method. We find that
non-treated BNNT is a naturally abundant source of stable QEs. We analyze the spectral, phononic
and photo-dynamics features of these QEs from micro-bundles down to single nanotubes, comparing
dispersed and suspended BNNT. Combining laser excitation with high spatial resolution imagery
of an SEM, we pin-point emission origin to less than 20 nm, giving us a one-to-one validation of emission
source. This allows us to visualize material smaller than the excitation wavelength, elucidating
nano-antenna effects. We narrow down emission to two origins: hybrid material and bundled BNNT
nanotubes. Finally, we artificially induce curvature in 2D h-BN flakes and recover the same QE spectral
features observed in BNNT material. The out of the box availability of abundant stable QEs in BNNT
with the lack of processing contamination is another milestone to correctly unravel the atomic
features of this family of single QEs. Artificially curving h-BN, giving rise to QEs, opens more
possibilities for precision engineering of QEs, puts h-BN under a similar umbrella of QEs observed
in TMDCs and provides a general model explaining QEs spatial localization and formation using electron/ion
irradiation and chemical etching.
