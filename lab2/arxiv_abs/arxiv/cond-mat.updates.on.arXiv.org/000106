Solid-solid collapse transition in open framework structures is ubiquitous in nature. The real
difficulty in understanding detailed microscopic aspects of such transitions in molecular systems
arises from the interplay between different energy and length scales involved in molecular systems,
often mediated through a solvent. In this work we employ Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to study the
collapse transition in a model molecular system interacting via both isotropic as well as anisotropic
interactions having different length and energy scales. The model we use is known as Mercedes-Benz
(MB) which for a specific set of parameters sustains three solid phases: honeycomb, oblique and
triangular. In order to study the temperature induced collapse transition, we start with a metastable
honeycomb solid and induce transition by heating. High density oblique solid so formed has two characteristic
length scales corresponding to isotropic and anisotropic parts of interaction potential. Contrary
to the common believe and classical nucleation theory, interestingly, we find linear strip-like
nucleating clusters having significantly different order and average coordination number than
the bulk stable phase. In the early stage of growth, the cluster grows as linear strip followed by
branched and ring-like strips. The geometry of growing cluster is a consequence of the delicate
balance between two types of interactions which enables the dominance of stabilizing energy over
the destabilizing surface energy. The nuclei of stable oblique phase are wetted by intermediate
order particles which minimizes the surface free energy. We observe different pathways for pressure
and temperature induced transitions.
