Thermally induced transport experiments through nanostructures give access to an exciting regime
where fluctuations are relevant, enabling studies of fundamental thermodynamic concepts and
the realization of thermal energy harvesters. Serial double quantum dots represent a model system
for a quantum mechanical two-level system with high sensitivity to fluctuations. By combining
finite bias spectroscopy with heated measurements and detailed modelling we demonstrate the principles
of heat driven transport in such systems. Our experimental system consists of a serial double quantum
dot formed in an InAs/InP nanowire, which is coupled to two electron reservoirs and a phonon bath.
By using a local metallic joule-heater, we reach a regime where the temperatures of both electron
reservoirs and the phonon bath differ. We show that for phonon temperatures exceeding the electron
temperatures in the reservoirs, phonon-assisted transport enables heat conversion into electrical
power. In addition, different temperatures in the electron reservoirs induce currents via the
thermoelectric effect. As the interdot coupling decreases, we observe a transition from mainly
thermoelectrically driven to predominantly phonon-assisted transport and discuss how via tuning
of the interdot tunnel coupling control over the dominant transport mechanism is possible. Consequently,
variation of the interdot coupling in the experiment in combination with modelling of our system
allows disentangling of the two effects. We further present evidence of sensitivity of phonon-assisted
transport to excited states. Our findings highlight that the well-established system of serial
double quantum dots offers a versatile platform for studies of fluctuations and fundamental nanothermodynamics
and provide the required tools to disentangle and interpret experimental data.
