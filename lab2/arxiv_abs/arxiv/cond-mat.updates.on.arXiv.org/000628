Phonon transports of group-VA elements (As, Sb, Bi) monolayer semiconductors have been widely
investigated in theory, and Sb monolayer (antimonene) of them has recently been synthesized. In
this work, phonon transport of SbAs monolayer is investigated from a combination of first-principles
calculations and the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation. It is found that the lattice thermal
conductivity of SbAs monolayer is lower than ones of both As and Sb monolayers, and the corresponding
sheet thermal conductance is 28.8 $\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ at room temperature. Calculated results
show that group velocities of SbAs monolayer are between ones of As and Sb onolayers, but phonon lifetimes
of SbAs are smaller than ones of both As and Sb monolayers. Hence, low lattice thermal conductivity
in SbAs monolayer is attributed to very small phonon lifetimes. Unexpectedly, the ZA branch has
very little contribution to the total thermal conductivity, only 2.4\%, which is obviously different
from ones of As and Sb monolayers with very large contribution. This can be explained by very small
phonon lifetimes for ZA branch of SbAs monolayer. The large charge transfer from Sb to As atoms leads
strongly polarized covalent bond, being different from As or Sb monolayer. The strongly polarized
covalent bond of SbAs monolayer can induce stronger phonon anharmonicity than As or Sb monolayer,
leading to lower lattice thermal conductivity. It is found that isotope scattering produces neglectful
effect, and the lattice thermal conductivity with the characteristic length smaller than 30 nm
can reach a decrease of about 47\%. These results may offer perspectives on tuning lattice thermal
conductivity by mixture of multi-elements for applications of thermal management and thermoelectricity,
and motivate further experimental efforts to synthesize monolayer SbAs.
