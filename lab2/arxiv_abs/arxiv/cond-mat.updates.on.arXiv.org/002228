Nitride has been drawing much attention for nearly half a century for its wide applications in optoelectronic
devices and still remains a plenty of room for materials design and discovery. Here, a large set of
nitrides have been designed, with their band gap and alignment being studied by first principle
calculations combined with machine learning. First, a small subset of designed nitrides were randomly
selected and their band gap, band offset against wurtzite GaN were accurately calculated by HSE.
Second, an 18-dimensional feature space was built upon elemental properties and HSE calculation
results were used to train and test machine learning models. After comparison among the performance
of support vector regression (SVR) with different kernels, linear regression and neural network
(NN) with different number of hidden layers, it was found that SVR with radial kernel is the best model
for predicting both band gap and band offset with prediction root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.298
eV and 0.130 eV, respectively, both of which are within HSE calculation uncertainty. Third, when
band gap calculated by PBE was added into the feature space, band gap prediction RMSE decreases to
0.099 eV. Through a feature engineering, elemental-property-based recursive feature extraction
algorithm (EPRFE), a new elemental property based feature space was established. Band gap prediction
RMSE has a small drop compared to 0.298 eV and the relative importance of elemental properties for
band gap prediction was found. Finally, band gap and band offset of all nitrides in the design space
were predicted and it was noticed that as the number of cation types increases, band gap tends to go
up while band offset tends to go down. Since the predicted band-gaps distribute in all valuable band
gap ranges, the predicted results will be useful for nitride design and discovery targeted towards
various applications.
