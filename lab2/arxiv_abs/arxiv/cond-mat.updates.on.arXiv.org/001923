The integral equation coarse-graining (IECG) approach is a promising high-level coarse-graining
(CG) method for polymer melts, with variable resolution from soft spheres to multi CG sites, which
preserves the structural and thermodynamical consistencies with the related atomistic simulations.
When compared to the atomistic description, the procedure of coarse-graining results in smoother
free energy surfaces, longer-ranged potentials, a decrease in the number of interaction sites
for a given polymer, and more. Because these changes have competing effects on the computational
efficiency of the CG model, care needs to be taken when studying the effect of coarse-graining on
the computational speed-up in CG molecular dynamics simulations. For instance, treatment of long-range
CG interactions requires the selection of cutoff distances that include the attractive part of
the effective CG potential and force. In particular, we show how the complex nature of the range and
curvature of the effective CG potential, the selection of a suitable CG timestep, the choice of the
cutoff distance, the molecular dynamics algorithms, and the smoothness of the CG free energy surface
affect the efficiency of IECG simulations. By direct comparison with the atomistic simulations
of relatively short chain polymer melts, we find that the overall computational efficiency is highest
for the highest level of CG (soft spheres), with an overall improvement of the computational efficiency
being about $10^6-10^8$ for various CG levels/resolutions. Therefore, the IECG method can have
important applications in molecular dynamics simulations of polymeric systems. Finally, making
use of the standard spatial decomposition algorithm, the parallel scalability of the IECG simulations
for various levels of CG is presented. Optimal parallel scaling is observed for a reasonably large
number of processors.
