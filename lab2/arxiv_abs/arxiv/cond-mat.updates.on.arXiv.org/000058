Magnetic systems based on the manipulation of domain walls (DWs) in nano-tracks have been shown
to store data at high density, perform complex logic operations, and mechanically manipulate magnetic
beads. The magnetic track has been a model system to study magnetic and magneto-electronic phenomena,
such as field induced DW propagation and spin-transfer torque. This thesis focuses on DW manipulation
and DW-based devices in spin-valve (SV) tracks. In comparison to monolayer tracks, the SV track
enables more sensitive and versatile measurements, as well as an electronic output of DW-based
devices, of crucial interest to applications. However, these multi-layered tracks add new, potentially
disruptive magnetic interactions, as well as fabrication challenges. In this thesis, the DW propagation
in SV tracks of different compositions was studied, and a system with DW propagation properties
comparable to the state-of-the-art in monolayer tracks was demonstrated, down to an unprecedented
lateral size of 33nm. Several logic devices were demonstrated and studied, namely a turn-counting
DW spiral, a DW gate, DW logic NOT gates, and a DW-DW interactor. It was found that the magnetic behaviour
of these devices was analogous to that of monolayer structures, and the device performance, as defined
by the range of field wherein they function desirably, was found to be comparable to that of monolayer
systems. The interaction between DWs in adjacent tracks was studied and new phenomena were characterised,
such as DW depinning induced by a static or travelling adjacent DW. The contribution of different
mechanisms to electrical current induced depinning were quantified, and it was found that the Oersted
field, negligible in monolayer tracks, was responsible for large variations in depinning field
in SV tracks, and that the strength of spin-transfer effect was similar to that reported in monolayer
tracks.
