We argue that random testing (polling the fraction of infected people in the population) is central
to managing the COVID-19 pandemic because it both measures the key variable controlled by restrictive
measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare system via the progression of the disease.
Knowledge of random testing outcomes will therefore (i) significantly improve the predictability
of the course of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive
measures, with much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment
of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates (such as new tracing strategies based
on the mobile telephone network, wearing face masks, etc.). Frequent random testing for COVID-19
infections has the essential benefit of providing more reliable and refined data than currently
available, in both time and space. This is crucial to accompany and monitor the safe release of restrictive
measures. Here we show that independent of the total size of population with frequent interactions
among its members, about 15000 tests with randomly selected people per day suffice to obtain valuable
data about the current number of infections and their evolution in time. In contrast to testing confined
to particular subpopulations such as those displaying symptoms, this will allow close to real-time
assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. With yet higher testing capacity,
random testing further allows detection of geographical differences in spreading rates and thus
the formulation of optimal strategies for a safe reboot of the economy. Most importantly, with daily
random testing in place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is still
an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a reboot without such polling.
