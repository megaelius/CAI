Reliable material property data is crucial for trustworthy simulations throughout different
areas of engineering. Special care must be taken when materials at extreme conditions are under
study. Superconductors and devices assembled from superconductors and other materials, like
superconducting magnets, are often operated at such extreme conditions: at low temperatures under
high magnetic fields and stresses. Typically, some library or database is used for getting the data.
We have started to develop a database for storing all kind of material property data online called
Open Material Property Library With Native Simulation Tool Integrations -- MASTO. The data that
can be imported includes, but is not limited to, anisotropic critical current surfaces for high
temperature superconducting materials, electrical resistivities as a function of temperature,
RRR and magnetic field, general fits for describing material behaviour etc. Data can also depend
on other data and it can be versioned to guarantee permanent access. The guiding idea in MASTO is to
build easy-to-use integration for various programming languages, modelling frameworks and simulation
software. Currently, a full-fledged integration is built for MATLAB to allow users to fetch and
use data with one-liners. In this paper we briefly review some of the material property databases
commonly used in superconductor modelling, present a case study showing how selection of the material
property data can influence the simulation results, and introduce the principal ideas behind MASTO.
This work serves as the reference document for citing MASTO when it is used in simulations.
