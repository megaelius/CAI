The concept of a hyperuniformity disorder length $h$ was recently introduced for analyzing volume
fraction fluctuations for a set of measuring windows. This length permits a direct connection to
the nature of disorder in the spatial configuration of the particles, and provides a way to diagnose
the degree of hyperuniformity in terms of the scaling of $h$ and its value in comparison with established
bounds. Here, this approach is generalized for extended particles, which are larger than the image
resolution and can lie partially inside and partially outside the measuring windows. The starting
point is an expression for the volume fraction variance in terms of four distinct volumes: that of
the particle, the measuring window, the mean-squared overlap between particle and region, and
the region over which particles have non-zero overlap with the measuring window. After establishing
limiting behaviors, computational methods are developed for both continuum and pixelated particles.
Exact results are presented for particles of special shape, and for measuring windows of special
shape. Comparison is made for other particle shapes, using simulated Poisson patterns. And the
effects of polydisersity and image errors are discussed. For small measuring windows, both particle
shape and spatial arrangement affect the form of the variance. For large regions, the variance scaling
depends only on arrangement but particle shape sets the numerical proportionality. The combined
understanding permit the measured variance to be translated to the spectrum of hyperuniformity
lengths versus region size, as the quantifier of spatial arrangement. This program is demonstrated
for a system of non-overlapping particles at a series of increasing packing fractions as well as
for an Einstein pattern of particles with several different extended shapes.
