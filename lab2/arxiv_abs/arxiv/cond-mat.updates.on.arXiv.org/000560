Magnetism is a very fascinating and dynamic field. Especially in the last 30 years it has experienced
many major advances in the full range from novel fundamental phenomena to new products. Applications
such as hard disk drives and magnetic sensors are part of our daily life, and new applications, such
as in non-volatile computer random access memory, are expected to surface shortly. Thus it is timely
for describing the current status, and current and future challenges in the form of a Roadmap article.
This 2014 Magnetism Roadmap provides a view on several selected, currently very active innovative
developments. It consists of 12 sections, each written by an expert in the field and addressing a
specific subject, with strong emphasize on future potential. This Roadmap cannot cover the entire
field. We have selected several highly relevant areas without attempting to provide a full review
- a future update will have room for more topics. The scope covers mostly nano-magnetic phenomena
and applications, where surfaces and interfaces provide additional functionality. New developments
in fundamental topics such as interacting nano-elements, novel magnon-based spintronics concepts,
spin-orbit torques and spin-caloric phenomena are addressed. New materials, such as organic magnetic
materials and permanent magnets are covered. New applications are presented such as nano-magnetic
logic, non-local and domain-wall based devices, heat-assisted magnetic recording, magnetic
random access memory, and applications in biotechnology. May the Roadmap serve as a guideline for
future emerging research directions in modern magnetism.
