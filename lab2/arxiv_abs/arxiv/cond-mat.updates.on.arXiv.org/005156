The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) offers a universal mechanism for the approach
to equilibrium of closed quantum many-body systems. So far, however, experimental studies have
focused on the relaxation dynamics of observables as described by the diagonal part of ETH, whose
verification requires substantial numerical input. This leaves many of the general assumptions
of ETH untested. Here, we propose a theory-independent route to probe the full ETH in quantum simulators
by observing the emergence of fluctuation-dissipation relations, which directly probe the off-diagonal
part of ETH. We present protocols to independently measure fluctuations and dissipations as well
as higher-order time ordered correlation functions. We first show how the emergence of fluctuation
dissipation relations from a nonequilibrium initial state can be observed for the 2D Bose-Hubbard
model in superconducting qubits or quantum gas microscopes. Then we focus on the long-range transverse
field Ising model (LTFI), which can be realized with trapped ions. The LTFI exhibits rich thermalization
phenomena: For strong transverse fields, we observe prethermalization to an effective magnetization-conserving
Hamiltonian in the fluctuation dissipation relations. For weak transverse fields, confined excitations
lead to non-thermal features resulting in a violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relations
up to long times. Moreover, in an integrable region of the LTFI, thermalization to a generalized
Gibbs ensemble occurs and the fluctuation-dissipation relations enable an experimental diagonalization
of the Hamiltonian. Our work presents a theory-independent way to characterize thermalization
in quantum simulators and paves the way to quantum simulate condensed matter pump-probe experiments.
