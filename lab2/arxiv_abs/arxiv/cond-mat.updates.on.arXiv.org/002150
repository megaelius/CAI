The structural stability and magnetic interaction in Cr (1,3,5)\% 3C-SiC samples synthesized
by Thermal Plasma Technique were investigated. The sample was characterized by X-Ray Diffraction
(XRD), Temperature variation Raman spectroscopy (110 K- 840 K), Variable temperature (100 K-450
K) X-band and Q-band Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy and SQUID-Vibrating Sample
Magnetometry respectively. The X-Ray diffraction pattern and Raman spectra of all the samples
indicate the incorporation of Cr into SiC host matrix and that CrSiC has crystallized in cubic crystal
structure with F$\bar{4}$3m space group symmetry. Temperature variation Raman spectra were analyzed
by longitudinal optical plasmon coupling model. An excellent fit between experimental data and
theoretical simulated spectra was found. This interaction between carrier and surface plasmon
is accounted for the non monotonous behavior of Longitudinal Optical mode in the Raman spectra.
High temperature magnetic measurements exhibit ferromagnetic behavior with non-zero value of
coercivity for all the samples up to 7 Tesla field. Temperature variation of magnetization shows
that the Curie temperature is above 760 K. Electron paramagnetic resonance study reveals the nature
of chromium valence state (Cr$^{3+}$) and its interaction with the neighboring environment. The
variation of peak intensity and resonance field with different temperature and concentration
were analyzed. Quantitative analysis of magnetic interaction was done and explained using Bound
Magnetic Polaron Model which probably arises out of the exchange interaction of Cr$^{3+}$ ions
with related (Si, C) defects.
