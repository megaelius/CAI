Both animal and plant tissue exhibit a nonlinear rheological phenomenon known as compression stiffening,
or an increase in moduli with increasing uniaxial compressive strain. Does such a phenomenon exist
in single cells, which are the building blocks of tissues? One expects an individual cell to compression
soften since the semiflexible biopolymer-based cytoskeletal network maintains the mechanical
integrity of the cell and in vitro semiflexible biopolymer networks typically compression soften.
To the contrary, we find that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) compression stiffen under uniaxial
compression via atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies. To understand this finding, we uncover
several potential mechanisms for compression stiffening. First, we study a single semiflexible
polymer loop modeling the actomyosin cortex enclosing a viscous medium modeled as an incompressible
fluid. Second, we study a two-dimensional semiflexible polymer/fiber network interspersed with
area-conserving loops, which are a proxy for vesicles and fluid-based organelles. Third, we study
two-dimensional fiber networks with angular-constraining crosslinks, i.e. semiflexible loops
on the mesh scale. In the latter two cases, the loops act as geometric constraints on the fiber network
to help stiffen it via increased angular interactions. We find that the single semiflexible polymer
loop model agrees well with our AFM experiments until approximately 35% compressive strain. We
also find for the fiber network with area-conserving loops model that the stress-strain curves
are sensitive to the packing fraction and size distribution of the area-conserving loops, thereby
creating a mechanical fingerprint across different cell types. Finally, we make comparisons between
this model and experiments on fibrin networks interlaced with beads as well as discuss the tissue-scale
implications of cellular compression stiffening.
