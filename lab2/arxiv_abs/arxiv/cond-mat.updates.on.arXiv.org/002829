Strong electron-electron interaction in ultraflat edge states can be responsible for correlated
phases of matter, such as magnetism, charge density wave or superconductivity. Here we consider
the diamond(111) surface that, after Pandey reconstruction, presents zig-zag carbon chains,
generating a flat surface band. By performing full structural optimization with hybrid functionals
and neglecting spin polarization, we find that a substantial dimerization ($0.090$ {\AA} / $0.076$
{\AA} bond disproportionation in the PBE0/HSE06) occurs on the chains; a structural effect absent
in calculations based on the LDA/GGA functionals. This dimerization is the primary mechanism for
the opening of an insulating gap in the absence of spin polarization. The single-particle direct
gap is $1.7$ eV ($1.0$ eV) in the PBE0 (HSE06), comparable with the experimental optical gap of $1.47$
eV, and on the larger(smaller) side of the estimated experimental single particle gap window of
1.57-1.87 eV, after inclusion of excitonic effects. However, by including spin polarization in
the calculation, we find that the exchange interaction stabilizes a different ground state, undimerized,
with no net magnetization and ferrimagnetic along the Pandey $\pi$-chains with magnetic moments
as large as $0.2-0.3~\mu_B$ in the PBE0. The direct single-particle band gap in the equal spin-channel
is approximately $2.2$ eV ($1.5$ eV) with the PBE0 (HSE06) functional. Our work is relevant for systems
with flat bands in general and wherever the interplay between structural, electronic and magnetic
degrees of freedom is crucial, as in twisted bilayer graphene, IVB atoms on IVB(111) surfaces such
as Pb/Si(111) or molecular crystals.
