This study investigates the changes of magnetic ordering temperature via nano- and mesoscale structural
features in an iron arsenide. Although magnetic ground states in quantum materials can be theoretically
predicted from known crystal structures and chemical compositions, the ordering temperature
is harder to pinpoint due to such local lattice variations. In this work we find surprisingly that
a locally disordered material can exhibit a significantly larger Neel temperature (TN) than an
ordered material of precisely the same chemical stoichiometry. Here, a EuFe2As2 crystal, which
is a 122 parent of iron arsenide superconductors, is found through synthesis to have ordering below
TN = 195 K (for the disordered crystal) or TN = 175 K (for the ordered crystal). In the higher TN crystals,
there are shorter planar Fe-Fe bonds [2.7692(2) A vs. 2.7745(3) A], a randomized in-plane defect
structure, and diffuse scattering along the [00L] crystallographic direction that manifests
as a rather broad specific heat peak. For the lower TN crystals, the a-lattice parameter is larger
and the in-plane microscopic structure shows defect ordering along the antiphase boundaries,
giving a larger TN and a higher superconducting temperature (Tc) upon the application of pressure.
First principles calculations find a strong interaction between c-axis strain and interlayer
magnetic coupling, but little impact of planar strain on the magnetic order. Neutron single-crystal
diffraction shows that the low-temperature magnetic phase transition due to localized Eu moments
is not lattice or disorder sensitive, unlike the higher-temperature Fe sublattice ordering. This
study demonstrates a higher magnetic ordering point arising from local disorder in 122.
