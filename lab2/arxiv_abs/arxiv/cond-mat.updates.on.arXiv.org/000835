With the recent exponential growth of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), the development
of efficient and ultrafast brain-like (neuromorphic) systems is crucial for future information
and communication technologies. While the implementation of AI systems using computer algorithms
of neural networks is emerging rapidly, scientists are just taking the very first steps in the development
of the hardware elements of an artificial brain, specifically neuromorphic microchips. In this
review article, we present the current state of neuromorphic photonic circuits based on solid-state
optoelectronic oscillators formed by nanoscale double barrier quantum well resonant tunneling
diodes. We address, both experimentally and theoretically, the key dynamic properties of recently
developed artificial solid-state neuron microchips with delayed perturbations and describe
their role in the study of neural activity and regenerative memory. This review covers our recent
research work on excitable and delay dynamic characteristics of both single and autaptic (delayed)
artificial neurons including all-or-none response, spike-based data encoding, storage, signal
regeneration and signal healing. Furthermore, the neural responses of these neuromorphic microchips
display all the signatures of extended spatio-temporal localized structures (LSs) of light, which
are reviewed here in detail. By taking advantage of the dissipative nature of LSs, we demonstrate
potential applications in optical data reconfiguration and clock and timing at high-speeds and
with short transients. The results reviewed in this article are a key enabler for the development
of high-performance optoelectronic devices in future high-speed brain-inspired optical memories
and neuromorphic computing.
