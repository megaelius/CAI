Frictional properties of interfaces with dynamic chemical bonds have been the subject of intensive
experimental investigation and modelling, as it provides important insights into the molecular
origin of the empirical rate and state laws, which have been highly successful in describing friction
from nano to geophysical scales. Using previously developed theoretical approaches requires
time-consuming simulations that are impractical for many realistic tribological systems. To
solve this problem and set a framework for understanding microscopic mechanisms of friction at
interfaces including multiple microscopic contacts, we developed an analytical approach for
description of friction mediated by dynamical formation and rupture of microscopic interfacial
contacts, which allows to calculate frictional properties on the time and length scales that are
relevant to tribological experimental conditions. The model accounts for the presence of various
types of contacts at the frictional interface and predicts novel dependencies of friction on sliding
velocity, temperature and normal load, which are amenable to experimental observations. Our model
predicts the velocity-temperature scaling, which relies on the interplay between the effects
of shear and temperature on the rupture of interfacial contacts. The proposed scaling can be used
to extrapolate the simulation results to a range of very low sliding velocities used in nanoscale
friction experiments, which is still unreachable by simulations. Considering friction force
microscopy experiments (FFM), we reveal a mechanism of nonlinear dependence of friction on normal
load observed in recent FFM experiments. Our work provides a promising avenue for the interpretation
of the experimental data on friction at interfaces including microscopic contacts and open new
pathways for the rational control of the frictional response.
