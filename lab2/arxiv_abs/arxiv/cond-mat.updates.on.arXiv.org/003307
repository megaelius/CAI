Micro- and nano-resonators have important applications including sensing, navigation, and biochemical
detection. Their performance is quantified using the quality factor $Q$, which gives the ratio
of the energy stored to the energy dissipated per cycle. Metallic glasses are a promising materials
class for micro- and nano-scale resonators since they are amorphous and can be fabricated precisely
into complex shapes on these lengthscales. To understand the intrinsic dissipation mechanisms
that ultimately limit large $Q$-values in metallic glasses, we perform molecular dynamics simulations
to model metallic glass resonators subjected to bending vibrations. We calculate the vibrational
density of states, redistribution of energy from the fundamental mode of vibration, and $Q$ versus
the kinetic energy per atom $K$ of the excitation. In the linear and nonlinear response regimes where
there are no atomic rearrangements, we find that $Q \rightarrow \infty$ (since we do not consider
coupling to the environment). We identify a characteristic $K_r$ above which atomic rearrangements
occur, and there is significant energy leakage from the fundamental mode to higher frequencies,
causing finite $Q$. Thus, $K_r$ is a critical parameter determining resonator performance. We
show that $K_r$ decreases as a power-law, $K_r\sim N^{-k},$ with increasing system size $N$, where
$k \approx 1.3$. We estimate the critical strain $\langle \gamma_r \rangle \sim 10^{-8}$ for micron-sized
resonators below which atomic rearrangements do not occur, and thus large $Q$-values can be obtained
when they are operated below $\gamma_r$. We find that $K_r$ for amorphous resonators is comparable
to that for resonators with crystalline order.
