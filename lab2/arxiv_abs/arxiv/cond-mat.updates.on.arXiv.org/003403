A comparative study of the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in metals within the single-band Hubbard
model on the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice using both mean-field (Stoner) approximation (MFA)
and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is done. The MCE is investigated in the case of second order
magnetic phase transition from ferromagnet to paramagnet. To ensure presence of itinerant ferromagnetism
in the Hubbard model the special case of spectrum parameters generating giant van Hove singularity
at the bottom of the band is considered, while the Fermi level $E_{\rm f}$ is in the vinicity of the
band bottom. To compare MCE within MFA and DMFT temperature dependence of magnetization, total
energy and finally entropy for a set of Coulomb interactions $U$ at zero and finite values of magnetic
field $h$ for both methods were performed. Also one of the MCE potentials, isothermal entropy change,
as a function of temperature $\Delta S (T)$ for both MFA and DMFT is calculated. In the MFA, the expected
maximum value of $\Delta S (T)$ at the Curie temperature $T_C$ ($\Delta S_{\rm max}$) quite significantly
decreases while $U$ grows. Similar but much weaker decreasing of $\Delta S_{\rm max}$ is found for
DMFT results. The account of local quantum fluctuations results in larger values of $\Delta S_{\rm
max}$ within DMFT than within MFA. A peak width of $\Delta S (T)$ at half height is approximately the
same for both methods. Another effect of DMFT local quantum fluctuations is the destruction of anomalous
Curie temperature $T_C$ dependence on $U$ present in MFA, which is invoked by an effect of giant van
Hove singularity. However the relative cooling power (RCP) is very close in DMFT and MFA for the same
model parameters and goes down upon $U$ increase.
