The performance of density functional theory (DFT) approximations for predicting materials thermodynamics
is typically assessed by comparing calculated and experimentally determined enthalpies of formation
from elemental phases, {\Delta}Hf. However, a compound competes thermodynamically with both
other compounds and their constituent elemental forms, and thus, the enthalpies of the decomposition
reactions to these competing phases, {\Delta}Hd, determines thermodynamic stability. We evaluated
the phase diagrams for 56,791 compounds to classify decomposition reactions into three types:
1. those that produce elemental phases, 2. those that produce compounds, and 3. those that produce
both. This analysis shows that the decomposition into elemental forms is rarely the competing reaction
that determines compound stability and that approximately two-thirds of decomposition reactions
involve no elemental phases. Using experimentally reported formation enthalpies for 1,012 solid
compounds, we assess the accuracy of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (PBE) and meta-GGA
(SCAN) density functionals for predicting compound stability. For 646 decomposition reactions
that are not trivially the formation reaction, PBE (MAD = 70 meV/atom) and SCAN (MAD = 59 meV/atom)
perform similarly, and commonly employed correction schemes using fitted elemental reference
energies make only a negligible improvement (~2 meV/atom). Furthermore, for 231 reactions involving
only compounds (Type 2), the agreement between SCAN, PBE, and experiment is within ~35 meV/atom
and is thus comparable to the magnitude of experimental uncertainty.
