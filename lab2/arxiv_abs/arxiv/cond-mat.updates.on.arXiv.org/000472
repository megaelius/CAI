Self-healing of polymer films often takes place as the molecules diffuse across a damaged region,
above their melting temperature. Using molecular dynamics simulations we probe the healing of
polymer films and compare the results with those for thermal welding of homopolymer slabs. The two
processes differ in their interfacial structure since damage leads to increased polydispersity
and more short chains. A polymer sample was cut into two separate films that were then held together
in the melt state. The recovery of the damaged film was followed as time elapsed and polymer molecules
diffused across the interface. The mass uptake and formation of entanglements, as obtained from
primitive path analysis, are extracted and correlated with the interfacial strength obtained
from shear simulations. We find that the interdiffusion is significantly faster in the damaged
film compared to welding because of the presence of short chains. Though interfacial entanglements
increase more rapidly for the damaged films, a large fraction of them are near chain ends. As a result,
the interfacial strength of the healing film increases more slowly than for welding. For both healing
and welding, the interfacial strength saturates as the bulk entanglement density is recovered
across the interface. However, the saturation strength of the damaged film is below the bulk strength
for the polymer sample. At saturation, cut chains remain near the healing interface. They are less
entangled and thus mechanically weaken the interface. When the interfacial strength saturates,
the number of interfacial entanglements scales with the corresponding bulk entanglement density.
Chain stiffness increases the density of entanglements, which increases the interfacial strength.
Our results show that a few entanglements across the interface are sufficient to resist interfacial
chain pullout and enhance the mechanical strength.
