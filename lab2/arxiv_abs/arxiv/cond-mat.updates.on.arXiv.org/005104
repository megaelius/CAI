Recently, nanolaminated ternary carbides have attracted immense interest due to the concomitant
presence of both ceramic and metallic properties. Here, we grow nanolaminate Ti3AlC2 thin films
by pulsed laser deposition on c-axis-oriented sapphire substrates and, surprisingly, the films
are found to be highly oriented along the (103) axis normal to the film plane, rather than the (000l)
orientation. Multiple characterization techniques are employed to explore the structural and
chemical quality of these films, the electrical and optical properties, and the device functionalities.
The 80-nm thick Ti3AlC2 film is highly conducting at room temperature (resistivity of 50 micro ohm-cm),
and a very-low-temperature coefficient of resistivity. The ultrathin (2 nm) Ti3AlC2 film has fairly
good optical transparency and high conductivity at room temperature (sheet resistance of 735 ohm).
Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals the metallic characteristics (with finite density of states
at the Fermi level) at room temperature. The metal-semiconductor junction of the p-type Ti3AlC2
film and n-Si show the expected rectification (diode) characteristics, in contrast to the ohmic
contact behavior in the case of Ti3AlC2 on p-Si. A triboelectric-nanogenerator-based touch-sensing
device, comprising of the Ti3AlC2 film, shows a very impressive peak-to-peak open-circuit output
voltage of 80 V. These observations reveal that pulsed laser deposited Ti3AlC2 thin films have excellent
potential for applications in multiple domains, such as bottom electrodes, resistors for high-precision
measurements, Schottky diodes, ohmic contacts, fairly transparent ultrathin conductors, and
next-generation biomechanical touch sensors for energy harvesting.
