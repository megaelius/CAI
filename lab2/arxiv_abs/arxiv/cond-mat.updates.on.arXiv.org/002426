DFT calculations of the magnetic resonance fingerprint of a wide variety of native defect models
and their complexes are carried out using the GIPAW method in order to determine the origin of the
two EPR $S = 1/2$ spectra observed in high-energy particle irradiated $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ single
crystals. The first of these (EPR1) can be observed at room temperature and below and is characterized
by $g_b=2.0313$, $g_c=2.0079$, $g_{a*}=2.0025$ and a quasi isotropic hyperfine interaction
with two equivalent Ga neighbors of 14 G. The second center (EPR2) is observed after photoexcitation
at low temperature and is characterized by $g_b=2.0064$, $g_c=2.0464$, $g_{a*}=2.0024$ and a
quasi isotropic hyperfine interaction with two equivalent Ga neighbors of 10 G. A spin $S = 1$ spectrum
with a similar g-tensor and a 50\% reduced hyperfine splitting accompanies each of these. Ga-vacancies
and their complexes with Ga-interstitials, the split interstitial oxygen and a self-trapped hole
are considered in the modeling. The $V_\mathrm{Ga1}-\mathrm{Ga}_{ib}-V_\mathrm{Ga1}$ model
has the best matching $g$-tensor principal component directions with EPR1. Given the Fermi level
not too far below the conduction band minimum it provides lower energy than the simple $V_\mathrm{Ga1}$
model in the EPR active $S=1/2$ and $S=1$ states than $V_\mathrm{Ga2}$ or other complexes. The latter
are less likely to occur in the EPR active state because of their deeper $2-/3-$ transition levels.
A metastable state of $V_\mathrm{Ga2}$ is a promising model to explain the EPR2 spectrum as well
as its accompanying $S=1$ state. An oxygen trapped hole on a split-interstitial O-dumbbell is also
considered as a relevant candidate for EPR2 but less likely to be in the EPR active state and exhibits
hyperfine with 3 Ga. The self-trapped hole, previously suggested, is excluded on the same basis.
