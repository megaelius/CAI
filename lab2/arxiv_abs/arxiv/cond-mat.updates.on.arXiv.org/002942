Electronic structure, electrical transport, dc and ac magnetization properties of the hole substituted
(Sr2+) partially B-site disordered double perovskite Pr2-xSrxCoMnO6 system have been investigated.
Electronic structure was probed by employing X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements.
The study suggested the presence of mixed valence states of the B-site ions (Co2+/Co3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+)
with significant enhancement of the average oxidation states due to hole doping. The mere absence
of electronic states near the Fermi level in the valence band (VB) spectra for both of the pure (x=0.0)
and Sr doped (x=0.5) systems indicated the insulating nature of the samples. Sr substitution is
observed to increase the spectral weight near the Fermi level suggesting for an enhanced conductivity
of the hole doped system. The temperature variation of electrical resistivity measurements revealed
the insulating nature for both the systems, thus supporting the VB spectra results. The dc magnetization
data divulged a Griffiths like phase above the long range ordering temperature. A typical re-entrant
spin glass like phase driven by the inherent anti-site disorder (ASD) has been maidenly recognized
by ac susceptibility study for both the pure and doped systems. Most interestingly, the emergence
of a new cluster glass like phase (immediately below the magnetic ordering temperature and above
the spin-glass transition temperature) solely driven by the Sr substitution has been unravelled
by ac magnetization dynamics study. The isothermal magnetization measurements further probed
the exhibition of the giant exchange bias effect emanated from the existence of multiple magnetic
phases.
