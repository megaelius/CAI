Integrating graphene with plasmonic nanostructures results in multifunctional hybrid systems
with enhanced performance for numerous applications. In this work, we take advantage of the remarkable
mechanical properties of graphene to combine it with scalable 3D plasmonic nanostructured silicon
substrates, which enhance the interaction of graphene with electromagnetic radiation. Large
areas of femtosecond laser-structured arrays of silicon nanopillars, decorated with gold nanoparticles,
are integrated with graphene, which conforms to the substrate nanotopography. We obtain Raman
spectra at 488, 514, 633, and 785 nm excitation wavelengths, spanning the entire visible range.
For all excitation wavelengths, the Raman signal of graphene is enhanced by 2-3 orders of magnitude,
similarly to the highest enhancements measured to date, concerning surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy
(SERS) of graphene on plasmonic substrates. Moreover, in contrast to traditional deposition and
lithographic methods, the fabrication method employed here relies on single-step, maskless,
cost-effective, rapid laser processing of silicon in water, amenable to large-scale fabrication.
Finite-difference time-domain simulations elucidate the advantages of the 3D topography of the
substrate. Conformation of graphene to the Au-decorated silicon nanopillars enables graphene
to sample near fields from an increased number of nanoparticles. Due to synergistic effects with
the nanopillars, different nanoparticles become more active for different wavelengths and locations
on the pillars, providing broadband enhancement. Nanostructured plasmonic silicon is a promising
platform for integration with graphene and other 2D materials, for next-generation applications
of large-area hybrid nanomaterials in the fields of sensing, photonics, optoelectronics, and
medical diagnostics.
