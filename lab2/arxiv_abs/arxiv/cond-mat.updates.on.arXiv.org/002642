For classical systems, expectation value of macroscopic property in equilibrium state can be typically
provided through thermodynamic (so-called canonical) average, where summation is taken over
possible states in phase space (or in crystalline solids, it is typically approximated on cofiguration
space). Although we have a number of theoretical approaches enabling to quantitatively estimate
equilibrium properties by applying given potential energy surface (PES) to the thermodynamic
average, it is generally unclear whether PES can be stablly, inversely determined from a given set
of properties. This essentially comes from the fact that bidirectional stability characters of
thermodynamic average for classical system is not sufficiently understood so far. Our recent study
reveals that for classical discrete system, this property for a set of microscopic states satisfying
special condition can be well-characterized by a newly-introduced concept of anharmonicity in
the structural degree of freedom of D, where these states are expected to be stably inversed to underlying
PES, known without any thermodynamic information. However, it is still quantitatively unclear
how the bidirectional stability character is broken inside the configuration space. Here we show
that the breaking in bidirectional stability for thermodynamic average is quantitatively formulated:
We find that the breaking is mainly dominated by the sum of divergence and Jacobian of vector field
D in configuration space, which can be fully known a priori only from geometric information of underlying
lattice, without using any thermodynamic information such as energy or temperature.
