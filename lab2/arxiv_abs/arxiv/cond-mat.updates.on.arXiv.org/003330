In different materials, orientationally controlled assembling of building blocks results in
the development of different anisotropic particles. These trends are pronounced in atoms of metallic
nature in their certain transition state. Their monolayer assembly is vital as it forms the tiny
particles. When triangle-shaped packets of nano-energy were supplied by a source of certain arrangement
to that formed compact monolayer assembly, atoms bound into their shapes. Joined triangle-shaped
tiny particles developed when tuned bipolar pulses were examined. For each case, they separated
into two tiny particles while a bit non-uniformed forcing exertion to electrons of atoms makes the
contact point. On electronically flat solution surface, atoms of tiny particles having re-crystallization
state elongate equally. Electrons of left side and right side at the center of their atoms experience
uniform exertion of surface force exerting along their opposite poles. Thus, atoms of arrays convert
into structures of smooth elements. Such structures of smooth elements flatten further by the travelling
photons of different forcing energies. Originally, binding of solid atoms is considered under
the execution of confined inter-state electron dynamics in grounded format. Nevertheless, tiny
particles developed in such structures of smooth elements and packed for their assembling together
at common point. They deal with the forced exertion which remains in the immersing format at electronically
controlled decreasing solution surface. In lateral-wise adherence of shaped mono layers, a gravitational
force exerting to electrons of uniformly elongated atoms competes with levitational force. Structures
of smooth elements remain adhered in their mono layers and develop a particle of geometrical shape,
which is not the case while developing a distorted particle.
