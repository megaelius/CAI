A 3d electron topological insulator (ETI) is a phase of matter protected by particle-number conservation
and time-reversal symmetry. It was previously believed that the surface of an ETI must be gapless
unless one of these symmetries is broken. A well-known symmetry-preserving, gapless surface termination
of an ETI supports an odd number of Dirac cones. In this paper we deduce a symmetry-respecting, gapped
surface termination of an ETI, which carries an intrinsic 2d topological order, Moore-Read x anti-semion.
The Moore-Read sector supports non-Abelian charge 1/4 anyons, while the Abelian, anti-semion
sector is electrically neutral. Time-reversal symmetry is implemented in this surface phase in
a highly non-trivial way. Moreover, it is impossible to realize this phase strictly in 2d, simultaneously
preserving its implementation of both the particle number and time-reversal symmetries. A 1d edge
on the ETI surface between the topologically-ordered phase and the topologically trivial time-reversal-broken
phase with a Hall conductivity sigma_H = 1/2, carries a right-moving neutral Majorana mode, a right-moving
bosonic charge mode and a left-moving bosonic neutral mode. The topologically-ordered phase is
separated from the surface superconductor by a direct second order phase transition in the XY* universality
class, which is driven by the condensation of a charge 1/2 boson, when approached from the topologically-ordered
side, and proliferation of a flux 4\pi-vortex, when approached from the superconducting side.
In addition, we prove that time-reversal invariant (interacting) electron insulators with no
intrinsic topological order and electromagnetic response characterized by a \theta-angle, \theta
= \pi, do not exist if the electrons transform as Kramers singlets under time-reversal.
