In the stochastic mean-field (SMF) approach, an ensemble of initial values for a selected set of
one-body observables is formed by stochastic sampling from a phase-space distribution that reproduces
the initial quantum fluctuations. Independent mean-field evolutions are performed with each
set of initial values followed by averaging over the resulting ensemble. This approach has been
recently shown to be rather versatile and accurate in describing the correlated dynamics beyond
the independent particle picture. In the original formulation of SMF, it was proposed to use a Gaussian
assumption for the phase-space distribution. This assumption turns out to be rather effective
when the dynamics of an initially uncorrelated state is considered, which was the case in all applications
of this approach up to now. Using the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, we show that such an assumption
might not be adequate if the quantum system under interest is initially correlated and presents
configuration mixing between several Slater determinants. In this case, a more realistic description
of the initial phase-space is necessary. We show that the SMF approach can be advantageously combined
with standard methods to describe phase-space in quantum mechanics. As an illustration, the Husimi
distribution function is used here to obtain a realistic representation of the phase-space of a
quantum many-body system. This method greatly improves the description of initially correlated
fermionic many-body states. In the LMG model, while the Gaussian approximation failed to describe
these systems in all interaction strength range, the novel approach gives a perfect agreement with
the exact evolution in the weak coupling regime and significantly improves the description of correlated
systems in the strong coupling regime.
