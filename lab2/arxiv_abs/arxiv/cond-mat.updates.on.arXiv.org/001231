First-principles phonon calculations along with Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is
an essential tool to study the lattice dynamics, thermodynamical properties and phase-transitions
of materials. The two full-Heusler compounds Fe$_{2}$VAl and Fe$_{2}$TiSn are studied for lattice
vibration dependent properties using finite displacement method and supercell approach. For
the investigation, four density functionals viz., LDA, PBE, PBEsol and meta-GGA SCAN are employed.
Using these functionals, phonon dispersion, vibrational density of states (DOS), thermal propertis
and zero-point energy are calculated at equilibrum lattice parameters under harmonic approximation.
For the two compounds the Debye temperatures are calculated from the obtained phonon DOS which are
$\sim$660 K and $\sim$540 K, respectively. The obtained results from different functionals are
compared among each other. The overall phonon energy in the dispersion is found to be $\sim$15 meV
higher in Fe$_{2}$VAl than the Fe$_{2}$TiSn compounds. For the two compounds PBE is yielding the
lowest phonon frequencies while LDA or SCAN functional is giving the highest. The same pattern is
observed in phonon DOS plots of two compounds. The zero-point energy calculated is the highest from
SCAN (84.16 and 67.80 J) and the lowest from PBE functionals (80.38 and 64.09 J) obeying the same trend
as frequency for both compounds. A general prediction of lattice thermal conductivity is made based
on the velocities of acoustic phonons which is in agreement with the reported experimental thermal
conductivity of two compounds. Phonon spectra obtained from PBE and SCAN have similar general features
while those from LDA and PBEsol have resembling features for Fe$_{2}$VAl, while this trend is not
observed for the compound Fe$_{2}$TiSn.
