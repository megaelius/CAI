We present a systematic analysis of diffusion-controlled evolution and collapse of two identical
spatially separated $d$-dimensional $A$-particle islands in the $B$-particle sea at propagation
of the sharp reaction front $A+B\to 0$ at equal species diffusivities. We show that at a sufficiently
large initial distance between the centers of islands $2\ell$ compared to their characteristic
initial size and a relatively large initial ratio of concentrations island/sea the evolution dynamics
of the island-sea-island system is determined unambiguously by the dimensionless parameter $\Lambda={\cal
N}_{0}/{\cal N}_{\Omega}$, where ${\cal N}_{0}$ is the initial particle number in the island and
${\cal N}_{\Omega}$ is the initial number of sea particles in the volume ${\Omega}=(2\ell)^{d}$.
It is established that a) there is a $d$-dependent critical value $\Lambda_{\star}$ above which
island coalescence occurs; b) regardless of $d$ the centers of each of the islands move towards each
other along a {\it universal} trajectory merging in a united center at the $d$-dependent critical
value $\Lambda_{s}\geq\Lambda_{\star}$; c) in one-dimensional systems $\Lambda_{\star}=\Lambda_{s}$,
therefore at $\Lambda<\Lambda_{\star}$ each of the islands dies individually, whereas at $\Lambda>\Lambda_{\star}$
coalescence is completed by collapse of a single-centered island in the system center; d) in two-
and three-dimensional systems in the range $\Lambda_{\star}< \Lambda < \Lambda_{s}$ coalescence
is accompanied by subsequent fragmentation of a two-centered island and is completed by individual
collapse of each of the islands. We discuss a detailed picture of coalescence, fragmentation and
collapse of islands focusing on evolution of their shape and on behavior of the relative width of
the reaction front at the final collapse stage and in the vicinity of starting coalescence and fragmentation
points.
