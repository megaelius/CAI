Ultrafast phenomena on a femtosecond timescale are commonly examined by pump-probe experiments.
This implies multiple measurements where the sample under investigation is pumped with a short
light pulse and has to be probed with a second pulse at various time delays to follow its dynamics.
Recently, the principle of streaking extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses in the temporal domain has
enabled recording the dynamics of system within a single pulse. However, separate pump-probe experiments
at different absorption edges lack a unified timing, when comparing the dynamics in complex systems.
Here we report on an experiment using a dedicated optical element and the two-color emission of the
FERMI XUV free-electron laser to follow the charge and spin dynamics in composite materials at two
distinct absorption edges, simultaneously. The sample, consisting of ferromagnetic Fe and Ni
layers, is pumped by an infrared laser and probed by a two-color XUV pulse with photon energies tuned
to the M-shell resonances of these two transition metals. The experiment geometry intrinsically
avoids any timing uncertainty between the two elements and unambiguously reveals an approximately
100 fs delay of the magnetic response with respect to the electronic excitation for both Fe and Ni.
This delay shows that the electronic and spin degrees of freedom are decoupled during the demagnetization
process. We furthermore observe that the electronic dynamics of Ni and Fe show pronounced differences
while the demagnetization dynamics are similar. These observations underline the importance
of simultaneous investigation of the temporal response of both charge and spin in multi-component
materials. In a more general scenario, the experimental approach can be extended to continuous
energy ranges, promising the development of jitter-free transient absorption spectroscopy in
the XUV and soft X-ray regimes.
