Triply-periodic networks (TPNs), like the well-known gyroid and diamond network phases, abound
in soft matter assemblies, from block copolymers (BCPs), lyotropic liquid crystals and surfactants
to functional architectures in biology. While TPNs are, in reality, volume-filling patterns of
spatially-varying molecular composition, physical and structural models most often reduce their
structure to lower-dimensional geometric objects: the {\it 2D interfaces} between chemical domains;
and the {\it 1D skeletons} that thread through inter-connected, tubular domains. These lower-dimensional
structures provide a useful basis of comparison to idealized geometries based on triply-periodic
minimal, or constant-mean curvature surfaces, and shed important light on the spatially heterogeneous
packing of molecular constituents that form the networks. Here, we propose a simple, efficient
and flexible method to extract a 1D skeleton from 3D volume composition data of self-assembled networks.
We apply this method to both self-consistent field theory predictions as well as experimental electron
microtomography reconstructions of the double-gyroid phase of an ABA triblock copolymer. We further
demonstrate how the analysis of 1D skeleton, 2D inter-domain surfaces, and combinations therefore,
provide physical and structural insight into TPNs, across multiple length scales. Specifically,
we propose and compare simple measures of {\it network chirality} as well as {\it domain thickness},
and analyze their spatial and statistical distributions in both ideal (theoretical) and non-ideal
(experimental) double gyroid assemblies.
