The critical properties of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the three-dimensional stacked-triangular
lattice are studied by means of a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation in order to get insight into
the controversial issue of the criticality of the noncollinear magnets with the $O(3)\times O(2)$
symmetry. The maximum size studied is $384^3$, considerably larger than the sizes studied by the
previous numerical works on the model. Availability of such large-size data enables us to examine
the detailed critical properties including the effect of corrections to the leading scaling. Strong
numerical evidence of the continuous nature of the transition is obtained. Our data indicates the
existence of significant corrections to the leading scaling. Careful analysis by taking account
of the possible corrections yield critical exponents estimates, $\alpha=0.44(3)$, $\beta=0.26(2)$,
$\gamma=1.03(5)$, $\nu=0.52(1)$, $\eta=0.02(5)$, and the chirality exponents $\beta_\kappa=0.40(3)$
and $\gamma_\kappa=0.77(6)$, supporting the existence of the $O(3)$ chiral (or $O(3)\times O(2)$)
universality class governed by a new `chiral' fixed point. We also obtain an indication that the
underlying fixed point is of the focus-type, characterized by the complex-valued correction-to-scaling
exponent, $\omega=0.1^{+0.4}_{-0.05} + i\ 0.7^{+0.1}_{-0.4}$. The focus-like nature of the
chiral fixed point accompanied by the spiral-like renormalization-group (RG) flow is likely to
be the origin of the apparently complicated critical behavior. The results are compared and discussed
in conjunction with the results of other numerical simulations, several distinct types of RG calculations
including the higher-order perturbative massive and massless RG calculations and the nonperturbative
functional RG calculation, and the conformal-bootstrap program.
