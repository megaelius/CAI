We study a one-dimensional (1d) system that shows many analogies to proposed two-dimensional (2d)
deconfined quantum critical points (DQCP). Our system is a translationally invariant spin-1/2
chain with on-site $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry and time reversal symmetry. It undergoes a direct continuous
transition from a ferromagnet (FM), where one of the $Z_2$ symmetries and the time reversal are broken,
to a valence bond solid (VBS), where all on-site symmetries are restored while the translation symmetry
is broken. The other $Z_2$ symmetry remains unbroken throughout, but its presence is crucial for
both the direct transition (via specific Berry phase effect on topological defects, also related
to a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-like theorem) and the precise characterization of the VBS phase (which
has crystalline-SPT-like property). The transition has a description in terms of either two domain
wall species that "fractionalize" the VBS order parameter or in terms of partons that "fractionalize"
the FM order parameter, with each picture having its own $Z_2$ gauge structure. The two descriptions
are dual to each other and, at long wavelengths, take the form of a self-dual \emph{gauged} Ashkin-Teller
model, reminiscent of the self-dual easy-plane non-compact CP$^1$ model that arises in the description
of the 2d easy-plane DQCP. We also find an exact reformulation of the transition that leads to a simple
field theory description that explicitly unifies the FM and VBS order parameters; this reformulation
can be interpreted as a new parton approach that does not attempt to fractionalize either of the two
order parameters but instead encodes them in instantons. Besides providing explicit realizations
of many ideas proposed in the context of the 2d DQCP, here in the simpler and fully tractable 1d setting
with continuous transition, our study also suggests possible new line of approach to the 2d DQCP.
