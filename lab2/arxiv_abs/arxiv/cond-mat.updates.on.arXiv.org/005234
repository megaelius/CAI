We present experimental evidence for the simultaneous existence of the magnons and spin-state
transition contributions to the heat capacity in ferromagnetic (FM) Cr-doped MnTe (Tc~280K),
where the magnon heat capacity is attributed to the observed magnon-bipolar carrier-drag thermopower.
The pristine antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnTe shows only a magnon-induced peak in the heat capacity
near the Neel temperature, TN~307K. However, Cr-doped MnTe shows a magnon-contributed heat capacity
peak at ~293K with an additional peak in the deep paramagnetic domain near 780K. Temperature-dependent
magnetic susceptibility reveals that Cr-doping initially creates low-spin (LS) states Mn2+ ions
into MnTe near and below TN due to a higher crystal field induced by Cr ions. Above 400K, LS Mn2+ ions
start converting into high-spin (HS) Mn2+ ions. The LS-to-HS transition of Mn2+ leads to an excess
entropy and hence excess heat capacity contribution in the system. Temperature-dependent X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and magnetic field-dependent susceptibility (M-H) confirmed no presence of
any structural changes and magnetic polaron, respectively. Both XRD and M-H ensure that the peak
of the heat capacity in the paramagnetic domain is originated solely by the spin-state transition.
The heat capacity versus temperature was calculated to explain the contribution of each component,
including the ones due to the phonons, magnons, spin-transition, Schottky anomaly, and lattice
dilation. With the recent advances in spin-caloritronics extending the spin-based effects from
magnetic to paramagnetic materials, the data from the heat capacity can play a crucial role to probe
the presence of different phenomena such as paramagnon-carrier-drag and spin-entropy thermopowers.
