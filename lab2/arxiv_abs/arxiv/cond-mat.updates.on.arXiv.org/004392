Understanding the strengthening and deformation mechanisms in refractory high-entropy alloys
(HEAs), proposed as new high-temperature material, is required for improving their typically
insufficient room-temperature ductility. Here, density-functional theory simulations and
a continuum mechanics analysis were conducted to systematically investigate the competition
between cleavage decohesion and dislocation emission from a crack tip in the body-centered cubic
refractory HEAs HfNbTiZr, MoNbTaVW, MoNbTaW, MoNbTiV, and NbTiVZr. This crack-tip competition
is evaluated for tensile loading and a totality of 15 crack configurations and slip systems. Our
results predict that dislocation plasticity at the crack tip is generally unfavorable -- although
the competition is close for some crack orientations, suggesting intrinsic brittleness and low
crack-tip fracture toughness in these five HEAs at zero temperature. Fluctuations in local alloy
composition, investigated for HfNbTiZr, can locally reduce the resistance to dislocation emission
for a slip system relative to the configuration average of that slip system, but do not change the
dominant crack-tip response. In the case of single-crystal MoNbTaW, where an experimental, room-temperature
fracture-toughness value is available for a crack on a \{100\} plane, theoretical and experimental
results agree favorably. Factors that may limit the agreement are discussed. We survey the effect
of material anisotropy on preferred crack tip orientations, which are found to be alloy specific.
Mixed-mode loadings are found to shift the competition in favor of cleavage or dislocation nucleation,
depending on crack configuration and amplified by the effect of material anisotropy on crack tip
stresses.
