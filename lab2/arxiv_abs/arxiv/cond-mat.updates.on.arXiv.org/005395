The celebrated Kitaev honeycomb model provides an analytically tractable example with an exact
quantum spin liquid ground state. While in real materials, other types of interactions besides
the Kitaev coupling ($K$) are present, such as the Heisenberg ($J$) and symmetric off-diagonal
($\Gamma$) terms, and these interactions can also be generalized to a triangular lattice. Here,
we carry out a comprehensive study of the $J$-$K$-$\Gamma$ model on the triangular lattice covering
the full parameters region, using the combination of the exact diagonalization, classical Monte
Carlo and analytic methods. In the HK limit ($\Gamma=0$), we find five quantum phases which are quite
similar to their classical counterparts. Among them, the stripe-A and dual N\'{e}el phase are robust
against the $\Gamma$ term, in particular the stripe-A extends to the region connecting the $K=-1$
and $K=1$ for $\Gamma<0$. Though the 120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el phase also extends to a finite $\Gamma$,
its region has been largely reduced compared to the previous classical result. Interestingly,
the ferromagnetic (dubbed as FM-A) phase and the stripe-B phase are unstable in response to an infinitesimal
$\Gamma$ interaction. Moreover, we find five new phases for $\Gamma\ne 0$ which are elaborated
by both the quantum and classical numerical methods. Part of the space previously identified as
120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el phase in the classical study is found to give way to the modulated stripe phase.
Depending on the sign of the $\Gamma$, the FM-A phase transits into the FM-B ($\Gamma>0$) and FM-C
($\Gamma<0$) phase with different spin orientations, and the stripe-B phase transits into the
stripe-C ($\Gamma>0$) and stripe-A ($\Gamma<0$). Around the positive $\Gamma$ point, due to the
interplay of the Heisenberg, Kiatev and $\Gamma$ interactions, we find a possible quantum spin
liquid with a continuum in spin excitations.
