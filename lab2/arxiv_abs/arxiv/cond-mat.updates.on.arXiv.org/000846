Apoptosis is essential for numerous processes, such as development, resistance to infections,
and suppression of tumorigenesis. Here, we investigate the influence of the nutrient sensing and
longevity-assuring enzyme SIRT6 on the dynamics of apoptosis triggered by serum starvation. Specifically,
we characterize the progression of apoptosis in wild type and SIRT6 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts
using time-lapse flow cytometry and computational modelling based on rate-equations and cell
distribution analysis. We find that SIRT6 deficient cells resist apoptosis by delaying its initiation.
Interestingly, once apoptosis is initiated, the rate of its progression is higher in SIRT6 null
cells compared to identically cultured wild type cells. However, SIRT6 null cells succumb to apoptosis
more slowly, not only in response to nutrient deprivation but also in response to other stresses.
Our data suggest that SIRT6 plays a role in several distinct steps of apoptosis. Overall, we demonstrate
the utility of our computational model to describe stages of apoptosis progression and the integrity
of the cellular membrane. Such measurements will be useful in a broad range of biological applications.
We describe a computational method to evaluate the progression of apoptosis through different
stages. Using this method, we describe how cells devoid of SIRT6 longevity gene respond to apoptosis
stimuli, specifically, how they respond to starvation. We find that SIRT6 cells resist apoptosis
initiation; however, once initiated, they progress through the apoptosis at a faster rate. These
data are first of the kind and suggest that SIRT6 activities might play different roles at different
stages of apoptosis. The model that we propose can be used to quantitatively evaluate progression
of apoptosis and will be useful in studies of cancer treatments and other areas where apoptosis is
involved.
