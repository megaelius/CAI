We present a theoretical analysis of electronic structure evolution in the group-IV alloy Ge$_{1-x}$Pb$_{x}$
based on density functional theory. For ordered alloy supercells we demonstrate the emergence
of a singlet conduction band (CB) edge state, suggesting the emergence of a direct band gap for Pb
compositions as low as $x \approx 1$%. However, application of hydrostatic pressure reveals Pb-induced
hybridisation, with the CB edge state in a Ge$_{63}$Pb$_{1}$ ($x = 1.56$%) supercell retaining
primarily indirect (Ge L$_{6c}$) character. For an ordered Ge$_{15}$Pb$_{1}$ ($x = 6.25$%) supercell
we find that the CB edge has acquired primarily direct (Ge $\Gamma_{7c}$) character, confirming
the presence of an indirect- to direct-gap transition. The importance of alloy disorder is highlighted
by investigating the impact on the electronic structure of the formation of a nearest-neighbour
Pb-Pb pair. Having established the importance of short-range disorder, we analyse the electronic
structure evolution as a function of $x$ using a series of 128-atom special quasi-random structures
(SQSs). Our calculations reveal a strong reduction (increase) of the band gap (spin-orbit splitting
energy), by $\approx 100$ meV ($\approx 40$ meV) per % Pb replacing Ge. We find an indirect- to direct-gap
transition occurring in a narrow composition range centred about $x \approx 7$%, close to which
composition we calculate that the alloy becomes semimetallic. Further analysis suggests that
long-range order introduced by Born von Karman (supercell) boundary conditions leads to overestimated
energy splitting of the Ge L$_{6c}$-derived CB states in the 128-atom SQSs. Accounting for these
finite-size effects, we expect a direct band gap to emerge in Ge$_{1-x}$Pb$_{x}$ for $x \gtrsim
3 - 4$%.
