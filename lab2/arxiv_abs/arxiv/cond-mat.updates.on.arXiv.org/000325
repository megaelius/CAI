The recent discovery of iron ferropnictide superconductors has received intensive concerns on
magnetic involved superconductors. Prominent features of ferropnictide superconductors are
becoming apparent: the parent compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered spin density
wave (SDW) state; the magnetic phase transition is always accompanied to a crystal structural transition;
superconductivity can be induced by suppressing the SDW phase via either chemical doping or applied
external pressure to the parent state. These features generated considerable interests on the
interplay between magnetism and structure in chemical doped samples, showing crystal structure
transitions always precedes to or coincide with magnetic transition. Pressure tuned transition
on the other hand would be more straightforward to superconducting mechanism studies since there
are no disorder effects caused by chemical doping; however, remarkably little is known about the
interplay in the parent compounds under controlled pressure due to the experimental challenge
of in situ measuring both of magnetic & crystal structure evolution at high pressure & low
temperatures. Here we show from combined synchrotron Mossbauer and x-ray diffraction at high pressures
that the magnetic ordering surprisingly precedes the structural transition at high pressures
in the parent compound BaFe2As2, in sharp contrast to the chemical doping case. The results can be
well understood in terms of the spin fluctuations in the emerging nematic phase before the long range
magnetic order that sheds new light on understanding how parent compound evolves from a SDW state
to a superconducting phase, a key scientific inquiry of iron based superconductors.
