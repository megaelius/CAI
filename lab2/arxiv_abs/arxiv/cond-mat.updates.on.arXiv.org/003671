Being the polymorphs of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), vaterite and calcite have attracted a great
deal of attention as promising biomaterials for drug delivery and tissue engineering. Furthermore,
they are important biogenic minerals, enabling living organisms to reach specific functions.
In nature, vaterite and calcite monocrystals typically form self-assembled polycrystal micro-
and nano-particles, also referred to as spherulites. Here, we demonstrate that alpine plants belonging
to the Saxifraga genus can use Kerker effect to improve light collection efficiency via producing
CaCO3 polycrystal nanoparticles on the margins of their leaves. To provide clear physical background
behind our concept, we study light scattering from artificially synthesized vaterite nanospherulites
and reveal the phenomenon of directional light scattering. Dark-field spectroscopy measurements
are supported by a comprehensive numerical analysis, accounting for the complex microstructure
of particles. We demonstrate the generalized Kerker condition, where several higher order multipoles
interfere constructively in the forward direction. As a result, highly directive forward light
scattering from vaterite nanospherulites is observed in the entire visible range. Also, we present
ex vivo study of microstructure and optical properties of leaves for the alpine plants Saxifraga
"Southside Seedling" and Saxifraga Paniculata Ria and show performance of Kerker effect for these
living organisms. Our results pave the way for a bioinspired strategy of efficient light collection
by self-assembled polycrystal CaCO3 nanoparticles via engineering of light propagation directly
to the photosynthetic tissue with minimized losses on backward scattering due to the generalized
Kerker effect.
