We define a characteristic energy density based on the measurement of the two first moments of the
extrinsic injected power smoothed over time. Using the stationarity, we show that this definition
characterizes an energy per degrees freedom of the intrinsic dissipation. Our framework can be
applied to systems in contact with thermostats put out of equilibrium by an external driving but
it holds also for intrinsically dissipative macroscopic systems that go at rest when the forcing
is stopped. Moreover, we are not concerned about the fluctuations around zero of the smoothed injected
power that can be extremely rare and difficult to catch experimentally. Then we show that the characteristic
energy density we defined, reduces to the kinetic energy of a Brownian-like particle described
by a set of Langevin equations with a viscous damping term. The particle can be either in contact with
a thermostat or intrinsically dissipative and driven by a random force. In the first case, we recover
the result obtained in the framework of the fluctuation relation but extended to a correlated thermal
noise. Our characteristic energy density is measured in an experimental system of nonlinear waves
generated by a large shaker in a thin elastic plate. A smaller shaker attached to the moving plate
is used as a probe to measure the energy exchanged with the plate excited by the large shaker. For both,
the proportionality of our characteristic energy density with the kinetic energy is demonstrated.
It is a consequence of the viscous damping driving the dissipation in this system. Another system
with nonlinear frictional dissipation is investigated numerically model. In this case, our definition
of energy density deduced from fluctuations of injected power still characterizes the dissipation
but is no more proportional to the kinetic energy because the dissipative process is not a viscous
damping.
