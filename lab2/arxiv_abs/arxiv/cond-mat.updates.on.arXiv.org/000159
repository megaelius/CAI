We theoretically investigate the effects of the excitation frequency on the plateau of high-order
terahertz sideband generation (HSG) in semiconductors driven by intense terahertz (THz) fields.
We find that the plateau of the sideband spectrum strongly depends on the detuning between the NIR
laser field and the band gap. We use the quantum trajectory theory (three-step model) to understand
the HSG. In the three-step model, an electron-hole pair is first excited by a weak laser, then driven
by the strong THz field, and finally recombine to emit a photon with energy gain. When the laser is
tuned below the band gap (negative detuning), the electron-hole generation is a virtual process
that requires quantum tunneling to occur. When the energy gained by the electron-hole pair from
the THz field is less than 3.2 times the ponderomotive energy, the electron and the hole can be driven
to the same position and recombine without quantum tunneling, so the HSG will have large probability
amplitude. This leads to a plateau feature of the HSG spectrum with a high-frequency cutoff at about
3.2 times the ponderomotive energy above the band gap. Such a plateau feature is similar to the case
of high-order harmonics generation in atoms where electrons have to overcome the binding energy
to escape the atomic core. A particularly interesting excitation condition in HSG is that the laser
can be tuned above the band gap (positive detuning), corresponding to the unphysical "negative"
binding energy in atoms for high-order harmonic generation. Now the electron-hole pair is generation
by real excitation, but the recombination process can be real or virtual depending on the energy
gained from the THz field, which determines the plateau feature in HSG.
