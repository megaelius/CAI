The original observation of the Einstein-de Haas effect was a landmark experiment in the early history
of modern physics that illustrates the relationship between magnetism and angular momentum. Today
the effect is still discussed in elementary physics courses to demonstrate that the angular momentum
associated with the aligned electron spins in a ferromagnet can be converted to mechanical angular
momentum by reversing the direction of magnetisation using an external magnetic field. In recent
times, a related problem in magnetism concerns the time-scale over which this angular momentum
transfer can occur. It is known experimentally for several metallic ferromagnets that intense
photoexcitation leads to a drop in the magnetisation on a time scale shorter than 100 fs, a phenomenon
called ultrafast demagnetisation. The microscopic mechanism for this process has been hotly debated,
with one key question still unanswered: where does the angular momentum go on these sub-picosecond
time scales? Here we show using femtosecond time-resolved x-ray diffraction that a large fraction
of the angular momentum lost from the spin system on the laserinduced demagnetisation of ferromagnetic
iron is transferred to the lattice on sub-picosecond timescales, manifesting as a transverse strain
wave that propagates from the surface into the bulk. By fitting a simple model of the x-ray data to
simulations and optical data, we roughly estimate that the angular momentum occurs on a time scale
of 200 fs and corresponds to 80% of the angular momentum lost from the spin system. Our results show
that interaction with the lattice plays an essential role in the process of ultrafast demagnetisation
in this system.
