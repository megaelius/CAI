Non-Newtonian transport properties of an inertial suspension of inelastic rough hard spheres
under simple shear flow are determined from the Boltzmann kinetic equation. The influence of the
interstitial gas on rough hard spheres is modeled via a Fokker--Planck generalized equation for
rotating spheres accounting for the coupling of both the translational and rotational degrees
of freedom of grains with the background viscous gas. The generalized Fokker--Planck term is the
sum of two ordinary Fokker--Planck differential operators in linear $\mathbf{v}$ and angular
$\boldsymbol{\omega}$ velocity space. As usual, each Fokker--Planck operator is constituted
by a drag force term (proportional to $\mathbf{v}$ and/or $\boldsymbol{\omega}$) plus a stochastic
Langevin term defined in terms of the background temperature $T_\text{ex}$. The Boltzmann equation
is solved by two different but complementary approaches: (i) by means of Grad's moment method, and
(ii) by using a Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook (BGK)-type kinetic model adapted to inelastic rough hard
spheres. As occurs in the case of \emph{smooth} inelastic hard spheres, our results show that both
the temperature and the non-Newtonian viscosity increase drastically with increasing the shear
rate (discontinuous shear thickening effect) while the fourth-degree velocity moments also exhibit
an $S$-shape. In particular, while high levels of roughness may slightly attenuate the jump of the
viscosity in comparison to the smooth case, the opposite happens for the rotational temperature.
As an application of these results, a linear stability analysis of the steady simple shear flow solution
is also carried out showing that there are regions of the parameter space where the steady solution
becomes linearly unstable.
