Control of magnetic domain wall motion holds promise for efficient manipulation and transfer of
magnetically stored information. Thermal magnon currents, generated by temperature gradients,
can be used to move magnetic textures, from domain walls, to magnetic vortices and skyrmions. In
the last years, theoretical studies have centered in ferro- and antiferromagnetic spin structures,
where domain walls always move towards the hotter end of the thermal gradient. Here we perform numerical
studies using atomistic spin dynamics simulations and complementary analytical calculations
to derive an equation of motion for the domain wall velocity. We demonstrate that in ferrimagnets,
domain wall motion under thermal magnon currents shows a much richer dynamics. Below the Walker
breakdown, we find that the temperature gradient always pulls the domain wall towards the hot end
by minimizating its free energy, in agreement with the observations for ferro- and antiferromagnets
in the same regime. Above Walker breakdown, the ferrimagnetic domain wall can show the opposite,
counterintuitive behavior of moving towards the cold end. We show that in this case, the motion to
the hotter or the colder ends is driven by angular momentum transfer and therefore strongly related
to the angular momentum compensation temperature, a unique property of ferrimagnets where the
intrinsic angular momentum of the ferrimagnet is zero while the sublattice angular momentum remains
finite. In particular, we find that below the compensation temperature the wall moves towards the
cold end, whereas above it, towards the hot end. Moreover, we find that for ferrimagnets, there is
a torque compensation temperature at which the domain wall dynamics shows similar characteristics
to antiferromagnets, that is, quasi-inertia-free motion and the absence of Walker breakdown.
