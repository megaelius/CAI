The exploration of large-scale many-body phenomena in quantum materials has produced many important
experimental discoveries, including novel states of entanglement, topology and quantum order
as found for example in quantum spin ices, topological insulators and semimetals, complex magnets,
and high-$T_c$ superconductors. Yet, the sheer scale of solid-state systems and the difficulty
of exercising exacting control of their quantum mechanical degrees of freedom limit the pace of
rational progress in advancing the properties of these and other materials. With extraordinary
effort to counteract natural processes of dissipation, precisely engineered ultracold quantum
simulators could point the way to exotic new materials. Here, we look instead to the quantum mechanical
character of the arrested state formed by a quenched ultracold molecular plasma. This novel class
of system arises spontaneously, without a deliberate engineering of interactions, and evolves
naturally from state-specified initial conditions, to a long-lived final state of canonical density,
in a process that conflicts with classical notions of plasma dissipation and neutral dissociation.
We take information from experimental observations to develop a conceptual argument that attempts
to explain this state of arrested relaxation in terms of a minimal phenomenological model of randomly
interacting dipoles of random energies. This model of the plasma forms a starting point to describe
its observed absence of relaxation in terms of many-body localization (MBL). The large number of
accessible Rydberg and excitonic states gives rise to an unconventional web of many-body interactions
that vastly exceeds the complexity of MBL in a conventional few-level scheme. This experimental
platform thus opens an avenue for the coupling of dipoles in disordered environments that will demand
the development of new theoretical tools.
