It is known that the low-energy physics of the Josephson effect in the presence of Majorana zero modes
exhibits a $4\pi$ periodicity as the Aharonov-Bohm flux varies in contrast to the $2\pi$ Josephson
periodicity in usual superconducting junctions. We study this fractional Josephson effect in
1D topological superconductors in Majorana nanowire systems by focusing on the features of the
phase-energy relations in a superconducting semiconductor nanowire with spin-orbital coupling
by including different factors operational in experimental systems, such as short wire length,
suppression of superconducting gap, and the presence of an Andreev bound state. We show that even
in the absence of Majorana zero modes, some non-topological physical effects can manifest a $4\pi$
periodicity of the phase-energy relation in the Josephson junction, thus providing a false positive
signal for fractional Josephson effect with no underlying Majorana zero modes. Furthermore, we
consider several scenarios of inhomogeneous chemical potential distributions in the superconducting
nanowire leading to four Majorana bound states and construct the effective four Majorana model
to correctly describe the low-energy theory of the Josephson effect. In this setup, multiple Majorana
zero modes can also have the $4\pi$ fractional Josephson effect, although the underlying physics
arises from Andreev bound states since two close by Majorana bound states effectively form Andreev
bound states. Our work demonstrates that the mere observation of a fractional Josephson effect
simulating $4\pi$ periodicity cannot, by itself, be taken as the definitive evidence for topological
superconductivity. This finding has important implications for the ongoing search for non-Abelian
Majorana zero modes and efforts for developing topological qubits.
