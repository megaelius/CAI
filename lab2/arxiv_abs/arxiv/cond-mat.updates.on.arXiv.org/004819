Deep neural networks ("deep learning") have emerged as a technology of choice to tackle problems
in natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition and gameplay, and in just
a few years has led to superhuman level performance and ushered in a new wave of "AI." Buoyed by these
successes, researchers in the physical sciences have made steady progress in incorporating deep
learning into their respective domains. However, such adoption brings substantial challenges
that need to be recognized and confronted. Here, we discuss both opportunities and roadblocks to
implementation of deep learning within materials science, focusing on the relationship between
correlative nature of machine learning and causal hypothesis driven nature of physical sciences.
We argue that deep learning and AI are now well positioned to revolutionize fields where causal links
are known, as is the case for applications in theory. When confounding factors are frozen or change
only weakly, this leaves open the pathway for effective deep learning solutions in experimental
domains. Similarly, these methods offer a pathway towards understanding the physics of real-world
systems, either via deriving reduced representations, deducing algorithmic complexity, or recovering
generative physical models. However, extending deep learning and "AI" for models with unclear
causal relationship can produce misleading and potentially incorrect results. Here, we argue
the broad adoption of Bayesian methods incorporating prior knowledge, development of DL solutions
with incorporated physical constraints, and ultimately adoption of causal models, offers a path
forward for fundamental and applied research. Most notably, while these advances can change the
way science is carried out in ways we cannot imagine, machine learning is not going to substitute
science any time soon.
