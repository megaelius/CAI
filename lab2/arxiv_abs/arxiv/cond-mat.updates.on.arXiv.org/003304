In 1978, to explain quark confinement in hadrons, 't Hooft coined the notion of "superinsulator",
a hypothetical ground state endowed with infinite electric resistance and representing thus an
extreme opposite to a superconductor. In condensed matter, the superinsulating ground state was
first predicted for Josephson junction arrays (JJA) and was rediscovered as a phase emerging at
the insulating side of the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in superconducting films
due to the duality of the phase-amplitude uncertainty principle. Superinsulators, dissipationless
Bose condensates of vortices retain an infinite resistance at finite temperatures and, as such,
have been gaining an intense research attention. Here we investigate the response of a superinsulator
to a dc electric field and show that small fields, E<Ec1 are completely suppressed inside the material,
a dual, electric version of the Meissner effect. Intermediate fields, Ec1<E<Ec2, penetrate the
superinsulator as electric filaments, realizing Polyakov's electric strings in compact QED,
a dual, electric version of the mixed state of superconductors, and, finally, large fields, E>Ec2,
break down superinsulation completely. We report transport measurements in NbTiN films revealing
both thresholds and their linear scaling with the system size. We demonstrate that the asymptotically
free behaviour of quarks within mesons maps onto the metal-like behaviour of small films. Our findings
open the route to measurements of Polyakov's string tension as a function of the system's parameters,
enabling the exploration of strong coupling gauge theory concepts via desktop experiments.
