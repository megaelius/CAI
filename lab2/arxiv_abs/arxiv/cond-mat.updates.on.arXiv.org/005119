The bond-dependent Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with anyonic excitations has recently
attracted considerable attention. However, in solid state materials other spin interactions
are present, and among such additional interactions, the off-diagonal symmetric Gamma interaction,
another type of bond-dependent term, has been particularly challenging to fully understand. A
minimal Kitaev-Gamma (KG) model has been investigated by various numerical techniques under a
magnetic field, but definite conclusions about field-induced spin liquids remain elusive and
one reason may lie in the limited sizes of the two-dimensional geometry it is possible to access numerically.
We therefore focus on the KG model defined on a two-leg ladder which is much more amenable to a complete
study, and determine the entire phase diagram in the presence of a magnetic field along [111]-direction.
Due to the competition between the interactions and the field, an extremely rich phase diagram emerges
with fifteen distinct phases. Focusing near the antiferromagnetic Kitaev region, we identify
nine different phases solely within this region: several incommensurate magnetically ordered
phases, spin nematic, and two chiral phases with enhanced entanglement. Of particular interest
is a highly entangled phase with staggered chirality with zero-net flux occurring at intermediate
field, which along with its companion phases outline a heart-shaped region of high entanglement,
the heart of entanglement. We compare our results for the ladder with a C3 symmetric cluster of the
two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, and offer insights into possible spin liquids in the two-dimensional
limit.
