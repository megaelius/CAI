Ultradilute quantum droplets are intriguing new state of matter, in which the attractive mean-field
force can be balanced by the repulsive force from quantum fluctuations to avoid collapse. Here,
we present a microscopic theory of ultradilute quantum droplets in low-dimensional two-component
Bose-Bose mixtures, by generalizing the conventional Bogoliubov theory to include the bosonic
pairing arising from the inter-species attraction. Our pairing theory is fully equivalent to a
variational approach and hence gives an upper bound for the energy of quantum droplets. In one dimension,
we find that the energy calculated by the pairing theory is in an excellent agreement with the latest
diffusion Monte Carlo simulation {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{122}, 105302 (2019){]}, for nearly
all the interaction strengths at which quantum droplets exist. In two dimensions, we show that quantum
droplets disappear and may turn into a soliton-like many-body bound state, when the inter-species
attraction exceeds a critical value. Below the threshold, the pairing theory predicts more or less
the same results as the Bogoliubov theory derived by Petrov and Astrakharchik {[}Phys. Rev. Lett.
\textbf{117}, 100401 (2016){]}. The predicted energies from both theories are higher than the
diffusion Monte Carlo results, due to the weak inter-species attraction and the increasingly important
role played by the beyond-Bogoliubov-approximation effect in two dimensions. Our pairing theory
provides an ideal starting point to understand interesting ground-state properties of quantum
droplets, including their shape and collective oscillations.
