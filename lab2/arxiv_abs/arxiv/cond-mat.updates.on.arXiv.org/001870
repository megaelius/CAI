Two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic perovskites have recently attracted increasing attention
due to their great environmental stability, remarkable quantum confinement effect and layered
characteristic. Heterostructures consisting of 2D layered perovskites are expected to exhibit
new physical phenomena inaccessible to the single 2D perovskites and can greatly extend their functionalities
for novel electronic and optoelectronic applications. Herein, we develop a novel solution method
to synthesize 2D perovskite single-crystals with the centimeter size, high phase purity, controllable
junction depth, high crystalline quality and great stability for highly narrow dual-band photodetectors.
On the basis of the different lattice constant, solubility and growth rate between different n number,
the newly designed synthesis method allows to first grow n=1 perovskite guided by the self-assembled
layer of the organic cations at the water-air interface and subsequently n=2 layer is formed via
diffusion process. Such growth process provides an efficient away for us to readily obtain 2D perovskite
heterostructural single-crystals with various thickness and junction depth by controlling the
concentration, reaction temperature and time. Photodetectors based on such heterostructural
single crystal plates exhibit extremely low dark current, high on-off current ratio, and highly
narrow dual-band spectral response with a full-width at half-maximum of 20 nm at 540 nm and 34 nm at
610 nm. In particular, the synthetic strategy is general for other 2D perovskites and the narrow
dual-band spectral response with all full-width at half-maximum below 40 nm can be continuously
tuned from red to blue by properly changing the halide compositions.
