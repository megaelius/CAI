A microscopic bubble of soluble gas always dissolves in finite time in an under-saturated fluid.
This diffusive process is driven by the difference between the gas concentration near the bubble,
whose value is governed by the internal pressure through Henry's law, and the concentration in the
far field. The presence of neighbouring bubbles can significantly slow down this process by increasing
the effective background concentration and reducing the diffusing flux of dissolved gas experienced
by each bubble. We develop theoretical modelling of such diffusive shielding process in the case
of small microbubbles whose internal pressure is dominated by Laplace pressure. We first use an
exact semi-analytical solution to capture the case of two bubbles, analyse in detail the shielding
effect and show that hydrodynamic effects are mostly negligible except in the case of almost-touching
bubbles. In order to tackle the case of multiple bubbles, we then derive and validate two analytical
approximate yet generic frameworks, first using the method of reflections and then by proposing
a self-consistent continuum description. Using both modelling frameworks, we examine the dissolution
of regular 1D, 2D and 3D bubble lattices. Bubbles located at the edge of the lattices dissolve first,
while innermost bubbles benefit from the diffusive shielding effect, leading to the inward propagation
of a dissolution front within the lattice. We show that diffusive shielding leads to severalfold
increases in the dissolution time which grows logarithmically with the number of bubbles in 1D-lattices
and algebraically in two and three dimensions, scaling respectively as its square root and 2/3-power.
We further illustrate the sensitivity of the dissolution patterns to initial fluctuations in bubble
size or arrangement in the case of large and dense lattices, as well as non-intuitive oscillatory
effects.
