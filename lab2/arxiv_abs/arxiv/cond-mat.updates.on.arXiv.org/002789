Fermionization is what happens to the state of strongly interacting repulsive bosons interacting
with contact interactions in one spatial dimension. Crystallization is what happens for sufficiently
strongly interacting repulsive bosons with dipolar interactions in one spatial dimension. Crystallization
and fermionization resemble each other: in both cases -- due to their repulsion -- the bosons try
to minimize their spatial overlap. We trace these two hallmark phases of strongly correlated one-dimensional
bosonic systems by exploring their ground state properties using the one- and two-body density
matrix. We solve the $N$-body Schr\"odinger equation accurately and from first principles using
the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB) and for fermions (MCTDHF)
methods. Using the one- and two-body density, fermionization can be distinguished from crystallization
in position space. For $N$ interacting bosons, a splitting into an $N$-fold pattern in the one-body
and two-body density is a unique feature of both, fermionization and crystallization. We demonstrate
that the splitting is incomplete for fermionized bosons and restricted by the confinement potential.
This incomplete splitting is a consequence of the convergence of the energy in the limit of infinite
repulsion and is in agreement with complementary results that we obtain for fermions using MCTDHF.
For crystalline bosons, in contrast, the splitting is complete: the interaction energy is capable
of overcoming the confinement potential. Our results suggest that the spreading of the density
as a function of the dipolar interaction strength diverges as a power law. We describe how to distinguish
fermionization from crystallization experimentally from measurements of the one- and two-body
density.
