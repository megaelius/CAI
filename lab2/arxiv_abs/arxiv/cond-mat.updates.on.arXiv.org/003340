The way atoms attach to each other defines the function(s), e.g., mechanical, optical, electronic,
of a given material. The nature of the chemical bond is, therefore, one of the most fundamental issues
in materials. Both ionic interactions, i.e., resulting from electrical charges associated with
the atoms, and covalent ones, i.e., the sharing of electrons between nuclei of different atoms,
are usually viewed as forces that attract between atoms to form a rigid structure. Although less
common for solid materials, it was shown theoretically to be possible for covalent interactions
at the chemically-active electronic shell (or valence-band maximum) of semiconductors to reverse
their more common nature and become repulsive, i.e., act against bonding. Some semiconductors
with such predicted anti-bonding valence-band maximum levels (such as halide perovskites) show
experimentally some amazing (opto-) electronic properties. Predictions that anti-bonding character
can allow tolerance for existing defects, at least in part, can explain the superior properties
of such semiconductors. Although there are known experimental ways to estimate the degree of the
covalent nature (e.g., electronegativity), this was not possible hitherto for the type, i.e.,
distinguishing whether a material exhibits bonding or anti-bonding covalent interactions. We
have developed a simple way to reveal the complete nature (both type and degree) of chemical bonds,
using experimental data. After confirming our development with classical models and theoretical
predictions, with a set of ~40 different functional semi-conductors, we show how knowledge of the
complete nature of covalent bonding is of critical importance for fundamental properties of semiconductors.
