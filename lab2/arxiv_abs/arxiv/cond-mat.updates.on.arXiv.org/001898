The Boltzmann transport equation is one of the most relevant framework to study the heat transport
at the nanoscale, beyond the diffusive regime and up to the micrometer-scale. In the general case
of three-dimensional devices, the particle Monte Carlo approach of phonon transport is particularly
powerful and convenient, and requires reasonable computational resources. In this work, we propose
an original and versatile particle Monte Carlo approach parametrized by using ab-initio data.
Both the phonon dispersion and the phonon-phonon scattering rates have been computed by DFT calculation
in the entire 3D Brillouin zone. To treat the phonon transport at rough interfaces, a combination
of specular and diffuse reflections has been implemented in phase space. Thermal transport has
been investigated in nanowires and thin films made of cubic and hexagonal Silicon, including edge
roughness, in terms of effective thermal conductivity, phonon band contributions and heat flux
orientation. It is shown that the effective thermal conductivity in quasi-ballistic regime obtained
from our Monte Carlo simulation cannot be accurately fitted by simple semi-analytical Matthiessen-like
models and that spectral approaches are mandatory to get good results. Our Full Band approach shows
that some phonon branches exhibiting a negative group velocity in some parts of the Brillouin zone
may contribute negatively to the total thermal flux. Besides, the thermal flux clearly appears
to be oriented along directions of high density of states. The resulting anisotropy of the heat flux
is discussed together with the influence of rough interfaces.
