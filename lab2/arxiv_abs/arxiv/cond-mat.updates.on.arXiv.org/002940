In the present Colloquium, we focus on the properties of 1-D magnetic systems on solid surfaces.
From the emulation of 1-D quantum phases to the potential realization of Majorana edge states, spin
chains are unique systems to study. The advent of scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) based techniques
has permitted us to engineer spin chains in an atom-by-atom fashion via atom manipulation and to
access their spin states on the ultimate atomic scale. Here, we present the current state of research
on spin correlations and dynamics of atomic spin chains as studied by the STM. After a brief review
of the main properties of spin chains on solid surfaces, we classify spin chains according to the
coupling of their magnetic moments with the holding substrate. This classification scheme takes
into account that the nature and lifetimes of the spin-chain excitation intrinsically depend on
the holding substrate. We first show the interest of using insulating layers on metals, which generally
results in an increase in the spin state's lifetimes such that their quantized nature gets evident
and they are individually accessible. Next, we show that the use of semiconductor substrates promises
additional control through the tunable electron density via doping. When the coupling to the substrate
is increased for spin chains on metals, the substrate conduction electron mediated interactions
can lead to emergent exotic phases of the coupled spin chain-substrate conduction electron system.
A particularly interesting example is furnished by superconductors. Magnetic impurities induce
states in the superconducting gap. Due to the extended nature of the spin chain, the in-gap states
develop into bands that can lead to the emergence of 1-D topological superconductivity and, consequently
to the appearance of Majorana edge states.
