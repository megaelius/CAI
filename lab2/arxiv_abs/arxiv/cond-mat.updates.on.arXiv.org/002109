The recent discoveries of proximate quantum spin-liquid compounds and their potential application
in quantum computing informs the search for new candidate materials for quantum spin-ice and spin-liquid
physics. While the majority of such work has centered on members of the pyrochlore family due to their
inherently frustrated linked tetrahedral structure, the rare-earth pyrogermanates also show
promise for possible frustrated magnetic behavior. With the familiar stoichiometry $RE_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$,
these compounds generally have tetragonal symmetry with a rare-earth sublattice built of a spiral
of alternating edge and corner sharing rare-earth site triangles. Studies on Dy$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$
and Ho$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$ have shown tunable low temperature antiferromagnetic order, a high frustration
index and spin-ice like dynamics. Here we use neutron diffraction to study magnetic order in Er$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$
(space group $P4_{1}2_{1}2$ ) and find the lowest yet Ne\'el temperature in the pyrogermanates
of 1.15 K. Using neutron powder diffraction we find the magnetic structure to order with $k = (0,0,0)$
ordering vector, magnetic space group symmetry $P4_{1}^{'}2_{1}2^{'}$ and a refined Er moment
of $m = 8.1 \mu_B$ - near the expected value for the Er$^{3+}$ free ion. Provocatively, the magnetic
structure exhibits similar 'local-Ising' behavior to that seen in the pyrocholres where the Er
moment points up or down along the short Er-Er bond. Upon applying a magnetic field we find a first
order metamagnetic transition at $\sim$ 0.35 T to a lower symmetry $P2_{1}^{'}2_{1}^{'}2$ structure.
This magnetic transition involves an inversion of Er moments aligned antiparallel to the applied
field describing a class I spin-flip type transition, indicating a strong local anisotropy at the
Er site - reminiscent of that seen in the spin-ice pyrochlores.
