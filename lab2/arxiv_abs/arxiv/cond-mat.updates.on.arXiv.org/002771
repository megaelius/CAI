There is an ongoing debate about the relative importance of structural change versus doping charge
carriers on the mechanism of superconductivity in Fe-based materials. Elucidating this issue
is a major challenge since it would require a large number of samples where structure properties
or the carrier density is systematically varied. FeSe, with its structural simplicity, is an ideal
platform for addressing this question. It has been demonstrated that the superconductivity in
this material can be controlled through crystal lattice tuning, as well as electronic structure
manipulation. Here, we apply a high-throughput methodology to FeSe to systematically delineate
the interdependence of its structural and electronic properties. Using a dual-beam pulsed laser
deposition, we have generated FeSe films with a marked gradient in the superconducting transition
temperature (below 2 K < Tc < 12 K) across 1 cm width of the films. The Tc gradient films display ~ 1% continuous
stretch and compression in the out-of-plane and in-plane lattice constants respectively, triggering
the continuous enhancement of superconductivity. Combining transport and angular-resolved
photoemission measurements on uniform FeSe films with tunable Tc from 3 K to 14 K, we find that the
electron carrier density is intimately correlated with Tc, i.e., it increases by a factor of 6 and
ultimately surpasses the almost constant hole concentration. Our transmission electron microscope
and band structure calculations reveal that rather than by shifting the chemical potential, the
enhanced superconductivity is linked to the selective adjustment of the dxy band dispersion across
the Fermi level by means of reduced local lattice distortions. Therefore, such novel mechanism
provides a key to understand discrete superconducting phases in FeSe.
