The flow of colloidal suspensions is ubiquitous in nature and industry. Colloidal suspensions
exhibit a wide range of rheological behavior, which should be closely related to the microscopic
structure of the systems. With in-situ small-angle neutron scattering complemented by rheological
measurements, we investigated the deformation behavior of a charge-stabilized colloidal glass
at particle level undergoing steady shear. A short-lived, localized elastic response at particle
level, termed as transient elasticity zone (TEZ), was identified from the neutron spectra. The
existence of the TEZ is a signature of the dynamical heterogeneity: The body of fluids under shear
behaves like an elastic solid within the spatial range of TEZ but like fluid outside the TEZ. The size
of TEZ shrinks as the shear rate increases in the shear thinning region, which shows that the shear
thinning is accompanied by a diminishing dynamical heterogeneity. More interestingly, the TEZ
is found to be the structural unit that provides the resistance to the imposed shear, as evidenced
by the quantitative agreement between the local elastic stress sustained by TEZ and the macroscopic
stress from rheological measurements at low and moderate shear rates. Besides the charged-stabilized
colloidal suspension, a hard-sphere colloidal suspension at the same volume fraction and shear
rates was also measured. The result highlights the key role of the electrostatic interparticle
repulsion in promoting the local elasticity. Our findings provide an understanding on the nonlinear
rheology of interacting colloidal glasses from a micro-mechanical view.
