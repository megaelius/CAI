Metallic colloids are frequently used in industry and provide understanding of science at micron
to nanometric size along with their usage in various technologically important applications.
Present investigations deal morphology-structure of gold, silver and their binary composition
while processing their solutions in a newly designed process and tap opportunities of tiny shaped
particle. At tuned bipolar pulse OFF to ON time and when chloroauric acid solution was processed,
in different regions of surface format force many tiny particles are developed in triangle shape.
Such tiny particles deal force at the tips of developed structure of smooth elements pointing toward
the centre under dominating force to pack into various geometric anisotropic shaped particles.
Under identical parameters along with pulse time, processing solutions of silver nitrate and binary
composition of chloroauric acid plus silver nitrate result into tiny particles of no specific shape
where they deal mixed behavior of force for their packing, which results into develop their distorted
particles. Elongation or deformation of atoms of unary and binary composition structure is due
to plastically-driven behavior of electrons as per stretching of energy knots clamping their states.
In three-dimension structure of surface format where metallic atoms at certain level behave neutral,
they do not elongate along the opposite poles as zero force axis does not work to stretch energy knots
clamping electron states in that axis. Different morphology-structure of particles along with
nature of precursor is discussed in this paper opening abundant avenues.
