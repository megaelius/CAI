Concentrated solutions of monoclonal antibodies have attracted considerable attention due to
their importance in pharmaceutical formulations, yet their tendency to aggregate and the resulting
high solution viscosity has posed considerable problems. It remains a very difficult task to understand
and predict the phase behavior and stability of such solutions. Here we present a systematic study
of the concentration dependence of the structural and dynamic properties of monoclonal antibodies
using a combination of different scattering methods and microrheological experiments. To interpret
these data, we use a colloid-inspired approach based on a simple patchy model, which explicitly
takes into account the anisotropic shape and the charge distribution of the molecules. Combining
theory, simulations and experiments, we are able to disentangle self-assembly and intermolecular
interactions and to quantitatively describe the concentration dependence of structural and dynamic
quantities such as the osmotic compressibility, the collective diffusion coefficient and the
zero shear viscosity over the entire range of investigated concentrations. This simple patchy
model not only allows us to consistently describe the thermodynamic and dynamic behavior of mAb
solutions, but also provides a robust estimate of the attraction between their binding sites. It
will thus be an ideal starting point for future work on antibody formulations, as it provides a quantitative
assessment of the effects of additional excipients or chemical modifications on antibody interactions,
and a prediction of their effect on solution viscosity.
