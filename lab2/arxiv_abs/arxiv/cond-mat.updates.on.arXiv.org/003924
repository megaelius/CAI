We analyze the cross-plane miniband transport in n-doped [001] silicon (Si)/germanium (Ge) superlattices
using an effective mass approximation (EMA) approach that correctly accounts for the indirect
nature of the Si and Ge band gaps. Direct-gap based EMA has been employed so far to investigate the
electronic properties of these superlattices, that does not accurately predict transport properties.
We use the Boltzmann transport equation framework in combination with the EMA band analysis, and
predict that significant improvement of the thermopower of n-doped Si/Ge superlattices can be
achieved by controlling the lattice strain environment in these heterostructured materials.
We illustrate that a remarkable degree of tunability in the Seebeck coefficient can be attained
by growing the superlattices on various substrates, and varying the periods, and the compositions.
Our calculations show up to ~3.2-fold Seebeck enhancement in Si/Ge [001] superlattices over bulk
silicon, in the high-doping regime, breaking the Pisarenko relation. The thermopower modulations
lead to an increase of power factor by up to 20%. Our approach is generically applicable to other superlattice
systems, e.g., to investigate dimensional effects on electronic transport in two-dimensional
nanowire and three dimensional nanodot superlattices. A material with high S potentially improves
the energy conversion efficiency of thermoelectric applications and additionally, is highly
valuable in various Seebeck metrology techniques including thermal, flow, radiation, and chemical
sensing applications. We anticipate that the ideas presented here will have a strong impact in controlling
electronic transport in various thermoelectric, opto-electronic, and quantum-enhanced materials
applications.
