Metal intercalation into layered topological insulator materials such as the binary chalcogenide
Bi2X3 (X=Te or Se) has yielded novel two-dimensional electron-gas physics, phase transitions
to superconductivity, as well as interesting magnetic ground states. Of recent interest is the
intercalation-driven interplay between lattice distortions, density wave ordering, and the
emergence of new phenomena in the vicinity of instabilities induced by intercalation. Here, we
examine the effects of Cu-intercalation on the ternary chalcogenide Bi2Te2Se. We report the discovery,
in Cu0.3Bi2Te2Se, of a periodic lattice distortion at room temperature, together with a charge
density wave transition around Td = 220K. We also report, for the first time, a complete study of the
CuxBi2Te2Se system, and the effect of Cu-intercalation on crystal structure, phonon structure,
and electronic properties for 0.0 $\le$ x $\le$ 0.5. Our electron diffraction studies reveal strong
Bragg spots at reciprocal lattice positions forbidden by ABC stacking, possibly resulting from
stacking faults, or a superlattice. The c-axis lattice parameter varies monotonically with x for
0 $\lt$ x $\lt$ 0.2, but drops precipitously for higher x. Similarly, Raman phonon modes $A^2_{1g}$
and $E_g$ soften monotonically for 0 $\lt$ x $\lt$ 0.2 but harden sharply for x $\gt$ 0.2. This indicates
that Cu likely intercalates up to x $\sim$0.2, followed by partial site-substitutions at higher
values. The resulting strain makes the 0.2 $\lt$ x $\lt$ 0.3 region susceptible to instabilities
and distortions. Our results point toward the presence of an incommensurate CDW above Td = 220 K.
This work strengthens prevalent thought that intercalation contributes significantly to instabilities
in the lattice and charge degrees of freedom in layered chalcogenides.
