Magic-sized clusters (MSCs) are renowned for their identical size and closed-shell stability
that inhibit conventional nanoparticle (NP) growth processes. Though MSCs have been of increasing
interest, understanding the reaction pathways toward their nucleation and stabilization is an
outstanding issue. In this work, we demonstrate that high concentration synthesis (1000 mM) promotes
a well-defined reaction pathway to form high-purity MSCs (greater than 99.9 percent). The MSCs
are resistant to typical growth and dissolution processes. Based on insights from in-situ X-ray
scattering analysis, we attribute this stability to the accompanying production of a large, hexagonal
organic-inorganic mesophase (greater than 100 nm grain size) that arrests growth of the MSCs and
prevents NP growth. At intermediate concentrations (500 mM), the MSC mesophase forms, but is unstable,
resulting in NP growth at the expense of the assemblies. These results provide an alternate explanation
for the high stability of MSCs. Whereas the conventional mantra has been that the stability of MSCs
derives from the precise arrangement of the inorganic structures (i.e., closed-shell atomic packing),
we demonstrate that anisotropic clusters can also be stabilized by self-forming fibrous mesophase
assemblies. At lower concentration (less than 200 mM or greater than 16 acid-to-metal), MSCs are
further destabilized and NPs formation dominates that of MSCs. Overall, the high concentration
approach intensifies and showcases inherent concentration-dependent surfactant phase behavior
that is not accessible in conventional (i.e., dilute) conditions. This work provides not only a
robust method to synthesize, stabilize, and study identical MSC products, but also uncovers an
underappreciated stabilizing interaction between surfactants and clusters.
