Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) technique has been used to study the magnetization relaxation processes
and magnetic anisotropy in two different series of the Co2FeSi (CFS) Heusler alloy thin films, deposited
on the Si(111) substrate by UHV sputtering. While the CFS films of fixed (50 nm) thickness, deposited
at different substrate temperatures (TS) ranging from room temperature (RT) to 600^C, constitute
the series-I, the CFS films with thickness t varying from 12 nm to 100 nm and deposited at 550^C make
up the series-II. In series-I, the CFS films deposited at TS = RT and 200^C are completely amorphous,
the one at TS = 300^C is partially crystalline, and those at TS equal 450^C, 550^C and 600^C are completely
crystalline with B2 order. By contrast, all the CFS films in series-II are in the fully-developed
B2 crystalline state. Irrespective of the strength of disorder and film thickness, angular variation
of the resonance field in the film plane unambiguously establishes the presence of global in-plane
uniaxial anisotropy. Angular variation of the linewidth in the film plane reveals that, in the CFS
thin films of varying thickness, a crossover from the in-plane local four-fold symmetry (cubic
anisotropy) to local two-fold symmetry (uniaxial anisotropy) occurs as t exceeds 50 nm. Gilbert
damping parameter {\alpha} decreases monotonously from 0.047 to 0.0078 with decreasing disorder
strength (increasing TS) and jumps from 0.008 for the CFS film with t = 50 nm to 0.024 for the film with
t equal 75 nm. Such variations of {\alpha} with TS and t are understood in terms of the changes in the
total (spin-up and spin-down) density of states at the Fermi level caused by the disorder and film
thickness.
