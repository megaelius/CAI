We review the state of the art on the delocalized non-ergodic regime of the Anderson model on Bethe
lattices. We also present new results using Belief Propagation, which consists in solving the self-consistent
recursion relations for the Green's functions directly on a given sample. This allows us to numerically
study very large system sizes and to directly access observables related to the eigenfunctions
and energy level statistics. In agreement with recent works, we establish the existence of a delocalized
non-ergodic phase on Cayley trees. On random regular graphs instead our results indicate that ergodicity
is recovered when the system size is larger than a cross-over scale $N_c (W)$, which diverges exponentially
fast approaching the localization transition. This scale corresponds to the size at which the mean-level
spacing becomes smaller than the Thouless energy $E_{Th} (W)$. Such energy scale, which vanishes
exponentially fast approaching the localization transition, is the one below which ergodicity
in the level statistics is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Remarkably, the behavior of random
regular graphs below $N_c (W)$ coincides with the one found close to the root of loop-less infinite
Cayley trees, {\it i.e.} only above $N_c (W)$ the effects of loops emerge and random regular graphs
behave differently from Cayley trees. Our results indicate that ergodicity is recovered in the
thermodynamic limit on random regular graph. However, all observables probing volumes smaller
than $N_c(W)$ and times smaller than $\hbar/E_{Th} (W)$ are expected to behave as if there were an
intermediate phase. Given the very fast divergence of $N_c(W)$ and $\hbar/E_{Th} (W)$ these non-ergodic
effects are very pronounced in a large region preceding the localization transition, and they can
be related to the intermediate phase present on Cayley trees.
