We investigate a generic dynamical theory to characterize topological quantum phases by quantum
quenches, and study the emergent topology of quantum dynamics when the quenches start from a deep
or shallow trivial phase to topological regimes. Two dynamical schemes are examined: One is to characterize
topological phases via quantum dynamics induced by a single quench along an arbitrary axis, and
the other applies a sequence of quenches with respect to all (pseudo)spin axes. These two schemes
are both built on the so-called dynamical bulk-surface correspondence, which shows that the $d$-dimensional
($d$D) topological phases with integer invariants can be characterized by the dynamical topological
pattern emerging on $(d-1)$D band inversion surfaces (BISs). We show that the first dynamical scheme
works for both deep and shallow quenches, the latter of which is initialized in an incompletely polarized
trivial phase. For the second scheme, however, when the initial phase for the quench study varies
from the deep trivial (fully polarized) regime to shallow trivial (incompletely polarized) regime,
a new dynamical topological transition, associated with topological charges crossing BISs, is
predicted in the quench dynamics. The generic criteria of the dynamical topological transition
is precisely obtained. Above the criteria (deep quench regime), the quantum dynamics on the BISs
can well characterize the topology of the post-quench Hamiltonian, while below the criteria (shallow
quench regime), the quench dynamics may not characterize the post-quench topology, but depict
a newly emergent dynamical topology. We illustrate our results by numerically calculating the
2D quantum anomalous Hall model, which has been realized in ultracold atoms. This work broadens
the way to classify topological phases by non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, and has feasibility
for experimental realization.
