This topical review focuses on solid-state quantum-light sources which are fabricated in a deterministic
fashion. In this framework we cover quantum emitters represented by semiconductor quantum dots,
colour centres in diamond, and defect-/strain-centres in two-dimensional materials. First,
we introduce the topic of quantum-light sources and non-classical light generation for applications
in photonic quantum technologies, motivating the need for the development of scalable device technologies
to push the field to real-world applications. In the second part, we summarize material systems
hosting quantum emitters in the solid-state. The third part reviews deterministic fabrication
techniques and comparatively discusses their advantages and disadvantages. The techniques are
classified in bottom-up approaches, exploiting the site-controlled positioning of the quantum
emitters themselves, and top-down approaches, allowing for the precise alignment of photonic
microstructures to pre-selected quantum emitters. Special emphasis is put on the progress achieved
in the development of in-situ techniques, which significantly pushed the performance of quantum-light
sources towards applications. Additionally we discuss hybrid approaches, exploiting pick-and-place
techniques or wafer-bonding. The fourth part presents state-of-the-art quantum-dot quantum-light
sources based on the fabrication techniques presented in the previous sections, which feature
engineered functionality and enhanced photon collection efficiency. The article closes by highlighting
recent applications of deterministic solid-state-based quantum-light sources in the fields
of quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum metrology, and discussing future perspectives
in the field of solid-state quantum-light sources.
