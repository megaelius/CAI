Atomistic molecular dynamics simulation is an important tool for predicting materials properties.
Accuracy depends crucially on the model for the interatomic potential. The gold standard would
be quantum mechanics (QM) based force calculations, but such a first-principles approach becomes
prohibitively expensive at large system sizes. Efficient machine learning models (ML) have become
increasingly popular as surrogates for QM. Neural networks with many thousands of parameters excel
in capturing structure within a large dataset, but may struggle to extrapolate beyond the scope
of the available data. Here we present a highly automated active learning approach to iteratively
collect new QM data that best resolves weaknesses in the existing ML model. We exemplify our approach
by developing a general potential for elemental aluminum. At each active learning iteration, the
method (1) trains an ANI-style neural network potential from the available data, (2) uses this potential
to drive molecular dynamics simulations, and (3) collects new QM data whenever the neural network
identifies an atomic configuration for which it cannot make a good prediction. All molecular dynamics
simulations are initialized to a disordered configuration, and then driven according to randomized,
time-varying temperatures. This nonequilibrium molecular dynamics forms a variety of crystalline
and defected configurations. By training on all such automatically collected data, we produce
ANI-Al, our new interatomic potential for aluminum. We demonstrate the remarkable transferability
of ANI-Al by benchmarking against experimental data, e.g., the radial distribution function in
melt, various properties of the stable face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal, and the coexistence
curve between melt and FCC.
