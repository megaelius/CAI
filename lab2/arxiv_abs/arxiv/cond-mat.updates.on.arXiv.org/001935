We establish a theoretical framework for exploring the quantum dynamics of finite ultracold bosonic
ensembles based on the Born-Bogoliubov-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy of equations
of motion for few-particle reduced density matrices (RDMs). The theory applies to zero as well as
low temperatures and is formulated in a highly efficient way by utilizing dynamically optimized
single-particle basis states and representing the RDMs in terms of permanents with respect to those.
An energy, RDM compatibility and symmetry conserving closure approximation is developed on the
basis of a recursively formulated cluster expansion for these finite systems. In order to enforce
necessary representability conditions, two novel, minimal-invasive and energy-conserving
correction algorithms are proposed, involving the dynamical purification of the solution of the
truncated BBGKY hierarchy and the correction of the equations of motion themselves, respectively.
For gaining conceptual insights, the impact of two-particle correlations on the dynamical quantum
depletion is studied analytically. We apply this theoretical framework to both a tunneling and
an interaction-quench scenario. Due to our efficient formulation of the theory, we can reach truncation
orders as large as twelve and thereby systematically study the impact of the truncation order on
the results. While the short-time dynamics is found to be excellently described with controllable
accuracy, significant deviations occur on a longer time-scale in sufficiently far off-equilibrium
situations. Theses deviations are accompanied by exponential-like instabilities leading to
unphysical results. The phenomenology of these instabilities is investigated in detail and we
show that the minimal-invasive correction algorithm of the equation of motion can indeed stabilize
the BBGKY hierarchy truncated at the second order.
