Two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases subject to s-wave pairing can be driven into a
topological phase by increasing the Zeeman spin splitting beyond a critical value. In the topological
regime, the system exhibits the hallmarks of chiral p-wave superfluidity, including exotic Majorana
excitations. Previous theoretical studies of this realization of a two-dimensional topological
Fermi superfluid have focused on the BCS limit where the s-wave Cooper pairs are only weakly bound
and, hence, the induced chiral p-wave order parameter has a small magnitude. Motivated by the goal
to identify potential new ways for the experimental realization of robust topological superfluids
in ultra-cold atom gases, we study the BCS-to-BEC crossover driven by increasing the Cooper-pair
binding energy for this system. In particular, we obtain phase diagrams in the parameter space of
two-particle bound-state energy and Zeeman spin-splitting energy. Ordinary characteristics
of the BEC limit, in particular the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the Fermi surface, are
observed in the nontopological regime. In contrast, the topological phase retains all features
of chiral p-wave superfluidity, including a well-defined underlying Fermi surface, even in the
limit of large s-wave pair-binding energies. Compared to the BCS limit, the topological superfluid
in the BEC limit turns out to be better realizable even for only moderate magnitude of spin-orbit
coupling because the chiral p-wave order parameter is generally larger and remnants of s-wave pairing
are suppressed. We identify optimal parameter ranges that can aid further experimental investigations
and elucidate the underlying physical reason for the persistence of the chiral p-wave superfluid.
