The discovery of topologically non-trivial states in band insulators has induced an extensive
search for topological phase in strongly correlated electron systems. In particular, samarium
hexaboride (SmB$_6$) has drawn much attention as it might represent a new class of condensed matter
called topological Kondo insulator. Kondo insulators (KI) can have non-trivial Z$_2$ topology
because the energy gap opens at the Fermi energy ($E_F$) by hybridization between an odd- parity
renormalized $f$ band and an even- parity conduction $d$ band. However, the characteristics of
SmB$_6$ deviate from the conventional KI because its gap is insensitive to doping and pressure.
Thus, it is unclear what makes the gap of SmB$_6$ different from that of KI, and how the band inversion
features occur. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the importance of charge fluctuations in SmB$_6$.
Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results reveal that with decreasing temperature
the bottom of the $d$-$f$ hybridized band at the $\bar{\text{X}}$ point gradually shifts from below
to above $E_F$. This shift accompanies a redistribution of spectral weight from the upper to the
lower quasiparticle band, and reflects the change in both carrier density and the number of localized
$f$ electron. Moreover, because this hybridized band is predicted to have odd parity and to induce
a non-trivial $Z_{2}$ topology, we compare our ARPES spectra with theoretical surface band structures
and find signatures of topological surface states. Therefore, our results indicate that SmB$_6$
is a charge fluctuating topological insulator having the odd-parity hybridized band above $E_F$
at the $X$ point. This demonstrates that the charge fluctuations do not only drive the insulating
bulk phase but also the non-trivial topological phase.
