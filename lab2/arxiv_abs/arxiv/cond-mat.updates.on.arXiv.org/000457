Aiming at spherical and monodisperse silver nanoparticles with diameters up to 100 nm, the potential
of heterogeneous nucleation of silver particles was explored. Gold seed particles, mainly produced
with a spark discharge generator, were carried by nitrogen through a three-zone tube furnace. Silver
was evaporated at 1210 {\deg}C in the first zone of the furnace and particle growth and shaping took
place in the subsequent zones, heated to 730 {\deg}C and 390 {\deg}C respectively. The generated
aerosol was monitored by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), while parameters, such as furnace
temperature, seed particle size and concentration and nitrogen carrier gas flow, were investigated.
Off-line atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to
characterize the morphology of the silver nanoparticles in addition to the SMPS scans. Spherical
silver nanoparticles with a mobility diameter of more than 115 nm and a geometric standard deviation
of typically 1.09 or lower at concentrations as large as 5e5cm^{-3} could be produced. The mobility
diameter of the monodisperse aerosol could be varied in the range of 50 nm to 115 nm by changing the
furnace temperature or the gold seed particle size. Elemental analysis revealed that the gold from
the seed particles formed a homogeneous alloy with the silver (< 3.5 atomic percent of gold).
The growth mechanism could not be identified unambiguously since the obtained silver particles
could both originate from heterogeneous nucleation of silver vapour on the seed particles or from
coagulation and coalescence of the seed particles with smaller, homogeneously nucleated silver
particles. Moreover, the narrow size distribution opens the opportunity to obtain an exclusively
singly charged, monodisperse calibration aerosol at sufficient concentrations after and additional
mobility selection process.
