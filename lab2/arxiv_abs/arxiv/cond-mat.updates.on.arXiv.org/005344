Superconducting (SC) fluctuations in cuprate superconductors have been extensively studied
to gain a deep insight into preformed Cooper pairs above the SC transition temperature $T_{\text{c}}$.
While the various measurements, such as the terahertz (THz) optical conductivity, Nernst effect,
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
measurements have provided the signature of the SC fluctuations, the onset temperature of the SC
fluctuations depends on the measurement scheme. Here, we shed light on the Higgs mode to investigate
the SC fluctuations, as it is the direct fingerprint of SC order parameter and can help elucidate
the development of SC phase coherence. We perform THz pump-optical probe spectroscopy for underdoped
and overdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212) thin films. The oscillatory behavior
in the pump-probe signal (THz Kerr signal) observed in the SC phase has been identified as the Higgs
mode in single crystals in our previous work [K. Katsumi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 117001 (2018)],
but two onset temperatures are identified above $T_{\text{c}}$. Combined with the results of the
single crystals in a wide range of doping, we find that the first onset $T_1^{\text{ons}}$ is 10-30
K above $T_{\text{c}}$. $T_1^{\text{ons}}$ coincides with that of the superfluid density $N_s$
extracted from the THz optical conductivity. Hence, $T_1^{\text{ons}}$ is interpreted as the
onset of macroscopic SC phase stiffness. On the other hand, the second onset $T_2^{\text{ons}}$
is identified at substantially higher than $T_{\text{c}}$, whose origin is discussed in terms
of preformed Cooper pairs.
