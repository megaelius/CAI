Depositing thin and thick films by different coating technology units is the beauty of deposition
technology where every synthesis deals chamber pressure. In hot-filament reactor, in addition
to force, chamber pressure deals heat and photon energy settling into the available species. Temperature
of substrate material and hot-filaments under fixed input power vary as per residence time of entered
dissociating CH4 and H2 gases for set flow rate. Rates of dissociating entered gases and conversion
rate of gas state carbon atoms into graphitic state and diamond state vary largely under varying
chamber pressure which influence the deposition of carbon films in terms of content-specific growth
and growth rate. The increase in the chamber pressure from 3.3 kPa to 14 kPa influences morphology
of carbon films comprising tiny grains, grains and crystallites. The increase in the chamber pressure
upto 8.6 kPa increases the growth rate of carbon film along with discernible features of grains and
crystallites. In the range of different intermediate chamber pressures, gas state carbon atoms
converted into diamond state at high rate. Under the range of high chamber pressures, gas state carbon
atoms mainly converted into graphitic state where low growth rate of the films was obtained. For
different chamber pressures, typical energies at different rate involved in developing carbon
films of featured grains and crystallites where influence of gas collisions on their development
rate is also discussed. Deposited carbon films are investigated under the investigation of original
line of experimental results opening abundant avenues of materials research.
