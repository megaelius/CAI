The electronic thermal conductivity of iron at Earth's core conditions is an extremely important
physical property in geophysics field. However, the exact value of electronic thermal conductivity
of iron under extreme pressure and temperature still remains poorly known both experimentally
and theoretically. A few recent experimental studies measured the value of the electronic thermal
conductivity directly and some theoretical works have predicted the electronic thermal conductivity
of iron at Earth's core conditions based on the Kubo-Greenwood method. However, these results differ
largely from each other. A very recent research has confirmed that for iron at Earth's core conditions
the strength of electron-electron scattering could be comparable to that for electron-phonon
scattering, meaning that the electron-electron scattering should also be considered when evaluating
the electronic thermal conductivity in the Earth's core situations. Here, by utilizing a newly
developed methodology based on direct non-equilibrium $ab~initio$ molecular dynamics simulation
coupled with the concept of electrostatic potential oscillation, we predict the electronic thermal
conductivity of iron in h.c.p phase. Our methodology inherently includes the electron-phonon
and electron-electron interactions under extreme conditions. Our results are comparable to the
previous theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly, our methodology provides a
new physical picture to describe the heat transfer process in $\epsilon-$iron at Earth's core conditions
from the electrostatic potential oscillation point of view and offers a new approach to study thermal
transport property of pure metals in planet's cores with different temperature and pressures.
