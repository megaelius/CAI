Graphene (GR) remarkable mechanical and electrical properties - such as its Young's modulus, low
mass per unit area, natural atomic flatness and electrical conductance - would make it an ideal material
for micro and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS). However, the difficulty of attaching
GR to supports coupled with naturally occurring internal defects in a few-layer GR can significantly
adversely affect the performance of such devices. Here, we have used a combined contact resonance
atomic force microscopy (CR-AFM) and ultrasonic force microscopy (UFM) approach to characterise
and map with nanoscale spatial resolution GR membrane properties inaccessible to most conventional
scanning probe characterisation techniques. Using a multi-layer GR plate (membrane) suspended
over a round hole we show that this combined approach allows access to the mechanical properties,
internal structure and attachment geometry of the membrane providing information about both the
supported and suspended regions of the system. We show that UFM allows the precise geometrical position
of the supported membrane-substrate contact to be located and provides indication of the local
variation of its quality in the contact areas. At the same time, we show that by mapping the position
sensitive frequency and phase response of CR-AFM response, one can reliably quantify the membrane
stiffness, and image the defects in the suspended area of the membrane. The phase and amplitude of
experimental CR-AFM measurements show excellent agreement with an analytical model accounting
for the resonance of the combined CR-AFM probe-membrane system. The combination of UFM and CR-AFM
provide a beneficial combination for investigation of few-layer NEMS systems based on two dimensional
materials.
