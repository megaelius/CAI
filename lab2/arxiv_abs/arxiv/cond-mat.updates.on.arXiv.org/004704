The Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) has a decisive influence on India's agricultural output
and economy. Extreme deviations from the normal seasonal amount of rainfall can cause severe droughts
or floods, affecting Indian food production and security. Despite the development of sophisticated
statistical and dynamical climate models, a long-term and reliable prediction of the ISMR has remained
a challenging problem. Towards achieving this goal, here we construct a series of dynamical and
physical climate networks based on the global near surface air temperature field. We uncover that
some characteristics of the directed and weighted climate networks can serve as efficient long-term
predictors for ISMR forecasting. The developed prediction method produces a forecast skill of
0.5 with a 5-month lead-time in advance by using the previous calendar year's data. The skill of our
ISMR forecast, is comparable to the current state-of-the-art models, however, with quite a short
(i.e., within one month) lead-time. We discuss the underlying mechanism of our predictor and associate
it with network-delayed-ENSO and ENSO-monsoon connections. Moreover, our approach allows predicting
the all India rainfall, as well as forecasting the different Indian homogeneous regions' rainfall,
which is crucial for agriculture in India. We reveal that global warming affects the climate network
by enhancing cross-equatorial teleconnections between Southwest Atlantic, Western part of the
Indian Ocean, and North Asia-Pacific with significant impacts on the precipitation in India. We
find a hotspots area in the mid-latitude South Atlantic, which is the basis for our predictor. Remarkably,
the significant warming trend in this area yields an improvement of the prediction skill.
