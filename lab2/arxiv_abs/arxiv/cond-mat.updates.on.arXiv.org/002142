Recent rapid advances in single particle tracking and supercomputing techniques resulted in an
unprecedented abundance of diffusion data exhibiting complex behaviours, such the presence of
power law tails of the msd and memory functions, commonly referred to as "fractional dynamics".
Motivated by these developments, we study the stationary solutions of the classical and generalized
Langevin equation as models of the contemporarily observed phenomena. In the first chapter we sketch
the historical background of the generalized Langevin equation. The second chapter is devoted
to the brief overview of the theory of the Gaussian variables and processes. In the third chapter
we derive the generalized Langevin equation from Hamilton's equations of motion. In the fourth
chapter the series of propositions and theorems shows that a large class of Langevin equations has
a solutions that, sampled in discrete time, are the moving average autoregressive processes, which
can be analysed using large number of available statistical methods. The fifth chapter starts with
a short introduction into the basic notions of ergodic theory. Then we prove a generalized version
of the classical Maruyama's theorem, which describes the time averages of all stationary Gaussian
processes with a finite number of spectral atoms. In the last, sixth chapter we continue the study
of the non-ergodic solutions of the Langevin equation, this time introducing the ergodicity breaking
through the random parametrisation of the equation itself. This leads to a specific form of non-Gaussianity
which affects only many-dimensional distributions of the process. The main result of this chapter
is the series of propositions which describes the second order structure of solutions of the superstatistical
Langevin equation.
