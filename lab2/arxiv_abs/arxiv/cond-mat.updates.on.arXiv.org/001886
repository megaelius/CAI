We analyze a new computational role of coherent multi-qubit quantum tunneling that gives rise to
bands of non-ergodic extended (NEE) quantum states each formed by a superposition of a large number
of computational states (deep local minima of the energy landscape) with similar energies. NEE
provide a mechanism for population transfer (PT) between computational states and therefore can
serve as a new quantum subroutine for quantum search, quantum parallel tempering and reverse annealing
optimization algorithms. We study PT in a quantum n-spin system subject to a transverse field where
the energy function $E(z)$ encodes a classical optimization problem over the set of spin configurations
$z$. Given an initial spin configuration with low energy, PT protocol searches for other bitstrings
at energies within a narrow window around the initial one. We provide an analytical solution for
PT in a simple yet nontrivial model: $M$ randomly chosen marked bit-strings are assigned energies
$E(z)$ within a narrow strip $[-n -W/2, n + W/2]$, while the rest of the states are assigned energy
0. We find that the scaling of a typical PT runtime with n and L is the same as that in the multi-target
Grover's quantum search algorithm, except for a factor that is equal to $\exp(n /(2B^2))$ for finite
transverse field $B\gg1$. Unlike the Hamiltonians used in analog quantum unstructured search
algorithms known so far, the model we consider is non-integrable and population transfer is not
exponentially sensitive in n to the weight of the driver Hamiltonian. We study numerically the PT
subroutine as a part of quantum parallel tempering algorithm for a number of examples of binary optimization
problems on fully connected graphs.
