We utilize a glass-like structural transition in order to induce a Mott metal-insulator transition
in the quasi-two-dimensional organic charge-transfer salt $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br.
In this material, the terminal ethylene groups of the BEDT-TTF molecules can adopt two different
structural orientations within the crystal structure, namely eclipsed (E) and staggered (S) with
the relative orientation of the outer C$-$C bonds being parallel and canted, respectively. These
two conformations are thermally disordered at room temperature and undergo a glass-like ordering
transition at $T_g \sim 75\,$K. When cooling through $T_g$, a small fraction that depends on the
cooling rate remains frozen in the S configuration, which is of slightly higher energy, corresponding
to a controllable degree of structural disorder. We demonstrate that, when thermally coupled to
a low-temperature heat bath, a pulsed heating current through the sample causes a very fast relaxation
with cooling rates at $T_g$ of the order of several 1000$\,$K/min. The freezing of the structural
degrees of freedom causes a decrease of the electronic bandwidth $W$ with increasing cooling rate,
and hence a Mott metal-insulator transition as the system crosses the critical ratio $(W/U)_{c}$
of bandwidth to on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$. Due to the glassy character of the transition, the
effect is persistent below $T_g$ and can be reversibly repeated by melting the frozen configuration
upon warming above $T_g$. Both by exploiting the characteristics of slowly-changing relaxation
times close to this temperature and by controlling the heating power, the materials can be fine-tuned
across the Mott transition. A simple model allows for an estimate of the energy difference between
the E and S state as well as the accompanying degree of frozen disorder in the population of the two
orientations.
