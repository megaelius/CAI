We present ground state calculations for low-density Fermi gases described by two model interactions,
an attractive square-well potential and a Lennard-Jones potential, of varying strength. We use
the optimized Fermi-Hypernetted Chain integral equation method which has been proved to provide,
in the density regimes of interest here, an accuracy better than one percent. We first examine the
low-density expansion of the energy and compare with the exact answer by Huang and Yang (H. Huang
and C. N. Yang, {\em Phys. Rev.\/} {\bf 105}, 767 (1957)). It is shown that a locally correlated wave
function of the Jastrow-Feenberg type does not recover the quadratic term in the expansion of the
energy in powers of $a_0 k_F$, where $a_0$ is the vacuum $s$-wave scattering length and $k_F$ the
Fermi wave number. The problem is cured by adding second-order perturbation corrections in a correlated
basis. Going to higher densities and/or more strongly coupled systems, we encounter an instability
of the system which is characterized by a divergence of the {\em in-medium\/} scattering length.
We interpret this divergence as a phonon-exchange driven dimerization of the system, similar to
what one has at zero density when the vacuum scattering length diverges. We then study, in the stable
regime, the superfluid gap and its dependence on the density and the interaction strength. We identify
two different corrections to low-density expansions: One are medium corrections to the pairing
interaction, and the other one finite-range corrections. We show that the most important finite-range
corrections are a direct manifestation of the many-body nature of the system.
