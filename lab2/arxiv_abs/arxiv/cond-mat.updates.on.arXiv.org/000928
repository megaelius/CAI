We study numerically the distribution of zero crossings in one-dimensional elastic interfaces
described by an overdamped Langevin dynamics with periodic boundary conditions. We model the %restoring
elastic forces with a Riesz-Feller fractional Laplacian of order $z = 1 + 2\zeta$, such that the interfaces
spontaneously relax, with a dynamical exponent $z$, to a self-affine geometry with roughness exponent
$\zeta$. By continuously increasing from $\zeta=-1/2$ (macroscopically flat interface described
by independent Ornstein--Uhlenbeck processes) to $\zeta=3/2$ (super-rough Mullins--Herring
interface), three different regimes are identified: (I) $-1/2<\zeta<0$, (II) $0<\zeta<1$, and
(III) $1<\zeta<3/2$. Starting from a flat initial condition, the mean number of zeros of the discretized
interface (I) decays exponentially in time and reaches an extensive value in the system size, or
decays as a power-law towards (II) a sub-extensive or (III) an intensive value. In the steady-state,
the distribution of intervals between zeros changes from an exponential decay in (I) to a power-law
decay $P(\ell) \sim \ell^{-\gamma}$ in (II) and (III). While in (II) $\gamma=1-\theta$ with $\theta=1-\zeta$
the steady-state persistence exponent, in (III) we obtain $\gamma = 3-2\zeta$, different from
the exponent $\gamma=1$ expected from the prediction $\theta=0$ for infinite super-rough interfaces
with $\zeta>1$. The effect on $P(\ell)$ of short-scale smoothening is also analyzed numerically
and analytically. A tight relation between the mean interval, the mean width of the interface and
the density of zeros is also reported. The results drawn from our analysis of rough interfaces subject
to particular boundary conditions or constraints, along with discretization effects, are relevant
for the practical analysis of zeros in interface imaging experiments or in numerical analysis.
