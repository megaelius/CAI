Materials with reduced dimensions have been shown to host a wide variety of exotic properties and
novel quantum states that often defy textbook wisdom1-5. Ferroelectric polarization and metallicity
are well-known examples of mutually exclusive properties that cannot coexist in bulk solids because
the net electric field in a metal can be fully screened by free electrons6. An atomically thin metallic
layer capped by insulating layers has shown decent conductivity at room temperature7. Moreover,
a penetrating polarization field can be employed to induce an ion displacement and create an intrinsic
polarization in the metallic layer. Here we demonstrate that a ferroelectric metal can be artificially
synthesized through imposing a strong polarization field in the form of ferroelectric/unit-cell-thin
metal superlattices. In this way the symmetry of an atomically thin conductive layer can be broken
and manipulated by a neighboring polar field, thereby forming a two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric
metal. The fabricated of (SrRuO3)1/(BaTiO3)10 superlattices exhibit ferroelectric polarization
in an atomically thin layer with metallic conductivity at room temperature. A multipronged investigation
combining structural analyses, electrical measurements, and first-principles electronic structure
calculations unravels the coexistence of 2D electrical conductivity in the SrRuO3 monolayer accompanied
by the electric polarization. Such 2D ferroelectric metal paves a novel way to engineer a quantum
multi-state with unusual coexisting properties, such as ferroelectrics, ferromagnetics and
metals, manipulated by external fields8,9.
