Understanding elementary mechanisms behind solid-state phase transformations and reactions
is the key to optimizing desired functional properties of many technologically relevant materials.
Recent advances in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) allow the real-time visualization
of solid-state transformations in materials, including those induced by an electron beam and temperature,
with atomic resolution. However, despite the ever-expanding capabilities for high-resolution
data acquisition, the inferred information about kinetics and thermodynamics of the process and
single defect dynamics and interactions is minima, due to the inherent limitations of manual ex-situ
analysis of the collected volumes of data. To circumvent this problem, we developed a deep learning
framework for dynamic STEM imaging that is trained to find the structures (defects) that break a
crystal lattice periodicity and apply it for mapping solid state reactions and transformations
in layered WS2 doped with Mo. This framework allows extracting thousands of lattice defects from
raw STEM data (single images and movies) in a matter of seconds, which are then classified into different
categories using unsupervised clustering methods. We further expanded our framework to extract
parameters of diffusion for the sulfur vacancies and analyzed transition probabilities associated
with switching between different configurations of defect complexes consisting of Mo dopant and
sulfur vacancy, providing insight into point defect dynamics and reactions. This approach is universal
and its application to beam induced reactions allows mapping chemical transformation pathways
in solids at the atomic level.
