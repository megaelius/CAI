The challenges presented by the COVID-19 epidemic have created a renewed interest in the development
of new methods to combat infectious diseases. A prominent property of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission
is the significant fraction of asymptomatic transmission. This may influence the effectiveness
of the standard contact tracing procedure for quarantining potentially infected individuals.
However, the effects of asymptomatic transmission on the epidemic threshold of epidemic spreading
on networks are largely unknown. Here we study the critical percolation transition in a simple epidemic
network model in the presence of a recursive contact tracing algorithm for instant quarantining.
We find that, above a certain fraction of asymptomatic transmission, standard contact tracing
loses its ability to suppress spreading below the epidemic threshold. However, we also find that
recursive contact tracing opens a possibility to contain epidemics with a large fraction of asymptomatic
or presymptomatic transmission. In particular, we calculate the required fraction of network
nodes participating in the contact tracing for networks with arbitrary degree distributions and
for varying recursion depths and discuss the influence of recursion depth and asymptomatic rate
on the epidemic percolation phase transition. We test and illustrate our theoretical results using
numerical simulations on infection trees and networks. We anticipate recursive contact tracing
to provide a basis for digital, app-based contact tracing tools that extend the efficiency of contact
tracing to diseases with a large fraction of asymptomatic transmission.
