We have studied the magnetic properties of multilayers composed of ferromagnetic metal Co and heavy
metals with strong spin orbit coupling (Pt and Ir). Multilayers with symmetric (ABA stacking) and
asymmetric (ABC stacking) structures are grown to study the effect of broken structural inversion
symmetry. We compare the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) energy of symmetric Pt/Co/Pt,
Ir/Co/Ir multilayers and asymmetric Pt/Co/Ir, Ir/Co/Pt multilayers. First, the interface contribution
to the PMA is studied using the Co layer thickness dependence of the effective PMA energy. Comparison
of the interfacial PMA between the Ir/Co/Pt, Pt/Co/Ir asymmetric structures and Pt/Co/Pt, Ir/Co/Ir
symmetric structures indicate that the broken structural inversion symmetry induced PMA is small
compared to the overall interfacial PMA. Second, we find the magnetic anisotropy field is significantly
increased in multilayers when the ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically coupled via
interlayer exchange coupling (IEC). Macrospin model calculations can qualitatively account
for the relation between the anisotropy field and the IEC. Among the structures studied, IEC is the
largest for the asymmetric Ir/Co/Pt multilayers: the exchange coupling field exceeds 3 T and consequently,
the anisotropy field approaches 10 T. Third, comparing the asymmetric Ir/Co/Pt and Pt/Co/Ir structures,
we find the IEC and, to some extent, the interface PMA are stronger for the former than the latter.
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism studies suggest that the proximity induced magnetization in
Pt is larger for the Ir/Co/Pt multilayers than the inverted structure, which may partly account
for the difference in the magnetic properties. These results show the intricate relation between
PMA, IEC and the proximity induced magnetization that can be exploited to design artificial structures
with unique magnetic characteristics.
