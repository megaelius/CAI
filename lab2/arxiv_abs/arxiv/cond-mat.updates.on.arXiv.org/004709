Mn-Zn ferrite nanoparticles have been subject of increasing research due to their desired properties
for a wide range of applications. These properties include nanometer particle size control, tunable
magnetic properties and low toxicity, providing these ferrites with the necessary requirements
for cancer treatment via magnetic hyperthermia. Powders of Mn1-xZnxFe2O4 (x=0; 0.5; 0.8; 1) were
synthesized via the sol-gel autocombustion and hydrothermal methods, aiming to optimize their
structural and magnetic properties for further application in a ferrofluid. Samples were characterized
by XRD, SQUID, SEM, TEM and magnetic induction heating (MIH) techniques. The XRD diffractograms
of hydrothermally produced samples presented spinel crystal structure with high single-phase
percentage (>88%). Rietveld refinement and Williamson-Hall analysis revealed a decrease of lattice
constant and crystallite size with increase of Zn/Mn ratio. TEM images reveals narrow particle
size distributions and decrease of the mean particle size with increase of Zn/Mn. SQUID results
showed that the increase of Zn results in a decrease of saturation magnetization and remnant magnetization.
More noticeably, the M(T) curves present a shift in the samples magnetic ordering temperature towards
lower temperatures with the increase of Zn content, from ~556 to ~284 K. The MIH experiment also unveiled
a decrease in the heating rate with the increase of Zn in ferrite. Nanocrystals of Mn-Zn ferrite produced
by hydrothermal method present better crystallinity and magnetic properties than the sol-gel
auto-combustion samples. The hydrothermally synthesized samples revealed dependence of its
structural and magnetic properties with Mn/Zn ratio.The magnetic ordering temperature of these
ferrites can be used as a self-controlled mechanism of heating, raising these ferrites to a class
of smart materials.
