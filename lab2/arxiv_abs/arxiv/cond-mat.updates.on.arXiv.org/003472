Metallic quantum criticality is among the central theme in the understanding of correlated electronic
systems, and converging results between analytical and numerical approaches are still under calling.
In this work, we develop state-of-art large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation technique and
systematically investigate the itinerant quantum critical point on a 2D square lattice with antiferromagnetic
spin fluctuations at wavevector $\mathbf{Q}=(\pi,\pi)$ -- a problem that resembles the Fermi
surface setup and low-energy antiferromagnetic fluctuations in high-Tc cuprates and other critical
metals, which might be relevant to their non-Fermi-liquid behaviors. System sizes of $60\times
60 \times 320$ ($L \times L \times L_\tau$) are comfortably accessed, and the quantum critical scaling
behaviors are revealed with unprecedingly high precision. We found that the antiferromagnetic
spin fluctuations introduce effective interactions among fermions and the fermions in return
render the bare bosonic critical point into a new universality, different from both the bare Ising
universality class and the Hertz-Mills-Moriya RPA prediction. At the quantum critical point,
a finite anomalous dimension $\eta\sim 0.125$ is observed in the bosonic propagator, and fermions
at hot spots evolve into a non-Fermi-liquid. In the antiferromagnetically ordered metallic phase,
fermion pockets are observed as energy gap opens up at the hot spots. These results bridge the recent
theoretical and numerical developments in metallic quantum criticality and can be served as the
stepping stone towards final understanding of the 2D correlated fermions interacting with gapless
critical excitations.
