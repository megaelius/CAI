Dislocation slip is a general deformation mode and governs the strength of metals. Via discrete
dislocation dynamics and molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the strain rate and dislocation
density dependence of the strength of bulk copper single crystals using 192 simulations spanning
over 10 orders of magnitude in strain rate and 9 orders of magnitude in dislocation density. Based
on these large set of simulations and theoretical analysis, a new analytical relationship between
material strength, dislocation density, strain rate and dislocation mobility is proposed, which
is in excellent agreement with the current simulations as well as with experimental data. The results
show that the material strength is a non-monotonic function of dislocation density and displays
two universal regimes (first decreasing, then increasing) as the dislocation density increases.
The first regime is a result of strain rate hardening, while the second regime is dominated by the
classical Taylor forest hardening. Accordingly, the strength displays universally, as a function
of strain rate, a rate-independent regime at low strain rates (governed by forest hardening) followed
by a rate hardening regime at high strain rates (governed by strain rate hardening). All the results
can be captured by a single scaling function. Finally, the fluctuations of dislocation flow are
analyzed in terms of the strain rate dependent distribution of dislocation segment velocities.
It is found that the fluctuations are governed by another universal scaling function and diverge
in the rate independent limit, indicating a critical behavior. The current analysis provides a
comprehensive understanding on how collective dislocation motions are governed by the competition
between the internal elastic interactions of dislocations, and the stress required to drive dislocation
fluxes at a given externally imposed strain rate.
