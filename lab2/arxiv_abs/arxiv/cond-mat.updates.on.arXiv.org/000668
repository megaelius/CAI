Approximate full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations have recently become tractable
for systems of unforeseen size thanks to stochastic and adaptive approximations to the exponentially
scaling FCI problem. The result of an FCI calculation is a weighted set of electronic configurations,
which can be also expressed as excitations from a reference configuration. These excitation amplitudes
contain information on the complexity of the electronic wave function, but this information is
contaminated by contributions from disconnected excitations, i.e. those excitations that are
just products of independent lower-level excitations. The unwanted contributions can be removed
via a cluster decomposition procedure, making it possible to examine the importance of connected
excitations in complicated multireference molecules which are outside the reach of conventional
algorithms. We present an implementation of the cluster decomposition analysis and apply it to
both true FCI wave functions, as well as wave functions generated from an adaptive sampling algorithm.
The cluster decomposition is useful for interpreting calculations in chemical studies, as a diagnostic
for the convergence of various excitation manifolds, as well as as a guidepost for polynomially
scaling electronic structure models. Applications are presented for (i) the double dissociation
of water, (ii) the carbon dimer, (iii) the {\pi} space of polyacenes, as well as (iv) the chromium
dimer. While the cluster amplitudes exhibit rapid decay with increasing rank for the first three
systems, even connected octuple excitations still appear important in Cr2, suggesting that spin-restricted
single-reference coupled-cluster approaches may not be tractable for some problems in transition
metal chemistry.
