In this work, we introduce three algorithmic improvements to reduce the cost and improve the scaling
of orbital space variational Monte Carlo (VMC). First, we show that by appropriately screening
the one- and two-electron integrals of the Hamiltonian one can improve the efficiency of the algorithm
by several orders of magnitude. This improved efficiency comes with the added benefit that the resulting
algorithm scales as the second power of the system size $O(N^2)$, down from the fourth power $O(N^4)$.
Using numerical results, we demonstrate that the practical scaling obtained is in fact $O(N^{1.5})$
for a chain of Hydrogen atoms, and $O(N^{1.2})$ for the Hubbard model. Second, we introduce the use
of the rejection-free continuous time Monte Carlo (CTMC) to sample the determinants. CTMC is usually
prohibitively expensive because of the need to calculate a large number of intermediates. Here,
we take advantage of the fact that these intermediates are already calculated during the evaluation
of the local energy and consequently, just by storing them one can use the CTCM algorithm with virtually
no overhead. Third, we show that by using the adaptive stochastic gradient descent algorithm called
AMSGrad one can optimize the wavefunction energies robustly and efficiently. The combination
of these three improvements allows us to calculate the ground state energy of a chain of 160 hydrogen
atoms using a wavefunction containing $\sim 2\times 10^5$ variational parameters with an accuracy
of 1 $mE_h$/particle at a cost of just 25 CPU hours, which when split over 2 nodes of 24 processors each
amounts to only about half hour of wall time. This low cost coupled with embarrassing parallelizability
of the VMC algorithm and great freedom in the forms of usable wavefunctions, represents a highly
effective method for calculating the electronic structure of model and \emph{ab initio} systems.
