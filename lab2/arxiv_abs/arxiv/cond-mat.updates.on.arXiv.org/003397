Interlayer excitons (IXs) in heterobilayers (HBLs) of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
represent an exciting emergent class of long-lived dipolar composite bosons in an atomically thin,
near-ideal two-dimensional (2D) system. The emergence of quantum correlations in finite 2D systems
may open up tantalizing prospects of excitonic Bose-Einstein condensation and Wigner-crystal-like
phases at sufficiently low temperatures and in confined geometries. Here, we trap a tunable number
of dipolar IXs within a nanoscale confinement potential induced by placing a MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$-HBL
onto an array of SiO$_2$ nanopillars. We control the mean occupation of the IX trap via the optical
excitation level and observe discrete sharp-line emission from different configurations of interacting
IXs. The intensities of these features exhibit characteristic near linear, quadratic, cubic and
quartic power dependencies, which allows us to identify them as different multiparticle configurations
with $N_{IX}=1-4$. We directly measure the hierarchy of dipolar and exchange interactions as $N_{IX}$
increases. The interlayer biexciton is found to be an emission doublet that is blue-shifted from
the single exciton by $\Delta E=(8.4\pm0.6)$ meV and split by $2J=(1.2\pm0.5)$ meV. The blueshift
is even more pronounced for triexcitons ($(12.4\pm0.4) $ meV) and quadexcitons ($(17.0\pm0.5)$
meV). These values are shown to be mutually consistent with numerical modelling of dipolar excitons
moving in a harmonic trapping potential having a confinement length scale in the range $l\approx3$
nm. Our results contribute to the understanding of interactions between IXs in TMD-HBLs at the discrete
limit of only a few excitations and represent a key step towards exploring quantum correlations
between IXs in TMD-HBLs.
