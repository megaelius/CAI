Motion of an object near a soft wall with intervening fluid is a canonical problem in elastohydrodynamics,
finding presence in subjects spanning biology to tribology. Particularly, motion of a sphere towards
a soft substrate with intervening fluid is often encountered in the context of scanning probe microscopy.
While there have been fundamental theoretical studies on this setup, they have focussed on specific
applications and thus enforced suitable simplifications. Here we present a versatile semi-analytical
framework for studying the elastohydrodynamics of axisymmetric loading of a rigid sphere near
a soft elastic substrate coated on a rigid platform mediated by an aqueous electrolytic solution.
Three loading modes are considered - approach, recession and oscillatory. The framework incorporates
- large oscillation frequency and amplitude, two-way coupling between pressure and substrate
deformation, and presence of DLVO forces. From computations using the framework, we gain insights
on the effects of DLVO forces, substrate thickness, substrate material compressibility (quantified
by Poisson's ratio) and high oscillation frequency for different physical setups encountered
in SPM and the likes. We list some key observations. A substrate that is thicker and more compressible
allows for larger deformation, i.e. is effectively softer. Presence of DLVO forces lead to magnification
in force of upto two orders of magnitude and in substrate deformation of upto an order of magnitude
for oscillatory loading at low frequencies and approach/recession loading at low speed. For oscillatory
loading at high frequencies, DLVO forces do not appreciably affect the force and deflection behaviour
of the system. Having demonstrated the versatility and utility of our framework, we expect it to
evolve into a diverse and useful tool for solving problems of soft-lubrication.
