Ensilication is a technology we developed that can physically stabilise proteins in silica without
use of a pre-formed particle matrix. Stabilisation is done by tailor fitting individual proteins
with a silica coat using a modified sol-gel process. Biopharmaceuticals, for example, liquid-formulated
vaccines with adjuvants, have poor thermal stability. Heating or freezing impairs their potency.
As a result, there is an increase in the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases in low-income
countries even when there are means to combat them. One of the root causes lies in the problematic
vaccine cold-chain distribution. We believe that ensilication can improve vaccine availability
by enabling transportation without refrigeration. Here, we show that ensilication stabilises
tetanus toxoid C fragment (TTCF) and demonstrate that this material can be stored and transported
at ambient temperature without compromising the immunogenic properties of TTCF in vivo. TTCF is
a component of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccine. To further our understanding
of the ensilication process, and its protective effect on proteins we have studied the formation
of TTCF-silica nanoparticles via time-resolved Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Our results
reveal ensilication to be a staged diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) type reaction,
induced by the presence of TTCF protein at neutral pH. Analysis of scattering data indicates tailor
fitting of TTCF protein. The experimental in vivo immunisation data confirms the retention of immunogenicity
after release from silica. Our results suggest that we could utilise this technology for multicomponent
vaccines, therapeutics or other biopharmaceuticals that are not compatible with lyophilisation.
