We develop an analytical framework to study the influence of a weakly intercoupled inplane spherical
metal nanoparticle (MNP) assembly on a coherently illuminated quantum emitter (QE). We reduce
the analytical expressions derived for the aforementioned generic planar setup into simple and
concise expressions representing a QE mediated by a symmetric MNP constellation, by exploiting
the symmetry. We use the recently introduced generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) theory
that has successfully explained plasmonic experiments to model the MNPs in our system. Due to the
use of GNOR theory, and our analytical approach, the procedure we suggest is extremely computationally
efficient. Using the derived model, we analyse the absorption rate, resultant Rabi frequency,
effective excitonic energy shift and dephasing rate shift spectra of an exciton bearing QE at the
centre of a symmetric MNP setup. We observe that the QE experiences plasmon induced absorption rate
spectral linewidth variations that increase in magnitude with decreasing MNP-QE centre separation
and increasing number of MNPs. Our results also suggest that, parameter regions where the QE exhibits
trends of decreasing linewidth against decreasing MNP-QE centre separation are likely to be associated
with plasmon induced excitonic energy redshifts. Similarly, regions where the QE absorption rate
linewidth tends to increase against decreasing MNP QE centre separation are likely to be accompanied
by plasmon induced excitonic energy blueshifts. In both these cases, the magnitude of the observed
red/blueshift was seen to increase with the number of MNPs in the constellation, due to enhancement
of the plasmonic influence.
