Although ferromagnetism is in general a long-range collective phenomenon, it is possible to induce
local spatial variations of magnetic properties in ferromagnetic materials. For example, systematic
variation of the exchange coupling strength can be used to to create systems that behave as if they
are comprised of virtually independent segments that exhibit "local" Curie temperatures. Such
localization of thermodynamic behavior leads to boundaries between strongly and weakly magnetized
regions that can be controllably moved within the material with temperature. The utility of this
interesting functionality is largely dependent on the inherent spatial resolution of magnetic
properties - specifically the distance over which the exchange strength and corresponding properties
behave locally. To test the degree to which this type of localization can be realized in materials,
we have fabricated epitaxial films of Co[1-x]Ru[x] alloy featuring a nanometer scale triangular
wave Ru concentration depth profile. Continuous modulation of the local Curie temperature across
distances as short as 4.9 nm were observed using polarized neutron reflectometry. These results
are consistent with mean-field simulations of spin systems that encompass the possibility of delocalized
exchange coupling, and show that composition grading can be used to localize magnetic properties
in films down to the sub-nanometer level. Since this is demonstrated here for an itinerant metal,
we assert that for virtually any modulated magnetic material system, collective effects can be
suppressed to length scales smaller than about 1 nm, so that magnetic behavior overall can be well
described in terms of local material properties.
