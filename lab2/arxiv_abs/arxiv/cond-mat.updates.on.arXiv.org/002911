Finite temperature quantum field theory in the heat kernel method is used to study the heat capacity
of condensed matter. The lattice heat is treated a la P. Debye as energy of the elastic (sound) waves.
The dimensionless functional of free energy is re-derived with a cut-off parameter and used to obtain
the specific heat of crystal lattices. The new dimensionless thermodynamical variable is formed
as the Planck's inverse temperature divided by the lattice constant. The dimensionless constant,
universal for a class of crystal lattices, which determines the low temperature region of molar
specific heat, is introduced and tested with the data for diamond lattice crystals. The low temperature
asymptotics of specific heat is found to be the fourth power in temperature instead of the cubic power
law of the Debye theory. Experimental data for the carbon group elements (silicon, germanium) and
other materials decisively confirm the quartic law. The true low temperature regime of specific
heat is defined by the surface heat, therefore, it depends on geometrical characteristics of a body,
while the absolute zero temperature limit is geometrically forbidden. The limit on a growth of specific
heat at temperatures close to critical points, known as the Dulong-Petit law, appears from the lattice
constant cut-off. Its value depends on the lattice type and it is the same for materials with the same
crystal lattice. The Dulong-Petit values of compounds are equal to those of elements with the same
crystal lattice type, if one mole of solid state matter were taken as the Avogadro number of the lattice
atoms. This means the Neumann-Kopp rule is valid only in some cases.
