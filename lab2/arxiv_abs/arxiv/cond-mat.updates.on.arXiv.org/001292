We use the Nernst effect to delineate the boundary of the pseudogap phase in the temperature-doping
phase diagram of cuprate superconductors. New data for the Nernst coefficient $\nu(T)$ of YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{y}$
(YBCO), La$_{1.8-x}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (Eu-LSCO) and La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$
(Nd-LSCO) are presented and compared with previous data including La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO).
The temperature $T_\nu$ at which $\nu/T$ deviates from its high-temperature behaviour is found
to coincide with the temperature at which the resistivity deviates from its linear-$T$ dependence,
which we take as the definition of the pseudogap temperature $T^\star$- in agreement with gap opening
detected in ARPES data. We track $T^\star$ as a function of doping and find that it decreases linearly
vs $p$ in all four materials, having the same value in the three LSCO-based cuprates, irrespective
of their different crystal structures. At low $p$, $T^\star$ is higher than the onset temperature
of the various orders observed in underdoped cuprates, suggesting that these orders are secondary
instabilities of the pseudogap phase. A linear extrapolation of $T^\star(p)$ to $p=0$ yields $T^\star(p\to
0)\simeq T_N(0)$, the N\'eel temperature for the onset of antiferromagnetic order at $p=0$, suggesting
that there is a link between pseudogap and antiferromagnetism. With increasing $p$, $T^\star(p)$
extrapolates linearly to zero at $p\simeq p_{\rm c2}$, the critical doping below which superconductivity
emerges at high doping, suggesting that the conditions which favour pseudogap formation also favour
pairing. We also use the Nernst effect to investigate how far superconducting fluctuations extend
above $T_{\rm c}$, as a function of doping, and find that a narrow fluctuation regime tracks $T_{\rm
c}$, and not $T^\star$. This confirms that the pseudogap phase is not a form of precursor superconductivity.
