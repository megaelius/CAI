We explore minimal navigation strategies for active particles in complex, dynamical, external
fields, introducing a class of autonomous, self-propelled particles which we call Markovian robots
(MR). These machines are equipped with a navigation control system (NCS) that triggers random changes
in the direction of self-propulsion of the robots. The internal state of the NCS is described by a
Boolean variable that adopts two values. The temporal dynamics of this Boolean variable is dictated
by a closed Markov chain -- ensuring the absence of fixed points in the dynamics -- with transition
rates that may depend exclusively on the instantaneous, local value of the external field. Importantly,
the NCS does not store past measurements of this value in continuous, internal variables. We show
that, despite the strong constraints, it is possible to conceive closed Markov chain motifs that
lead to nontrivial motility behaviors of the MR in one, two and three dimensions. By analytically
reducing the complexity of the NCS dynamics, we obtain an effective description of the long-time
motility behavior of the MR that allows us to identify the minimum requirements in the design of NCS
motifs and transition rates to perform complex navigation tasks such as adaptive gradient following,
detection of minima or maxima, or selection of a desired value in a dynamical, external field. We
put these ideas in practice by assembling a robot that operates by the proposed minimalistic NCS
to evaluate the robustness of MR, providing a proof-of-concept that is possible to navigate through
complex information landscapes with such a simple NCS whose internal state can be stored in one bit.
These ideas may prove useful for the engineering of miniaturized robots.
