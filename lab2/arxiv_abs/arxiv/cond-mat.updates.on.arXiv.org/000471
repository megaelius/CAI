An important goal in nanoelectromechanics is to cool the vibrational motion, ideally to its quantum
ground state. Cooling by an applied charge current is a particularly simple and hence attractive
strategy to this effect. Here, we explore this phenomenon in the context of the general theory of
thermoelectrics. In linear response, this theory describes thermoelectric refrigerators in
terms of their cooling efficiency and figure of merit ZT. We show that both concepts carry over to
phonon cooling in nanoelectromechanical systems. As an important consequence, this allows us
to discuss the efficiency of phonon refrigerators in relation to the fundamental Carnot efficiency.
We illustrate these general concepts by thoroughly investigating a simple double-quantum-dot
model with the dual advantage of being quite realistic experimentally and amenable to a largely
analytical analysis theoretically. Specifically, we obtain results for the efficiency, the figure
of merit, and the effective temperature of the vibrational motion in two regimes. In the quantum
regime in which the vibrational motion is fast compared to the electronic degrees of freedom, we
can describe the electronic and phononic dynamics of the model in terms of master equations. In the
complementary classical regime of slow vibrational motion, the dynamics is described in terms
of an appropriate Langevin equation. Remarkably, we find that the efficiency can approach the maximal
Carnot value in the quantum regime, with large associated figures of merit. In contrast, the efficiencies
are typically far from the Carnot limit in the classical regime. Our theoretical results should
provide guidance to implementing efficient vibrational cooling of nanoelectromechanical systems
in the laboratory.
