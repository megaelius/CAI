High pressure serves as a path finding tool towards novel structures, including those with very
high Tc.The superconductivity in sulfur hydrides with record value (203 K) is caused by the phonon
mechanism. However, the picture differs from the conventional one in important ways. The phonon
spectrum in sulfur hydride is both broad and has a complex structure. High value of Tc is mainly due
to strong coupling to the high-frequency optical modes, although the acoustic phonons also make
a noticeable contribution. New approach is described;it generalizes the standard treatment of
the phonon mechanism and makes it possible to obtain an analytical expression for Tc . It turns out
that, unlike in the conventional case, the value of the isotope coefficient varies with the pressure
and reflects the impact of the optical modes. The phase diagram, that is the pressure dependence
of Tc, is rather peculiar. A crucial feature is that increasing pressure results in a series of structural
transitions, including the one, which yields the superconducting phase with the record Tc.In a
narrow region near 150GPa the critical temperature rises sharply from 120K to 200K. The sharp structural
transition, which produces the high Tc phase, is a first-order phase transition caused by interaction
between the order parameter and lattice deformations.Remarkable feature of the electronic spectrum
in the high Tc phase is the appearance of small pockets at the Fermi level. Their presence leads to
a two-gap spectrum, which can, in principle, be observed, with the future use of tunneling spectroscopy.
This feature leads to non-monotonic and strongly asymmetric pressure dependence of Tc. Other hydrides
can be expected to display even higher values of Tc, up to room temperature. The fundamental challenge
lays in creation a structure capable of displaying high Tc at ambient pressure.
