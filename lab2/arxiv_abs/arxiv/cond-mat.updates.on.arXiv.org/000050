We study the occurrence of modulational instabilities in lattices with non-local, power-law hoppings
and interactions. Choosing as a case study the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we consider
one-dimensional chains with power-law decaying interactions (with exponent \alpha) and hoppings
(with exponent \beta): An extensive energy is obtained for \alpha, \beta>1. We show that the
effect of power-law interactions is that of shifting the onset of the modulational instabilities
region for \alpha>1. At a critical value of the interaction strength, the modulational stable
region shrinks to zero. Similar results are found for effectively short-range nonlocal hoppings
(\beta > 2): At variance, for longer-ranged hoppings (1 < \beta < 2) there is no longer any
modulational stability. The hopping instability arises for q = 0 perturbations, thus the system
is most sensitive to the perturbations of the order of the system's size. We also discuss the stability
regions in the presence of the interplay between competing interactions - (e.g., attractive local
and repulsive nonlocal interactions). We find that noncompeting nonlocal interactions give rise
to a modulational instability emerging for a perturbing wave vector q = \pi while competing nonlocal
interactions may induce a modulational instability for a perturbing wave vector 0 < q < \pi.
Since for \alpha > 1 and \beta > 2 the effects are similar to the effect produced on the stability
phase diagram by finite range interactions and/or hoppings, we conclude that the modulational
instability is "genuinely" long-ranged for 1 < \beta < 2 nonlocal hoppings.
