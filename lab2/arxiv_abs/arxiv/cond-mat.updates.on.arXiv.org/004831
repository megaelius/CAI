Finding the stopping site of the muon in a muon-spin relaxation experiment is one of the main problems
of muon spectroscopy, and computational techniques that make use of quantum chemistry simulations
can be of great help when looking for this stopping site. The most thorough approach would require
the use of simulations - such as Density Functional Theory (DFT)- to test and optimise multiple possible
sites, accounting for the effect that the added muon has on its surroundings. However, this can be
computationally expensive and sometimes unnecessary. Hence, in this work we present a software
implementation of the Unperturbed Electrostatic Method (UEP), which is an approach used for finding
the muon stopping site in crystalline materials that calculates the minima of the electrostatic
potential in the crystalline material, and estimates the stopping site of the muon relying on the
approximation that the muon presence does not significantly affect its surroundings. One of the
main assumptions of the UEP is that the muon stopping site will be one of the electrostatic potential
minima in the crystalline material. In this regard, we also propose some symmetry-based considerations
about the properties of the electrostatic potential of the crystalline material. In particular,
which sites are more likely to be its minima and why the unperturbed approximation may be sufficiently
robust for them. We introduce the Python software package pymuon-suite and the various utilities
it provides to facilitate these calculations, and finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
the method with some chosen example systems.
