In most interacting many-body systems associated with some "emergent phenomena," we can identify
sub-groups of degrees of freedom that relax on dramatically different time-scales. Time-scale
separation of this kind is particularly helpful in nonequilibrium systems where only the fast variables
are subjected to external driving; in such a case, it may be shown through elimination of fast variables
that the slow coordinates effectively experience a thermal bath of spatially-varying temperature.
In this work, we investigate how such a temperature landscape arises according to how the slow variables
affect the character of the driven quasi-steady-state reached by the fast variables. Brownian
motion in the presence of spatial temperature gradients is known to lead to the accumulation of probability
density in low temperature regions. Here, we focus on the implications of attraction to low effective
temperature for the long-term evolution of slow variables. After quantitatively deriving the
temperature landscape for a general class of overdamped systems using a path integral technique,
we then illustrate in a simple dynamical system how the attraction to low effective temperature
has a fine-tuning effect on the slow variable, selecting configurations that bring about exceptionally
low force fluctuation in the fast-variable steady-state. We furthermore demonstrate that a particularly
strong effect of this kind can take place when the slow variable is tuned to bring about orderly, integrable
motion in the fast dynamics that avoids thermalizing energy absorbed from the drive. We thus point
to a potentially general feedback mechanism in multi-time-scale active systems, that leads to
the exploration of slow variable space, as if in search of fine-tuning for a "least rattling" response
in the fast coordinates.
