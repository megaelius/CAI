Soft-X-ray ARPES (SX-ARPES) with its enhanced probing depth and chemical specificity allows access
to fundamental electronic structure characteristics - momentum-resolved spectral function,
band structure, Fermi surface - of systems difficult and even impossible for the conventional ARPES
such as three-dimensional materials, buried interfaces and impurities. After a recap of the spectroscopic
abilities of SX-ARPES, we review its applications to oxide interfaces, focusing on the paradigm
LaAlO3-SrTiO3 interface. Resonant SX-ARPES at the Ti L-edge accentuates photoemission response
of the mobile interface electrons and exposes their dxy-, dyz- and dxz-derived subbands forming
the Fermi surface in the interface quantum well. After a recap of the electron-phonon interaction
physics, we demonstrate that peak-dip-hump structure of the experimental spectral function manifests
the Holstein-type large polaron nature of the interface charge carriers, explaining their fundamentally
reduced mobility. Coupling of the charge carriers to polar soft phonon modes defines dramatic drop
of mobility with temperature. Oxygen deficiency adds another dimension to the rich physics of LaAlO3-SrTiO3
resulting from co-existence of mobile and localized electrons introduced by oxygen vacancies.
Oxygen deficiency allows tuning of the polaronic coupling and thus mobility of the charge carriers,
as well as of interfacial ferromagnetism connected with various atomic configurations of the vacancies.
Finally, we discuss spectroscopic evidence of phase separation at the LaAlO3-SrTiO3 interface.
Concluding, we put prospects of SX-ARPES for complex heterostructures, spin-resolving experiments
opening the totally unexplored field of interfacial spin structure, and in-operando field-effect
experiments paving the way towards device applications of the reach physics of oxide interfaces.
