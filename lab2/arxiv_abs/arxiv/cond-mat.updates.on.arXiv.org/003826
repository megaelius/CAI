A hydrodynamic description for inelastic Maxwell mixtures driven by a stochastic thermostat with
friction is derived by solving the set of Boltzmann kinetic equations by means of the Chapman--Enskog
method. Contrary to previous works where the constitutive relations for the fluxes were restricted
to states near the homogeneous \emph{steady} state, the expressions of the Navier--Stokes transport
coefficients are obtained by considering a more general time-dependent reference state. This
allows us to describe the system under wider physical conditions. The transport coefficients are
given in terms of the solutions of a set of nonlinear differential equations. These differential
equations (which must be in general numerically solved) involve the derivatives with respect to
the scaled parameter of the thermostat $\xi^*$. Exact expressions for the Navier--Stokes transport
coefficients are obtained in the special cases of undriven mixtures ($\xi^*=0$) and driven mixtures
under steady conditions ($\xi^*=\xi_\text{st}^*$, where $\xi_\text{st}^*$ is the value of the
reduced noise strength at the steady state). \vicente{While the transport coefficients display
a weak dependence on $\xi^*$ for small inelasticity (and so, driven and undriven systems have similar
transport properties), this dependence significantly increases with increasing inelasticity.
As a complement,} the results for inelastic Maxwell models (IMM) are compared against known results
for inelastic hard spheres (IHS) obtained in the leading Sonine approximation. While the IMM predictions
for the diffusion transport coefficients compare very well with those derived for IHS, significant
quantitative differences are found in the cases of the shear viscosity coefficient and the heat
flux transport coefficients.
