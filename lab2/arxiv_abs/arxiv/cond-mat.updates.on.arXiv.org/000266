In this work we develop a time-dependent extension of the Landauer-B\"uttiker approach to study
transient dynamics in time-dependent quantum transport through molecular junctions. A key feature
of the approach is that it provides a closed integral expression for the time-dependence of the density
matrix of the molecular junction after switch-on of a bias or gate potential which can be evaluated
without the necessity of propagating individual single-particle orbitals. This allows for the
study of time-dependent transport in large molecular systems coupled to wide band leads. As an application
of the formalism we study the transient dynamics of zigzag and armchair graphene nanoribbons of
different symmetries. We find that the transient times can exceed several hundreds of femtoseconds
while displaying a long time oscillatory motion related to multiple reflections of the density
wave in the nanoribbons at the ribbon--lead interface. This temporal profile has a shape that scales
with the length of the ribbons and is modulated by fast oscillations described by intra-ribbon and
ribbon--lead transitions. Especially in the armchair nanoribbons there exists a sequence of quasi-stationary
states related to reflections at the edge state located at the ribbon--lead interface. In the case
of zigzag nanoribbons there is a predominant oscillation frequency associated with virtual transitions
between the edge states and the Fermi levels of the electrode. We further study the local bond currents
in the nanoribbons and find that the parity of the edges strongly affects the path of the electrons
in the nanoribbons. We finally study the behavior of the transients for various added gate potentials.
