There exists many quantum or topological phases in Nature. One well known organization principle
is through various quantum or topological phases transitions between or among these phases. Another
is through either complete or in-complete devil staircases in their quantized forms. Here, we show
that both classes of organization principle appear in an experimentally accessible system: strongly
interacting spinor bosons subject to any of the linear combinations of the Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the space of the two SOC parameters $ ( \alpha, \beta) $ in a square lattice.
In the strong coupling limit, it leads to a new quantum spin model called Rotated Ferromagnetic Heisenberg
model (RFHM). The RFHM leads to rich and unconventional magnetic phases even in a bipartite lattice.
For the first class, by identifying a suitable low energy mode, we investigate a new quantum Lifshitz
transition from the Y-x to the IC-SkX-y phase. For the second class, we introduce the topological
rational and irrational winding numbers $ W $ to characterize the incomplete or complete devil staircases
and also perform their quantizations. The IC-YZ-x/LQx phases form a Cantor set with a fractal dimension
along the complete devil staircase. They also take most of measures in the incomplete devil staircases
when $ \beta \ll \alpha $. Quantum chaos and quantum information scramblings along the diagonal
line $ \alpha=\beta $ are discussed. Implications on un-conventional magnetic ordered phases
detected in the 4d- or 5d-orbital strongly correlated materials with SOC and in the current or near
future cold atom systems are presented.
