We report a general macroscopic theory for the electrodynamic response of semi-infinite metals
(SIMs). The theory includes the hitherto overlooked capacitive effects due to the finite spatial
extension of a surface. The basic structure of this theory is independent of the particulars of electron
dynamics. Analytical expressions have been obtained of the charge density-density response function,
which is naturally parsed into two parts. One of them represents a bulk property while the other a
pure surface property. We apply the theory to study the responses according to several electronic
dynamics models and provide a unified view of their validity and limitations. The models studied
include the local dielectric model (DM), the dispersive hydrodynamic model (HDM) and specular
reflection model (SRM), as well as the less common semi-classical model (SCM) based on Boltzmann's
transport equation. We show that, in terms of their basic equations, the SRM is an extension of the
HDM, just as the HDM is an extension of the DM. The SCM improves over the SRM critically through the
inclusion of translation symmetry breaking and surface roughness effects. We then employ the response
function to evaluate the so-called dynamical structure factor, which plays an important role in
particle scattering. As expected, this factor reveals a peak due to the excitation of surface plasma
waves (SPWs). Surprisingly, however, the peak is shown to be considerably sharper in the SCM than
in other models, indicating an incipient instability of the system according to this model. We also
study the distribution of charges induced by a charged particle grazing over a SIM surface at constant
speed. This distribution is shown to contain model-specific features that are of immediate experimental
interest.
