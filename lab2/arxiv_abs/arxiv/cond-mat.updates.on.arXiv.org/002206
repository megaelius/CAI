We introduce a clean cluster spin chain coupled to fully interacting spinless fermions, forming
an uncon- strained Z2 lattice gauge theory (LGT) which possesses dynamical proximity effect controlled
by the entangle- ment structure of the initial state. We expand the machinery of interaction-driven
localization to the realm of LGTs such that for any starting product state, the matter fields exhibits
emergent statistical bubble localization, which is driven solely by the cluster interaction,
having no topologically trivial non-interacting peer, and thus is of pure dynamical many-body
effect. In this vein, our proposed setting provides possibly the minimal model dropping all the
conventional assumptions regarding the existence of many-body localization. Through projec-
tive measurement of local constituting species, we also identify the coexistence of the disentangled
nonergodic matter and thermalized gauge degrees of freedom which stands completely beyond the
standard established phe- nomenology of quantum disentangled liquids. As a by product of self-localization
of the proximate fermions, the spin subsystem hosts the long-lived topological edge zero modes,
which are dynamically decoupled from the thermalized background Z2 charges of the bulk, and hence
remains cold at arbitrary high-energy density. This provides a convenient platform for strong
protection of the quantum bits of information which are embedded at the edges of completely ergodic
sub-system; the phenomenon that in the absence of such proximity-induced self-localization could,
at best, come about with a pre-thermal manner in translational invariant systems. Finally, by breaking
local Z2 symmetry of the model, we argue that such admixture of particles no longer remains dis- entangled
and the ergodic gauge degrees of freedom act as a "small bath" coupled to the localized components.
