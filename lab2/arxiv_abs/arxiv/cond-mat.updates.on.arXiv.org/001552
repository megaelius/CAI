Electronic coherent 2D spectroscopy, which allows nontrivial quantum effects in chemistry and
biology to be explored in detail, is attracting broad interest. In photosynthetic antenna and reaction
center complexes beatings of the 2D spectra have been reported and discussed in terms of quantum
coherences. While the very early stages of these coherences can have electronic character, the
long-lived beatings are related to the nuclear motions. Since involved electronic states are intimately
linked to the functioning of the complexes, an inevitable question rises about a possible nontrivial
quantum character of optimization of the primary events of photosynthesis. One of the key functional
elements of such quantum behavior and optimization in photosynthesis is delocalization-the spatial
domain coherently covered by the excited state after light absorption. Here, we apply recently
developed fluorescence detected coherent 2D spectroscopy to study the excited state delocalization
in the light harvesting antenna2 (LH2). The new method utilizes the destructive interference between
two signal components thereby uncovering cross peaks of the 2D spectra which are not visible in conventional
photon-echo based coherent 2D and earlier transient absorption measurements. Analyses of all
possible quantum pathways leads to the conclusion that, contrary to the currently prevailing physical
picture, the two weakly-coupled pigment rings of LH2 share a common ground state and the initial
electronic excitation has strong quantum mechanical correlation over the whole absorption spectrum
consisting of two clearly separate bands. These results are general and have consequences for the
interpretation of excited states not only in photosynthesis but in all light absorbing systems.
The huge initial delocalization can be the key for enhancing the light harvesting efficiency via
biased motion towards the energy funnel.
