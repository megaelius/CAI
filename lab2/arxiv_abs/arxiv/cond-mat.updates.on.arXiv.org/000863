Carbon fibers, especially those constructed from carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have attracted intensive
interests from both scientific and engineering communities due to their outstanding physical
properties. In this workHere we report, we find that the recently synthesized recently synthesized
ultrathin diamond nanothread (DNT) not only possesses excellent torsional deformation capability,
but also has excellent interfacial load transfer efficiency. Comparing with the (10,10) carbon
nanotube bundles, (1) By considering a seven strand fiber, the flattening of nanotubes as observed
in (10,10) CNT bundles is not observed in DNTdiamond nanothread bundle, which . This endows the DNT
bundle withleads to a high torsional elastic limit that is almost three times higherfour times as
obtained from the (10,10) CNT bundle. Pull-out tests reveal that (2) Pull-out tests reveal that
tthe DNT diamond nanothread bundle has has an interface transfer load of more than twice that of the
CNT carbon naontube bundle, corresponding to an order of magnitude higher in terms of . (3) Tthe interfacial
shear strength of the DNT bundle is an order of magnitude higher than that of the CNT bundle. Such high
interface load transfer efficiency is attributed to the zigzag morphology of DNT, which introduces
a strong mechanical interlocking effect at the interface through the stick-slip motion (totally
different from the load transfer mechanism in CNT bundle). The aforementioned three aspects are
commonly used to gauge the performance of fibers. Obviously,These intriguing features enable
DNT diamond nanothread as exhibits excellent potential candidate for constructing next generation
carbon fibers.
