Despite the technological significance of the tetragonal PbTiO3 for the piezoelectric transducer
industry, its high pressure behaviour is quite controversial as two entirely different scenarios,
involving pressure induced (1) morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) like structural transition
with concomitant rotation of the ferroelectric polarization vector and (2) antiferrodistortive
(AFD) phase transition followed by emergence of a reentrant ferroelectric phase, have been proposed
in recent theoretical and experimental studies. We have attempted to address these controversies
through a high resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction study of pressure induced phase transitions
in the tetragonal phase of a modified PbTiO3 composition containing 50% BiFeO3, where BiFeO3 was
added to enhance the AFD instability of PbTiO3. We present here the first experimental evidence
for the presence of the characteristic superlattice reflections due to an AFD transition at a moderate
pressure pc1 ~2.15 GPa in broad agreement with scenario (2), but the high pressure ferroelectric
phase belongs to the monoclinic space group Cc, and not the tetragonal space group I4cm predicted
under scenario (2), which permits the rotation of the ferroelectric polarization vector as per
scenario (1). We show that the monoclinic distortion angle and ferroelectric polarization of the
Cc phase initially decrease with increasing pressure for p < 7 GPa, but start increasing above pc2
~ 7 GPa due to an isostructural Cc-I to Cc-II transition reminiscent of MA(apc > bpc ~ cpc) to MB(apc<
bpc ~ cpc) transition predicted for MPB systems. We also show that octahedral tilting provides an
efficient mechanism for accommodating pressure induced volume reduction for the stabilisation
of the reentrant ferroelectric phase Cc-II.
