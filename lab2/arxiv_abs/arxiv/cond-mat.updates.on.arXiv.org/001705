Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is applied to obtain the fundamental (quasiparticle) electronic band
gap, $\Delta_f$, of a semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) phosphorene whose optical and electronic
properties fill the void between graphene and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. Similarly
to other 2D materials, the electronic structure of phosphorene is strongly influenced by reduced
screening, making it challenging to obtain reliable predictions by single-particle density functional
methods. Advanced GW techniques, which include many-body effects as perturbative corrections,
are hardly consistent with each other, predicting the band gap of phosphorene with a spread of almost
1 eV, from 1.6 to 2.4 eV. Our QMC results, from infinite periodic superlattices as well as from finite
clusters, predict $\Delta_f$ to be about 2.4 eV, indicating that available GW results are systematically
underestimating the gap. Using the recently uncovered universal scaling between the exciton binding
energy and $\Delta_f$, we predict the optical gap of 1.75 eV that can be directly related to measurements
even on encapsulated samples due to its robustness against dielectric environment. The QMC gaps
are indeed consistent with recent experiments based on optical absorption and photoluminescence
excitation spectroscopy. We also predict the cohesion of phosphorene to be only slightly smaller
than that of the bulk crystal. Our investigations not only benchmark GW methods and experiments,
but also open the field of 2D electronic structure to computationally intensive but highly predictive
QMC methods which include many-body effects such as electronic correlations and van der Waals interactions
explicitly.
