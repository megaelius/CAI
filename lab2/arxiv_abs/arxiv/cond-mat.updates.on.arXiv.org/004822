Impregnation of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) into a porous medium is a promising way to stabilize
their shape and improve thermal conductivity which are essential for thermal energy storage and
thermal management of small-size applications, such as electronic devices or batteries. However,
in these composites a general understanding of how leakage is related to the characteristics of
the porous material is still lacking. As a result, the energy density and the antileakage capability
are often antagonistically coupled. In this work we overcome the current limitations, showing
that a high energy density can be reached together with superior anti-leakage performance by using
hierarchical macro-nanoporous metals for PCMs impregnation. By analyzing capillary phenomena
and synthesizing a new type of material, it was demonstrated that a hierarchical trimodal macro-nanoporous
metal (copper) provides superior antileakage capability (due to strong capillary forces of nanopores),
high energy density (90vol% of PCM load due to macropores) and improves the charging/discharging
kinetics, due to a three-fold enhancement of thermal conductivity. It was further demonstrated
by CFD simulations that such a composite can be used for thermal management of a battery pack and unlike
pure PCM it is capable of maintaining the maximum temperature below the safety limit. The present
results pave the way for the application of hierarchical macro-nanoporous metals for high-energy
density, leakage-free, and shape-stabilized PCMs with enhanced thermal conductivity. These
innovative composites can significantly facilitate the thermal management of compact systems
such as electronic devices or high-power batteries by improving their efficiency, durability
and sustainability
