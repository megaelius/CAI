Quantum computers are expected to outperform conventional computers for a range of important problems,
from molecular simulation to search algorithms, once they can be scaled up to large numbers of quantum
bits (qubits), typically millions. For most solid-state qubit technologies, e.g. those using
superconducting circuits or semiconductor spins, scaling poses a significant challenge as every
additional qubit increases the heat generated, while the cooling power of dilution refrigerators
is severely limited at their operating temperature below 100 mK. Here we demonstrate operation
of a scalable silicon quantum processor unit cell, comprising two qubits confined to quantum dots
(QDs) at $\sim$1.5 Kelvin. We achieve this by isolating the QDs from the electron reservoir, initialising
and reading the qubits solely via tunnelling of electrons between the two QDs. We coherently control
the qubits using electrically-driven spin resonance (EDSR) in isotopically enriched silicon
$^{28}$Si, attaining single-qubit gate fidelities of 98.6% and coherence time $T_2^*$ = 2$\mu$s
during `hot' operation, comparable to those of spin qubits in natural silicon at millikelvin temperatures.
Furthermore, we show that the unit cell can be operated at magnetic fields as low as 0.1 T, corresponding
to a qubit control frequency of 3.5 GHz, where the qubit energy is well below the thermal energy. The
unit cell constitutes the core building block of a full-scale silicon quantum computer, and satisfies
layout constraints required by error correction architectures. Our work indicates that a spin-based
quantum computer could be operated at elevated temperatures in a simple pumped $^4$He system, offering
orders of magnitude higher cooling power than dilution refrigerators, potentially enabling classical
control electronics to be integrated with the qubit array.
