It is well known that the electronic thermal conductivity of clean compensated semimetals can be
greatly enhanced over the electric conductivity by the availability of an ambipolar mechanism
of conduction, whereby electrons and holes flow in the same direction experiencing negligible
Coulomb scattering as well as negligible impurity scattering. This enhancement -- resulting in
a breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law with an anomalously large Lorenz ratio -- has been recently
observed in two-dimensional monolayer and bilayer graphene near the charge neutrality point.
In contrast to this, three-dimensional compensated semimetals such as WP$_2$ and Sb are typically
found to show a reduced Lorenz ratio. This dramatic difference in behavior is generally attributed
to different regimes of Fermi statistics in the two cases: degenerate electron-hole liquid in compensated
semimetals versus non-degenerate electron-hole liquid in graphene. We show that this difference
is not sufficient to explain the reduction of the Lorenz ratio in compensated semimetals. We argue
that the solution of the puzzle lies in the ability of compensated semimetals to sustain sizeable
regions of electron-hole accumulation near the contacts, which in turn is a consequence of the large
separation of electron and hole pockets in momentum space. These accumulations suppress the ambipolar
conduction mechanism and effectively split the system into two independent electron and hole conductors.
We present a quantitative theory of the crossover from ambipolar to unipolar conduction as a function
of the size of the electron-hole accumulation regions, and show that it naturally leads to a sample-size-dependent
thermal conductivity.
