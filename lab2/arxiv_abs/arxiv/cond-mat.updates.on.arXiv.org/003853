In this work, we present an atomistic first-principles framework for modeling the low-temperature
electronic and transport properties of disordered two-dimensional (2D) materials with randomly
distributed point defects (impurities). The method is based on the $T$-matrix formalism in combination
with realistic density-functional theory (DFT) descriptions of the defects and their scattering
matrix elements. From the $T$-matrix approximations to the disorder-averaged Green's function
(GF) and the collision integral in the Boltzmann transport equation, the method allows calculations
of, e.g., the density of states (DOS) including contributions from bound defect states, the quasiparticle
spectrum and the spectral linewidth (scattering rate), and the conductivity/mobility of disordered
2D materials. We demonstrate the method by examining these quantities in monolayers of the archetypal
2D materials graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) contaminated with vacancy
defects and substitutional impurity atoms. By comparing the Born and $T$-matrix approximations,
we also demonstrate a strong breakdown of the Born approximation for defects in 2D materials manifested
in a pronounced renormalization of, e.g., the scattering rate by the higher-order $T$-matrix method.
As the $T$-matrix approximation is essentially exact for dilute disorder, i.e., low defect concentrations
($c_\text{dis} \ll 1$) or density ($n_\text{dis}\ll A_\text{cell}^{-1}$ where $A_\text{cell}$
is the unit cell area), our first-principles method provides an excellent framework for modeling
the properties of disordered 2D materials with defect concentrations relevant for devices.
