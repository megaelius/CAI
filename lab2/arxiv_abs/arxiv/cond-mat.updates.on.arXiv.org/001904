We investigate the effects of solvent specificities on the stability of the native structure (NS)
of a protein on the basis of our free-energy function (FEF). We use CPB-bromodomain (CBP-BD) and
apoplastocyanin (apoPC) as representatives of the protein universe and water, methanol, ethanol,
and cyclohexane as solvents. The NSs of CBP-BD and apoPC consist of 66$\%$ $\alpha$-helices and
of 35$\%$ $\beta$-sheets and 4$\%$ $\alpha$-helices, respectively. In order to assess the structural
stability of a given protein immersed in each solvent, we contrast the FEF of its NS against that of
a number of artificially created, misfolded decoys possessing the same amino-acid sequence but
significantly different topology and $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-sheet contents. We find that
for both CBP-BD and apoPC, the energetic component dominates in methanol, ethanol, and cyclohexane,
with the most stable structures in these solvents sharing the same characteristics described as
an association of a-helices. In water, the entropic component is as strong as or even stronger than
the energetic one, with a large gain of translational, configurational entropy of water becoming
crucially important, so that the relative contents of $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-sheet and the
content of total secondary structures are carefully selected to achieve sufficiently close packing
of side chains. Our analysis, which requires minimal computational effort, can be applied to any
protein immersed in any solvent and provides robust predictions that are quite consistent with
the experimental observations for proteins in different solvent environments, thus paving the
way toward a more detailed understanding of the folding process.
