During the formation of Si nanocrystals (Si NC) in Si$_x$C$_{1-x}$ layers via solid-phase crystallization,
the unintended formation of nanocrystalline SiC reduces the minority carrier lifetime and therefore
the performance of Si$_x$C$_{1-x}$ as an absorber layer in solar cells. A significant reduction
in the annealing time may suppress the crystallization of the SiC matrix while maintaining the formation
of Si NC. In this study, we investigated the crystallization of stoichiometric SiC and Si-rich SiC
using conventional rapid thermal annealing (RTA) and nonequilibrium millisecond range flash
lamp annealing (FLA). The investigated Si$_x$C$_{1-x}$ films were prepared by plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition and annealed at temperatures from 700${\deg}$C to 1100${\deg}$C for
RTA and at flash energies between 34 J/cm$^2$ and 62 J/cm$^2$ for FLA. GIXRD and FTIR were conducted
to investigate hydrogen effusion, Si and SiC NC growth, and SiC crystallinity. Both the Si content
and the choice of the annealing process affect the crystallization behavior. It is shown that under
certain conditions, FLA can be successfully utilized for the formation of Si NC in a SiC matrix, which
closely resembles Si NC in a SiC matrix achieved by RTA. The samples must have excess Si, and the flash
energy should not exceed 40 J/cm$^2$ and 47 J/cm$^2$ for Si$_{0.63}$C$_{0.37}$ and Si$_{0.77}$C$_{0.23}$
samples, respectively. Under these conditions, FLA succeeds in producing Si NC of a given size in
less crystalline SiC than RTA does. This result is discussed in terms of nucleation and crystal growth
using classical crystallization theory. For FLA and RTA samples, an opposite relationship between
NC size and Si content was observed and attributed either to the dependence of H effusion on Si content
or to the optical absorption properties of the materials, which also depend on the Si content.
