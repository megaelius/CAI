Magnetization measurements and time-of-flight neutron powder-diffraction studies on the high-temperature
(300--980 K) magnetism and crystal structure (321--1200 K) of a pulverized YCrO$_3$ single crystal
have been performed. Temperature-dependent inverse magnetic susceptibility coincides with
a piecewise linear function with five regimes, with which we fit a Curie-Weiss law and calculate
the frustration factor $f$. The fit results indicate a formation of magnetic polarons between 300
and 540 K and a very strong magnetic frustration. By including one factor $\eta$ that represents
the degree of spin interactions into the Brillouin function, we can fit well the applied-magnetic-field
dependence of magnetization. No structural phase transition was observed from 321 to 1200 K. The
average thermal expansions of lattice configurations (\emph{a}, \emph{b}, \emph{c}, and \emph{V})
obey well the Gr$\ddot{\texttt{u}}$neisen approximations with an anomaly appearing around 900
K, implying an isosymmetric structural phase transition, and display an anisotropic character
along the crystallographic \emph{a}, \emph{b}, and \emph{c} axes with the incompressibility
$K^a_0 > K^c_0 > K^b_0$. It is interesting to find that at 321 K, the local distortion size $\Delta$(O2)
$\approx$ 1.96$\Delta$(O1) $\approx$ 4.32$\Delta$(Y) $\approx$ 293.89$\Delta$(Cr). Based
on the refined Y-O and Cr-O bond lengths, we deduce the local distortion environments and modes of
Y, Cr, O1, and O2 ions. Especially, the Y and O2 ions display obvious atomic displacement and charge
subduction, which may shed light on the dielectric property of the YCrO$_3$ compound. Additionally,
by comparing Kramers Mn$^{3+}$ with non-Kramers Cr$^{3+}$ ions, it is noted that being a Kramers
or non-Kramers ion can strongly affect the local distortion size, whereas, it may not be able to change
the detailed distortion mode.
