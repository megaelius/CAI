This chapter presents a descriptive and illustrative account of phase behavior in the seven naturally
occurring petroleum fluids and ties all the known eleven phase-transition concepts in a unified
narrative. The figures and tables contained in this report are designed so that they could effectively
support the discussion about molecular make-up of petroleum fluids, P- and T-effects on phase behavior
and phase transition points. Seven naturally occurring hydrocarbon fluids are known as petroleum
fluids. They include, in the order of their fluidity, natural gas, gas-condensate (NGL), light
crude, intermediate crude, heavy oil, tar sand and oil shale. In this report we present a generalized
description of the various phase transitions, which may occur in petroleum fluids with emphasis
on heavy organics deposition. At first the nature of every petroleum fluid is presented. Their constituents
including their socalled impurities are identified and categorized. Heavy fractions in petroleum
fluids are discussed and their main families of constituents are presented including petroleum
wax, diamondoids, asphaltenes and petroleum resins. Then the generalized petroleum fluids phase
behavior is discussed in light of the known theory of phase transitions. The effects of variations
of composition, temperature and pressure on the phase behavior of petroleum fluids are introduced.
Finally eleven distinct phase-transition points of petroleum fluids are presented and their relation
with state variables and constituents of petroleum fluids are identified. This report is to generalize
and relate phase behaviors of all the seven naturally occurring petroleum fluids into a unified
perspective. This work is the basis to develop a comprehensive computational model for phase behavior
prediction of all the petroleum fluids, which is of major interest in the petroleum industry.
