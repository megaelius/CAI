Noncentrosymmetric superconductors with line nodes are expected to possess topologically protected
flat zero-energy bands of surface states, which can be described as Majorana modes. We here investigate
their fate if residual interactions beyond BCS theory are included. For a minimal square-lattice
model with a plaquette interaction, we find string-like integrals of motion that form Clifford
algebras and lead to exact degeneracies. These degeneracies strongly depend on whether the numbers
of sites in the $x$ and $y$ directions are even or odd, and are robust against disorder in the interactions.
We show that the mapping of the Majorana model onto two decoupled spin compass models [Kamiya et al.,
Phys. Rev. B 98, 161409 (2018)] and extra spectator degrees of freedom only works for open boundary
conditions. Based on this mapping, we see that the three-leg and four-leg Majorana ladders are integrable.
In addition, the mapping maximally reduces the effort for exact diagonalization, which is utilized
to obtain the gap above the ground states. We find that this gap remains open if one dimension is kept
constant and even, while the other is sent to infinity, at least if that dimension is odd. Moreover,
we compare the topological properties of the interacting Majorana model to those of the toric-code
model. The Majorana model has long-range entangled ground states that differ by $\mathbb{Z}_2$
fluxes through the system put on a torus. The ground states exhibit string condensation similar
to the toric code but the topological order is not robust. While the spectrum is gapped - due to spontaneous
symmetry breaking inherited from the compass models - states with different values of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$
fluxes end up in the ground-state sector in the thermodynamic limit. Hence, the gap does not protect
the ground states against weak perturbations.
