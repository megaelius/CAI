Coalescence of tiny particles for a large sized particle has been a significant phenomenon for many
senior academicians and researchers throughout the world, where it has been a part of record of all
periodicals contributing to science and technology. This study attempts to deal with the development
of gold particles under varying precursor concentration for a custom-built setup. Under the tuned
ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time, tiny particles of different sizes and shapes develop depending
on the amount of gold precursor. Packets of nano-energy bind gold atoms in their own shape when a compact
monolayer assembly is formed at solution surface. Between 0.07 mM to 0.90 mM precursor concentration,
tiny particles develop both in triangular shape as well as in non-triangular shape. Tiny particles
of triangular shape develop in a large number at precursor concentration 0.30 mM and 0.60 mM. Hence,
nanoparticles and particles also developed in different geometrical shapes. Such tiny particles
pack due to the exerted force in immersing format, where converted structures of smooth elements
assemble to develop particles of different shapes. Tiny particles of non-geometrical shapes do
not assemble at common point and their assembling develops a particle of distorted shape. This occurs
mainly when precursor concentration is 0.05 mM and 1.20 mM. Development of different shapes having
different sizes depends mainly on the amount of precursor concentration. When the length of a side
is around 100 nm, it is considered a nanoparticle and when it is greater, it is considered a particle.
An anisotropic particle has structure different to that of the distorted one. At 50 sccm Argon flow
rate, particles develop in the same shapes as in the case of 100 sccm...
