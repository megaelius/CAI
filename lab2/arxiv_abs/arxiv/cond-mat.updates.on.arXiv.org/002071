Mass transport of a driven granular binary mixture is analyzed from the inelastic Boltzmann kinetic
equation for inelastic Maxwell models (IMM). The mixture is driven by a thermostat constituted
by two terms: a stochastic force and a drag force proportional to the particle velocity. The combined
action of both forces attempts to mimic the interaction of solid particles with the interstitial
surrounding gas. As with ordinary gases, the use of IMM allows us to exactly evaluate the velocity
moments of the Boltzmann collision operator and so, it opens up the possibility of obtaining the
exact forms of the Navier--Stokes transport coefficients of the granular mixture. In this work,
the diffusion coefficients associated with the mass flux are explicitly determined in terms of
the parameters of the mixture. As a first step, the steady homogeneous state reached by the system
when the energy lost by collisions is compensated for by the energy injected by the thermostat is
addressed. In this steady state, the ratio of kinetic temperatures are determined and compared
against molecular dynamics simulations for inelastic hard spheres (IHS). The comparison shows
an excellent agreement, even for strong inelasticity and/or disparity in masses and diameters.
As a second step, the set of kinetic equations for the mixture is solved by means of the Chapman-Enskog
method for states near homogeneous steady states. In the first-order approximation, the mass flux
is obtained and the corresponding diffusion transport coefficients identified. The results show
that the predictions for IMM obtained in this work coincide with those previously derived for IHS
in the first-Sonine approximation when the non-Gaussian corrections to the zeroth-order approximation
are neglected.
