Modeling of the phosphorus radiation-enhanced diffusion in the course of implantation of high-energy
protons into an elevated-temperature silicon substrate and during its treatment in a hydrogen-containing
plasma with addition of a diffusant has been carried out. It follows from the results obtained that
the radiation-enhanced diffusion occurs by means of formation, migration, and dissociation of
"impurity atom -- silicon self-interstitial" pairs being in a local thermodynamic equilibrium
with substitutionally dissolved impurity atoms and nonequilibrium point defects generated due
to external irradiation. The resulting value of the average migration length of nonequilibrium
silicon self-interstitials decreases from 0.19 micrometer for proton energy of 140 keV to 0.09
and 0.08 micrometer for energies of 110 and 80 keV, respectively. The decrease of the average migration
length with the proton energy can be due to the interaction of silicon self-interstitials with the
vacancies generated at the surface or with the defects formed in the phosphorus implanted region.
Based on the pair diffusion mechanism, a theoretical investigation of the form of impurity profiles
that can be created in thin silicon layers due to the radiation-enhanced diffusion was carried out.
It is shown that depletion of the uniformly doped silicon layer occurs during plasma treatment except
for the silicon -- insulator interface where a narrow region with a high impurity concentration
is formed. The results of calculations give a clear evidence in favor of further investigation of
various doping processes based on the radiation-enhanced diffusion, especially the processes
of plasma doping, to develop a cheap method for the formation of strictly assigned impurity distributions
in the local semiconductor domains.
