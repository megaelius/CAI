Here we show that addition of Hf to Nb4Ta can significantly improve the high field performance of
Nb$_{3}$Sn, making it suitable for dipole magnets for Future Circular Collider (FCC). A big challenge
for the FCC is that a realistic production target for FCC Nb3Sn requires ~30% improvement over current
conductor performance. Recent success with internal oxidation(IO) of Nb-Zr precursor has shown
significant improvement in the layer J$_{c}$ of Nb$_{3}$Sn wires, albeit the complication of providing
an internal O$_{2}$ diffusion path and avoiding degradation of irreversibility field($_{irr}$).
We compare Zr and Hf additions to the standard Nb4Ta alloy of maximum H$_{c2}$ and H$_{irr}$. Nb4Ta
rods with 1Zr or 1Hf were made into monofilament wires with and without SnO$_{2}$ and their properties
measured over the entire superconducting range up to 31 T. We found that group IV alloying of Nb4Ta
raises H$_{irr}$, though adding O$_{2}$ still degrades this slightly. As noted in Nb1Zr studies,
the pinning force density F$_{p}$ is strongly enhanced and its peak value shifted to higher field
by IO. A surprising result of this work is that we found better properties in Nb4Ta1Hf without SnO$_{2}$,
F$_{pmax}$ achieving 2.35 times that of the standard Nb4Ta alloy, while the oxidized Nb4Ta1Zr alloy
achieved 1.54 times that of the Nb4Ta alloy. The highest layer J$_{c}$ (16 T, 4.2 K) of 3700 A/mm$^{2}$
was found in the SnO$_{2}$-free wire made with Nb4Ta1Hf alloy. Using a standard A15 cross-section
fraction of 60% for modern PIT and RRP wires, we estimated that a non-Cu J$_{c}$ of 2200 A/mm$^{2}$
is obtainable in modern conductors, well above the 1500A/mm$^{2}$ FCC specification. Moreover,
the best properties were obtained without SnO$_{2}$, the Nb4Ta1Hf alloy appears to open a straightforward
route to enhanced properties in Nb$_{3}$Sn wires.
