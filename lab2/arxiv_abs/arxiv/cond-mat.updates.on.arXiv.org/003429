Helical structures offer exciting properties and are utilized in numerous applications ranging
from biotechnology to displays to medicine. Elucidation of resonance effects in helical structures
that provides crucial information on molecular packing beyond positional ordering often remains
a challenge due to limited availability of characterization techniques. This limits our understanding
of the molecular self-assembly that dictates macroscopic properties. Liquid crystals that are
routinely utilized in display industry comprise of helical structures. In this article, we examined
the manifestation of resonance effects in twist bend nematic (NTB), smectic A (SmA) and crystalline
phases via tender resonant X-ray scattering (TReXS) at sulfur K-edge. While SmA layering peak is
partially resonant, scattering peak of NTB is purely resonant visible only near S K-edge. The difference
is attributed to the periodic molecular orientation variation with weak electron density modulation.
We further demonstrate that the energy-dependence of such scattering peak arising from pure orientation
variation scales with the sum of f'(E)^2 and f''2(E)^2, corresponding to the correction to dispersion
and absorption respectively, while the resonant contribution in sulfur-containing SmA scales
with f'(E), and is a first order perturbation to the relatively strong non-resonant peak from electron
density modulation. We anticipate TReXS will open new avenues in exploration of complex orientational
structures in chemistry, biology, and materials science both in static as well as realistic sample
environments, such as under mechanical shearing, electric/magnetic field, chemical or optical
stimuli.
