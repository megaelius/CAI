In this work we present a deep learning approach to produce highly accurate predictions of macroscopic
physical properties of solid crystals. Since the distribution function of the total energy would
enable a thorough understanding of the macroscopic properties for alloys and magnetic systems,
surrogate deep learning models can replace first principle calculations to speed up each sample
from the total energy distribution function. However, neural networks lose accuracy with respect
to first principle calculations, affecting the reliability of the estimate. In this paper we focus
on improving the accuracy of neural network models that are used to predict the total energy distribution
function. The accuracy is improved by reducing the overfitting with multi-tasking neural networks
that perform a joint training on multiple physical properties. The strong correlation between
the physical quantities is exploited so that they mutually serve as constraints for the training
of the deep learning model. This leads to more reliable models because the physics is also learned
correctly. We present numerical experiments for two types of binary alloys: copper-gold and iron-platinum.
Each numerical experiment considers a solid crystal with 32 atoms placed on a regular cubic structure.
The dataset comprises information about total energy, charge density and magnetic moment (for
magnetizable materials) computed via first principle codes for 32,000 configurations which differ
per composition to span the entire state space. Results show that multitasking neural networks
estimate the material properties for a specific state space hundreds of times faster than the first
principle codes used as a reference. Moreover, the joint training exploits the correlations between
the quantities to improve the reliability of the prediction with respect to the neural networks
separately trained on individual quantities.
