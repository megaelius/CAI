Increasing the efficiency of materials design and discovery remains a significant challenge,
especially given the prohibitively large size of chemical compound space. The use of a chemically
transferable coarse-grained model enables different molecular fragments to map to the same bead
type, while also reducing computational expense. These properties further increase screening
efficiency, as many compounds are screened through the use of a single coarse-grained simulation,
effectively reducing the size of chemical compound space. Here, we propose new criteria for the
rational design of coarse-grained models that allows for the optimization of their chemical transferability
and evaluate the Martini model within this framework. We further investigate the scope of this chemical
transferability by parameterizing three Martini-like models, in which the number of bead types
ranges from five to sixteen for the different force fields. We then implement a Bayesian approach
to determining which chemical groups are more likely to be present on fragments corresponding to
specific bead types for each model. We demonstrate that a level of performance and accuracy comparable
to Martini can be obtained by using a force field with fewer bead types. However, the advantage of
including more bead types is a reduction of uncertainty with respect to back-mapping these bead
types to specific chemistries. Just as reducing the size of the coarse-grained particles leads
to a finer mapping of conformational space, increasing the number of bead types yields a finer mapping
of chemical compound space. Finally, we note that, due to the relatively large size of the chemical
fragments that map to a single martini bead, a clear resolution limit arises when using the water/octanol
partition free energy as the only descriptor when coarse-graining chemical compound space.
