We study numerically the dynamical instabilities and splitting of singly and doubly quantized
composite vortices in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates harmonically confined to quasi
two dimensions. In this system, the vortices become pointlike composite defects that can be classified
in terms of an integer pair $(\kappa_1,\kappa_2)$ of phase winding numbers. Our simulations based
on zero-temperature mean-field theory reveal several vortex splitting behaviors that stem from
the multicomponent nature of the system and do not have direct counterparts in single-component
condensates. By calculating the Bogoliubov excitations of stationary axisymmetric composite
vortices, we find nonreal excitation frequencies (dynamical instabilities) for the singly quantized
$(1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$ vortices and for all variants of doubly quantized vortices, which we define
by the condition $\max_{j=1,2}|\kappa_j|=2$. While the short-time predictions of the linear
Bogoliubov analysis are confirmed by direct time integration of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations
of motion, the time integration also reveals intricate long-time decay behavior not captured by
the linearized dynamics. First, the $(1,\pm 1)$ vortex is found to be unstable against splitting
into a $(1,0)$ vortex and a $(0,\pm 1)$ vortex. Second, the $(2,1)$ vortex exhibits a two-step decay
process in which its initial splitting into a $(2,0)$ vortex and a $(0,1)$ vortex is followed by the
off-axis splitting of the $(2,0)$ vortex into two $(1,0)$ vortices. Third, the $(2,-2)$ vortex
is observed to split into a $(-1,1)$ vortex, three $(1,0)$ vortices, and three $(0,-1)$ vortices.
Each of these splitting processes is the dominant decay mechanism of the respective stationary
composite vortex for a wide range of intercomponent interaction strengths and relative populations
of the two condensate components and should be amenable to experimental detection.
