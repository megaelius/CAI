The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays an important role in evaluating a photocatalyst and to
understand its surface chemistry. In this work we present a comparative study of the OER on the oxide
NaTaO$_3$ (113) surface and the oxynitride SrTaO$_2$N (001) surface. Oxynitrides are highly promising
photocatalysts due to their smaller band gap and resulting better visible light absorption compared
to oxides but our knowledge about their surface structure and chemistry is still very limited. With
the goal to compare the surface chemistry of oxides and oxynitrides, we perform density functional
theory calculations to obtain the free energy changes associated with the OER reaction steps. For
the OER at the Ta site of the clean surfaces, our results predict the rate-limiting step for both materials
to be the formation of the *OOH intermediate, with a larger overpotential for the oxide than the oxynitride
(1.30 V vs 1.01 V). The Na site is found to be more active than the Ta site on the oxide surface with an
OER overpotential of 0.88 V, whereas the OER at the Sr site on the oxynitride has an overpotential
of 1.14 V. For the A sites, contrary to the Ta site, the deprotonation of *OH was found to be the rate-limiting
step. Computed Pourbaix diagrams show that at relevant (photo)electrochemical conditions all
surfaces are covered with oxygen adsorbates. Oxygen adsorbates at A (Na, Sr) sites are however found
to couple and desorb as O$_2$, leaving these sites empty under typical operating conditions. Following
this desorption, we find the OER to proceed by the conventional *OOH mechanism on the SrO termination
of the oxynitride but by a direct coupling of neighbouring *O at Na sites on the oxide surface. This
coupling mechanism on the oxide has the smallest overpotential of 0.79 V compared to 0.88 V for the
oxynitride, implying that the oxide is a better OER catalyst.
