Transport of solid particles in blood flow exhibits qualitative differences in the transport mechanism
when the particle varies from nanoscale to microscale size comparable to the red blood cell (RBC).
The effect of microscale particle margination has been investigated by several groups. Also, the
transport of nanoscale particles (NPs) in blood has received considerable attention in the past.
This study attempts to bridge the gap by quantitatively showing how the transport mechanism varies
with particle size from nano- to microscale. Using a three-dimensional (3D) multiscale method,
the dispersion of particles in microscale tubular flows is investigated for various hematocrits,
vessel diameters and particle sizes. NPs exhibit a nonuniform, smoothly-dispersed distribution
across the tube radius due to Brownian dispersion. The near-wall concentration of NPs can be enhanced
by increasing hematocrit and confinement. Moreover, there exists a critical particle size ($\sim$1
$\mu$m) where retention of particles in the cell-free region near the wall (i.e., margination)
occurs. Above this threshold, the margination propensity increases with the particle size. The
dominance of RBC-enhanced shear-induced diffusivity (RESID) over Brownian diffusivity (BD)
results in 10 times higher radial diffusion rates in the RBC-laden region compared to that in the
cell-free layer, correlated with the high margination propensity of microscale particles. This
work captures the particle size-dependent transition from Brownian dispersion to margination
using a unified 3D computational approach, and highlights the linkage between the radial distribution
of RESID and the margination propensity of particles in confined blood flows.
