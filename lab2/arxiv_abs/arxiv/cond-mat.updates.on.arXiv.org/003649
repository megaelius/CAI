Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion has been observed in several biological and soft matter systems,
but the underlying reasons behind the emergence of non-Gaussianity while simultaneously retaining
the linear nature of the mean square displacement remain speculative. Here, we perform a set of controlled
experiments that quantitatively explore the effect of spatial heterogeneities on the appearance
of non-Gaussianity in Fickian diffusion. We study the diffusion of fluorescent colloidal particles
in a matrix of micropillars having a range of structural configurations: from completely ordered
to completely random. Structural randomness and density are found to be the two most important factors
in making diffusion non-Gaussian. We show that non-Gaussianity emerges as a direct consequence
of two coupled factors. First, individual particle diffusivities become spatially dependent
in a heterogeneous environment. Second, the spatial distribution of the particles varies significantly
in heterogeneous environments, which further influences the diffusivity of a single particle.
As a result, we find that considerable non-Gaussianity appears even for weak disorder in the arrangement
of the micropillars. A simple simulation validates our hypothesis that non-Gaussian yet Fickian
diffusion in our system arises from the superstatistical behavior of the ensemble in a structurally
heterogeneous environment. The two mechanisms identified here are relevant for many systems of
crowded heterogeneous environments where non-Gaussian diffusion is frequently observed, for
example in biological systems, polymers, gels and porous materials.
