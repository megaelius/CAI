Toroidal order, given by a composite of electric and magnetic orders, manifests itself not only
in the peculiar magnetism but also in anomalous transport and magnetoelectric effect. We report
our theoretical results on the influence and stability of a toroidal order in metals on the basis
of a microscopic model. We consider an effective single-band Hubbard-type model with a site-dependent
antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, which is derived from a four-band tight-binding model including
the atomic spin-orbit coupling, off-site hybridizations between orbitals with different parities,
and odd-parity crystalline electric field. For this single-band model on a layered honeycomb lattice,
we investigate the electronic structure, magnetotransport, and magnetoelectric effect in the
toroidal ordered state with a vortex-like magnetic structure. The ferroic order of the microscopic
toroidal moments acts as an effective gauge field for electrons, which modulates the electronic
band structure with a shift of the band bottom in the momentum space. In addition, the site-dependent
antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling gives rise to highly anisotropic Hall responses. The most salient
feature is two different types of magnetoelectric responses: one is a magnetic order with net toroidal
magnetization induced by an electric current perpendicular to the planes, and the other is a uniform
transverse magnetization induced by an electric current within the planes. We examine the ground
state of the effective model by the mean-field approximation, and show that the toroidal order is
stabilized by strong electron correlations at low electron density. We also discuss the temperature
dependence of the magnetoelectric effects associated with spontaneous toroidal ordering. Implications
to experiments are also presented.
