The extension of the linear flavor-wave theory (LFWT) to fully antisymmetric irreducible representations
(irreps) of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ is presented in order to investigate the color order of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models in several two-dimensional geometries. The square, triangular
and honeycomb lattices are considered with $m$ fermionic particles per site. We present two different
methods: the first method is the generalization of the multiboson spin-wave approach to $\mathrm{SU}(N)$
which consists of associating a Schwinger boson to each state on a site. The second method adopts
the Read and Sachdev bosons which are an extension of the Schwinger bosons that introduces one boson
for each color and each line of the Young tableau. The two methods yield the same dispersing modes,
a good indication that they properly capture the semi-classical fluctuations, but the first one
leads to spurious flat modes of finite frequency not present in the second one. Both methods lead
to the same physical conclusions otherwise: long-range N\'eel-type order is likely for the square
lattice for $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ with two particles per site, but quantum fluctuations probably destroy
order for more than two particles per site, with $N=2m$. By contrast, quantum fluctuations always
lead to corrections larger than the classical order parameter for the tripartite triangular lattice
(with $N=3m$) or the bipartite honeycomb lattice (with $N=2m$) for more than one particle per site,
$m>1$, making the presence of color very unlikely except maybe for $m=2$ on the honeycomb lattice,
for which the correction is only marginally larger than the classical order parameter.
