We present a new framework to quantify the effect of hydrogen on dislocations using large scale three-dimensional
(3D) discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. In this model, the first order elastic interaction
energy associated with the hydrogen-induced volume change is accounted for. The three-dimensional
stress tensor induced by hydrogen concentration, which is in equilibrium with respect to the dislocation
stress field, is derived using the Eshelby inclusion model, while the hydrogen diffusion is treated
as a continuum process. This newly developed framework is utilized to quantify the effect of different
hydrogen concentrations on the dynamics of a glide dislocation in the absence of an applied stress
field as well as on the spacing between dislocations in an array of parallel edge dislocations. A
shielding effect is observed for materials having a large hydrogen diffusion coefficient, with
the shield effect leading to the homogenization of the shrinkage process leading to the glide loop
maintaining its circular shape, as well as resulting in a decrease in dislocation separation distances
in the array of parallel edge dislocations. On the other hand, for materials having a small hydrogen
diffusion coefficient, the high hydrogen concentrations around the edge characters of the dislocations
act to pin them. Higher stresses are required to be able to unpin the dislocations from the hydrogen
clouds surrounding them. Finally, this new framework can open the door for further large scale studies
on the effect of hydrogen on the different aspects of dislocation-mediated plasticity in metals.
With minor modifications of the current formulations, the framework can also be extended to account
for general inclusion-induced stress field in discrete dislocation dynamics simulations.
