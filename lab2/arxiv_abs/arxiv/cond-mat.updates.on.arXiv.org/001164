The paper presents a short overview of the theoretical, numerical and experimental works on the
critical behavior of a dilute polymer solution of long-flexible polymer chains confined in semi-infinite
space restricted by a surface or in a slit geometry of two parallel walls with different adsorbing
or repelling properties in respect for polymers as well as in a solution of mesoscopic spherical
colloidal particles of one sort or two different sorts. We discuss the application of the massive
field theory approach in a fixed space dimensions d=3 up to one loop order for such topics as:(a) the
investigation of the elastic properties of real polymer chain immersed in a good solvent and anchored
by one end to the surface and with other end being under tension of the external applied force;(b)
the calculation of the monomer density profiles, the depletion interaction potentials and the
depletion forces which arise in a dilute polymer solution immersed in confined geometries, like
slit of two parallel walls with different adsorbing or repelling properties in respect for polymers
or in the polymer-colloid mixtures with mesoscopic spherical colloidal particles of one sort or
two different sorts. The presented results give possibility better to understand the complexity
of physical effects arising from confinement and indicate about the interesting and nontrivial
behavior of linear polymer chains in confined geometries and are in good qualitative and quantitative
agreement with previous theoretical investigations, results of DFT, MC simulations and experimental
data based on the AFM and TIRM. Besides, the obtained results have important practical applications
for better understanding of the elastic properties of the individual macromolecules, networks,
gels and brush layers as well as indicate about possibility of application in production of new types
of nano- and micro-electromechanical devices.
