When translational symmetry is broken by bulk disorder, the topological nature of states in topological
crystalline systems may change depending on the type of disorder that is applied. In this work, we
characterize the phases of a one-dimensional (1D) chain with inversion and chiral symmetries,
where every disorder configuration is inversion-symmetric. By using a basis-independent formulation
for the inversion topological invariant, chiral winding number, and bulk polarization, we are
able to construct phase diagrams for these quantities when disorder is present. We show that unlike
the chiral winding number and bulk polarization, the inversion topological invariant can fluctuate
when the bulk spectral gap closes at strong disorder. Using the position-space renormalization
group, we are able to compare how the inversion topological invariant, chiral winding number and
bulk polarization behave at low energies in the strong disorder limit. We show that with inversion
symmetry-preserving disorder, the value of the inversion topological invariant is determined
by the inversion eigenvalues of the states at the inversion centers, while quantities such as the
chiral winding number and the bulk polarization still have contributions from every state throughout
the chain. We also show that it is possible to alter the value of the inversion topological invariant
in a clean system by occupying additional states at the inversion centers while keeping the bulk
polarization fixed. We discuss the implications of our results for topological crystalline phases
in higher-dimensional electronic systems, and in ultra-cold atomic systems.
