The climate is an excellent example of a forced, dissipative system dominated by nonlinear processes
and featuring non-trivial dynamics of a vast range of spatial and temporal scales. The understanding
of the climate's structural and multiscale properties is crucial for the provision of a unifying
picture of its dynamics an thd for the implementation of accurate and efficient numerical models.
In this interdisciplinary review, we are guided by our interest in exploring the nexus between climate
and concepts such as energy, entropy, symmetry, response, multiscale interactions, and its potential
relevance in terms of numerical modeling. We describe the Nambu reformulation of fluid dynamics,
and the possible potential of such theory for constructing numerical models of the geophysical
fluids. We focus on the very promising results on the statistical mechanics of quasi-equilibrium
geophysical flows, which are extremely useful in the direction of constructing a robust theory
of geophysical macro turbulence. The second half of the review is dedicated to the non-equilibrium
properties of the climate system. First, we describe some recent findings showing how to use basic
concepts of macroscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics for characterizing the energy and entropy
budgets of the climate systems, with the ensuing protocols for intercomparing climate models and
developing methods aimed at studying tipping points. These ideas can also create a link between
climate science and the growing sector of astrophysics devoted to the investigation of exoplanetary
atmospheres. We conclude by focusing on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which allows
for framing in a unified way problems as different as climate response to forcings of general nature,
the effect of altering the boundary conditions or the coupling between geophysical flows, and the
derivation of parametrizations for numerical models.
