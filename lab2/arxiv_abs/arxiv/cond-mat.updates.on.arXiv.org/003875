The origin of the metal-to-insulator transition in RNiO3 perovskites with trivalent 4f ion has
challenged the condensed matter research community for almost three decades. A drawback for progress
in this direction has been the lack of studies combining physical properties and accurate structural
data covering the full nickelate phase diagram. Here we focus on a small region close to the itinerant
limit (R = Pr, 1.5K < T < 300K), where we investigate the gap opening and the simultaneous emergence
of charge order in PrNiO3. We combine electric resistance, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements
with high resolution neutron and synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction data that, in contrast to
previous studies, we analyze in terms of symmetry-adapted distortion modes. Such analysis allows
to identify the contribution of the different modes to the global distortion in a broad temperature
range. Moreover, it shows that the structural changes at the MIT, traditionally described in terms
of the evolution of the interatomic distances and angles, appear as abrupt increases of all nonzero
mode amplitudes at TMIT = TN ~130K accompanied by the appearance of new modes below this temperature.
A further interesting observation is the existence of a nearly perfect linear correlation between
the amplitude of the breathing mode associated to the charge order and the staggered magnetization
below the MIT. Our data also uncover a previously unnoticed anomaly at T* ~60K (~0.4 x TMIT), clearly
visible in the electrical resistance, lattice parameters and some mode amplitudes. Since phase
coexistence is only observed in a small temperature region around TMIT (~10K), these observations
suggest the existence of a hidden symmetry in the insulating phase. We discuss some possible origins,
among them the theoretically predicted existence of polar distortions induced by the non-centrosymmetric
magnetic order.
