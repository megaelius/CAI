This paper reports experiments investigating the reaction of H$_{2}$ with uranium metal-oxide
bilayers. The bilayers consist of $\leq$ 100 nm of epitaxial $\alpha$-U (grown on a Nb buffer deposited
on sapphire) with a UO$_{2}$ overlayer of thicknesses of between 20 and 80 nm. The oxides were made
either by depositing via reactive magnetron sputtering, or allowing the uranium metal to oxidise
in air at room temperature. The bilayers were exposed to hydrogen, with sample temperatures between
80 and 200 C, and monitored via in-situ x-ray diffraction and complimentary experiments conducted
using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy - Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (STEM-EELS).
Small partial pressures of H$_{2}$ caused rapid consumption of the U metal and lead to changes in
the intensity and position of the diffraction peaks from both the UO$_{2}$ overlayers and the U metal.
There is an orientational dependence in the rate of U consumption. From changes in the lattice parameter
we deduce that hydrogen enters both the oxide and metal layers, contracting the oxide and expanding
the metal. The air-grown oxide overlayers appear to hinder the H$_{2}$-reaction up to a threshold
dose, but then on heating from 80 to 140 C the consumption is more rapid than for the as-deposited overlayers.
STEM-EELS establishes that the U-hydride layer lies at the oxide-metal interface, and that the
initial formation is at defects or grain boundaries, and involves the formation of amorphous and/or
nanocrystalline UH$_{3}$. This explains why no diffraction peaks from UH$_{3}$ are observed.
