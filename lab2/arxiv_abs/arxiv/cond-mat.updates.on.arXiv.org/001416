We investigate the deformation of soft spherical elastic capsules filled with a ferrofluid in external
uniform magnetic fields at fixed volume by a combination of numerical and analytical approaches.
We develop a numerical iterative solution strategy based on nonlinear elastic shape equations
to calculate the stretched capsule shape numerically and a coupled finite element and boundary
element method to solve the corresponding magnetostatic problem, and employ analytical linear
response theory, approximative energy minimization, and slender-body theory. The observed deformation
behavior is qualitatively similar to the deformation of ferrofluid droplets in uniform magnetic
fields. Homogeneous magnetic fields elongate the capsule, and a discontinuous shape transition
from a spheroidal shape to a conical shape takes place at a critical field strength. We investigate
how capsule elasticity modifies this hysteretic shape transition. We show that conical capsule
shapes are possible but involve diverging stretch factors at the tips, which gives rise to rupture
for real capsule materials. In a slender-body approximation we find that the critical susceptibility
above which conical shapes occur for ferrofluid capsules is the same as for droplets. At small fields
capsules remain spheroidal, and we characterize the deformation of spheroidal capsules both analytically
and numerically. Finally, we determine whether wrinkling of a spheroidal capsule occurs during
elongation in a magnetic field and how it modifies the stretching behavior. We find the nontrivial
dependence between the extent of the wrinkled region and capsule elongation. Our results can be
helpful in order to quantitatively determine capsule or ferrofluid material properties from magnetic
deformation experiments. All results also apply to elastic capsules filled with a dielectric liquid
in an external uniform electric field.
