This work analyzes the adiabatic decoherence of a many-body system coupled with a boson field. The
studied system is a partition of equivalent elements with strong interactions within each element
and no direct interaction between different elements, coupled with a common boson bath. This model
aims to feature the decoherence mechanism that arises when the only interplay between different
elements comes from the coupling of each element with a common environment. We restrict the analysis
to "local" observables compatible with the anisotropy of the observable system, that is, to operators
whose expectation values can be put in terms of a density operator reduced both over the environment
(as usual in the spin-boson model) and also reduced to a single, representative element of the partition.
Such condensed density matrix undergoes irreversible decoherence, which depends on an exponential
decay represented by a function $\Gamma(t)$ and on a phase factor $\Upsilon(t)$. The first function
depends on the temperature and the second does not, while both depend on the on the eigenvalues of
the system-environment Hamiltonian (eigenselectivity). As a novel result, we find that the phase
factor involves a macroscopic sum over all possible configurations of states in all the partition
elements (except the representative one). This reference to the entire system introduces a relevant
decay in the absolute value of the matrix elements. The result is applied to a system of spin 1/2 pairs
in the context of solid state NMR. We estimate the decoherence rates in terms of physical constants
of the model and find that it is mainly governed by the phase factor and its numerical value is remarkably
similar to the experiment.
