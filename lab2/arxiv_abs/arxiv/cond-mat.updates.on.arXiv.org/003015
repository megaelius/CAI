This paper presents a two-step Bayesian framework for the estimation of the intrinsic single crystal
elastic stiffness parameters from the measurements of spherical indentation stress-strain responses
in multiple individual grains of a polycrystalline sample, whose crystal lattice orientations
have been measured using electron back-scattered diffraction technique. The first step requires
the establishment of the functional dependence of the indentation elastic modulus given the lattice
orientation and the intrinsic single crystal elastic stiffness parameters. Previous efforts
for this step required a large database of computationally expensive finite element (FE) simulations
in order to establish this function with adequate accuracy. In this paper, it is shown that the introduction
of a Bayesian framework can greatly reduce the number of simulations necessary to establish this
function, while introducing practically useful measures of uncertainty which can guide the selection
of specific additional simulations that are expected to best improve the predictive accuracy of
the function. The second step involves a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the distribution
of possible values for the single crystal elastic stiffness parameters based on a given set of experimentally
measured elastic indentation moduli in individual grains of different lattice orientations.
This second step is accomplished by calibrating the available experimental data to the function
established in the first step. This novel framework is presented and demonstrated in this paper
for an as-cast cubic polycrystalline Fe-3% Si sample and a hexagonal polycrystalline commercially
pure (CP-Ti) titanium sample.
