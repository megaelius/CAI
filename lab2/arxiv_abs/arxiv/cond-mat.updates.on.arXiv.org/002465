Networks in the brain consist of different types of neurons. We here investigate the influence of
neuron diversity on the dynamical stability, phase space structure, and computational capabilities
of inhibitory spiking networks using mixtures of neurons with positive and negative dissipation.
We find that already a single neuron of a different type may qualitatively change the dynamics of
a neural network and that mixed networks can combine the computational capabilities of ones with
only a single neuron type. Our networks contain leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (positive dissipation)
as well as neurons with inverted sign of the leak current (negative dissipation). We first show that
such networks can exhibit a balanced state of irregular, asynchronous spiking activity, if the
neurons with negative dissipation are endowed with a voltage-dependent input cutoff, which may
be interpreted as a simple conductance-based implementation of their synapses. We compute the
voltage probability distributions and self-consistent firing rates for both types of neurons
for finite size spike impacts assuming that inputs are Poissonian. The balanced state exists in
a variety of neural network models and its dynamical properties such as chaoticity vary considerably.
Our models generalize networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons where the dynamics are non-chaotic
despite their irregularity. We show that switching the sign of the dissipation of a single neuron
renders the entire network dynamics unstable and chaotic as indicated by a positive largest Lyapunov
exponent. To further characterize the dynamics we consider the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents
and the related covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), which indicate the directions in which infinitesimal
perturbations grow or shrink with a rate given by the Lyapunov exponents. We find that for each ...
