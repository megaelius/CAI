In a recent high-quality experimental work on normal metal--superconducting nanowire junctions
arXiv:1807.01940 (2018), strong anisotropic suppression of induced superconductivity has been
observed in tunnel conductance measurements in the presence of applied magnetic field with variable
orientation. Following this finding, we investigate theoretically the dependence of tunnel conductance
on the direction of the Zeeman field in order to understand the operational mechanisms and to extract
effective system parameters. Second, motivated by a generic discrepancy between experiment and
theory, i.e., many in-gap and above-gap conductance features predicted by theory are barely observed
in experiments, we study several mechanisms possibly responsible for the suppression of the theoretically
predicted conductance features (e.g., length of the nanowire, self-energy effect due to the proximity
effect, finite temperature, finite dissipation, and multiband effect). One essential finding
in the current work is that only by a combined understanding of both suppression mechanisms can we
extract effective system parameters from the experimental data (e.g., the effective nanowire-superconductor
coupling, the effective Land\'e $g$ factor, and the chemical potential of the semiconducting nanowire).
In addition, we consider topologically trivial Andreev bound states in hybrid nanowires in the
presence of potential inhomogeneities, such as external quantum dots or potential inhomogeneities
inside the nanowire. We compare the anisotropic, field-dependent features induced by these nontopological
Andreev bound states with the corresponding features produced by topological Majorana zero modes
in pristine nanostructures, so that we can provide guidance to differentiate between the topologically
trivial and nontrivial cases.
