Measurements of 1H NMR and $\mu^{+}$SR have been performed as a function of temperature and external
magnetic field on two isostructural lanthanide complexes, Er(trensal) and Dy(trensal) featuring
crystallographic trigonal symmetry. The two complexes show different type of magnetic anisotropy
in their ground state, namely easy axis for Er(trensal) and easy plane for Dy(trensal). Despite
this slow relaxation of the magnetization has been reported in applied field for both systems. The
broadening of the proton NMR line and the temperature and field dependence of the peaks observed
in the proton and muon relaxation rate are found to be different from the behavior observed up to now
in all Molecular Nanomagnets and indicate an unconventional spin dynamics. Indeed, both the nuclear
1/T1 and muon lambda spin-lattice relaxation rate exhibit a peak, associated to the slowing down
of the dynamics, which does not follow the BPP scaling of the amplitude and position in temperature
and cannot be explained in terms of a single dominant correlation time slowing down at low temperature.
We suggest that the NMR line broadening observed at T >50 K could be due to a slow thermalization of
the excited states. At T<50 K the two complexes are in a frozen spin state and the spin dynamics is dominated
by a slow relaxation in the doublet ground state involving direct energy exchange between protons
(muons) energy levels and the fine structure of the molecule magnetic ground state. This second
type of spin dynamics should explain the peaks observed in the proton (muons) relaxation rate in
the 10-20 K temperature range and their field dependence. Finally, in the T<5 K region both nuclear
(muons) relaxation and alternated current (ac) susceptibility indicate that the magnetization
dynamics of these complexes becomes almost temperature independent, which is a signature of a quantum
mechanical relaxation mechanism.
