The presence of wrinkles in Graphene Nanoribbons (GNR) and other two-dimensional (2D) materials
significantly alter their mechanical, electronic, optical properties, which can be either beneficial
or detrimental. Experimentally, it has been observed that during the commonly used growth process
of GNR, water molecules, sourced from ambient humidity, can be diffused in between GNR and the substrate.
The water diffusion causes wrinkle formation in GNR, which influences its properties. Furthermore,
the diffused water eventually dries, creating the alteration not only in the geometry of Wrinkled
Graphene Nanoribbons (WGNR) but also its features. Computational analysis of these phenomena
can provide an atomistic-level understanding of the phenomena. Therefore, in this work, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to model the water diffusion and evaporation in between
GNR and its substrate, and their effect on wrinkle formation and dynamics. Additionally, Density
Functional Theory (DFT)-based analysis is used to characterize the difference in the electronic
structure of WGNR caused by the change in wrinkle geometry. Our study reveals that the initially
distributed wrinkles tend to coalesce to form a localized wrinkle whose configuration depends
on the initial wrinkle geometry and the amount of diffused water. The wrinkle configuration changes
upon drying, while it remains static until the complete drying. The movement of the localized wrinkle
is the combination of three fundamental modes - bending, buckling, and sliding. The stress analysis
reveals that the maximum stress is at the base of the wrinkle, and its magnitude is always below the
plasticity limit. The DFT results provide insight into the potential of using the wrinkles to control
the direction of electron flow for the applications in flexible electronics.
