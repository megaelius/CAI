Atherosclerotic disease develops when there is endothelial dysfunction, making low density lipoproteins
(LDL) which are cholesterol carriers traveling in the blood, very likely to penetrate the endothelium
layer triggering the formation of the atheromatous plaque and leading to the obstruction of blood
vessels. For some time now, devices called stents have been used to re-open the light of the plugged
artery, allowing the restoration of blood flow. However, this treatment has disadvantages like
developing intra-stent restenosis and progression of the atherosclerosis, clogging the blood
vessel again. For these reasons it is necessary to develop new materials and strategies focused
on the prevention and correction of this pathology and its subsequent complications. In the present
work, a reduction and in situ nitrogen doping method in graphene oxide (N-rGO) was studied. By means
of XPS a 9.57% at of nitrogen doping was demonstrated and was found that the pyrrole type nitrogen
is predominant. Due to nitrogen doping and pyrrolic sites, the N-rGO surface reached high levels
of negative electric charge, which was verified by Electrostatic Force Microscopy (EFM) and wettability
tests between the LDL at different oxidation levels and the synthesized N-rGO; contact angles between
95.7{\deg} and 130.4{\deg} were obtained which indicates repulsion between both materials. The
N-rGO was also characterized by SEM and TEM where a wrinkled morphology typical of this type of material
was observed and the hexagonal atomic arrangement of GO is distinguished. Finally, cell viability
tests using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were carried
out on human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) to analyze the cellular response at different
concentrations of N-rGO, obtaining favorable behavior up to concentrations of 100 ({\mu}g/mL).
