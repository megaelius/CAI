In the presence of axial magnetic fields that can be realized in deliberately buckled monolayer
graphene, quasi-relativistic Dirac fermions may find themselves in a variety of broken symmetry
phases even for weak interactions. Through a detailed Hartree self-consistent numerical calculation
in finite strained graphene with cylindrical and open boundaries we establish the possibility
of realizing a charge-density-wave order for the spinless fermions in the presence of weak nearest-neighbor
repulsion. Such an instability gives rise to a staggered pattern of average fermionic density between
bulk and boundary of the system as well as among two sublattices of graphene, due to the spatial separation
of the zero energy states localized on opposite sublattices. Although with fermions spin restored,
an unconventional magnetic order driven by the onsite repulsion, possibly leads to the dominant
instability at the Dirac point, the proposed charge-density-wave order can nevertheless be realized
at finite doping, which is always accompanied by a finite ferromagnetic moment. Additionally,
the charge-density-wave phase supports a quantized charge or spin Hall conductivity when its formation
away from the Dirac point is further preceded by the appearance of topological anomalous or spin
Hall insulator respectively. The topological orders in strained graphene can be supported by weak
second neighbor repulsion, for example. Therefore, depending on the relative strength of various
short-range components of the Coulomb interaction a number of broken symmetry phases can be realized
within the zero energy manifold in strained graphene.
