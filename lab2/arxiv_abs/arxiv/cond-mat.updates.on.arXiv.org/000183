A subtle relation between Quantum Hall physics and the phenomenon of pairing is unveiled. By use
of second quantization, we establish a connection between (i) a broad class of rotationally symmetric
two-body interactions within the lowest Landau level and (ii) integrable hyperbolic Richardson-Gaudin
type Hamiltonians that arise in (p_x+ip_y) superconductivity. Specifically, we show that general
Haldane pseudopotentials (and their sums) can be expressed as a sum of repulsive non-commuting
(p_x+ip_y)-type pairing Hamiltonians. The determination of the spectrum and individual null
spaces of each of these non-commuting Richardson-Gaudin type Hamiltonians is non-trivial yet
is Bethe Ansatz solvable. We prove separability of arbitrary Haldane pseudopotentials, providing
explicit expressions for their second quantized forms, and further show by explicit construction
how to exploit the topological equivalence between different geometries (disk, cylinder, and
sphere) sharing the same topological genus number, in the second quantized formalism, through
similarity transformations. As an application of the second quantized approach, we establish
a "squeezing principle" that applies to the zero modes of a general class of Hamiltonians, which
includes but is not limited to Haldane pseudopotentials. We also show how one may establish (bounds
on) "incompressible filling factors" for those Hamiltonians. By invoking properties of symmetric
polynomials, we provide explicit second quantized quasi-hole generators; the generators that
we find directly relate to bosonic chiral edge modes and further make aspects of dimensional reduction
in the Quantum Hall systems precise.
