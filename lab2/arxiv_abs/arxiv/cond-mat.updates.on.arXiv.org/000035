We further investigate a class of time-reversal-invariant two-band s-wave topological superconductors
introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 036803 (2012). We show how, in the presence of time-reversal
symmetry, Z_2 invariants that distinguish between trivial and non-trivial quantum phases can
be constructed by considering only one of the Kramers' sectors in which the Hamiltonian decouples
into. We find that the main features identified in our original 2D setting remain qualitatively
unchanged in 1D and 3D, with non-trivial topological superconducting phases supporting an odd
number of Kramers' pairs of helical Majorana modes on each boundary, as long as the required $\pi$
phase difference between gaps is maintained. We also analyze the consequences of time-reversal
symmetry-breaking either due to the presence of an applied or impurity magnetic field or to a deviation
from the intended phase matching between the superconducting gaps. We demonstrate how the relevant
notion of topological invariance must be modified when time-reversal symmetry is broken, and how
both the persistence of gapless Majorana modes and their robustness properties depend in general
upon the way in which the original Hamiltonian is perturbed. Interestingly, a topological quantum
phase transition between helical and chiral superconducting phases can be induced by suitably
tuning a Zeeman field in conjunction with a phase mismatch between the gaps. Recent experiments
in doped semiconducting crystals, of potential relevance to the proposed model, and possible candidate
material realizations in superconductors with $s_\pm$ pairing symmetry are discussed.
