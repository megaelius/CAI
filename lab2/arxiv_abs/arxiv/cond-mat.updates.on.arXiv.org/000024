The study of individual quantum systems in solids, for use as quantum bits (qubits) and probes of
decoherence, requires protocols for their initialization, unitary manipulation, and readout.
In many solid-state quantum systems, these operations rely on disparate techniques that can vary
widely depending on the particular qubit structure. One such qubit, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
center spin in diamond, can be initialized and read out through its special spin selective intersystem
crossing, while microwave electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques provide unitary spin rotations.
Instead, we demonstrate an alternative, fully optical approach to these control protocols in an
NV center that does not rely on its intersystem crossing. By tuning an NV center to an excited-state
spin anticrossing at cryogenic temperatures, we use coherent population trapping and stimulated
Raman techniques to realize initialization, readout, and unitary manipulation of a single spin.
Each of these techniques can be directly performed along any arbitrarily-chosen quantum basis,
removing the need for extra control steps to map the spin to and from a preferred basis. Combining
these protocols, we perform measurements of the NV center's spin coherence, a demonstration of
this full optical control. Consisting solely of optical pulses, these techniques enable control
within a smaller footprint and within photonic networks. Likewise, this approach obviates the
need for both ESR manipulation and spin addressability through the intersystem crossing. This
method could therefore be applied to a wide range of potential solid-state qubits, including those
which currently lack a means to be addressed.
