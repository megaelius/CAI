The delicate balance between H-bonding and van der Waals interactions determine the stability,structure
and chirality of many molecular and supramolecular aggregates weakly adsorbed on solid surfaces.Yet
the inherent complexity of these systems makes their experimental study at the molecular level
very challenging.Small alcohols adsorbed on metal surfaces have become a useful model system to
gain fundamental insight into the interplay of such molecule-surface and molecule-molecule interactions.Here,
through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory,we compare
and contrast the adsorption and self-assembly of a range of small alcohols from methanol to butanol
on Au(111).We find that that longer chained alcohols prefer to form zigzag chains held together
by extended H-bonded networks between adjacent molecules.When alcohols bind to a metal surface
datively via one of the two lone electron pairs of the oxygen atom they become chiral.Therefore,the
chain structures are formed by a H-bonded network between adjacent molecules with alternating
adsorbed chirality.These chain structures accommodate longer alkyl tails through larger unit
cells, while the position of the hydroxyl group within the alcohol molecule can produce denser unit
cells that maximize intermolecular interactions.Interestingly,when intrinsic chirality is
introduced into the molecule as in the case of 2-butanol the assembly changes completely and square
packing structures with chiral pockets are observed. This is rationalized by the fact that the intrinsic
chirality of the molecule directs the chirality of the adsorbed hydroxyl group meaning that heterochiral
chain structures cannot form.Overall this study provides a general framework for understanding
the effect of simple alcohol molecular adstructures on H-bonded aggregates and paves the way for
rationalizing 2D chiral supramolecular assembly.
