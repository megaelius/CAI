Two dimensional semiconductors provide an ideal platform for exploration of linear exciton and
polariton physics, primarily due to large exciton binding energy and strong light-matter coupling.
These features, however, generically imply reduced exciton-exciton interactions, hindering
the realisation of active optical devices such as lasers or parametric oscillators. Here, we show
that electrical injection of itinerant electrons into monolayer molybdenum diselenide allows
us to overcome this limitation: dynamical screening of exciton-polaritons by electrons leads
to the formation of new quasi-particles termed polaron-polaritons that exhibit unexpectedly
strong interactions as well as optical amplification by Bose-enhanced polaron-electron scattering.
To measure the nonlinear optical response, we carry out time-resolved pump-probe measurements
and observe polaron-polariton interaction enhancement by a factor of 50 ($0.5 \mu$eV $\mu$m$^2$)
as compared to exciton-polaritons. Concurrently, we measure a spectrally integrated transmission
gain of the probe field of $\gtrsim 2$ stemming from stimulated scattering of polaron-polaritons.
We show theoretically that the non-equilibrium nature of optically excited quasiparticles favours
a previously unexplored interaction mechanism stemming from a phase-space filling in the screening
cloud, which provides an accurate explanation of the strong repulsive interactions observed experimentally.
Our findings show that itinerant electron-exciton interactions provide an invaluable tool for
electronic manipulation of optical properties, demonstrate a new mechanism for dramatically
enhancing polariton-polariton interactions, and pave the way for realisation of nonequilibrium
polariton condensates.
