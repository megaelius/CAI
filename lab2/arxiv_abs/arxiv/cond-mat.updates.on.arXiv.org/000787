Re-based double perovskites (DPs) exhibit a complex interplay of structural and metal-insulator
transitions. Here we systematically study the ground state electronic and structural properties
for a family of Re-based DPs $A_2B$ReO$_6$ ($A$=Sr, Ca and $B$=Cr, Fe), which are related by a common
low energy Hamiltonian, using density functional theory + $U$ calculations. We show that the on-site
interaction $U$ of Re induces orbital ordering (denoted COO), with each Re site having an occupied
$d_{xy}$ orbital and a C-type alternation among $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$, resulting in an insulating state
consistent with experimentally determined insulators Sr$_2$CrReO$_6$, Ca$_2$CrReO$_6$, and
Ca$_2$FeReO$_6$. The threshold value of $U_{Re}$ for orbital ordering is reduced by inducing $E_g$
octahedral distortions of the same C-type wavelength (denoted COD), which serves as a structural
signature of the orbital ordering; octahedral tilting also reduces the threshold. The COO, and
the concomitant COD, are a spontaneously broken symmetry for the Sr based materials (i.e. $a^0a^0c^-$
tilt pattern), while not for the Ca based systems (i.e. $a^-a^-b^+$ tilt pattern). Spin-orbit coupling
does not qualitatively change the physics of the COO/COD, but can induce relevant quantitative
changes. We prove that a single set of $U_{Cr}$,$U_{Fe}$,$U_{Re}$ capture the experimentally
observed metallic state in Sr$_2$FeReO$_6$ and insulating states in the other three systems. We
predict that the COO is the origin of the insulating state in Sr$_2$CrReO$_6$, and that the concomitant
COD may be experimentally observed at sufficiently low temperatures (ie. space group P$4_2/m$).
Additionally, given our prescribed values of $U$, we show that the COO induced insulating state
in Ca$_2$CrReO$_6$ will survive even if the COD amplitude is suppressed (e.g. due to thermal fluctuations).
