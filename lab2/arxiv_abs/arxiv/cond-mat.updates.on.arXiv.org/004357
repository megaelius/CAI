We investigate the Joule expansion of nonintegrable quantum systems that contain bosons or spinless
fermions in one-dimensional lattices. A barrier initially confines the particles to be in half
of the system in a thermal state described by the canonical ensemble and is removed at time $t = 0$.
We investigate the properties of the time-evolved density matrix, the diagonal ensemble density
matrix and the corresponding canonical ensemble density matrix with an effective temperature
determined by the total energy conservation using exact diagonalization. The weights for the diagonal
ensemble and the canonical ensemble match well for high initial temperatures that correspond to
negative effective final temperatures after the expansion. At long times after the barrier is removed,
the time-evolved R\'enyi entropy of subsystems bigger than half can equilibrate to the thermal
entropy with exponentially small fluctuations. The time-evolved reduced density matrix at long
times can be approximated by a thermal density matrix for small subsystems. Few-body observables,
like the momentum distribution function, can be approximated by a thermal expectation of the canonical
ensemble with strongly suppressed fluctuations. The negative effective temperatures for finite
systems go to nonnegative temperatures in the thermodynamic limit for bosons, but is a true thermodynamic
effect for fermions, which is confirmed by finite temperature density matrix renormalization
group calculations. We propose the Joule expansion as a way to dynamically create negative temperature
states for fermion systems with repulsive interactions.
