In recent years, the role of predictive computational modeling has become a cornerstone for the
study of fundamental electronic, optical, and thermal properties in complex forms of condensed
matter, including Dirac and topological materials. The simulation of quantum transport in realistic
materials calls for the development of linear scaling, or order-$N$, numerical methods, which
then become enabling tools for guiding experimental research and for supporting the interpretation
of measurements. In this review, we describe and compare different order-$N$ computational methods
that have been developed during the past twenty years, and which have been intensively used to explore
quantum transport phenomena. We place particular focus on the electrical conductivities derived
within the Kubo-Greenwood and Kubo-Streda formalisms, and illustrate the capabilities of these
methods to tackle the quasi-ballistic, diffusive, and localization regimes of quantum transport.
The fundamental issue of computational cost versus accuracy of various proposed numerical schemes
is also addressed. We then extend the review to the study of spin dynamics and topological transport,
for which efficient approaches of inspecting charge, spin, and valley Hall conductivities are
outlined. The supremacy of time propagation methods is demonstrated for the calculation of the
dissipative conductivity, while implementations fully based on polynomial expansions are found
to perform better in the presence of topological gaps. The usefulness of these methods is illustrated
by various examples of transport in disordered Dirac-based materials, such as polycrystalline
and defected graphene models, carbon nanotubes as well as organic materials.
