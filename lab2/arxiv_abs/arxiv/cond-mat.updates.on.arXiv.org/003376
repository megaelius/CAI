Graphene thermionic electron emission across high-interface-barrier involves energetic electrons
residing far away from the Dirac point where the Dirac cone approximation of the band structure breaks
down. Here we construct a full-band model beyond the simple Dirac cone approximation for the thermionic
injection of high-energy electrons in graphene. We show that the thermionic emission model based
on the Dirac cone approximation is valid only in the graphene/semiconductor Schottky interface
operating near room temperature, but breaks down in the cases involving high-energy electrons,
such as graphene/vacuum interface or heterojunction in the presence of photon absorption, where
the full-band model is required to account for the band structure nonlinearity at high electron
energy. We identify a critical barrier height, $\Phi_B^{(\text{c})} \approx 3.5$ eV, beyond which
the Dirac cone approximation crosses over from underestimation to overestimation. In the high-temperature
thermionic emission regime at graphene/vacuum interface, the Dirac cone approximation severely
overestimates the electrical and heat current densities by more than 50\% compared to the more accurate
full-band model. The large discrepancies between the two models are demonstrated using a graphene-based
thermionic cooler. These findings reveal the fallacy of Dirac cone approximation in the thermionic
injection of high-energy electrons in graphene. The full-band model developed here can be readily
generalized to other 2D materials, and shall provide an improved theoretical avenue for the accurate
analysis, modeling and design of graphene-based thermionic energy devices.
