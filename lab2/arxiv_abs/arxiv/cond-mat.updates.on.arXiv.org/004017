We introduce a numerical method that enables efficient modelling of light scattering by large,
disordered ensembles of non-spherical particles incorporated in stratified media, including
when the particles are in close vicinity to each other, to planar interfaces and/or to localized
light sources. The method consists in finding a small set of fictitious polarizable elements --
or numerical dipoles -- that quantitatively reproduces the field scattered by an individual particle
for any excitation and at an arbitrary distance from the particle surface. The set of numerical dipoles
is described by a global polarizability matrix that is determined numerically by solving an inverse
problem relying on fullwave simulations. The latter are classical and may be performed with any
Maxwell's equations solver. Spatial non-locality is an important feature of the numerical dipoles
set, providing additional degrees of freedom compared to classical coupled dipoles to reconstruct
complex scattered fields. Once the polarizability matrix describing scattering by an individual
particle is determined, the multiple scattering problem by ensembles of such particles in stratified
media can be solved using a Green tensor formalism and only few numerical dipoles, thereby with a
low physical memory usage, even for dense systems in close vicinity to interfaces. The performance
of the method is studied with the example of large high-aspect-ratio high-index dielectric cylinders.
The method is easy to implement and may offer new possibilities for the study of complex nanostructured
surfaces, which are becoming widespread in emerging photonic technologies.
