We explore the use of the stochastic resolution-of-the-identity (sRI) with the phaseless auxiliary-field
quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) method. sRI is combined with four existing local energy evaluation
strategies in ph-AFQMC, namely (1) the half-rotated electron repulsion integral tensor (HR),
(2) Cholesky decomposition (CD), (3) tensor hypercontraction (THC), or (4) low-rank factorization
(LR). We demonstrate that HR-sRI achieves no scaling reduction, CD-sRI scales as $\mathcal O(N^3)$,
and THC-sRI and LR-sRI scale as $\mathcal O(N^2)$, albeit with a potentially large prefactor. Furthermore,
the walker-specific extra memory requirement in CD is reduced from $\mathcal O(N^3)$ to $\mathcal
O(N^2)$ with sRI, while sRI-based THC and LR algorithms lead to a reduction from $\mathcal O(N^2)$
extra memory to $\mathcal O(N)$. Based on numerical results for one-dimensional hydrogen chains
and water clusters, we demonstrated that, along with the use of a variance reduction technique,
CD-sRI achieves cubic-scaling {\it without overhead}. In particular, we find for the systems studied
the observed scaling of standard CD is $\mathcal O(N^{3-4})$ while for CD-sRI it is reduced to $\mathcal
O(N^{2-3})$. Once a memory bottleneck is reached, we expect THC-sRI and LR-sRI to be preferred methods
due to their quadratic-scaling memory requirements and their quadratic-scaling of the local energy
evaluation (with a potentially large prefactor). The theoretical framework developed here should
facilitate large-scale ph-AFQMC applications that were previously difficult or impossible to
carry out with standard computational resources.
