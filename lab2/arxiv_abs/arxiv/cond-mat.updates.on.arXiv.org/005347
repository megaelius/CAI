One branch of the La-214 family of cuprate superconductors, La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 (Nd-LSCO), has
been of significant and sustained interest, in large part because it displays the full complexity
of the phase diagram for canonical hole-doped, high Tc superconductivity, while also displaying
relatively low superconducting critical temperatures. The low superconducting Tc's imply that
experimentally accessible magnetic fields can suppress the superconductivity to zero temperature.
In particular, this has enabled various transport and thermodynamic studies of the T = 0 ground state
in Nd-LSCO, free of superconductivity, across the critical doping p* = 0.23 where the pseudogap
phase ends. The strong dependence of its superconducting properties on its crystal symmetry has
itself motivated careful studies of the Nd-LSCO structural phase diagram. This paper provides
a systematic study and summary of the materials preparation and characterization of both single
crystal and polycrystalline samples of Nd-LSCO. Single-phase polycrystalline samples with x
spanning the range from 0.01 to 0.40 have been synthesized, and large single crystals of Nd-LSCO
for select x across the region (0.07, 0.12, 0.17, 0.19, 0.225, 0.24, and 0.26) were grown by the optical
floating zone method. Systematic neutron and X-ray diffraction studies on these samples were performed
at both low and room temperatures, 10 K and 300 K, respectively. These studies allowed us to follow
the various structural phase transitions and propose an updated structural phase diagram for Nd-LSCO.
In particular, we found that the low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase ends at a critical doping
pLTT = 0.255(5), clearly separated from p*.
