Recent theoretical and experimental advances have shed light on the existence of so-called `perfectly
transmitting' wavefronts with transmission coefficients close to 1 in strongly backscattering
random media. These perfectly transmitting eigen-wavefronts can be synthesized by spatial amplitude
and phase modulation. Here, we consider the problem of transmission enhancement using phase-only
modulated wavefronts. We develop physically realizable iterative and non-iterative algorithms
for increasing the transmission through such random media using backscatter analysis. We theoretically
show that, despite the phase-only modulation constraint, the non-iterative algorithms will achieve
at least about 25$\pi$% or about 78.5% transmission assuming there is at least one perfectly transmitting
eigen-wavefront and that the singular vectors of the transmission matrix obey a maximum entropy
principle so that they are isotropically random. We numerically analyze the limits of phase-only
modulated transmission in 2-D with fully spectrally accurate simulators and provide rigorous
numerical evidence confirming our theoretical prediction in random media with periodic boundary
conditions that is composed of hundreds of thousands of non-absorbing scatterers. We show via numerical
simulations that the iterative algorithms we have developed converge rapidly, yielding highly
transmitting wavefronts using relatively few measurements of the backscatter field. Specifically,
the best performing iterative algorithm yields approx 70% transmission using just 15-20 measurements
in the regime where the non-iterative algorithms yield approximately 78.5% transmission but require
measuring the entire modal reflection matrix.
