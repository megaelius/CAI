We present a numerical study on the rheology of semi-dilute and concentrated filament suspensions
of different bending stiffness and Reynolds number, with the immersed boundary method used to couple
the fluid and solid. The filaments are considered as one-dimensional inextensible slender bodies
with fixed aspect ratio, obeying the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. To understand the global suspension
behavior we relate it to the filament microstructure, deformation and elastic energy and examine
the stress budget to quantify the effect of the elastic contribution. At fixed volume fraction,
the viscosity of the suspension reduces when decreasing the bending rigidity and grows when increasing
the Reynolds number. The change in the relative viscosity is stronger at finite inertia, although
still in the laminar flow regime as considered here. Moreover, we find the first normal stress difference
to be positive as in polymeric fluids, and to increase with the Reynolds number; its value has a peak
for an intermediate value of the filament bending stiffness. The peak value is found to be proportional
to the Reynolds number, moving towards more rigid suspensions at larger inertia. Moreover, the
viscosity increases when increasing the filament volume fraction, and the rate of increase of the
filament stress with the bending rigidity is stronger at higher Reynolds numbers and reduces with
the volume fraction. We show that this behaviour is associated with the formation of a more ordered
structure in the flow, where filaments tend to be more aligned and move as a compact aggregate, thus
reducing the filament-filament interactions despite their volume fraction increases.
