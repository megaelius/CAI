The hyperpolarisation of nuclear spins within target molecules is a critical and complex challenge
in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Hyperpolarisation
offers enormous gains in signal and spatial resolution which may ultimately lead to the development
of molecular MRI and NMR. At present, techniques used to polarise nuclear spins generally require
low temperatures and/or high magnetic fields, radio-frequency control fields, or the introduction
of catalysts or free-radical mediators. The emergence of room temperature solid-state spin qubits
has opened exciting new pathways to circumvent these requirements to achieve direct nuclear spin
hyperpolarisation using quantum control. Employing a novel cross-relaxation induced polarisation
(CRIP) protocol using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, we demonstrate the first
external nuclear spin hyperpolarisation achieved by a quantum probe, in this case of $^1$H molecular
spins in poly(methyl methacrylate). In doing so, we show that a single qubit is capable of increasing
the thermal polarisation of $\sim 10^6$ nuclear spins by six orders of magnitude, equivalent to
an applied magnetic field of $10^5$\,T. The technique can also be tuned to multiple spin species,
which we demonstrate using both \C{13} and $^1$H nuclear spin ensembles. Our results are analysed
and interpreted via a detailed theoretical treatment, which is also used to describe how the system
can be scaled up to a universal quantum hyperpolarisation platform for the production of macroscopic
quantities of contrast agents at high polarisation levels for clinical applications. These results
represent a new paradigm for nuclear spin hyperpolarisation for molecular imaging and spectroscopy,
and beyond into areas such as materials science and quantum information processing.
