We present the first theoretical calculation of the pressure-temperature-field phase diagram
for the vortex phases of rotating superfluid $^3$He-B. Based on a strong-coupling extension of
the Ginzburg-Landau theory that accounts for the relative stability of the bulk A and B phases of
$^3$He at all pressures, we report calculations for the internal structure and free energies of
distinct broken-symmetry vortices in rotating superfluid $^3$He-B. Theoretical results for
the equilibrium vortex phase diagram in zero field and an external field of $H=284\,\mbox{G}$ parallel
to the rotation axis, $\vec{H}\parallel\vec{\Omega}$, are reported, as well as the supercooling
transition line, $T^{*}_ {v} (p,H)$. In zero field the vortex phases of $^3$He-B are separated by
a first-order phase transition line $T_ {v} (p)$ that terminates on the bulk critical line $T_{c}(p)$
at a triple point. The low-pressure, low-temperature phase is characterized by an array of singly-quantized
vortices that spontaneously breaks axial rotation symmetry, exhibits anisotropic vortex currents
and an axial current anomaly (D-core phase). The high-pressure, high-temperature phase is characterized
by vortices with both bulk A phase and $\beta$ phase in their cores (A-core phase). We show that this
phase is metastable and supercools down to a minimum temperature, $T^{*}_ {v} (p,H)$, below which
it is globally unstable to an array of D-core vortices. For $H\gtrsim 60\,\mbox{G}$ external magnetic
fields aligned along the axis of rotation increase the region of stability of the A-core phase of
rotating $^3$He-B, opening a window of stability down to low pressures. These results are compared
with the experimentally reported phase transitions in rotating $^3$He-B.
