Formation of large volume fractions of Mn-Ni-Si precipitates (MNSPs) causes excess irradiation
embrittlement of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels at high, extended-life fluences. Thus,
a new and unique, semi-empirical cluster dynamics model was developed to study the evolution of
MNSPs in low- Cu RPV steels. The model is based on CALPHAD thermodynamics and radiation enhanced
diffusion ki- netics. The thermodynamics dictates the compositional and temperature dependence
of the free energy reductions that drive precipitation. The model treats both homogeneous and heterogeneous
nucleation, where the latter occurs on cascade damage, like dislocation loops. The model has only
four adjustable parameters that were fit to an atom probe tomography (APT) database. The model predictions
are in semi-quantitative agreement with systematic Mn, Ni and Si composition variations in alloys
character- ized by APT, including a sensitivity to local tip-to-tip variations even in the same
steel. The model predicts that heterogeneous nucleation plays a critical role in MNSP formation
in lower alloy Ni contents. Single variable assessments of compositional effects show that Ni plays
a dominant role, while even small variations in irradiation temperature can have a large effect
on theMNSP evolution. Within typical RPV steel ranges, Mn and Si have smaller effects. The delayed
but then rapid growth of MNSPs to large volume fractions at high fluence is well predicted by the model.
For purposes of illustration, the effect of MNSPs on transition temperature shifts are presented
based on well-established microstructure-prop- erty and property-property models.
