In recent years, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered great interest as topological
materials -- monolayers of centrosymmetric $\beta$-phase TMDs have been identified as 2D topological
insulators (TIs), and bulk crystals of noncentrosymmetric $\gamma$-phase MoTe$_2$ and WTe$_2$
have been identified as type-II Weyl semimetals. However, ARPES and STM probes of these TMDs have
revealed huge, "arc-like" surface states that overwhelm, and are sometimes mistaken for, the much
smaller topological surface Fermi arcs of bulk type-II Weyl points. In this letter, we use first-principles
calculations and (nested) Wilson loops to analyze the bulk and surface electronic structure of
both $\beta$- and $\gamma$-MoTe$_2$, finding that $\beta$-MoTe$_2$ ($\gamma$-MoTe$_2$ gapped
with symmetry-preserving distortion) is an inversion-symmetry-indicated $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$-nontrivial
($noncentrosymmetric, non$-$symmetry$-$indicated$) higher-order TI (HOTI) driven by double
band inversion. Both structural phases of MoTe$_2$ exhibit the same surface features as WTe$_2$,
revealing that the large Fermi arcs are in fact not topologically trivial, but are rather the characteristic
split and gapped fourfold surface states of a HOTI. We also show that, when the effects of SOC are neglected,
$\beta$-MoTe$_2$ is a nodal-line semimetal with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-nontrivial monopole nodal
lines (MNLSM). This finding confirms that MNLSMs driven by double band inversion are the weak-SOC
limit of HOTIs, implying that MNLSMs are higher-order topological $semimetals$ with flat-band-like
hinge states, which we find to originate from the corner modes of 2D "fragile" TIs.
