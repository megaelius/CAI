Motivated by recent experiments and density functional theory calculations on choloalite PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$,
which possesses a Cu-based three-dimensional hyperkagome lattice, we propose and study a $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a hyperkagome lattice. In the classical limit, possible
ground states are analyzed by two triangle rules, i.e., the "hyperkagome triangle rule" and the
"isolated triangle rule," and classical Monte Carlo simulations are exploited to identify possible
classical magnetic ordering and explore the phase diagram. In the quantum regime, Schwinger boson
theory is applied to study possible quantum spin liquid states and long-range magnetically ordered
states on an equal footing. These quantum states with bosonic partons are classified and analyzed
by using projective symmetry groups (PSGs). It is found that there are only four types of algebraic
PSGs allowed by the space group $P4_{1}32$ on a hyperkagome lattice. Moreover, there are only two
types of PSGs that are compatible with the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model. These two types
of $Z_2$ bosonic states are distinguished by the gauge-invariant flux on the elementary ten-site
loops on the hyperkagome network, called zero-flux state and $\pi$-flux state respectively. Both
the zero-flux state and the $\pi$-flux state are able to give rise to quantum spin liquid states as
well as magnetically ordered states, and the zero-flux states and the $\pi$-flux states can be distinguished
by the lower and upper edges of the spectral function $S(\bm{q},\omega)$, which can be measured
by inelastic neutron scattering experiments.
