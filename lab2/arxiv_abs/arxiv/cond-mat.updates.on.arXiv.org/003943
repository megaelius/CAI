Nanoporous media exhibit structures significantly smaller than the wavelengths of visible light
and can thus act as photonic metamaterials. Their optical functionality is not determined by the
properties of the base materials, but rather by tailored, multiscale structures, in terms of precise
pore shape, geometry, and orientation. Embedding liquid crystals in pore space provides additional
opportunities to control light-matter interactions at the single-pore, meta-atomic scale. Here,
we present temperature-dependent 3D reciprocal space mapping using synchrotron-based X-ray
diffraction in combination with high-resolution birefringence experiments on disk-like mesogens
(HAT6) imbibed in self-ordered arrays of parallel cylindrical pores 17 to 160 nm across in monolithic
anodic aluminium oxide (AAO). In agreement with Monte Carlo computer simulations we observe a remarkably
rich self-assembly behaviour, unknown from the bulk state. It encompasses transitions between
the isotropic liquid state and discotic stacking in linear columns as well as circular concentric
ring formation perpendicular and parallel to the pore axis. These textural transitions underpin
an optical birefringence functionality, tuneable in magnitude and in sign from positive to negative
via pore size, pore surface-grafting and temperature. Our study demonstrates that the advent of
large-scale, self-organised nanoporosity in monolithic solids along with confinement-controllable
phase behaviour of liquid-crystalline matter at the single-pore scale provides a reliable and
accessible tool to design materials with adjustable optical anisotropy, and thus offers versatile
pathways to fine-tune polarisation-dependent light propagation speeds in materials. Such a tailorability
is at the core of the emerging field of transformative optics, allowing, e.g., adjustable light
absorbers and extremely thin metalenses.
