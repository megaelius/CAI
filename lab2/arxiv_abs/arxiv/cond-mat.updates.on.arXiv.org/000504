A coarse-graining strategy, previously developed for polymer solutions, is extended here to mixtures
of linear polymers and hard-sphere colloids. In this approach groups of monomers are mapped onto
a single pseudoatom (a blob) and the effective blob-blob interactions are obtained by requiring
the model to reproduce some large-scale structural properties in the zero-density limit. We show
that an accurate parametrization of the polymer-colloid interactions is obtained by simply introducing
pair potentials between blobs and colloids. For the coarse-grained model in which polymers are
modelled as four-blob chains (tetramers), the pair potentials are determined by means of the iterative
Boltzmann inversion scheme, taking full-monomer pair correlation functions at zero-density
as targets. For a larger number $n$ of blobs, pair potentials are determined by using a simple transferability
assumption based on the polymer self-similarity. We validate the model by comparing its predictions
with full-monomer results for the interfacial properties of polymer solutions in the presence
of a single colloid and for thermodynamic and structural properties in the homogeneous phase at
finite polymer and colloid density. The tetramer model is quite accurate for $q\lesssim 1$ ($q=\hat{R}_g/R_c$,
where $\hat{R}_g$ is the zero-density polymer radius of gyration and $R_c$ is the colloid radius)
and reasonably good also for $q=2$. For $q=2$ an accurate coarse-grained description is obtained
by using the $n=10$ blob model. We also compare our results with those obtained by using single-blob
models with state-dependent potentials.
