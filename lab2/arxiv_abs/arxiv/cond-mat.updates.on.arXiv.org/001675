A chain of Josephson junctions implements one of the simplest many-body models undergoing a superconductor-insulator
quantum phase transition between states with zero and infinite resistance. This phenomenon is
central to our understanding of interacting bosons and fermions in one dimension. Apart from zero
resistance, the superconducting state is always accompanied by a sound-like mode due to collective
oscillations of the phase of the complex-valued order parameter. Surprisingly little is known
about the fate of this mode upon entering the insulating state, where the order parameter amplitude
remains non zero, but the phase ordering is \melted" by quantum fluctuations. Here we report momentum-resolved
radio-frequency spectroscopy of collective modes in nanofabricated chains of Al/AlOx/Al tunnel
junctions. Our key finding is that the GHz-frequency modes survive far into the insulating regime,
i.e. an insulator can superconduct AC currents. The insulating state manifests itself by a weak
decoherence of collective modes with an unusual frequency dependence: longer wavelengths decohere
faster, in fact suggesting the absence of DC transport. Owing to an unprecedentedly large kinetic
inductance per unit length, the observed phase mode represents microwave photons with a remarkably
low speed of light (below 10^6 m/s) and high wave impedance (above 23 kOhm). The latter exceeds the
transition value for the Bose glass insulator, expected in this system, by an order of magnitude,
which challenges theory to revisit the finite-energy condensate dynamics near the transition.
More generally, the high impedance translates into a fine structure constant exceeding a unity,
opening access to previously impossible regimes of quantum electrodynamics.
