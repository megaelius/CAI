The out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics of an interacting Bose gas trapped in a 1D asymmetric double-well
potential is studied by solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation numerically accurately.
We examine how the loss of symmetry of the confining trap affects the macroscopic quantum tunneling
dynamics of the system between the two wells. In an asymmetric DW, the two wells are not equivalent
anymore -the left well is deeper than the right one. Accordingly, we analyze the dynamics by initially
preparing the condensate in both the left and the right well. We examined the frequencies and amplitudes
of the oscillations of the survival probabilities, the time scale for the development of fragmentation
and its degree, and the growth and oscillatory behavior of the many-body position and momentum variances.
There is an overall suppression of the oscillations of the survival probabilities in an asymmetric
double well. However, depending on whether the condensate is initially prepared in the left or right
well, the repulsive inter-atomic interactions affect the survival probabilities differently.
The degree of fragmentation depends both on the asymmetry of the trap and the initial well in which
the condensate is prepared in a non-trivial manner. Overall, the many-body position and momentum
variances bear the prominent signatures of the density oscillations of the system in the asymmetric
double well as well as a breathing-mode oscillation. Finally, a universality of fragmentation
for systems made of different numbers of particles but the same interaction parameter is also found.
The phenomenon is robust despite the asymmetry of the junction and admits a macroscopically-large
fragmented condensate characterized by a diverging many-body position variance.
