We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising-like systems, arising
from sudden quenches of the Hamiltonian parameter $g$ driving quantum transitions between disordered
and ordered phases. In particular, we consider quenches to values of $g$ around the critical value
$g_c$, and mainly address the question whether, and how, the quantum transition leaves traces in
the evolution of the transverse and longitudinal magnetizations during such a deep out-of-equilibrium
dynamics. We shed light on the emergence of singularities in the thermodynamic infinite-size limit,
likely related to the integrability of the model. Finite systems in periodic and open boundary conditions
develop peculiar power-law finite-size scaling laws related to revival phenomena, but apparently
unrelated to the quantum transition, because their main features are generally observed in quenches
to generic values of $g$. We also investigate the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment,
modeled by a Lindblad equation with local decay and pumping dissipation operators within the quadratic
fermionic model obtainable by a Jordan-Wigner mapping. Dissipation tends to suppress the main
features of the unitary dynamics of closed systems. We finally address the effects of integrability
breaking, due to further lattice interactions, such as in anisotropic next-to-nearest neighbor
Ising (ANNNI) models. We show that some qualitative features of the post-quench dynamics persist,
in particular the different behaviors when quenching to quantum ferromagnetic and paramagnetic
phases, and the revival phenomena due to the finite size of the system.
