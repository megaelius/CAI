Lipid monolayers with phase coexistence are a frequently used model for lipid membranes. In these
systems, domains of the liquid-condensed phase always present size polydispersity. However,
very few theoretical works consider size distribution effects on the monolayer properties. Because
of the difference in surface densities, domains have excess dipolar density with respect to the
surrounding liquid expanded phase, originating a dipolar inter-domain interaction. This interaction
depends on the domain area, and hence the presence of a domain size distribution is associated with
interaction polydispersity. Inter-domain interactions are fundamental to understanding the
structure and dynamics of the monolayer. For this reason, it is expected that polydispersity significantly
alters monolayer properties. By means of Brownian dynamics simulations, we study the radial distribution
function (RDF), the average mean square displacement and the average time-dependent self-diffusion
coefficient, D(t), of lipid monolayers with normal distributed size domains. It was found that
polydispersity strongly affects the value of the interaction strength obtained, which is greatly
underestimated if polydispersity is not considered. However, within a certain range of parameters,
the RDF obtained from a polydisperse model can be well approximated by that of a monodisperse model,
suitably fitting the interaction strength, even for 40% polydispersities. For small interaction
strengths or small polydispersities, the polydisperse systems obtained from fitting the experimental
RDF have an average mean square displacement and D(t) in good agreement with that of the monodisperse
system.
