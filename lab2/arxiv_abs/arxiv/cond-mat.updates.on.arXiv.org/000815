We simulate numerically the compression driven jamming of athermal, frictionless, soft-core
spherocylinders in two dimensions, for a range of particle aspect ratios $\alpha$. We find the critical
packing fraction $\phi_J(\alpha)$ for the jamming transition, and the average number of contacts
per particle $z_J(\alpha)$ at jamming. We find that both are nonmonotonic, with a peak at $\alpha\approx
1$. We find that configurations at the compression driven jamming point are always hypostatic for
all $\alpha$, with $z_J<z_\mathrm{iso}=2d_f=6$ the isostatic value. We show that, for moderately
elongated spherocylinders, there is no orientational ordering upon athermal compression through
jamming. We analyze in detail the eigenmodes of the dynamical matrix close to the jamming point for
a few different values of the aspect ratio, from nearly circular to moderately elongated. We find
that there are low frequency bands containing $N(z_\mathrm{iso}-z_J)/2$ modes, such that the
frequency of these modes vanish as $\phi\to\phi_J$. We consider the extended vs localized nature
of these low frequency modes, and the extent to which they involve translational or rotational motion,
and find many low frequency sliding modes where particles can move with little rotation. We highlight
the importance of treating side-to-side contacts, along flat sides of the spherocylinder, properly
for the correct determination of $z_J$. We note the singular nature of taking the $\alpha\to 0$ limit.
We discuss the similarities and differences with previous work on jammed ellipses and ellipsoids,
to illustrate the effects that different particle shape have on configurations at jamming.
