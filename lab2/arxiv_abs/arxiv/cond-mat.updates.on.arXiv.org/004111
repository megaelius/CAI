Direct simulation of rare events using atomistic molecular dynamics is a significant challenge
in computational biophysics. Well established enhanced sampling techniques like umbrella sampling,
metadynamics and adaptive-biasing forces are able to calculate the free energy landscapes for
rare events involving barrier crossing. But developing methods for obtaining kinetics of long
timescale processes from molecular dynamics simulation is still an emerging area of science. Milestoning
and weighted ensemble (WE) are two different path sampling based strategies which have shown promises
for computing timescales of complex biomolecular processes. Nevertheless, both require a significant
investment of computational resources. We have combined WE and milestoning, in a novel way, to calculate
experimental observables in orders of magnitude less CPU and wall-clock time. Our method uses WE
simulation to converge the transition probability and first passage times between milestones,
followed by the utilization of the theoretical framework of milestoning to extract thermodynamic
and kinetic properties of the entire process. We tested our method for a simple one dimensional double
well potential, an eleven dimensional potential energy surface with energy barrier, and on a molecular
system of alanine dipeptide. We were able to recover the free energy profiles, time correlation
functions, and mean first passage times for barrier crossing events at a significantly small computational
cost. Our method promises to extend the applicability of molecular dynamics simulation to the slow
dynamics of large systems which are beyond the scope of present day computer power.
