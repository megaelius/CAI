The high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides emerges when carriers are doped into
the parent Mott insulator. This well-established fact has, however, eluded a microscopic explanation.
Here we show that the missing link is the self-energy pole in the energy-momentum space. Its continuous
evolution with doping directly connects the Mott insulator and high-temperature superconductivity.
We show this by numerically studying the extremely small doping region close to the Mott insulating
phase in a standard model for cuprates, the two-dimensional Hubbard model. We first identify two
relevant self-energy structures in the Mott insulator; the pole generating the Mott gap and a relatively
broad peak generating the so-called waterfall structure, which is another consequence of strong
correlations present in the Mott insulator. We next reveal that either the Mott-gap pole or the waterfall
structure (the feature at the energy closer to the Fermi level) directly transforms itself into
another self-energy pole at the same energy and momentum when the system is doped with carriers.
The anomalous self-energy yielding the superconductivity is simultaneously born exactly at this
energy-momentum point. Thus created self-energy pole, interpreted as arising from a hidden fermionic
excitation, continuously evolves upon further doping and considerably enhances the superconductivity.
Above the critical temperature, the same self-energy pole generates a pseudogap in the normal state.
We thus elucidate a unified Mott-physics mechanism, where the self-energy structure inherent
to the Mott insulator directly gives birth to both the high-temperature superconductivity and
pseudogap.
