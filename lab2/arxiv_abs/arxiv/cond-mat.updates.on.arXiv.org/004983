We investigate the spin-pumping-induced electric current on the surface of a three-dimensional
topological insulator hybridized with a ferromagnet, namely, ferromagnetic topological insulator.
In order to do this, we establish the microscopic formalism and construct the perturbation theory
using a Keldysh Green's function approach. We analyze how this electric current is generated by
an exchange interaction and an external ac magnetic field, which is the driving force of ferromagnetic
resonance as well as the spin pumping. The mechanism is as follows. First, the ferromagnetic resonance
is driven and a zero-momentum magnon emerges. It is the fluctuation from the saturation magnetization
pointing parallel to the precession axis of the ferromagnetic resonance. After then, the spin pumping
is generated with the zero-momentum magnon being the carrier of spin. The zero-momentum magnon
and the topological insulator surface state couples through the exchange interaction and the spin
carried by the magnon is transferred to it. Owing to the spin-momentum locking, the transferred
spin is converted into the momentum of topological insulator surface state leading to the generation
of electric current flowing perpendicular to the precession axis of the ferromagnetic resonance.
It is quadratic in the amplitude of external ac magnetic field whereas it is linear to the strength
of the exchange interaction. The associated electric voltage is described by the spectrum of zero-momentum
magnon. The non-linearity of spin-pumping-induced electric current in the ac magnetic field as
well as the linearity in the exchange-interaction strength reflects that the surface of ferromagnetic
topological insulator has a high-performing functionality of generating the electric charge
current by magnetic controlling.
