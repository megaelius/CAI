Thin films of topological insulators (TI) usually exhibit multiple parallel conduction channels
for the transport of electrical current. Beside the topologically protected surface states (TSS),
parallel channels may exist, namely the interior of the not-ideally insulating TI film, the interface
layer to the substrate, and the substrate itself. To be able to take advantage of the auspicious transport
properties of the TSS, the influence of the parasitic parallel channels on the total current transport
has to be minimized. Because the conductivity of the interior (bulk) of the thin TI film is difficult
to access by measurements, we propose here an approach for calculating the mobile charge carrier
concentration in the TI film. To this end, we calculate the near-surface band bending using parameters
obtained experimentally from surface-sensitive measurements, namely (gate-dependent) four-point
resistance measurements and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). While in most
cases another parameter in the calculations, i.e. the concentration of unintentional dopants
inside the thin TI film, is unknown, it turns out that in the thin-film limit the band bending is largely
independent of the dopant concentration in the film. Thus, a well-founded estimate of the total
mobile charge carrier concentration and the conductivity of the interior of the thin TI film proves
possible. Since the interface and substrate conductivities can be measured by a four-probe conductance
measurement prior to the deposition of the TI film, the total contribution of all parasitic channels,
and therefore also the contribution of the vitally important TSS, can be determined reliably.
