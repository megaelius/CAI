Why does a microwave oven work? How does biological tissue absorb electromagnetic radiation? Astonishingly,
we do not have a definite answer to these simple questions because the microscopic processes governing
the absorption of electromagnetic waves by water are largely unclarified. This absorption can
be quantified by dielectric loss spectra, which reveal a huge peak at a frequency of the exciting
electric field of about 20 GHz and a gradual tailing off towards higher frequencies. The microscopic
interpretation of such spectra is highly controversial and various superpositions of relaxation
and resonance processes ascribed to single-molecule or molecule-cluster motions have been proposed
for their analysis. By combining dielectric, microwave, THz, and far-infrared spectroscopy,
here we provide nearly continuous temperature-dependent broadband spectra of water. Moreover,
we find that corresponding spectra for aqueous solutions reveal the same features as pure water.
However, in contrast to the latter, crystallization in these solutions can be avoided by supercooling.
As different spectral contributions tend to disentangle at low temperatures, this enables to deconvolute
them when approaching the glass transition under cooling. We find that the overall spectral development,
including the 20 GHz feature (employed for microwave heating), closely resembles the behavior
known for common supercooled liquids. Thus, water's absorption of electromagnetic waves at room
temperature is not unusual but very similar to that of glass-forming liquids at elevated temperatures,
deep in the low-viscosity liquid regime, and should be interpreted along similar lines.
