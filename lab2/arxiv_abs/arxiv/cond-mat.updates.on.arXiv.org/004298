Many complex phenomena occurring in physics, chemistry, finance, etc. can be reduced, by some projection
process, to a 1-d SDE for the variable of interest. Typically, this SDE results both non linear and
non Markovian, thus an exact equivalent Fokker Planck equation (FPE), for the probability density
function (PDF), is not generally obtainable. However, the FPE is desirable because it is the main
tool for obtaining important analytical statistical information such as stationary PDF and First
Passage Time. Several techniques have been developed to deal with the finite correlation time of
the noise in nonlinear SDE, with the goal of obtaining an effective FPE. The main results are the "best
FPE (BFPE) of Lopez, West and Lindenberg and the FPE obtained by using the "local linearization assumption"
(LLA) introduced by Grigolini and Fox. In principle the BFPE is the best FPE achievable by using a
perturbation approach, where noise is weak. However, the BFPE often gives "non-physical" results,
as negative values of both the diffusion coefficient and the Probability Distribution Functions
in some regions of the state space. Moreover, when compared with numerical simulations of the SDE,
the agreement is not so good, except for very weak noises. We show here that these flaws of the original
BFPE are due to an incorrect use of the interaction picture, due to a pitfall of strongly dissipative
systems. We will show how to cure this problem, so as to arrive to the true best FPE achievable from
a perturbation approach. However, we shall also show that the LLA FPE for 1d-SDE usually perform
better than the cured BFPE, in particular for intensity of noise beyond the perturbation limit.
We will briefly mention the reasons for this, with a detailed explanation reserved for later work.
In this first paper we consider non-linear systems of interest perturbed by additive Gaussian colored
noises.
