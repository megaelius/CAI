This study deals formation process of tiny particles when gold atoms are in transition state under
the getup of monolayer assembly at solution surface following by their elongation through forces
of surface format and packing for developing particles of extended shapes at different processing
time of solution. A double-packet nano shape energy when placed over transition state atoms of monolayer
assembly results into crop in tiny particle of its own shape if distribution of atoms is as per accord.
It is observed that developing rate of extended shapes, not more than millisecond time, depends
on size of individual particle. Diffusing electrons of atoms in their tiny particle under the stretching
of energy knots clamping states reveal the origin of diffusion. Tiny particles cropping at surface
regions near the zero-force axis elongate less. So, in this case, particles shape like rod and bar
are developed. Tiny particles where they elongate more, they develop particles shape like hexagon
and triangle revealing the less width of structure of smooth elements along with inter-spacing
distance as compared to rod and bar shape particles. Different widths of structure of smooth elements
of one-dimensional and three-dimensional shaped particles are measured from inter-spacing distance
of spotted dots in their patterns resulted from reflected photons at respective surface giving
the same value as in high resolution images. When atoms of one-dimensionally elongated arrays are
placed at slight tilted position dealing force other than surface format resulting into bind two
regular structures of smooth element, thus, giving double width. These discoveries open multiple
routes to design materials and explore underlying science.
