The models of spin systems defined on Euclidean space provide powerful machinery for studying a
broad range of condensed matter phenomena. While the non-relativistic effective description
is sufficient for most of the applications, it is interesting to consider special and general relativistic
extensions of such models. Here, we introduce a framework that allows us to construct theories of
continuous spin variables on a curved spacetime. Our approach takes advantage of the results of
the non-linear field space theory, which shows how to construct compact phase space models, in particular
for the spherical phase space of spin. Following the methodology corresponding to a bosonization
of spin systems into the spin wave representations, we postulate a representation having the form
of the Klein-Gordon field. This representation is equivalent to the semi-classical version of
the well-known Holstein-Primakoff transformation. The general-relativistic extension of the
spin wave representation is then performed, leading to the general-relativistically motivated
modifications of the Ising model coupled to a transversal magnetic field. The advantage of our approach
is its off-shell construction, while the popular methods of coupling fermions to general relativity
usually depend on the form of Einstein field equations with matter. Furthermore, we show equivalence
between the considered spin system and the Dirac-Born-Infeld type scalar field theory with a specific
potential, which is also an example of k-essence theory. Based on this, the cosmological consequences
of the introduced spin field matter content are preliminarily investigated.
