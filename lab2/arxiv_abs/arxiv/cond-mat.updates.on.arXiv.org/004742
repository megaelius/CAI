The coupling between multiple nanocavities in close vicinity leads to hybridization of their modes.
Stacked Metal/Insulator/Metal (MIM) nanocavities constitute a highly versatile and very interesting
model system to study and engineer such mode coupling, since they can be realized by lithography-free
fabrication methods with fine control on the optical and geometrical parameters. The resonant
modes of such MIM cavities are epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) resonances, which are appealing for non-linear
photophysics and a variety of applications. Here we study the hybridization of ENZ resonances in
MIMIM nanocavities, obtaining a very large mode splitting reaching 0.477 eV, Q factors of the order
of 40 in the visible spectral range, and fine control on the resonance wavelength and mode linewidth
by tuning the thickness of the dielectric and metallic layers. A semi-classical approach that analyses
the MIMIM structure as a double quantum well system allows to derive the exact analytical dispersion
relation of the ENZ resonances, achieving perfect agreement with numerical simulations and experiments.
Interestingly, the asymmetry of the mode splitting in a symmetric MIMIM cavity is not reflected
in the classical model of coupled oscillators, which can be directly related to quantum mechanical
tunneling for the coupling of the two cavities. Interpreting the cavity resonances as resonant
tunneling modes elucidates that can be excited without momentum matching techniques. The broad
tunability of high-quality ENZ resonances together with their strong coupling efficiency makes
such MIMIM cavities an ideal platform for exploring light-matter interaction, for example, by
integration of quantum emitters in the dielectric layers.
