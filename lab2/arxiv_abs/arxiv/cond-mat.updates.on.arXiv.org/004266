The incidence of topology on the band structure and physical properties of layered compounds has
been extensively studied in semimetals. How those evolve in presence of electronic correlations
has been less investigated so far. In the sodium cobaltates NaxCoO2 considered here, unexpected
magnetic properties associated with correlations on the Co sites have been disclosed about 15 years
ago. Altogether it has also been found that various orderings of the Na atoms occur in between the
CoO2 layers in the stable phases of these cobaltates. The distinct Na orders of these phases have
been shown to induce specific Co charge disproportionation with large size unit cells in the CoO2
planes, linked with the diverse magnetic behaviors. This provides an original playground in the
studies of interplays between topology and correlations in these layered materials. We present
here transport measurements on a series of single crystals and demonstrate that we do synthetize
pure phases with quite reproducible transport properties. We evidence a great diversity in Hall
effect low temperature dependences which underlines the specificities of the Fermi Surface reconstructions
induced by the Na order. We study in some detail the difference between two metallic phases, one (x=0.77)
antiferromagnetic below TN=22 K and the second (x=2/3) paramagnetic down to T=0. For the x=0.77
phase the negative Hall effect has a non-linear field dependence and occurs in similar conditions
as the anomalous Hall effect found in various magnetic metals. In the x=2/3 phase in which the Co sites
are disproportionated in a kagome substructure, the singularities of the Hall effect have to be
assigned with specificities of its Fermi surface. In both cases the detected Hall effect anomalies
are certainly associated with the topology of their Co electronic bands.
