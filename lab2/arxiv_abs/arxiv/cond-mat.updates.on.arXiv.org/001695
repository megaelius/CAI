The electronic band structures along with Fermi surface, anisotropy, Vickers hardness, analysis
of Mulliken populations, optical and thermodynamic properties were studied for the first time.
The optimized unit cell parameters are compared with available theoretical and experimental results
and a reasonable agreement is recorded. The mechanical stability of these compounds is confirmed.
All the compounds herein exhibit metallic conductivity where major contribution comes from d-orbital
electrons. The hardness values of 10.71, 12.44, 8.52 and 16.80 GPa were recorded for M2BC (M = V, Nb,
Mo and Ta) compounds, respectively. The value of bulk modulus, B is found to increase in the sequence
B (V2BC) < B (Nb2BC) < B (Ta2BC) < B (Mo2BC), indicates Mo2BC is highly stiff among all compounds. The
Mo2BC and Ta2BC compound might be considered as potential candidates for protection of cutting
and forming tools due to the moderately ductile and highly stiff behavior compared to other benchmark
hard coating materials such as TiN, TiAlN, Ti0.5Al0.5N and c-BN. Ta2BC compound could also be a promising
thermal barrier coating (TBC) material due to the reasonable results of minimum thermal conductivity,
Debye temperature and damage tolerance behavior. Various optical functions such as dielectric
constants, refractive index, photo-conductivity, absorption, loss function and reflectivity)
are calculated and discussed in details. The amount of reflectivity was always more than around
50% with no significant change in the near infrared, visible light and near ultraviolet region (up
to ~6 eV), which results a promising coating material to diminish solar heating as well.
