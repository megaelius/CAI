In this paper, we examine the viscoelastic properties of integer quantum Hall (IQH) states in a tilted
magnetic field. In particular, we explore to what extent the tilted-field system behaves like a
two-dimensional electron gas with anisotropic mass in the presence of strain deformations. We
first review the Kubo formalism for viscosity in an external magnetic field, paying particular
attention to the role of rotational symmetry and contact terms. Next, we compute the conductivity,
stress, and viscosity tensors for IQH states in the presence of a tilted field and vertical confining
potential. By comparing our results with the recently developed bimetric formalism, we show that,
at the level of the contracted Hall viscosity tensor, the mapping between tilted field and effective
mass anisotropy holds only if we simultaneously modify the background perpendicular magnetic
field; in other words, a simultaneous measurement of the density, contracted Hall viscosity, and
Hall conductivity at fixed particle number can distinguish between tilted field and effective
mass anisotropy. Additionally, we show that in the presence of a tilted magnetic field, the stress
tensor acquires an unusual anisotropic ground state average, leading to anomalous elastic response
functions. We develop a formalism for projecting a three-dimensional Hamiltonian with confining
potential and magnetic field to a two-dimensional Hamiltonian in order to further address the phenomenology
of the tilted-field IQH fluid. We find that the projected fluid couples non-minimally to geometric
deformations, indicating the presence of internal geometric degrees of freedom.
