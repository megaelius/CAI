The recent emergence of strain gradient engineering directly affects the nanomechanics, optoelectronics
and thermal transport fields in 2D materials. More specifically, large suspended graphene under
very high stress represents the quintessence for nanomechanical mass detection through unique
molecular reactions. Different techniques have been used to induce strain in 2D materials, for
instance by applying tip indentation, pressure or substrate bending on a graphene membrane. Nevertheless,
an efficient way to control the strain of a structure is to engineer the system geometry as shown in
everyday life in architecture and acoustics. Similarly, we studied the concentration of strain
in artificial nanoconstrictions (~100 nm) in a suspended epitaxial bilayer graphene membrane
with different geometries and lengths ranging from 10 to 40 micrometer. We carefully isolated the
strain signature from micro-Raman measurements and extracted information on a scale below the
laser spot size by analyzing the broadened shape of our Raman peaks, up to 100 cm-1. We potentially
measured a strong strain concentration in a nanoconstriction up to 5percent, which is 20 times larger
than the native epitaxial graphene strain. Moreover, with a bilayer graphene, our configuration
naturally enhanced the native asymmetric strain between the upper and lower graphene layers. In
contrast to previous results, we can achieve any kind of complex strain tensor in graphene thanks
to our structural approach. This method completes the previous strain-induced techniques and
opens up new perspectives for bilayer graphene and 2D heterostructures based devices.
