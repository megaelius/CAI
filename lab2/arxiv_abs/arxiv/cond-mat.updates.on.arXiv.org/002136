Recent progress in nanoscale manufacturing allowed to experimentally investigate quantum dots
coupled to two superconducting leads in controlled and tunable setups. The equilibrium Josephson
current was measured in on-chip SQUID devices and subgap states were investigated using weakly
coupled metallic leads for spectroscopy. This put back two "classic" problems also on the agenda
of theoretical condensed matter physics: the Josephson effect and quantum spins in superconductors.
We discuss the status of the theoretical understanding of the Anderson-Josephson quantum dot in
equilibrium mainly focusing on the Josephson current. We introduce a minimal model consisting
of a dot which can only host one spin-up and one spin-down electron repelling each other by a local
Coulomb interaction. The dot is tunnel-coupled to two superconducting leads described by the BCS
Hamiltonian. This model was investigated using a variety of methods, some capturing aspects of
Kondo physics others failing in this respect. We briefly review this. The model shows a first order
level-crossing quantum phase transition when varying any parameter provided the others are within
appropriate ranges. At vanishing temperature it leads to a jump of the Josephson current. We show
that a quantitative agreement between accurate results obtained for the simple model and measurements
of the current can be reached. This confirms that the experiments reveal the finite temperature
signatures of the zero temperature transition. In addition, we consider two examples of more complex
dot geometries which might be experimentally realized in the near future. The first is characterized
by the interplay of the above level-crossing physics and the Fano effect, the second by the interplay
of superconductivity and almost degenerate singlet and triplet two-body states.
