Ferritic steels possibly strengthened by oxide dispersion are candidates as structural materials
for generation IV and fusion nuclear reactors. Their use is limited by incomplete knowledge of the
iron-chromium phase diagram at low temperatures and of the phenomena inducing preferential segregation
of one element at grain boundaries or at surfaces. In this context, this work contributes to the multi-scale
study of the model iron-chromium alloy and their free surfaces by numerical simulations. This study
begins with ab initio calculations of properties related to the mixture of atoms of iron and chromium.
We highlight complex dependency of the magnetic moments of the chromium atoms on their local chemical
environment. Surface properties are also proving sensitive to magnetism. This is the case of impurity
segregation of chromium in iron and of their interactions near the surface. In a second step, we construct
a simple energy model for high numerical efficiency. It is based on pair interactions on a rigid lattice
to which are given local chemical environment and temperature dependencies. With this model, we
reproduce the ab initio results at zero temperature and experimental results at high temperature.
We also deduce the solubility limits at all intermediate temperatures with mean field approximations
that we compare to Monte Carlo simulations. The last step of our work is to introduce free surfaces
in our model. We then study the effect of ab initio calculated bulk and surface properties on surface
segregation. Finally, we calculate segregation isotherms. We therefore propose an evolution
model of surface composition of iron-chromium alloys as a function of bulk composition.
