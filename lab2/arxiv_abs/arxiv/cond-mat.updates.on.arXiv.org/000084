We study the mechanics of pressurized graphene membranes using an experimental configuration
that allows the determination of the elasticity of graphene and the adhesion energy between a substrate
and a graphene (or other two-dimensional solid) membrane. The test consists of a monolayer graphene
membrane adhered to a substrate by surface forces. The substrate is patterned with etched microcavities
of a prescribed volume and when they are covered with the graphene monolayer it traps a fixed number
(N) of gas molecules in the microchamber. By lowering the ambient pressure, and thus changing the
pressure difference across the graphene membrane, the membrane can be made to bulge and delaminate
in a stable manner from the substrate. Here we describe the analysis of the membrane/substrate as
a thermodynamic system and explore the behavior of the system over representative experimentally-accessible
geometry and loading parameters. We carry out companion experiments and compare them to the theoretical
predictions and then use the theory and experiments together to determine the adhesion energy of
graphene/SiO2 interfaces. We find an average adhesion energy of 0.24 J/m2 which is lower, but in
line with our previously reported values. We assert that this test, which we call the constant N blister
test, is a valuable approach to determine the adhesion energy between two-dimensional solid membranes
and a substrate, which is an important, but not well-understood aspect of behavior. The test also
provides valuable information that can serve as the basis for subsequent research to understand
the mechanisms contributing to the observed adhesion energy. Finally, we show how in the limit of
a large microcavity, the constant N test approaches the behavior observed in a constant pressure
blister test and we provide an experimental observation that suggests this behavior.
