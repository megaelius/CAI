We study diffusion-reaction processes on periodic square planar lattices and simple cubic (sc)
lattices. Considered first is a single diffusing reactant undergoing an irreversible reaction
upon first encounter with a stationary co-reactant ["one-walker (1W) problem"]. We then generalize
this scenario to allow for a competing reaction, i.e., instantaneous trapping of the diffusing
reactant with probability $s$ at any vacant site before interacting with a (stationary) co-reactant
at a target site. We determine the mean walklength of the diffusing reactant until irreversible
reaction occurs. We use generating functions and the theory of finite Markov processes, as well
as MC simulations. To investigate the dependence of walklength on lattice size we compute the first,
finite size corrections to the Green function of the sc lattice, and provide a Pad\'e approximation
for this quantity. Finally, we consider the case where both reactant and co-reactant undergo synchronous
nearest-neighbor displacements ["two-walker (2W) problem"]. In this case, reactant and co-reactant
can individually be trapped with probability $s$ at any vacant lattice site, or can undergo an irreversible
reaction on first encounter at any site. When $s=0$ we find that, both for the 1W and the 2W problem,
for lattices with (approximately) the same number of sites, the mean walklength is smaller (and
hence the reaction efficiency greater) in $d=3$ than in $d=2$. Increasing $s$ tends to reduce differences
in system dimensionality, and distinctions between the 1W problem and the 2W problem. Our model
provides a good starting point to develop studies on the efficiency of apparently diverse diffusion-reaction
processes, such as diffusion on a partially poisoned catalytic substrate or photosynthetic trapping
of excitations.
