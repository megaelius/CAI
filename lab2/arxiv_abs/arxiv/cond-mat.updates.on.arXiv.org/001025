We provide a C/C++ software for the shape analysis of deflated elastic capsules in a pendant capsule
geometry, which is based on an elastic description of the capsule material as a quasi two-dimensional
elastic membrane using shell theory. Pendant capsule elastometry provides a new in-situ and non-contact
method for interfacial rheology of elastic capsules. Given an elastic model of the capsule membrane,
pendant capsule elastometry determines optimal elastic moduli by fitting numerically generated
axisymmetric shapes optimally to an experimental image. For each digitized image of a deflated
capsule elastic moduli can be determined, if another image of its undeformed reference shape is
provided. Within this paper, we focus on nonlinear Hookean elasticity because of its low computational
cost its wide applicability, but also discuss and implement alternative constitutive laws. For
Hookean elasticity, Young's surface modulus (or, alternatively, area compression modulus) and
Poisson's ratio are determined; for Mooney-Rivlin elasticity, the Rivlin modulus and a dimensionless
shape parameter are determined; for neo-Hookean elasticity, only the Rivlin modulus is determined,
using a fixed dimensionless shape parameter. Comparing results for different models we find that
nonlinear Hookean elasticity is adequate for most capsules. If series of images are available,
these moduli can be evaluated as a function of the capsule volume to analyze hysteresis or aging effects
depending on the deformation history. An additional wrinkling wavelength measurement allows
the user to determine the bending modulus, from which the layer thickness can be derived. We verify
the method by analyzing several materials, compare the results to available rheological measurements,
and review several applications. We make the software available under the GPL license at github.com/jhegemann/opencapsule.
