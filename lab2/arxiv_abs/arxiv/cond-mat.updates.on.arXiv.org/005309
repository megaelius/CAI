Lattice dynamics in low-dimensional materials and, in particular, the quadratic behaviour of
the flexural acoustic modes play a fundamental role in their thermomechanical and thermal transport
properties. A first-principles evaluation of these can be computationally very demanding, and
can be affected by numerical noise which breaks translational and/or rotational invariance. In
order to overcome these challenges in honeycomb lattices, we consider the Gartstein internal-coordinate
potential where we tune its 13 parameters on first-principles calculations of the interatomic
force constants for graphene. We show that the resulting potential not only reproduces very well
the phonon dispersions of graphene, but that it can also describe the vibrational properties of
carbon nanotubes of any diameter and chirality, without any additional modifications to its analytic
expression or parametrization. In addition, one can augment its functional form with a single cubic
term to be able to reproduce the dominant anharmonic terms of the interactions and obtain a close
estimate for the lattice thermal conductivity. Finally, this potential form works well also for
other 2D honeycomb materials, such as a monolayer of boron-nitride, provided it is fitted on the
short-range (analytical) part of the interatomic force constants, and augmented thereafter with
the long-range dielectric contribution. These considerations underscore how in polar materials
potentials based on short-ranged descriptors should be fit to the short-range part of the first-principles
interactions, and complemented by long-range analytical dielectric models also parametrized
by the same first-principles calculations.
