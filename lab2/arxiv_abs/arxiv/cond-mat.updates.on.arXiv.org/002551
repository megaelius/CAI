Single-photon sources are essential building blocks in quantum photonic networks, where quantum-mechanical
properties of photons are utilised to achieve quantum technologies such as quantum cryptography
and quantum computing. Most conventional solid-state single-photon sources are based on single
emitters such as self-assembled quantum dots, which are created at random locations and require
spectral filtering. These issues hinder the integration of a single-photon source into a scaleable
photonic quantum network for applications such as on-chip photonic quantum processors. In this
work, using only regular lithography techniques on a conventional GaAs quantum well, we realise
an electrically triggered single-photon source with a GHz repetition rate and without the need
for spectral filtering. In this device, a single electron is carried in the potential minimum of
a surface acoustic wave (SAW) and is transported to a region of holes to form an exciton. The exciton
then decays and creates a single photon in a lifetime of ~ 100ps. This SAW-driven electroluminescence
(EL) yields photon antibunching with $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.39 \pm 0.05$, which satisfies the common criterion
for a single-photon source $g^{(2)}(0) < 0.5$. Furthermore, we estimate that if a photon detector
receives a SAW-driven EL signal within one SAW period, this signal has a 79%-90% chance of being a
single photon. This work shows that a single-photon source can be made by combining single-electron
transport and a lateral n-i-p junction. This approach makes it possible to create multiple synchronised
single-photon sources at chosen positions with photon energy determined by quantum-well thickness.
Compared with conventional quantum-dot-based single-photon sources, this device may be more
suitable for an on-chip integrated photonic quantum network.
