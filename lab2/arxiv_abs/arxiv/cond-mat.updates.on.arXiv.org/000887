We focus on the response of mechanically stable (MS) packings of frictionless, bidisperse disks
to thermal fluctuations, with the aim of quantifying how nonlinearities affect system properties
at finite temperature. Packings of disks with purely repulsive contact interactions possess two
main types of nonlinearities, one from the form of the interaction potential and one from the breaking
(or forming) of interparticle contacts. To identify the temperature regime at which the contact-breaking
nonlinearities begin to contribute, we first calculated the minimum temperatures $T_{cb}$ required
to break a single contact in the MS packing for both single and multiple eigenmode perturbations
of the $T=0$ MS packing. We then studied deviations in the constant volume specific heat $C_V$ and
deviations of the average disk positions $\Delta r$ from their $T=0$ values in the temperature regime
$T_{cb} < T < T_{r}$, where $T_r$ is the temperature beyond which the system samples the basin of a
new MS packing. We find that the deviation in the specific heat per particle $\Delta {\overline C}_V^0/{\overline
C}_V^0$ relative to the zero temperature value ${\overline C}_V^0$ can grow rapidly above $T_{cb}$,
however, the deviation $\Delta {\overline C}_V^0/{\overline C}_V^0$ decreases as $N^{-1}$ with
increasing system size. To characterize the relative strength of contact-breaking versus form
nonlinearities, we measured the ratio of the average position deviations $\Delta r^{ss}/\Delta
r^{ds}$ for single- and double-sided linear and nonlinear spring interactions. We find that $\Delta
r^{ss}/\Delta r^{ds} > 100$ for linear spring interactions and is independent of system size.
