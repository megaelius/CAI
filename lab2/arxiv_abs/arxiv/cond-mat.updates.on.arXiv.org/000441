This paper shows by computer simulations that some crystalline systems have curves in their thermodynamic
phase diagrams, so-called isomorphs, along which structure and dynamics in reduced units are invariant
to a good approximation. Isomorphs were previously only investigated in the liquid phase. Crystals
are studied in a classical-mechanical framework, which is generally a good description except
significantly below melting. The existence of isomorphs for crystals is validated by simulations
of particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones pair potential arranged into a face-centered cubic
crystalline structure; the slow vacancy-jump dynamics of a defective crystal is also shown to be
isomorph invariant. In contrast, a $NaCl$ crystal model does not exhibit isomorph invariances.
Other systems simulated, though in less detail, are the Wahnstr\"om binary Lennard-Jones crystal
with the ${\rm MgZn_2}$ Laves crystal structure, monatomic FCC crystals of particles interacting
via the Buckingham pair potential and a novel purely repulsive non-inverse-power-law pair potential,
an ortho-terphenyl molecular model, and SPC/E hexagonal ice. Except for $NaCl$ and ice, all crystals
simulated have good isomorphs. Based on these findings and previous simulations of liquid models,
we conjecture that solids with good isomorphs include most or all crystals formed by atoms or molecules
interacting via metallic or van der Waals forces. On the other hand, covalently- or hydrogen-bonded
crystals are not expected to have good isomorphs. Crystals of ions or dipolar molecules constitute
a limiting case for which good isomorphs are only expected when the Coulomb interactions are relatively
weak. We briefly discuss the consequences of these results for theories of melting and crystallization.
