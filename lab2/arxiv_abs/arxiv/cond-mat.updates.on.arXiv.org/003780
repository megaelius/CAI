Signatures of the Kondo effect in the electrical conductance of strongly correlated quantum dots
are well understood both experimentally and theoretically, while those in the thermopower have
been the subject of recent interest. Here, we extend theoretical work [T. A. Costi, Phys. Rev. B {\bf
100}, 161106(R) (2019)] on the field-dependent thermopower of such systems, and carry out calculations
in order to address a recent experiment on the field dependent thermoelectric response of Kondo-correlated
quantum dots [A. Svilans {\em et al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 121}, 206801 (2018)]. In addition to
the sign changes in the thermopower at temperatures $T_1(B)$ and $T_2(B)$ (present also for $B=0$)
in the Kondo regime, an additional sign change was found [T. A. Costi, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 100}, 161106(R)
(2019)] at a temperature $T_0(B)<T_1(B)<T_2(B)$ for fields exceeding a gate-voltage dependent
value $B_0$, where $B_0$ is comparable to, but larger, than the field $B_c$ at which the Kondo resonance
splits. We describe the evolution of the Kondo-induced sign changes in the thermopower at temperatures
$T_0(B),T_1(B)$ and $T_2(B)$ with magnetic field and gate voltage from the Kondo regime to the mixed
valence and empty orbital regimes. By carrying out detailed NRG calculations for the above quantities
we address the recent experiment by A. Svilans {\em et al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 121}, 206801 (2018),
which measures the field-dependent thermoelectric response of InAs quantum dots exhibiting the
Kondo effect, finding good agreement for the overall trends in the measured field- and temperature-dependent
thermoelectric response as a function of gate voltage.
