Existing structures of atoms belonging to different elements are not in line with their original
behaviors. This study deals with structure evolution in atoms of suitable elements capable to execute
confined inter-state electron dynamics. The structure of these atoms gets evolved during amalgamation
due to significantly attained dynamics. Structures evolve in a different format as per naturally
attained ground points of their atoms. In neutral state of atoms, they transform heat energy into
bind energy having shapes like tick, integral or Gaussian distribution symbol depending on the
mechanism of their electron dynamics. The evolving structure of atoms having same ground points
also deals with forced exertions for suitable electrons at the same level. In atoms of space format,
the structure starts evolving above the typical level of ground surface. In atoms of grounded format,
the structure starts evolving below the typical level of ground surface. The structure evolves
for different dimensions of atoms as per the number of their quadrants simultaneously execute electron
dynamics. Atoms of those elements execute electron dynamics for three quadrants show a bit different
mechanism of their structure evolution. An atom binds to the targeted atom at the points of their
generated energy. For structure evolution in space format and grounded format, amalgamating atoms
bind to the targeted atom in a lateral way from upward side and downward side respectively. In structure
of surface format, amalgamated atoms bind to target atom in adjacent manner. The binding of atoms
in layers for each definite format is by means of involved force and engaged energy. As a result of
chemical activity related to force and energy of atoms bound under electron dynamics, the emerged
chemical reactivity connects their mono layers. A mixed orientation structure develops due to
frustrated amalgamation of atoms ...
