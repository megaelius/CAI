The search for local structures within a disordered medium has led to proposals of several methods
for probing transient short-range symmetry in a homogeneous mono-atomic liquid. We offer a comparison
of different characterizations of such local structure in an in-homogeneous liquid. We simulate
the interfaces between a Lennard-Jones liquid and (i) a flat Lennard-Jones wall, (ii) a wall of face-centered
cubic-packed Lennard-Jones particles, and (iii) a Lennard-Jones vapor. The interface density
distributions in cases (i) and (ii) have oscillations extending several particle diameters into
the bulk liquid, while that in case (iii) the interface density distribution monotonically decays
from the bulk liquid to the vapor. We search for transient ordered fluctuations, which we identify
with local ordered structures, using the Aperture Cross Correlation Function of the system. We
find that only particles in the FCC-liquid interface that are in the two layers closest to the FCC
surface exhibit preferred four-fold symmetry. Furthermore, the absence of three- or five-fold
symmetry peaks in the Aperture Cross Correlation Function of the liquid-vapor interface yields
a different picture of that interface than derived from the high density of bi-pyramidal clusters
found in the Topological Cluster Classification study (Molecular Physics, 109 (7-10), 1393-1402
(2011)). While the Aperture Cross Correlation Function results need not be viewed as contradictory
with the Topological Cluster Classification results, we argue the advantages of using the former
to characterize transient ordered fluctuations as being both experimentally accessible in favorable
cases and not reliant on a list of structures.
