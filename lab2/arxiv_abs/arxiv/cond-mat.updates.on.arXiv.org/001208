We report a multiscale approach of broad applicability to stochastic reconstruction of multiphase
materials, including porous ones. The approach devised uses an optimization method, such as the
simulated annealing (SA) and the so-called entropic descriptors (EDs). For a binary pattern, they
quantify spatial inhomogeneity or statistical complexity at discrete length-scales. The EDs
extract dissimilar structural information to that given by two-point correlation functions (CFs).
Within the SA, we use an appropriate cost function consisting of EDs or comprised of EDs and CFs. It
was found that the stochastic reconstruction is computationally efficient when we begin with a
preliminary synthetic configuration having in part desirable features. Another option is low-cost
approximate reconstructing of the entire multiphase medium beyond the SA technique. The information
included in the target ED-curve was utilized for this purpose. For a given volume fraction the low-cost
trial microstructures can be generated in two ways. In the first one, applied to ceramics and carbonate
samples, the interpenetrating spheres generate a number of trial configurations. In the second
one, with phase-EDs, here used to the sandstone sample, the overlapping superspheres do it. Both
methods use a radius determined from the EDs-linked two-exponent power-law. However, the supersphere
deformation parameter allows controlling of the spatial inhomogeneity of prototypical microstructures.
At last, even for a hypothetical ED-curve (under reasonable assumptions), the specific microstructure
can be found, if it is realizable for a given volume fraction. In general, the EDs-based methods offer
a compromise between computational efficiency and the accuracy of reconstructions.
