How the information microscopically processed by individual neurons is integrated and used in
organising the macroscopic behaviour of an animal is a central question in neuroscience. Coherence
of dynamics over different scales has been suggested as a clue to the mechanisms underlying this
integration. Balanced excitation and inhibition amplify microscopic fluctuations to a macroscopic
level and may provide a mechanism for generating coherent dynamics over the two scales. Previous
theories of brain dynamics, however, have been restricted to cases in which population-averaged
activities have been constrained to constant values, that is, to cases with no macroscopic degrees
of freedom. In the present study, we investigate balanced neuronal networks with a nonzero number
of macroscopic degrees of freedom coupled to microscopic degrees of freedom. In these networks,
amplified microscopic fluctuations drive the macroscopic dynamics, while the macroscopic dynamics
determine the statistics of the microscopic fluctuations. We develop a novel type of mean-field
theory applicable to this class of interscale interactions, for which an analytical approach has
previously been unknown. Irregular macroscopic rhythms similar to those observed in the brain
emerge spontaneously as a result of such interactions. Microscopic inputs to a small number of neurons
effectively entrain the whole network through the amplification mechanism. Neuronal responses
become coherent as the magnitude of either the balanced excitation and inhibition or the external
inputs is increased. Our mean-field theory successfully predicts the behaviour of the model. Our
numerical results further suggest that the coherent dynamics can be used for selective read-out
of information. In conclusion, our results show a novel form of neuronal information processing
that bridges different scales, and advance our understanding of the brain.
