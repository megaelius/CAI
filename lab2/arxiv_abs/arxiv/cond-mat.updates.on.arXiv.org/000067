Compass models are theories of matter in which the couplings between the internal spin (or other
relevant field) components are inherently spatially (typically, direction) dependent. Compass-type
interactions appear in diverse physical systems including Mott insulators with orbital degrees
of freedom (where interactions sensitively depend on the spatial orientation of the orbitals involved),
the low energy effective theories of frustrated quantum magnets, systems with strong spin-orbit
couplings (such as the iridates), vacancy centers, and cold atomic gases. Kitaev's models, in particular
the compass variant on the honeycomb lattice, realize basic notions of topological quantum computing.
The fundamental inter-dependence between internal (spin, orbital, or other) and external (i.e.,
spatial) degrees of freedom which underlies compass models generally leads to very rich behaviors
including the frustration of (semi-)classical ordered states on non-frustrated lattices and
to enhanced quantum effects prompting, in certain cases, the appearance of zero temperature quantum
spin liquids. As a consequence of these frustrations, new types of symmetries and their associated
degeneracies may appear. These intermediate symmetries lie midway between the extremes of global
symmetries and local gauge symmetries and lead to effective dimensional reductions. We review
compass models in a unified manner, paying close attention to exact consequences of these symmetries,
and to thermal and quantum fluctuations that stabilize orders via order out of disorder effects.
We review non-trivial statistics and the appearance of topological quantum orders in compass systems
in which, by virtue of their intermediate symmetry standard orders do not arise. This is complemented
by a survey of numerical results. Where appropriate theoretical and experimental results are compared.
