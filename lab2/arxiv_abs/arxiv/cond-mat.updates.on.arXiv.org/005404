We consider the role of coordinate dependent tetrads ("Fermi velocities"), momentum space geometry,
and torsional Landau levels (LLs) in condensed matter systems with low-energy Weyl quasiparticles.
In contrast to their relativistic counterparts, they arise at finite momenta and an explicit cutoff
to the linear spectrum. Via the universal coupling of tetrads to momentum, they experience geometric
chiral and axial anomalies with gravitational character. More precisely, at low-energy, the fermions
experience background fields corresponding to emergent anisotropic Riemann-Cartan and Newton-Cartan
spacetimes, depending on the form of the low-energy dispersion. On these backgrounds, we show how
torsion and the Nieh-Yan (NY) anomaly appear in condensed matter Weyl systems with a ultraviolet
(UV) parameter with dimensions of momentum. The torsional NY anomaly arises in simplest terms from
the spectral flow of torsional LLs coupled to the nodes at finite momenta and the linear approximation
with a cutoff. We carefully review the torsional anomaly and spectral flow for relativistic fermions
at zero momentum and contrast this with the spectral flow, non-zero torsional anomaly and the appearance
the dimensionful UV-cutoff parameter in condensed matter systems at finite momentum. We apply
this to chiral transport anomalies sensitive to the emergent tetrads in non-homogenous chiral
superconductors, superfluids and Weyl semimetals under elastic strain. This leads to the suppression
of anomalous density at nodes from geometry, as compared to (pseudo)gauge fields. We also briefly
discuss the role torsion in anomalous thermal transport for non-relativistic Weyl fermions, which
arises via Luttinger's fictitious gravitational field corresponding to thermal gradients.
