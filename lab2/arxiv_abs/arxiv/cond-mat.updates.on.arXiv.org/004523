The phase behavior of hydrocarbon fluids confined in porous media has been reported to deviate significantly
from that in the bulk environment due to the existence of sub-10nm pores. Though experiments and
simulations have measured the bubble/dew points and sorption isotherms of hydrocarbons confined
in both natural and synthetic nanopores, the confinement effects in terms of the strength of fluid-pore
interactions tuned by surface wettability and chemistry have received comparably less discussion.
More importantly, the underlying physics of confinement-induced phenomena remain obfuscated.
In this work, we studied the phase behavior and capillary condensation of n-hexane to understand
the effects of confinement at the molecular level. To systematically investigate the pore effects,
we constructed two types of wall confinements; one is a structureless virtual wall described by
the Steele potential and the other one is an all-atom amorphous silica structure with surface modified
by hydroxyl groups. Our numerical results demonstrated the importance of fluid-pore interaction,
pore size, and pore morphology effects in mediating the pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) properties
of hydrocarbons. The most remarkable finding of this work was that the saturation pressure predicted
from the van der Waals-type adsorption isothermal loop could be elevated or suppressed relative
to the bulk phase, as illustrated in the graphical abstract. As the surface energy (i.e., fluid-pore
interaction) decreased, the isothermal vapor pressure increased, indicating a greater preference
for the fluid to exist in the vapor state. Sufficient reduction of the fluid-pore interactions could
even elevate the vapor pressure above that of the bulk fluid.
