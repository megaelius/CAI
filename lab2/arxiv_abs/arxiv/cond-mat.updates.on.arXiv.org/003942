The electronic structure of Au-Sn intermetallic layers of different compositions grown on Au(111)
to the thickness of several nanometers has been studied in this work. The layer, interface and the
substrate related components in the Au 4$f$ and Sn 4$d$ core-level spectra obtained using x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) vary with deposition parameters to reveal the details of the
Au-Sn formation. While AuSn is grown by deposition at room temperature, Au rich compounds form as
a result of heat treatment through inter diffusion of Au and Sn. Deposition at high temperature forms
more Au rich compositions compared to post annealing at the same temperature due to the kinetic energy
of the impinging Sn atoms in the former case. Post annealing, on the other hand, stabilizes the bulk
phases such as AuSn and Au$_5$Sn and exhibits an activated behavior for transition from the former
to the latter with increasing temperature. The XPS valence band spectra of AuSn and Au$_{5}$Sn layers
show good agreement with the density functional theory calculation, indicating that these have
the bulk structure reported in literature. However, the influence of anti-site defects is observed
in Au$_5$Sn. Low energy electron diffraction study reveals that although the AuSn layer is ordered,
its top surface is disordered at room temperature. Surface order is obtained by annealing or deposition
at elevated temperatures and dispersing bands are observed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy.
Both electron-like and hole-like bands are evident for the ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30$^{\circ}$
phase, while a nearly free electron-like parabolic surface state is observed for the p(3$\times$3)R15$^{\circ}$
phase.
