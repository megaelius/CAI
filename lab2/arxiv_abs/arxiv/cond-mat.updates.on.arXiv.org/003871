Mo$_8$O$_{23}$ is a low-dimensional chemically robust transition metal oxide coming from a prospective
family of functional materials, MoO$_{3-x}$, ranging from a wide gap insulator $(x=0)$ to a metal
$(x=1)$. The large number of stoichometric compounds with intermediate $x$ have widely different
properties. In Mo$_8$O$_{23}$, an unusual charge density wave transition has been suggested to
occur above room temperature, but its low temperature behaviour is particularly enigmatic. We
present a comprehensive experimental study of the electronic structure associated with various
ordering phenomena in this compound, complemented by theory. Density-functional theory (DFT)
calculations reveal a cross-over from a semi-metal with vanishing band overlap to narrow-gap semiconductor
behaviour with decreasing temperature. A buried Dirac crossing at the zone boundary is confirmed
by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) reveals
a gradual gap opening corresponding to a metal-to-insulator transition at 343 K in resistivity,
consistent with CDW formation and DFT results, but with large non-thermal smearing of the spectra
implying strong carrier scattering. At low temperatures, the CDW picture is negated by the observation
of a metallic Hall contribution, a non-trivial gap structure in STS below $\sim 170$ K and ARPES spectra,
that together represent evidence for the onset of the correlated state at $70$ K and the rapid increase
of gap size below $\sim 30$ K. The intricate interplay between electronic correlations and the presence
of multiple narrow bands near the Fermi level set the stage for metastability and suggest suitability
for memristor applications.
