We consider a dynamics of 180-degree uncharged rotational domain wall in a miltiaxial ferroelectric
film within the framework of analytical Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) approach. The Finite
Element Modelling (FEM) is used to solve numerically the system of the coupled nonlinear Euler-Lagrange
(EL) differential equations of the second order for two components of polarization. It appeared,
that the stable structure of the rotational domain wall and corresponding (meta)stable phase of
the film are dependent on the only master parameter - dimensionless factor of ferroelectric anisotropy
mu. We fitted the static profile of a solitary domain wall, calculated by FEM, with hyperbolic functions
for polarization components, and extracted the five mu-dependent parameters from the fitting
to FEM curves. The surprisingly high accuracy of the fitting results for two polarization components
in the entire mu-range allows us to conclude that the analytical functions, which are trial functions
in the direct variational method, can be treated as the high accuracy variational solution of the
static EL equations with cubic nonlinearity. Next, using elliptic functions, we derived the two
component analytical solutions of the static EL equations for a polydomain 180-degree domain structure
in a miltiaxial ferroelectric film. The analytical polydomain solutions contain enough free parameters
to satisfy arbitrary boundary conditions at the film surfaces. The analysis of the free energy dependence
on the film thickness and boundary conditions at its surfaces allows to select the domain states
corresponding to the minimal energy.
