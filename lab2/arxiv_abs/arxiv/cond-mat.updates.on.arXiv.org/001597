The usefulness of a quantum system as a sensor is given by the quantum Fisher information (QFI) which
quantifies the sensitivity of its quantum states to perturbations. In particular, for unitary
perturbations useful quantum states are necessarily coherent. Quantum enhanced sensing with
many-body states relies on multipartite entanglement (MPE), and therefore QFI is used as an entanglement
witness. Here we show that for systems with a fixed local charge (for example fixed density) the connection
between QFI and MPE simplifies. In this case, QFI can become a faithful witness of MPE, as a consequence
of the emerging direct relation between MPE and coherence in a quantum state, and coherence (as quantified
by relative entropy) becomes a faithful upper bound for the relative entropy MPE. When the local
charge is not fixed but conserved, QFI becomes a faithful witness of multipartite quantum discord
(i.e. quantumness) and coherence becomes its faithful upper bound. Analogously, we show how the
bipartite entanglement (BPE) of a fixed-charge state can be witnessed by the QFI related to unitary
perturbations of the bipartition, while the corresponding block coherence (i.e., charge asymmetry
between partitions) serves as a lower bound on BPE of formation. As estimating QFI is difficult for
mixed states of open quantum systems, we adapt a recently introduced protocol that measures QFI
of pure states and provides a lower bound for the QFI in open systems. When conservation laws are present,
this lower bound can also be a faithful witness of MPE, and furthermore a lower bound of a BPE measure.
We illustrate these general results with an application to the problem of detecting the growth of
entanglement in a many-body localised system with and without dissipation.
