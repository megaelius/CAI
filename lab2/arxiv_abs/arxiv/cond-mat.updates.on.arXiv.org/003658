The ferro-rotational order, whose order parameter (OP) is an axial vector invariant under both
time reversal (TR) and spatial inversion (SI) operations, is the last remaining category of ferroics
to be observed after the ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, and ferro-toroidal orders. This order
has become increasingly popular in many new quantum materials, especially in complex oxides, and
is considered responsible for a number of novel phenomena such as polar vortices, giant magnetoelectric
coupling, and type-II multiferroics. However, physical properties of the ferro-rotational order
have been rarely studied either theoretically or experimentally. Here, using high sensitivity
rotational anisotropy second harmonic generation (RA SHG), we have, for the first time, exploited
the electric quadrupole (EQ) contribution to the SHG to directly couple to this centrosymmetric
ferro-rotational order in an archetype of type-II multiferroics, RbFe(MoO4)2. Surprisingly,
we have found that two types of domains with opposite ferro-rotational vectors emerge with distinct
populations at the critical temperature Tc ~195 K and gradually evolve to reach an even ratio at lower
temperatures. Moreover, we have identified the ferro-rotational order phase transition as weak
first order, and have revealed its conjugate coupling field as a unique combination of the induced
EQ SHG and the incident fundamental electric fields. Our results on physical properties of a ferro-rotational
order provide crucial knowledge for understanding and searching for novel phases of matter built
upon the ferro-rotational order. Further, these results open the possibility of revealing unconventional
centrosymmetric orders and identifying their conjugate coupling fields with second order nonlinear
optics.
