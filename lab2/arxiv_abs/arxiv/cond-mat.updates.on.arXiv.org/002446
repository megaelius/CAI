Coalescence of tiny-sized particles into large-sized particles has been an overlooked phenomenon
since long. This study discusses development of gold particles under varying precursor concentration
in custom-built setup. Under the fixed ratio of pulse OFF to ON time, tiny-sized particles of different
sizes develop depending on the amount of gold precursor. Double-packets of nanoshape energy bind
gold atoms at solution surface into own shape when possess compact monolayer assembly. Between
precursor concentration 0.07 mM to 0.90 mM, many tiny-sized particles are developed in a joined
triangular-shape, they are in the large number at 0.30 mM and at 0.60 mM. On separating joined triangular-shaped
tiny particle into two tiny-shaped particles under the certain mechanism, each of them forms the
shape of an equilateral triangle. Atoms of one-dimensional arrays of such tiny particles elongate
by the exerting surface forces converting them into structures of smooth elements. Structures
of smooth elements of such tiny particles assemble to develop particles of different geometric
anisotropic shapes at the center of light glow because of stop exerting surface forces. At 0.05 mM
and 1.20 mM, tiny-sized particles do not develop in a triangular-shape largely and their packing
under exerting forces of mixed-behavior develop particles of distorted shapes. Photons reflected
at the surface of anisotropic particles indicate their different structures to the distorted ones.
At 50 sccm argon flow rate, particles develop in same shapes as for the case of 100 sccm argon flow rate
but colors of their solutions indicate a bit different elongation rate of atoms forming structures
of smooth elements. This study clarifies that under what concentration of gold, certain size and
shape particle develops.
