The dynamics of an adhesive two-dimensional vesicle doublet under various flow conditions is investigated
numerically using a high-order, adaptive-in-time boundary integral method. In a quiescent flow,
two nearby vesicles move slowly towards each other under the adhesive potential, pushing out fluid
between them to form a vesicle doublet at equilibrium. A lubrication analysis on such draining of
a thin film gives the dependencies of draining time on adhesion strength and separation distance
that are in good agreement with numerical results. In a planar extensional flow we find a stable vesicle
doublet forms only when two vesicles collide head-on around the stagnation point. In a microfluid
trap where the stagnation of an extensional flow is dynamically placed in the middle of a vesicle
doublet through an active control loop, novel dynamics of a vesicle doublet are observed. Numerical
simulations show that there exists a critical extensional flow rate above which adhesive interaction
is overcome by the diverging stream, thus providing a simple method to measure the adhesion strength
between two vesicle membranes. In a planar shear flow, numerical simulations reveal that a vesicle
doublet may form provided that the adhesion strength is sufficiently large at a given vesicle reduced
area. Once a doublet is formed, its oscillatory dynamics is found to depend on the adhesion strength
and their reduced area. Furthermore the effective shear viscosity of a dilute suspension of vesicle
doublets is found to be a function of the reduced area. Results from these numerical studies and analysis
shed light on the hydrodynamic and rheological consequences of adhesive interactions between
vesicles in a viscous fluid.
