A new steady-state kinetic model of ammonia decomposition is presented and analyzed regarding
the electronic properties of metal catalysts. The model is based on the classical Temkin-Ertl mechanism
and modified in accordance with Wolkenstein electronic theory by implementing participation
of free electrons of the catalyst to change the chemical nature of adsorbed species. Wolkenstein
original theory only applied to semiconductors but by including the d-band model, the electronic
theory can be extended to metals. For both simplified and full reaction mechanisms, including electronic
steps, we present a steady-state rate equation where the dependence on the Fermi level of the metal
creates a volcano-shaped dependence. According to the kinetic model, an increasing Fermi level
of the catalyst, that approaching the antibonding state with adsorbed nitrogen molecules, will
increase the fraction of neutral nitrogen molecules and enhance their the desorption. Concurrently,
strong chemisorption of ammonia molecules proceeds easily through participation of additional
free catalyst electrons in the adsorbate bond. As a result, the reaction rate is enhanced and reaches
its maximum value. A further increasing Fermi level of the catalyst that approaches the antibonding
state with ammonia molecules will result in a smaller fraction of negatively charged ammonia molecules
and less dehydrogenation. Concurrently, the desorption of neutral nitrogen molecules occurs
without impairment. As a result, the reaction rate decreases. The detailed kinetic model is compared
to recent experimental measurements of ammonia decomposition on iron, cobalt and CoFe bimetallic
catalysts.
