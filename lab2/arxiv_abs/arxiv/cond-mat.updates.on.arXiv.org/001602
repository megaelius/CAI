We investigate the electron properties of the monolayer and bilayer silicene which is the honeycomb
lattice consist of silicon atoms, including the optical conductivity and charged impurity scattering,
due to the quasipatricle Dirac-like behaviors near the K-point of silicene. The spin, valley, sublattice
degrees of freedom are taken into consider in the multi-band tight-binding model. In momentum space,
the scattering matrix which connects the two bare (without interaction) Green's functions in the
quasiparticle momentum transport process, could be momentum-independent for the single impuirity
configuration, which is similar to the case with small Coulomb coupling in the low-energy Dirac
semimetallic system. While in the zero-frequency limit, or the frequency-independent case in
the strong Coulomb coupling regime, the static polarization can be obtained by the random-phase-approximation,
and it's important for the determination of the screened Coulomb scattering by the charge impurity.
The antiferromagnetic order in the silicene is Hubbard-U-dependent, unlike the square lattice
which with the antiferromagnetic ground state, and provides the premise of the phase transition
from the nonmagnetic semimetal phase to the insulator one. We found that in the absence of electric
field, the critical value of the phase transition from semimetal to insulator is 9 eV for the clear
monolayer silicene, and is 12 eV for the 2nd AA-stacked bilayer silicene or the dirty monolayer silicene
whcih with impurity strength 4 eV. While the behaviors of 1st AA-stacked bilayer silicene is found
similar to the monolayer one. The in-plane optical conductivity also shows the same results.
