Using NRG, we show that a system containing a quantum impurity (QI), strongly coupled to a semiconductor
(gap $2 \Delta$) and weakly coupled to a metal, displays a 'reentrant' Kondo stage at low temperatures.
The NRG analysis of the corresponding Single Impurity Anderson Model (SIAM) shows that the reentrant
stage is characterized by a second sequence of SIAM fixed points: free orbital (FO) > local moment
(LM) > strong coupling (SC). In the first stage, the SC fixed point (Kondo temperature $T_{K1}$)
is unstable, while the second stage exhibits a much lower Kondo temperature $T_{K2}$, associated
to a stable SC fixed point. The results indicate that the reentrant Kondo screening is associated
to an effective SIAM, with an effective repulsion $U_{eff}$. This low temperature effective SIAM,
which we dub as 'reentrant' SIAM, behaves as a 'replica' of the high temperature (bare) SIAM. The
intuitive picture that emerges is that the first Kondo state develops through impurity screening
by semiconducting electrons, while the second Kondo state involves screening by metallic electrons,
once the semiconducting electrons are out of reach to thermal excitations ($T < \Delta$) and only
the metallic spectral weight inside the gap is available for impurity screening. In addition, we
analyze a hybrid system formed by a QI `sandwiched' between an armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR)
and a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip, with respective couplings set to reproduce the generic
model described above. The energy gap in the AGNR can be externally tuned by an electric-field-induced
Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We analyzed this system for realistic parameter values, using
NRG, and concluded that the reentrant SIAM, with its associated second stage Kondo, is worthy of
experimental investigation.
