Scale-invariant spatiotemporal dynamics in cortex indicates a critical state entailing interesting
properties including efficient information processing, information transition, and maximal
variability in phase synchrony. Hence, mechanisms that underlie, or are generated by criticality
in neuronal networks are of particular interest. Therefore, we presume that the existence of a coupling
between spikes and LFPs which measures the inter-neuronal interactions may enhance our understanding
of the mechanisms governing the critical behavior in the cortex. To this end, we consider a network
of $N$ excitatory neurons that reside on a regular lattice with periodic boundary conditions. The
connection between neurons, $K$, plays the role of the control parameter that is expected to generate
criticality when the critical cooperation strength, $K_c$, is adopted. Here, we show that spike-LFP
coupling (SPC), quantified by the phase locking value (PLV), is positively correlated with the
inter-neuronal connectivity strength. We find a continuous transition from irregular spiking
(i.e., zero PLV) to a phase locked state at a critical point, soaring to its maximum level (i.e., one).
We also studied the effect of input noise and current to individual neurons, and found that SPC is
attenuated as the noise or input current are increased. Moreover, we deploy the finite-size scaling
analysis to obtain the universality of this transition. We also show that the neuronal avalanches
created at this critical point, display a remarkable scaling behavior in a fair agreement with the
predicted theoretical and experimental values reported before. We conclude that SPC can play the
role of an order parameter in our neural model.
