In the literature about field emission, finite elements and finite differences techniques are
being increasingly employed to understand the local field enhancement factor (FEF) via numerical
simulations. In theoretical analyses, it is usual to consider the emitter as isolated, i.e, a single
tip field emitter infinitely far from any physical boundary, except the substrate. However, simulation
domains must be finite and the simulation boundaries influences the electrostatic potential distribution.
In either finite elements or finite differences techniques, there is a systematic error ($\epsilon$)
in the FEF caused by the finite size of the simulation domain. It is attempting to oversize the domain
to avoid any influence from the boundaries, however, the computation might become memory and time
consuming, especially in full three dimensional analyses. In this work, we provide the minimum
width and height of the simulation domain necessary to evaluate the FEF with $\epsilon$ at the desired
tolerance. The minimum width ($A$) and height ($B$) are given relative to the height of the emitter
($h$), that is, $(A/h)_{min} \times (B/h)_{min}$ necessary to simulate isolated emitters on a
substrate. We also provide the $(B/h)_{min}$ to simulate arrays and the $(A/h)_{min}$ to simulate
an emitter between an anode-cathode planar capacitor. At last, we present the formulae to obtain
the minimal domain size to simulate clusters of emitters with precision $\epsilon_{tol}$. Our
formulae account for ellipsoidal emitters and hemisphere on cylindrical posts. In the latter case,
where an analytical solution is not known at present, our results are expected to produce an unprecedented
numerical accuracy in the corresponding local FEF.
