Diamond has outstanding physical properties: the hardest known material, a wide band gap, the highest
thermal conductivity, and a very high Debye temperature. In 2004, Ekimov et al. discovered that
heavily boron-doped (B-doped) diamond becomes a superconductor around 4 K. Our group successfully
controlled the boron concentration and synthesized homoepitaxially grown superconducting diamond
films by a CVD method. By CVD method, we found that superconductivity appears when the boron concentration
(nB) exceeds a metal-insulator transition concentration of 3.0x10^20 cm^-3 and its Tczero increases
up to 7.4 K with increasing nB. We additionally elucidated that the holes formed at the valence band
are responsible for the metallic states leading to superconductivity. The calculations predicted
that the hole doping into the valence band induces strong attractive interaction and a rapid increase
in Tc with increasing boron concentration. According to the calculations, if substitutional doped
boron could be arranged periodically or the degree of disorder is reduced, a Tc of approximately
100 K could be achieved via minimal percent doping. In this work, we have successfully observed zero
resistivity above 10 K and an onset of resistivity reduction at 25.2 K in heavily B-doped diamond
film. However, the effective carrier concentration is similar to that of superconducting diamond
with a lower Tc. We found that the carrier has a longer mean free path and lifetime than previously
reported, indicating that this highest Tc diamond has better crystallinity compared to that of
other superconducting diamond films. In addition, the susceptibility shows a small transition
above 20 K in the high quality diamond, suggesting a signature of superconductivity above 20 K. These
results strongly suggest that heavier carrier doped defect-free crystalline diamond could give
rise to high Tc diamond.
