We study the structural, magnetic, transport and electronic properties of LaCoO$_3$ with Sr/Nb
co-substitution, i.e., La$_{(1-2x)}$Sr$_{2x}$Co$_{(1-x)}$Nb$_{x}$O$_3$ using x-ray and
neutron diffraction, dc and ac-magnetization, neutron depolarization, dc-resistivity and photoemission
measurements. The powder x-ray and neutron diffraction data were fitted well with the rhombohedral
crystal symmetry (space group \textit{R$\bar{3}$c}) in Rietveld refinement analysis. The calculated
effective magnetic moment ($\approx$3.85~$\mu_B$) and average spin ($\approx$1.5) of Co ions
from the analysis of magnetic susceptibility data are consistent with 3+ state of Co ions in intermediate-spin
(IS) and high-spin (HS) states in the ratio of $\approx$50:50, i.e., spin-state of Co$^{3+}$ is
preserved at least up to $x=$ 0.1 sample. Interestingly, the magnetization values were significantly
increased with respect to the $x=$ 0 sample, and the M-H curves show non-saturated behavior up to
an applied maximum magnetic field of $\pm$70 kOe. The ac-susceptibility data show a shift in the
freezing temperature with excitation frequency and the detailed analysis confirm the slower dynamics
and a non-zero value of the Vogel-Fulcher temperature T$_0$, which suggests for the cluster spin
glass. The unusual magnetic behavior indicates the presence of complex magnetic interactions
at low temperatures. The dc-resistivity measurements show the insulating nature in all the samples.
However, relatively large density of states $\approx$10$^{22}$ eV$^{-1}$cm$^{-3}$ and low activation
energy $\approx$130~meV are found in $x=$ 0.05 sample. Using x-ray photoemission spectroscopy,
we study the core-level spectra of La 3$d$, Co 2$p$, Sr 3$d$, and Nb 3$d$ to confirm the valence state.
