Quantum gas microscopes are a promising tool to study interacting quantum many-body systems and
bridge the gap between theoretical models and real materials. So far they were limited to measurements
of instantaneous correlation functions of the form $\langle \hat{O}(t) \rangle$, even though
extensions to frequency-resolved response functions $\langle \hat{O}(t) \hat{O}(0) \rangle$
would provide important information about the elementary excitations in a many-body system. For
example, single particle spectral functions, which are usually measured using photoemission
experiments in electron systems, contain direct information about fractionalization and the
quasiparticle excitation spectrum. Here, we propose a measurement scheme to experimentally access
the momentum and energy resolved spectral function in a quantum gas microscope with currently available
techniques. As an example for possible applications, we numerically calculate the spectrum of
a single hole excitation in one-dimensional $t-J$ models with isotropic and anisotropic antiferromagnetic
couplings. A sharp asymmetry in the distribution of spectral weight appears when a hole is created
in an isotropic Heisenberg spin chain. This effect slowly vanishes for anisotropic spin interactions
and disappears completely in the case of pure Ising interactions. The asymmetry strongly depends
on the total magnetization of the spin chain, which can be tuned in experiments with quantum gas microscopes.
An intuitive picture for the observed behavior is provided by a slave-fermion mean field theory.
The key properties of the spectra are visible at currently accessible temperatures.
