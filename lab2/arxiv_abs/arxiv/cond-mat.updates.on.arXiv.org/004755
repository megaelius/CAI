We propose a method for deriving Lindblad-like master equations when the environment/reservoir
is consigned to a classical description. We illustrate the method by considering continuous wave
(CW) magnetic resonance. We make use of a perturbation scheme we have termed "affine commutation
perturbation" (ACP). Unlike traditional perturbation methods, ACP has the advantage of incorporating
some effects of the perturbation even at the zeroth-order approximation. Indeed, we concentrate
here on the zeroth-order, and show how -- even at this lowest order -- the ACP scheme can still yield
non-trivial and equally important results. In contradistinction to the purely quantum Markovian
master equations in the literature, we explicitly keep the term linear in the system-environment
interaction -- at all orders of the perturbation. At the zeroth-order, we show that this results
in a dynamics whose map is non-CP (Completely Positive) but approaches asymptotically a CP map as
$t \to +\infty$. We also argue that this linear term accounts for the linear response of the system
to the presence of the environment -- thus the harbinger for a linear response theory (LRT) within
the confines of such (semiclassical) Lindblad-like master equations. The adiabatic process limit
of the dynamics is also defined, and considerably explored in the context of CW magnetic resonance.
Here, the same linear term emerges as the preeminent link between standard (adiabatic process)
LRT (as formulated by Kubo and co.) and Lindblad-like master equations. And with it, we show how simple
stick-plot CW magnetic resonance spectra of multispin systems can be easily generated under certain
conditions.
