Understanding correlation effects in topological phases of matter is at the forefront of current
research in condensed matter physics. Here we try to clarify some subtleties in studying topological
behaviors of interacting Weyl semimetals. It is well-known that there exist two topological invariants
defined to identify their topological character. One is the many-body Chern number, which can be
directly linked to the Hall conductivity and thus to the two-particle correlations. The other is
the topological index constructed from the single-particle Green's functions. Because the information
of Green's functions is easier to be achieved than the many-body wavefunctions, usually only the
latter is employed in the literature. However, the approach based on the single-particle Green's
function can break down in the strongly correlated phase. For illustration, an exactly solvable
two-orbital model with momentum-local two-body interactions is discussed, in which both topological
invariants can be calculated analytically. We find that the topological index calculated from
the Green's function formalism can be nonzero even for a non-topological strongly correlated phase
with vanishing many-body Chern number. In addition, we stress that the physical surface states
implied by nonzero many-body Chern numbers should be the edge modes of particle-hole collective
excitations, rather than those of quasiparticle nature derived from the Green's function formalism.
Our observations thus demonstrate the limitation of the validity of Green's function formalism
in the investigations of interacting topological materials.
