We exploit topological semi-metallic phases resulting from the Kondo screening in Anderson lattice
models. It is shown that by including spin-orbit interactions both in the bulk electrons and in the
hybridization between the conduction electrons and electrons in $f$ orbit, all types of topological
semi-metallic phases can be realized in Anderson lattice models. Specifically, upon either time-reversal
symmetry broken or inversion symmetry broken, we find that either Weyl semi-metallic phase, Dirac
semi-metallic phase or nodal-ring semi-metallic phases always emerge between insulating phases
and can be accessed by tuning either temperature or spin-orbit interaction. For Anderson lattice
models with general 3D spin-orbit hybridization between the conduction electrons and electrons
in $f$ orbit, we find that Weyl nodal-ring semi-metallic phases emerges between strong and weak
topological insulating phases. Furthermore, in the presence of an exchange field, Weyl semi-metallic
phases forms after two Weyl points of charge $\pm1$ split off from a Dirac point at time-reversal
momenta. On the other hand, when the spin-orbit interaction is included in the conduction electron,
we find that upon the rotation symmetry being broken with anisotropic hopping amplitudes, Weyl
semi-metallic phase emerges with double Weyl node of charges of $\pm2$. Furthermore, the Weyl semi-metallic
phases with charges of $\pm2$ can be tuned into Weyl semi-metallic phases with charges of $\pm1$
through the inclusion of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our analyses indicate that Anderson
lattices with appropriate spin-orbit interactions provide a platform for realizing all types
of topological semi-metallic phase
