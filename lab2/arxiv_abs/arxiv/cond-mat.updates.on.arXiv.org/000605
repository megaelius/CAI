We investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of the fully frustrated transverse field Ising
model on the square lattice both in the classical limit and in the presence of quantum fluctuations.
At the classical level (the limit of infinite spin $S$), we find that upon decreasing the transverse
field $\Gamma$ this model exhibits a phase transition from the fully polarized state into an eight-fold
degenerate translational symmetry breaking state. This phase can be identified to correspond
to plaquette order in the dimer language and remains the lowest-energy state in the entire range
of fields below the critical one, $\Gamma_c$. The eight-fold degenerate solution which corresponds
to columnar order in the dimer language is a saddle point of the classical energy. It is degenerate
with the plaquette solution at $\Gamma=0$ and is only slightly higher in energy in the whole interval
$0<\Gamma<\Gamma_c$. The effect of quantum fluctuations is investigated in the context
of a large S expansion both for the plaquette and columnar structures. For this purpose we employ
an approximate method allowing to estimate from above the fluctuation-induced correction to the
energy of a configuration which at the classical level is a saddle point of the energy, \textit{not}
a local minimum. Although the convergence of the $1/S$ expansion in the $\Gamma/J\rightarrow 0$
limit remains an open question, harmonic quantum fluctuations show a clear tendency to overcome
the energy difference between the two states and to change the classical picture favoring the columnar
order over the plaquette one in a wide parameter range.
