The two-dimensional metallic interface between lanthanum manganite and strontium iridate is
a prototypical platform for the realization of a triangular crystal of N\'eel-type skyrmions at
low temperatures in the presence of an external magnetic field, applied perpendicular to the interface.
The skyrmion crystal is stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya -type anti-symmetric spin-exchange
interaction located at the interface due to the broken structural inversion symmetry and strong
spin-orbit coupling in the iridate. We investigate spin-wave excitations emerging from the skyrmion
crystal by employing the Monte Carlo simulations and Landau-Lifshitz spin-dynamics calculations.
The computed dynamical spin structure factor $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ reveals that six modes of
spin-wave excitations appear in the skyrmion crystal at low temperatures and are supplemented
by the spin-wave mode coming from the zero-momentum magnetic ordering of the ferromagnetic background.
Above the critical temperature $T_s$ for the skyrmion crystallization, we find a diffusive regime
of temperatures that confirms previous experimental findings that skyrmionic correlation starts
to develop above $T_s$ as the precursor of the long-range skyrmion crystal order. We also explore
the spin-wave excitations originating from the spin spiral phase that is stabilized spontaneously
at zero magnetic field. We discuss the challenges and opportunities for the experimental detection
of these spin-wave excitations of the skyrmion crystal in inelastic neutron-scattering experiments
based on multi-layer superlattices of the manganite-iridate heterostructure.
