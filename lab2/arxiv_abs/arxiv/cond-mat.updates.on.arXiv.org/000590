In this work, we present recent developments in magnonic holographic memory devices exploiting
spin waves for information transfer. The devices comprise a magnetic matrix and spin wave generating/detecting
elements placed on the edges of the waveguides. The matrix consists of a grid of magnetic waveguides
connected via cross junctions. Magnetic memory elements are incorporated within the junction
while the read-in and read-out is accomplished by the spin waves propagating through the waveguides.
We present experimental data on spin wave propagation through NiFe and YIG magnetic crosses. The
obtained experimental data show prominent spin wave signal modulation (up to 20 dB for NiFe and 35
dB for YIG) by the external magnetic field, where both the strength and the direction of the magnetic
field define the transport between the cross arms. We also present experimental data on the 2-bit
magnonic holographic memory built on the double cross YIG structure with micro-magnets placed
on the top of each cross. It appears possible to recognize the state of each magnet via the interference
pattern produced by the spin waves with all experiments done at room temperature. Magnonic holographic
devices aim to combine the advantages of magnetic data storage with wave-based information transfer.
We present estimates on the spin wave holographic devices performance, including power consumption
and functional throughput. According to the estimates, magnonic holographic devices may provide
data processing rates higher than 10^18 bits/cm2/s while consuming 0.15uW. Technological challenges
and fundamental physical limits of this approach are also discussed.
