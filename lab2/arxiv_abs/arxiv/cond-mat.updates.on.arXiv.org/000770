Machine learning (ML) of quantum mechanical properties shows promise for accelerating chemical
discovery. For transition metal chemistry where accurate calculations are computationally costly
and available training data sets are small, the molecular representation becomes a critical ingredient
in ML model predictive accuracy. We introduce a series of revised autocorrelation functions (RACs)
that encode relationships between the heuristic atomic properties (e.g., size, connectivity,
and electronegativity) on a molecular graph. We alter the starting point, scope, and nature of the
quantities evaluated in standard ACs to make these RACs amenable to inorganic chemistry. On an organic
molecule set, we first demonstrate superior standard AC performance to other presently-available
topological descriptors for ML model training, with mean unsigned errors (MUEs) for atomization
energies on set-aside test molecules as low as 6 kcal/mol. For inorganic chemistry, our RACs yield
1 kcal/mol ML MUEs on set-aside test molecules in spin-state splitting in comparison to 15-20x higher
errors from feature sets that encode whole-molecule structural information. Systematic feature
selection methods including univariate filtering, recursive feature elimination, and direct
optimization (e.g., random forest and LASSO) are compared. Random-forest- or LASSO-selected
subsets 4-5x smaller than RAC-155 produce sub- to 1-kcal/mol spin-splitting MUEs, with good transferability
to metal-ligand bond length prediction (0.004-5 {\AA} MUE) and redox potential on a smaller data
set (0.2-0.3 eV MUE). Evaluation of feature selection results across property sets reveals the
relative importance of local, electronic descriptors (e.g., electronegativity, atomic number)
in spin-splitting and distal, steric effects in redox potential and bond lengths.
