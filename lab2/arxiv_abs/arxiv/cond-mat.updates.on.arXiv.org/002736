Semi-local approximations to the density functional for the exchange-correlation energy of a
many-electron system necessarily fail for lobed one-electron densities, including not only the
familiar stretched densities but also the less familiar but closely-related noded ones. The Perdew-Zunger
(PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) to a semi-local approximation makes that approximation
exact for all one-electron ground- or excited-state densities and accurate for stretched bonds.
When the minimization of the PZ total energy is made over real localized orbitals, the orbital densities
can be noded, leading to energy errors in many-electron systems. Minimization over complex localized
orbitals yields nodeless orbital densities, which reduce but typically do not eliminate the SIC
errors of atomization energies. Other errors of PZ SIC remain, attributable to the loss of the exact
constraints and appropriate norms that the semi-local approximations satisfy, and suggesting
the need for a generalized SIC. These conclusions are supported by calculations for one-electron
densities, and for many-electron molecules. While PZ SIC raises and improves the energy barriers
of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) and meta-GGA's, it reduces and often
worsens the atomization energies of molecules. Thus PZ SIC raises the energy more as the nodality
of the valence localized orbitals increases from atoms to molecules to transition states. PZ SIC
is applied here in particular to the SCAN meta-GGA, for which the correlation part is already self-interaction-free.
That property makes SCAN a natural first candidate for a generalized SIC.
