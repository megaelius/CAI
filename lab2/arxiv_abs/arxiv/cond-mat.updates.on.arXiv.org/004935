Lead halide perovskite-based photoactive layers are nowadays employed for a large number of optoelectronic
applications, from solar cells to photodetectors and light-emitting diodes, because of their
excellent absorption, emission and charge-transport properties. Unfortunately, their commercialization
is still hindered by an intrinsic instability towards classical environmental conditions. Water
in particular promotes fast decomposition, leading to a drastic decrease in device performance.
An innovative functional approach to overcome this major issue could derive from integrating water-splitting
active species within charge extracting layers adjacent to the perovskite photoactive layer,
converting incoming water molecules into molecular oxygen and hydrogen before they reach this
last one, thus preserving device performance in time. In this work we report for the first time on
a perovskite-ancillary layer based on CuSCN nanoplateletes dispersed in a p-type semiconducting
polymeric matrix, combining hole extraction/transport properties with good water-oxidation
activity, that transforms incoming water molecules and further triggers the in situ p-doping of
the conjugated polymer by means of the produced dioxygen, further improving transport of photogenerated
charges. This composite layer enables the long-term stabilization of a mixed cation lead halide
perovskite within a direct solar cell architecture, maintaining a stable performance for 28 days
in high-moisture simulated conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the engineering of a hole
extraction layer with water-splitting active additives represent a valuable strategy to mitigate
the degradation of perovskite solar cells exposed to atmospheric humidity. A similar approach
could be employed in the future to improve stabilities of other optoelectronic devices based on
water-sensitive species.
