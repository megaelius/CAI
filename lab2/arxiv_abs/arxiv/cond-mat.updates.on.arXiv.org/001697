Hydrogen bonding plays a role in the microphase separation behavior of many block copolymers, such
as those used in lithography, where the stronger interactions due to H-bonding can lead to a smaller
period for the self-assembled structures, allowing the production of higher resolution templates.
However, current statistical thermodynamic models used in descriptions of microphase separation,
such as the Flory-Huggins approach, do not take into account some important properties of hydrogen
bonding, such as site specificity and cooperativity. In this combined theoretical and experimental
study, a step is taken toward the development of a more complete theory of hydrogen bonding in polymers,
using polyacrylamide as a model system. We begin by developing a set of association models to describe
hydrogen bonding in amides. Both models with one association constant and two association constants
are considered. This theory is used to fit IR spectroscopy data from acrylamide solutions in chloroform,
thereby determining the model parameters. These parameters are then employed to calculate the
scattering function of the disordered state of a diblock copolymer with one polyacrylamide block
and one non-hydrogen-bonding block in the random phase approximation. It is then shown that the
expression for the inverse scattering function with hydrogen bonding is the same as that without
hydrogen bonding, but with the Flory-Huggins parameter $\chi$ replaced by an effective value $\chi_\text{eff}=\chi+\delta\chi_\text{HB}\left(f\right)$,
where the hydrogen-bonding contribution $\delta\chi_\text{HB}$ depends on the volume fraction
$f$ of the hydrogen-bonding block. We find that models with two constants give better predictions
of bond energy in the acrylamide dimer and more realistic asymptotic behavior of the association
constants and $\delta\chi_\text{HB}$ in the limit of high temperatures.
