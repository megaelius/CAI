To reduce material and processing costs of commercial permanent magnets and to attempt to fill the
empty niche of energy products, 10 - 20 MGOe, between low-flux (ferrites, alnico) and high-flux
(Nd2Fe14B- and SmCo5-type) magnets, we report synthesis, structure, magnetic properties and
modeling of Ta, Cu and Fe substituted CeCo5. Using a self-flux technique, we grew single crystals
of I - Ce15.1Ta1.0Co74.4Cu9.5, II - Ce16.3Ta0.6Co68.9Cu14.2, III - Ce15.7Ta0.6Co67.8Cu15.9,
IV - Ce16.3Ta0.3Co61.7Cu21.7 and V - Ce14.3Ta1.0Co62.0Fe12.3Cu10.4. X-ray diffraction analysis
(XRD) showed that these materials retain a CaCu5 substructure and incorporate small amounts of
Ta in the form of \dumb-bells", filling the 2e crystallographic sites within the 1D hexagonal channel
with the 1a Ce site, whereas Co, Cu and Fe are statistically distributed among the 2c and 3g crystallographic
sites. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) examinations provided strong evidence of the single-phase
nature of the as-grown crystals, even though they readily exhibited significant magnetic coercivitie
of ~1.6 - ~1.8 kOe caused by Co-enriched, nano-sized, structural defects and faults that can serve
as pinning sites. Formation of the "composite crystal" during the heat treatment creates a 3D array
of extended defects within a primarily single grain single crystal, which greatly improves its
magnetic characteristics. Possible causes of the formation of the "composite crystal" may be associated
with Ta atoms leaving matrix interstices at lower temperatures and/or matrix degradation induced
by decreased miscibility at lower temperatures. Fe strongly improves both the Curie temperature
and magnetization of the system resulting in (BH)max:~13 MGOe at room temperature.
