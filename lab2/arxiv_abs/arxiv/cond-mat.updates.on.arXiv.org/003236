The zero-temperature phase diagram of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $J_{1}$--$J_{2}$--$J_{1}^{\perp}$
model on an $AA$-stacked square-lattice bilayer is studied using the coupled cluster method implemented
to very high orders. Both nearest-neighbor (NN) and frustrating next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg
exchange interactions, of strengths $J_{1}>0$ and $J_{2} \equiv \kappa J_{1}>0$, respectively,
are included in each layer. The two layers are coupled via a NN interlayer Heisenberg exchange interaction
with a strength $J_{1}^{\perp} \equiv \delta J_{1}$. The magnetic order parameter $M$ (viz., the
sublattice magnetization) is calculated directly in the thermodynamic (infinite-lattice) limit
for the two cases when both layers have antiferromagnetic ordering of either the N\'{e}el or the
striped kind, and with the layers coupled so that NN spins between them are either parallel (when
$\delta < 0$) or antiparallel (when $\delta > 0$) to one another. Calculations are performed at $n$th
order in a well-defined sequence of approximations, which exactly preserve both the Goldstone
linked cluster theorem and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, with $n \leq 10$. The sole approximation
made is to extrapolate such sequences of $n$th-order results for $M$ to the exact limit, $n \to \infty$.
By thus locating the points where $M$ vanishes, we calculate the full phase boundaries of the two
collinear AFM phases in the $\kappa$--$\delta$ half-plane with $\kappa > 0$. In particular, we
provide the accurate estimate, ($\kappa \approx 0.547,\delta \approx -0.45$), for the position
of the quantum triple point (QTP) in the region $\delta < 0$. We also show that there is no counterpart
of such a QTP in the region $\delta > 0$, where the two quasiclassical phase boundaries show instead
an ``avoided crossing'' behavior, such that the entire region that contains the nonclassical paramagnetic
phases is singly connected.
