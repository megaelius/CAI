Harnessing the unique properties of non-collinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) will be essential
for exploiting the full potential of antiferromagnetic spintronics. Indeed, many of the effects
enabling ferromagnetic spintronic devices have a corresponding counterpart in materials with
non-collinear spin structure. In addition, new phenomena such as the magnetic spin Hall effect
were experimentally observed in non-collinear AFMs, and the presence of the equivalent to the ferromagnetic
spin transfer torque via spin polarized currents was theoretically predicted. In spite of these
developments, an interpretation of the rich physical phenomena observed in non-collinear antiferromagnets
is challenging, since the microscopic spin arrangement, the magnetic domain distribution, and
the domain orientations have proven notoriously difficult to access experimentally. This is all
the more problematic, as imaging and writing magnetic domains is of central importance for applications.
Successful imaging is a basic requirement to experimentally confirm the spin transfer torque acting
on non-collinear domain walls and therefore of eminent interest. Here, we demonstrate that the
local magnetic structure of the non-collinear AFM Mn3Sn films can be imaged by scanning thermal
gradient microscopy (STGM). The technique is based on scanning a laser spot over the sample's surface,
and recording the ensuing thermo-voltage. We image the magnetic structure at a series of different
temperatures and show that at room temperature, the domain structure is not affected by the application
of moderate magnetic fields. In addition to imaging, we establish a scheme for heat-assisted magnetic
recording, using local laser heating in combination with magnetic fields to intentionally write
domain patterns into the antiferromagnet.
