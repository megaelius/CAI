In this work, we first perform a systematic search for high-efficiency three-dimensional (3D)
and two-dimensional (2D) thermoelectric materials by combining semiclassical transport techniques
with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and then train machine-learning models on the
thermoelectric data. Out of 36000 three-dimensional and 900 two-dimensional materials currently
in the publicly available JARVIS-DFT database, we identify 2932 3D and 148 2D promising thermoelectric
materials using a multi-steps screening procedure, where specific thresholds are chosen for key
quantities like bandgaps, Seebeck coefficients and power factors. We compute the Seebeck coefficients
for all the materials currently in the database and validate our calculations by comparing our results,
for a subset of materials, to experimental and existing computational datasets. We also investigate
the effect of chemical, structural, crystallographic and dimensionality trends on thermoelectric
performance. We predict several classes of efficient 3D and 2D materials such as Ba(MgX)2 (X=P,As,Bi),
X2YZ6 (X=K,Rb, Y=Pd,Pt, Z=Cl,Br), K2PtX2(X=S,Se), NbCu3X4 (X=S,Se,Te), Sr2XYO6 (X=Ta, Zn, Y=Ga,
Mo), TaCu3X4 (X=S, Se,Te), and XYN (X=Ti, Zr, Y=Cl, Br). Finally, as high-throughput DFT is computationally
expensive, we train machine learning models using gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) and
classical force-field inspired descriptors (CFID) for n-and p-type Seebeck coefficients and
power factors, to quickly pre-screen materials for guiding the next set of DFT calculations. The
