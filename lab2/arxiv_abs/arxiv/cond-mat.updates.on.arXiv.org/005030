The predictive performance screening of novel compounds can significantly promote the discovery
of efficient, cheap, and non-toxic thermoelectric materials. Large efforts to implement machine-learning
techniques coupled to materials databases are currently being undertaken, but the adopted computational
methods can dramatically affect the outcome. With regards to electronic transport and power factor
calculations, the most widely adopted and computationally efficient method, is the constant relaxation
time approximation (CRT). This work goes beyond the CRT and adopts the proper, full energy and momentum
dependencies of electron-phonon and ionized impurity scattering, to compute the electronic transport
and perform power factor optimization for a group of half-Heusler alloys. Then the material parameters
that determine the optimal power factor based on this more advanced treatment are identified. This
enables the development of a set of significantly improved descriptors that can be used in materials
screening studies, and which offer deeper insights into the underlying nature of high performance
thermoelectric materials. We have identified $n_v$$\epsilon_r$ / $D_o^2m_{cond}$ as the most
useful and generic descriptor, a combination of the number of valleys, the dielectric constant,
the conductivity effective mass, and the deformation potential for the dominant electron-phonon
process. The proposed descriptors can accelerate the discovery of new efficient and environment
friendly thermoelectric materials in a much more accurate and reliable manner, and some predictions
for very high performance materials are presented.
