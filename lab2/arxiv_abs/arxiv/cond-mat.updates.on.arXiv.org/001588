The genetic material of a eukaryotic cell comprises both nuclear DNA (ncDNA) and mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA). These differ markedly in several aspects but nevertheless must encode proteins that
are compatible with one another. Here we introduce a network model of the hypothetical co-evolution
of the two most common modes of cellular division for reproduction: by mitosis (supporting asexual
reproduction) and by meiosis (supporting sexual reproduction). Our model is based on a random hypergraph,
with two nodes for each possible genotype, each encompassing both ncDNA and mtDNA. One of the nodes
is necessarily generated by mitosis occurring at a parent genotype, the other by meiosis occurring
at two parent genotypes. A genotype's fitness depends on the compatibility of its ncDNA and mtDNA.
The model has two probability parameters, $p$ and $r$, the former accounting for the diversification
of ncDNA during meiosis, the latter for the diversification of mtDNA accompanying both meiosis
and mitosis. Another parameter, $\lambda$, is used to regulate the relative rate at which mitosis-
and meiosis-generated genotypes are produced. We have found that, even though $p$ and $r$ do affect
the existence of evolutionary pathways in the network, the crucial parameter regulating the coexistence
of the two modes of cellular division is $\lambda$. Depending on genotype size, $\lambda$ can be
valued so that either mode of cellular division prevails. Our study is closely related to a recent
hypothesis that views the appearance of cellular division by meiosis, as opposed to division by
mitosis, as an evolutionary strategy for boosting ncDNA diversification to keep up with that of
mtDNA. Our results indicate that this may well have been the case, thus lending support to the first
hypothesis in the field to take into account the role of such ubiquitous and essential organelles
as mitochondria.
