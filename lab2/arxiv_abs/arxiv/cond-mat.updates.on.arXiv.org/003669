A colloidal particle is a prominent example of a stochastic system, and, if suspended in a simple
viscous liquid, very closely resembles the case of an ideal random walker. A variety of new phenomena
have been observed when such colloid is suspended in a viscoelastic fluid instead, for example pronounced
nonlinear responses when the viscoelastic bath is driven out of equilibrium. Here, using a micron-sized
particle in a micellar solution, we investigate in detail, how these nonlinear bath properties
leave their fingerprints already in equilibrium measurements, for the cases where the particle
is unconfined or trapped in a harmonic potential. We find that the coefficients in an effective linear
(generalized) Langevin equation show intriguing inter-dependencies, which can be shown to arise
only in nonlinear baths: For example, the friction memory can depend on the external potential that
acts only on the colloidal particle (as recently noted in simulations of molecular tracers in water
in {\it Phys.~Rev.~X} {\bf 7}, 041065 (2017)), it can depend on the mass of the colloid, or, in an overdamped
setting, on its bare diffusivity. These inter-dependencies, caused by so-called fluctuation
renormalizations, are seen in an exact small time expansion of the friction memory based on microscopic
starting points. Using linear response theory, they can be interpreted in terms of microrheological
modes of force-controlled or velocity-controlled driving. The mentioned nonlinear markers are
observed in our experiments, which are astonishingly well reproduced by a stochastic Prandtl-Tomlinson
model mimicking the nonlinear viscoelastic bath. The pronounced nonlinearities seen in our experiments
together with the good understanding in a simple theoretical model make this system a promising
candidate for exploration of colloidal motion in nonlinear stochastic environments.
