We revisit the effective parameter description of hot Brownian motion -- a scenario where a colloidal
particle is kept at an elevated temperature than the ambient fluid. Due to the time scale separation
between heat diffusion and particle motion, a stationary halo of hot fluid is carried along with
the particle, resulting in a spatially varying comoving temperature and viscosity profile. The
resultant Brownian motion in the overdamped limit can be well described by a Langevin equation with
effective parameters such as effective temperature $T_{\rm HBM}$ and friction coefficient $\zeta_{\rm
HBM}$ that quantifies the thermal fluctuations and the diffusivity of the particle. These parameters
can exactly be calculated using the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics. Additionally, it
was also observed that configurational and the kinetic degrees of freedom admits to different effective
temperatures, $T^{\mathbf{x}}_{\rm HBM}$ and $T^{\mathbf{v}}_{\rm HBM}$, respectively, with
the former predicted accurately from fluctuating hydrodynamics. A more rigorous calculation
by Falasco et. al. Physical Review E , 90, $032131(2014)$ extends the overdamped description to
a generalized Langevin equation where the effective temperature becomes frequency dependent
and consequently, for any temperature measurement from a Brownian trajectory requires the knowledge
of this frequency dependence. We use this framework to expand on this earlier work and look at the
first order correction to the effective temperature. The effective temperature is calculated
from the weighted average of the temperature field with the dissipation function. Further, we provide
a closed form analytical result for effective temperature in the small as well high frequency limit
and using this we determine the kinetic temperature from the generalized Langevin equation and
the Wiener-Khinchine theorem.
