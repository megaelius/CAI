We use a simple yet Earth-like global atmospheric model to propose a new framework for the mathematical
properties of blocking events. Using finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we show that the occurrence
of blockings is associated to conditions featuring anomalously high instability, and that the
lifetime of a blocking is positively correlated with such an anomaly. In the case of Atlantic blockings,
predictability is especially reduced at the onset and decay of the blocking event, while a relative
increase of predictability is found in the mature phase, while the opposite holds for Pacific blockings.
We then associate blockings to a specific class of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs), natural modes
of variability that cover the attractor the system. The UPOs associated to blockings are indeed
anomalously unstable: the onset of the blocking takes place when the trajectory of the system hops
into the neighbourhood of one of these special UPOs. The stronger the instability, the less frequent
is such an event. The decay takes place when the trajectory hops back to the neighbourhood of usual,
less unstable UPOs associated to zonal flow. The analysis of UPOs elucidates that the model features
a very strong violations of hyperbolicity, due to the variability of the number of unstable dimensions,
which explains why different states of the atmosphere can have a very different degree of predictability.
We propose that such a severe violation of hyperbolicity is responsible for the existence of a new
fundamental issue - on top of chaos - limiting our ability to construction of very accurate numerical
models of the atmosphere, in term of predictability of the both the first and the second kind. The
resulting lack of robustness might be a fundamental cause contributing to the difficulty of predicting
how blockings will respond to climate change.
