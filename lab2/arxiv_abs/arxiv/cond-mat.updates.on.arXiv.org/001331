We argue that the kosmotropes remain strongly hydrated in the vicinity of a hydrophobic surface,
while the chaotropes lose their hydration shell and can become adsorbed to the interface. The mechanism
of adsorption is still a subject of debate. We argue that there are two driving forces for anionic
adsorption: the hydrophobic cavitational energy and the interfacial electrostatic surface potential
of water. While the cavitational contribution to ionic adsorption is now well accepted, the role
of the electrostatic surface potential is much less clear. The difficulty is that even the sign of
this potential is a subject of debate, with the ab initio and the classical force field simulations
predicting electrostatic surface potentials of opposite sign. In this paper, we will argue that
the strong anionic adsorption found in the polarizable force field simulations is the result of
the artificial electrostatic surface potential present in the classical water models. We will
show that if the adsorption of anions were as large as predicted by the polarizable force field simulations,
the excess surface tension of the NaI solution would be strongly negative, contrary to the experimental
measurements. While the large polarizability of heavy halides is a fundamental property and must
be included in realistic modeling of the electrolyte solutions, we argue that the point charge water
models, studied so far, are incompatible with the polarizable ionic force fields when the translational
symmetry is broken. The goal for the future should be the development of water models with very low
electrostatic surface potential. We believe that such water models will be compatible with the
polarizable force fields, which can then be used to study the interaction of ions with hydrophobic
surfaces and proteins.
