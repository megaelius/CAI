The effect of weak non-magnetic disorder on $s$-wave superconductivity in ordinary metals can
be formally described by the Abrikosov-Gorkov diagrammatic formalism. Within this formalism,
the vertex correction is unimportant because the inequality $k_F l \gg 1$, where $k_F$ is the Fermi
momentum and $l$ mean free path, is satisfied in ordinary metals with a large Fermi surface. In a Dirac
semimetal that has discrete Fermi points, this inequality breaks down since $k_F \rightarrow 0$
and the vertex correction could be important. We incorporate the vertex correction into the Abrikosov-Gorkov
formalism and then apply this approach to examine how superconductivity is affected by random chemical
potential in two- and three-dimensional Dirac semimetals, as well as two-dimensional semi-Dirac
semimetal. In the clean limit, superconductivity is formed only when the pairing interaction strength
is greater than some critical value in these materials. Adding random chemical potential promotes
superconductivity by generating a finite zero-energy density of states. In slightly disordered
three-dimensional Dirac semimetal, the critical strength is reduced, but remains finite. In the
rest cases, there is no quantum critical point and superconductivity is induced by arbitrarily
weak attraction. Including the vertex correction does not change the above qualitative result.
However, the vertex correction plays a vital role in the precise determination of the superconducting
gap. Actually, the gap could be severely underestimated if the vertex correction is neglected.
Bilayer graphene is quite special because its zero-energy density of states is nonzero despite
the existence of Fermi points. Due to this peculiar property, superconductivity is always suppressed
by random chemical potential.
