With the achievement on the additive manufacturing, the mechanical properties of architectured
materials can be precisely designed by tailoring microstructures. As one of the primary design
objectives, the elastic isotropy is of great significance for many engineering applications.
However, the prevailing experimental and numerical methods are normally too costly and time-consuming
to determine the elastic isotropy of architectured materials with tens of thousands of possible
microstructures in design space. The quick mechanical characterization is thus desired for the
advanced design of architectured materials. Here, a deep learning-based approach is developed
as a portable and efficient tool to identify the elastic isotropy of architectured materials directly
from the images of their representative microstructures with arbitrary component distributions.
The measure of elastic isotropy for architectured materials is derived firstly in this paper to
construct a database with associated images of microstructures. Then a convolutional neural network
is trained with the database. It is found that the convolutional neural network shows good performance
on the isotropy identification. Meanwhile, it exhibits enough robustness to maintain the performance
under fluctuated material properties in practical fabrications. Moreover, the well-trained
convolutional neural network can be successfully transferred among different types of architectured
materials, including two-phase composites and porous materials, which greatly enhance the efficiency
of the deep learning-based approach. This study can give new inspirations on the fast mechanical
characterization for the big-data driven design of architectured materials.
