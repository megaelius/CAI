Depositing thin and thick films through different types of deposition units is a topic of great interest.
In deposition chamber, each synthesis is carried out at some value of chamber pressure. In addition
to different gases in deposition chamber, photon energy also exists. On dissociation of gases by
hot-filaments, the conversion rate of gaseous carbon atoms into graphite and diamond atoms varies
largely at varying chamber pressures. Increase in the chamber pressure from 3.3 kPa to 14 kPa changes
the morphology and structure of carbon films comprising tiny grains, grains and particles. The
increase in chamber pressure upto 8.6 kPa increases the growth rate of a carbon film along with discernible
features of grains and particles. For intermediate set chamber pressures, the conversion rate
of gaseous carbon atoms into diamond state is high. At high set chamber pressures, gaseous carbon
atoms converted into graphite state at high rate. However, film with low growth rate is deposited.
At fixed input power, temperature of the hot-filaments changes due to contamination. So, collision
rate of gases is also varied at varying chamber pressures. As a result, a different amount of atomic
hydrogen is dissociated. Hence, a different amount of typical energy is etched. Atomic hydrogen
etches the photon energy into typical energy shape like parabola, which is involved in the conversion
of gaseous carbon atoms into graphite and diamond states. Graphite atoms bind under the same involved
energy. Atomic hydrogen etches the photon energy and unused parabola shaped energy into typical
energy shape like golf-stick, too, which is involved in the process of binding diamond atoms. So,
this study sets new trends in the deposition of carbon films.
