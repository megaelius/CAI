In many natural multi-layered composites, such as in the dactyl club of Stomatopods or the shell
of bivalve mollusks, the defining functional and structural properties are determined by locally
varying orientations of inorganic building blocks within each layer. One approach to artificially
produce textured microstructures inspired by such complex composites is magnetically assisted
slip-casting (MASC). MASC is a colloidal process in which anisotropic particles are oriented at
arbitrarily defined angles using a magnetic field. The orientation of the particles is maintained
during growth as particles are collected from the wall of a porous mold. Whereas a number of proof-of-concept
studies have established the potential of the technique, the full design space available for MASC-fabricated
structures, and the limits of the approach, have so far not been explored in a systematic manner.
To fill this gap, we have studied both theoretically and experimentally the various torques that
act on the particles at different stage of the assembly process. We define the boundary conditions
of the MASC process for magnetically responsive alumina platelets suspended in a low-viscosity
aqueous suspension, considering the composition of the colloidal suspension and the dynamics
of the particle-alignment process under a rotating magnetic field. Taken together, these findings
define a design strategy for the fabrication of designed multi-lamellar microstructures using
MASC. Our guidelines are based on a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms governing
the orientation and assembly of anisotropic particles during MASC and indicate a route to expanding
this technique to building blocks of various chemistries, and thus to broadening the range of bio-inspired
composites with customized multi-scale structures that can be produced for specific applications.
