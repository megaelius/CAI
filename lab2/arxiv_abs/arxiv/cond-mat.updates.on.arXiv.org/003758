An old problem in mathematical physics deals with the structure of the dispersion relation of the
Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta+V(x)$ in $\R^n$ with periodic potential near the edges of the
spectrum, i.e.\ near extrema of the dispersion relation. A well known and widely believed conjecture
says that generically (with respect to perturbations of the periodic potential) the extrema are
attained by a single branch of the dispersion relation, are isolated, and have non-degenerate Hessian
(i.e., dispersion relations are graphs of Morse functions). In particular, the important notion
of effective masses hinges upon this property. The progress in proving this conjecture has been
slow. It is natural to try to look at discrete problems, where the dispersion relation is (in appropriate
coordinates) an algebraic, rather than analytic, variety. Moreover, such models are often used
for computation in solid state physics (the tight binding model). Alas, counterexamples exist
showing that the genericity fails in some discrete situations. We consider a general periodic discrete
operator depending polynomially on some parameters. We prove the natural dichotomy: the non-degeneracy
of extrema either fails or holds in the complement of a proper algebraic subset of the parameters.
Thus, a random choice of a point in the parameter space gives the correct answer ``with probability
one.'' We then use methods from computational and combinatorial algebraic geometry to prove the
genericity conjecture for a particular diatomic $\Z^2$-periodic structure with many free parameters.
Here several new approaches to the genericity problem introduced and many examples of both alternatives
are provided.
