We present a systematic study of the properties of TiN films by varying the deposition conditions
in an ultra-high-vacuum reactive magnetron sputtering chamber. By increasing the deposition
pressure from 2 to 9 mTorr while keeping a nearly stoichiometric composition of Ti(1-x)N(x) (x=0.5),
the film resistivity increases, the dominant crystal orientation changes from (100) to (111),
grain boundaries become clearer, and the strong compressive strain changes to weak tensile strain.
The TiN films absorb a high concentration of contaminants including hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen
when they are exposed to air after deposition. With the target-substrate distance set to 88 mm the
contaminant levels increase from ~0.1% to ~10% as the pressure is increased from 2 to 9 mTorr. The
contaminant concentrations also correlate with in-plane distance from the center of the substrate
and increase by roughly two orders of magnitude as the target-substrate distance is increased from
88 mm to 266 mm. These contaminants are found to strongly influence the properties of TiN films. For
instance, the resistivity of stoichiometric films increases by around a factor of 5 as the oxygen
content increases from 0.1% to 11%. These results suggest that the sputtered TiN particle energy
is critical in determining the TiN film properties, and that it is important to control this energy
to obtain high-quality TiN films. Superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators made from a series
of nearly stoichiometric films grown at pressures from 2 mTorr to 7 mTorr show an increase in intrinsic
quality factor from ~10^4 to ~10^6 as the magnitude of the compressive strain decreases from nearly
3800 MPa to approximately 150 MPa and the oxygen content increases from 0.1% to 8%. The films with
a higher oxygen content exhibit lower loss, but the nonuniformity of the oxygen incorporation hinders
the use of sputtered TiN in larger circuits.
