Graphene quantum dots (GQD's) have optical properties which are very different from those of an
extended graphene sheet. In this Article we explore how the size, shape and edge--structure of a
GQD affect its optical conductivity. Using representation theory, we derive optical selection
rules for regular-shaped dots, starting from the symmetry properties of the current operator.
We find that, where the x- and y-components of the current operator transform with the same irreducible
representation (irrep) of the point group - for example in triangular or hexagonal GQD's - the optical
conductivity is independent of the polarisation of the light. On the other hand, where these components
transform with different irreps - for example in rectangular GQD's - the optical conductivity depends
on the polarisation of light. We find that GQD's with non-commuting point-group operations - for
example dots of rectangular shape - can be distinguished from GQD's with commuting point-group
operations - for example dots of triangular or hexagonal shape - by using polarized light. We carry
out explicit calculations of the optical conductivity of GQD's described by a simple tight--binding
model and, for dots of intermediate size, \textcolor{blue}{($10 \lesssim L \lesssim 50\ \text{nm}$)}
find an absorption peak in the low--frequency range of the spectrum which allows us to distinguish
between dots with zigzag and armchair edges. We also clarify the one-dimensional nature of states
at the van Hove singularity in graphene, providing a possible explanation for very high exciton-binding
energies. Finally we discuss the role of atomic vacancies and shape asymmetry.
