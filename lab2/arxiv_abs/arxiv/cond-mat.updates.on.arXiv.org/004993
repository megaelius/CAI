Clustering of ligand-binding receptors of different types on thickened isles of the cell membrane,
namely lipid rafts, is an experimentally observed phenomenon. Although its influence on cell response
is deeply investigated, the role of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics
involving the active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding has not
yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),
which regulate specific cell processes through chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic
balance between the cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the intracellular
environment and its efflux, mediated by Multidrug Resistance Proteins (MRPs) transporters. This
paper develops a multiphysics approach based on the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical
changes and mass balance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and kinetics
of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon both the kinematics and the changes
of species densities, balance of mass and of linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time
evolution of the cell membrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering
of the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active receptors -in agreement
with experimentally observed cAMP levels- and how the latter trigger rafts formation and cluster
on such sites. Within the current scientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on the basis of the ascertained fact that lipid rafts often serve as an entry port
for viruses, it is felt that approaches accounting for strong coupling among mechanobiological
aspects could even turn helpful in better understanding membrane-mediated phenomena such as COVID-19
virus-cell interaction.
