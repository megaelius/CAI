Capturing the interplay between electronic correlations and many-particle entanglement requires
a unified framework for Hamiltonian and eigenbasis renormalization. In this work, we apply the
unitary renormalization group (URG) scheme developed in a companion work (Ref.[1]) to the study
of two archetypal models of stongly correlated lattice electrons, one with translation invariance
and one without. We obtain detailed insight into the emergence of various gapless and gapped phases
of quantum electronic matter by computing effective Hamiltonians as well as entanglement signatures
through their respective tensor network descriptions. For the translationally invariant model
of a single-band of interacting electrons, this includes results on gapless metallic phases such
as the Fermi liquid and Marginal Fermi liquid, as well as gapped phases such as the reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer,
pair density-wave and Mott liquid phases. Additionally, a study of a generalised Sachdev-Ye model
with disordered four-fermion interactions offers detailed results on many-body localised phases,
as well as thermalised phase. We emphasise the distinctions between the various phases based on
a combined analysis of their dynamical (obtained from the effective Hamiltonian) and entanglement
properties. Importantly, the RG flow of the Hamiltonian vertex tensor network is shown to lead to
emergent gauge theories for the gapped phases. Taken together with results on the holographic spacetime
generated from the RG of the many-particle eigenstate (seen through, for instance, the holographic
upper bound of the one-particle entanglement entropy), our analysis offer an ab-initio perspective
of the gauge-gravity duality for quantum liquids that are emergent in systems of correlated electrons.
