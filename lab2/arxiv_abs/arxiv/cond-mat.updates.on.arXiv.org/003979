When an electron or hole is in a conduction band of a crystal, it can be very different from 2, depending
upon the crystalline anisotropy and the direction of the applied magnetic induction ${\bf B}$.
In fact, it can even be 0! To demonstrate this quantitatively, the Dirac equation is extended for
a relativistic electron or hole in an orthorhombically-anisotropic conduction band with effective
masses $m_j$ for $j=1,2,3$ with geometric mean $m_g=(m_1m_2m_3)^{1/3}$. The appropriate Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformations are extended to evaluate the non-relativistic Hamiltonian to $O({\rm m}c^2)^{-4}$,
where ${\rm m}c^2$ is the particle's Einstein rest energy. For ${\bf B}||\hat{\bf e}_{\mu}$, the
Zeeman $g_{\mu}$ factor is $2{\rm m}\sqrt{m_{\mu}}/m_g^{3/2} + O({\rm m}c^2)^{-2}$. While propagating
in a two-dimensional (2D) conduction band with $m_3\gg m_1,m_2$, $g_{||}<<2$, consistent with
recent measurements of the temperature $T$ dependence of the parallel upper critical induction
$B_{c2,||}(T)$ in superconducting monolayer NbSe$_2$ and in twisted bilayer graphene. While
a particle is in its conduction band of an atomically thin one-dimensional metallic chain along
$\hat{\bf e}_{\mu}$, $g<<2$ for all ${\bf B}={\bf\nabla}\times{\bf A}$ directions and vanishingly
small for ${\bf B}||\hat{\bf e}_{\mu}$. The quantum spin Hall Hamiltonian for 2D metals with $m_1=m_2=m_{||}$
is $K[{\bf E}\times({\bf p}-q{\bf A})]_{\perp}\sigma_{\perp}+O({\rm m}c^2)^{-4}$, where
${\bf E}$ and ${\bf p}-q{\bf A}$ are the planar electric field and gauge-invariant momentum, $q=\mp|e|$
is the particle's charge, $\sigma_{\perp}$ is the Pauli matrix normal to the layer, $K=\pm\mu_B/(2m_{||}c^2)$,
and $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton.
