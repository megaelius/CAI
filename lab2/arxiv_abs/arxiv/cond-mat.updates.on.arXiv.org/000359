The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine the effective coherent extent of the neutron
wave packet transverse to its mean propagation vector k, when it is prepared in a typical instrument
used to study the structure of materials in thin film form via specular reflection. There are two
principal reasons for doing so. One has to do with the fundamental physical interest in the characteristics
of a free neutron as a quantum object while the other is of a more practical nature, relating to the
understanding of how to interpret elastic scattering data when the neutron is employed as a probe
of condensed matter structure on an atomic or nanometer scale. Knowing such a basic physical characteristic
as the neutron's effective transverse coherence can dictate how to properly analyze specular reflectivity
data obtained for material film structures possessing some amount of in-plane inhomogeneity.
In this study we describe a means of measuring the effective transverse coherence length of the neutron
wave packet by specular reflection from a series of diffraction gratings of different spacings.
Complementary non-specular measurements of the widths of grating reflections were also performed
which corroborate the specular results. (Part I principally describes measurements interpreted
according to the theoretical picture presented in Part II.) Each grating was fabricated by lift-off
photo-lithography patterning of a nickel film (approximately 1000 Angstroms thick) formed by
physical vapor deposition on a flat silicon crystal surface. The grating periods ranged from 10
microns (5 microns Ni stripe, 5 microns intervening space) to several hundred microns. The transverse
coherence length, modeled as the width of the wave packet, was determined from an analysis of the
specular reflectivity curves of the set of gratings.
