Exotic behaviour of mechanical metamaterials often relies on an internal transformation of the
underlying microstructure triggered by its local instabilities, rearrangements, and rotations.
Depending on the presence and magnitude of such a transformation, effective properties of a metamaterial
may change significantly. To capture this phenomenon accurately and efficiently, homogenization
schemes are required that reflect microstructural as well as macro-structural instabilities,
large deformations, and non-local effects. To this end, a micromorphic computational homogenization
scheme has recently been developed, which employs the particular microstructural transformation
as a non-local mechanism, magnitude of which is governed by an additional coupled partial differential
equation. Upon discretizing the resulting problem it turns out that the macroscopic stiffness
matrix requires integration of macro-element basis functions as well as their derivatives, thus
calling for a higher-order integration rules. Because evaluation of constitutive law in multiscale
schemes involves an expensive solution of a non-linear boundary value problem, computational
efficiency can be improved by reducing the number of integration points. Therefore, the goal of
this paper is to investigate reduced-order schemes in computational homogenization, with emphasis
on the stability of the resulting elements. In particular, arguments for lowering the order of integration
from the expensive mass-matrix to a cheaper stiffness-matrix equivalent are first outlined. An
efficient one-point integration quadrilateral element is then introduced and proper hourglass
stabilization discussed. Performance of the resulting set of elements is finally tested on a benchmark
bending example, showing that we achieve accuracy comparable to the full quadrature rules.
