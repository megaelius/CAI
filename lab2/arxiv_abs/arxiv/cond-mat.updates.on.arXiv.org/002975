Disordered systems like liquids, gels, glasses, or granular materials are not only ubiquitous
in daily life and in industrial applications but they are also crucial for the mechanical stability
of cells or the transport of chemical and biological agents in living organisms [1-3]. Despite the
importance of these systems, their microscopic structure is understood only on a rudimentary level,
thus in stark contrast to the case of gases and crystals [1,4]. Experimental and theoretical investigations
indicate that disordered systems have a structural order on the length scale of a few particle diameters
but which then quickly vanishes at larger distances [5]. This conclusion is, however, based mainly
on the behavior of two-point correlation functions such as the static structure factor or the radial
distribution function [5.6]. Whether or not disordered systems have an order that extents to larger
length scales is therefore a highly important question that is still open [7-10]. Here we use computer
simulations to show that liquids have an intricate structural order given by alternating layers
with icosahedral and dodecahedral symmetries and which extends to surprisingly large distances.
We show that the temperature dependence of the corresponding length scale can be detected in the
static structure factor, making it directly accessible to scattering experiments. These results,
obtained by a novel type of four point correlation function that probes directly the particle density
in three dimensions, show that liquids are far more ordered than envisaged so far but that this structural
information is encoded in non-standard correlation functions.
