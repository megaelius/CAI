As huge differences exist between the computational costs of low level MM and high level QM Hamiltonians,
the errors in indirect QM/MM simulation are mostly introduced in QM/MM end-state corrections.
QM/MM end-state corrections can be obtained from integration of the partial derivatives of alchemical
Hamiltonians or from perturbation-based estimators including free energy perturbation (FEP)
and acceptance ratio methods. When using FEP or exponential averaging (EXP), researchers tend
to only simulate MM end states and calculate single point energy to get the free energy estimates.
In this case the sample size hysteresis arises and the convergence is determined by bias elimination
rather than variance minimization. Various criteria are proposed to evaluate this convergence
issue. Under the approximation of Gaussian distributed energy difference Ulf (JCTC. 2017, 13 (11),
5745-5752.) presented practical considerations into the convergence issue and concluded that
the variance of distribution is the best convergence criterion and other convergence criteria
are variance-dependent. However, this question is only partially answered. In this paper we present
theoretical interpretations to dig the underlying statistical nature behind the problem. Still,
the variance of the distribution is the central quantity for all convergence criteria in Gaussian
approximated Exponential averaging (GEXP). Further, we prove that these estimators are nonlinearly
dependent on the variance of the free energy estimate. As these estimators are often orders of magnitude
overestimated, the variance of the FEP estimate is orders of magnitude underestimated. Hence,
computing this statistical uncertainty is meaningless in practice. The effective sample size
is also proven to be a function of the overlap scalar. We hope this literature can help readers to get
a deeper understanding of perturbation-based theories.
