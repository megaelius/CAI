The recent proposals of devices with overlapping Andreev bound states (ABS) open up the opportunities
to control and fine-tune their spectrum, that can be used in various applications. In this Article,
we study the ABS in a device consisting of a semiconducting nanowire covered with three superconducting
leads. The ABS are formed at two junctions where the wire is not covered. They overlap in the wire where
the electron propagation is 1D, and in one of the leads where the propagation is 3D. We identify a number
of regimes where these two overlaps either dominate or compete, depending on the junction separation
$L$ as compared to the correlation lengths $\xi_{\rm w}$, $\xi_{\rm s}$ in the wire and in the lead,
respectively. We utilize a simple model of 1D electron spectrum in the nanowire and take into account
the quality of the contact between the nanowire and the superconducting lead. We present the spectra
for different $L$, detailing the transition from a single-ABS in the regime of strong 1D hybridization
to two almost independent ABS hybridized at the degeneracy points, in the regime of weak 1D hybridization.
We present the details of merging the upper ABS with the continuous spectrum upon decreasing $L$.
We study in detail the effect of quantum interference due to the phase accumulated during the electron
passage between the junctions. We develop a perturbation theory for analytical treatment of hybridization.
We address an interesting separate case of fully transparent junctions. We derive and exemplify
a perturbation theory suitable for the competition regime demonstrating the interference of 1D
and two 3D transmission amplitudes.
