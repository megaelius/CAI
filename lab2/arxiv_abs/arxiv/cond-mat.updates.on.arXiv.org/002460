The features of electronic structure of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, Pr0.8Sr0.2MnO3, and Pr0.6Sr0.4MnO3
polycrystalline films of different thickness have been investigated using magnetic circular
dichroism (MCD) in the range of 1.1-4.2 eV. The temperature behavior of the samples electrical resistance
were also has been studied. It was found that films with high Sr content (0.3 and 0.4) act as high-temperature
semiconductors, while the maximum in the temperature dependences of these films resistivity indicates
the transition of the samples to the metallic state at some temperature TM-S, which is different
for different sample thickness. The films with the lower Sr content (0.2) act as insulators in the
used temperature range. The MCD spectra have been decomposed to the Gaussian-shaped lines, and
the temperature dependence of intensity of each line has been analyzed in comparison with temperature
dependence of the films magnetization and with their electric conductivity type. Different temperature
behavior of the intensity of four specified Gaussian-lines was revealed for semiconductor films.
In the case of insulating Pr0.8Sr0.2MnO3 samples, the intensity of three specified Gaussian lines
changes with the temperature in the same way as the magnetization changed. It was established that
the lanthanide (La, Pr) type does not affect the MCD spectra shape for the films with the same electrical
conductivity type. Besides, the correlation between the MCD data of the films and their conductivity
type was revealed. Due to the detailed analysis of the specified Gaussian lines with taking into
account the well-known in the literature absorption bands, lying outside the studied spectral
region, the MCD bands for the studied manganite films have been identified with electronic transitions
of a different nature.
