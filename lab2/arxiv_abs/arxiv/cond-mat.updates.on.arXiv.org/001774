We analyze multiple new issues concerning activated relaxation in glassy hard sphere fluids and
molecular and polymer liquids based on the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation
(ECNLE) theory. By invoking a high temperature reference state, a near universality of the apparent
dynamic localization length scale is predicted for liquids of widely varying fragility, a result
that is relevant to recent simulation studies and quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements.
In contrast, in the same format strongly non-universal behavior is found for the activation barrier
that controls long time relaxation. Two measures of cooperativity in ECNLE theory are analyzed.
A particle-level total displacement associated with the alpha relaxation event is found to be only
of order 1-2 particle diameters and weakly increases with cooling. In contrast, an alternative
cooperativity length is defined as the spatial scale required to recover the full barrier and bulk
alpha time. This length scale grows strongly with cooling due to the emergence in the deeply supercooled
regime of collective long range elastic fluctuations required to allow local hopping. It becomes
very large as the laboratory Tg is approached, though is relatively modest at degrees of supercooling
accessible with molecular dynamics simulation. The alpha time is found to be exponentially related
to this cooperativity length over an enormous number of decades of relaxation time that span the
lightly to deeply supercooled regimes. Moreover, the effective barrier height increases almost
linearly with the growing cooperativity length scale. An alternative calculation of the collective
elastic barrier based on a literal continuum mechanics approach is shown to result in very little
change of the theoretical results for bulk properties, but leads to a much smaller and less temperature-sensitive
cooperativity length scale.
