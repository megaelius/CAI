A number of applications in nanoplasmonics utilize noble metals, gold (Au) and silver (Ag), as the
materials of choice. However, these materials suffer from problems of poor thermal and chemical
stability accompanied by significant dissipative losses under high-temperature conditions.
In this regard, semiconductor nanoparticles have attracted attention with their promising characteristics
of highly tunable plasmonic resonances, low ohmic losses and greater thermochemical stability.
Here, we investigate the size-dependent thermoplasmonic properties of semiconducting silicon
and gallium arsenide nanoparticles to compare them with metallic Au nanoparticles using Mie theory.
To this end, we employ experimentally estimated models of dielectric permittivity in our computations.
Among the various permittivity models for Au, we further compare the Drude-Lorentz (DL) and the
Drude and critical points (DCP) models. Results show a redshift in the scattering and absorption
resonances for the DL model while the DCP model presents a blueshift. The dissipative damping in
the semiconductor nanoparticles is strongest for the sharp electric octupole resonances followed
by the quadrupole and dipole modes. However, a reverse order with strongest values for the broad
dipole resonance is observed for the Au nanoparticles. A massive Drude broadening contributes
strongly to the damping of resonances in Au nanoparticles at elevated temperatures. In contrast,
the semiconductor nanoparticles do not exhibit any significant deterioration in their scattering
and absorption resonances at high temperatures. In combination with low dissipative damping,
this makes the semiconductor nanoparticles better suited for high-temperature applications
in nanoplasmonics wherein the noble metals suffer from excessive heating.
