During development, organisms acquire three-dimensional shapes with important physiological
consequences. While the basic mechanisms underlying morphogenesis are known in eukaryotes, it
is often difficult to manipulate them in vivo. To circumvent this issue, here we present a study of
developing Vibrio cholerae biofilms grown on agar substrates in which the spatiotemporal morphological
patterns were altered by varying the agar concentration. Expanding biofilms are initially flat,
but later experience a mechanical instability and become wrinkled. Whereas the peripheral region
develops ordered radial stripes, the central region acquires a zigzag herringbone-like wrinkle
pattern. Depending on the agar concentration, the wrinkles initially appear either in the peripheral
region and propagate inward (low agar concentration) or in the central region and propagate outward
(high agar concentration). To understand these experimental observations, we developed a model
that considers diffusion of nutrients and their uptake by bacteria, bacterial growth/biofilm
matrix production, mechanical deformation of both the biofilm and the agar, and the friction between
them. Our model demonstrates that depletion of nutrients beneath the central region of the biofilm
results in radially-dependent growth profiles, which in turn, produce anisotropic stresses that
dictate the morphology of wrinkles. Furthermore, we predict that increasing surface friction
(agar concentration) reduces stress anisotropy and shifts the location of the maximum compressive
stress, where the wrinkling instability first occurs, toward the center of the biofilm, in agreement
with our experimental observations. Our results are broadly applicable to bacterial biofilms
with similar morphologies and also provide insight into how other bacterial biofilms form distinct
wrinkle patterns.
