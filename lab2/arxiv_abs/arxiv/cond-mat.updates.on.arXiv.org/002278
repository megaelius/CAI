Recent advances in monochromatic aberration corrected electron microscopy make it possible to
detect the lattice vibration with both high-energy resolution and high spatial resolution. Here,
we use sub-10 meV electron energy loss spectroscopy to investigate the local vibrational properties
at surface and interface of an amorphous SiO$_2$ (a-SiO$_2$) thin film on Si substrate. We find that
each optical mode splits into three sub-modes, i.e., surface mode, bulk mode and interface mode,
which can be measured from different locations. The pure surface modes can be measured in the vacuum
near the surface, and the pure interface modes are expected to be obtained either at the interface
location or in the Si, while inside the SiO$_2$ the measured signal is a mixture of bulk, surface,
and interface modes. The bulk mode has the largest vibration energy and surface mode has the lowest.
The energy of surface mode is thickness dependent, showing a blue-shift as z-thickness (parallel
to fast electron beam) of SiO$_2$ film increases, while the bulk and interface modes have constant
vibration energy. The intensity of bulk mode linearly increases with thickness being increased,
and it drops steeply to zero near the surface and interface (within a few nanometers). The surface
modes decay slowly in the vacuum following a Bessel function. The mechanism of the observed spatially
dependent vibration behavior is discussed and quantitatively compared with dielectric response
theory analysis. Our nanometer scale measurements of vibrations properties provide useful information
about the bonding conditions at the surface and interface and thus may help to design better silicon-based
electronic devices via surface and interface treatments
