Strongly interacting dipolar bosons in optical lattices exhibit diverse quantum phases that are
rich in physics. As the strength of the long-range boson-boson interaction increases, the system
transitions across different phases: from a superfluid, through a Mott-insulator to a Tonks gas
and, eventually, a crystal state. The signature of these phases and their transitions can be unequivocally
identified by an experimentally detectable order parameter, recently described in arXiv:1708.07409.
Herein, we calculate the momentum distributions and the normalized Glauber correlation functions
of dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice in order to characterize all their phases.
To understand the behavior of the correlations across the phase transitions, we first investigate
the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the one-body reduced density matrix as the function of the
dipolar interaction strength. We then analyze the real- and momentum-space Glauber correlation
functions, thereby gaining a spatially and momentum-resolved insight into the coherence properties
of these quantum phases. We find an intriguing structure of non-local correlations that, independently
of other system parameters, reveal the phase transitions of the system. In particular, spatial
localization with synchronous momentum delocalization accompanies the formation of correlated
islands in the density. Moreover, our study showcases that precise control of intersite correlations
is possible through manipulation of the depth of the lattice, while intrasite correlations are
influenced solely by changing the dipolar interaction strength.
