We study the nature of the glass transition by cooling model atomistic glass formers at constant
rate from a temperature above the onset of glassy dynamics to $T=0$. Motivated by the East model,
a kinetically constrained lattice model with hierarchical relaxation, we make several predictions
about the behavior of the supercooled liquid as it passes through the glass transition. We then compare
those predictions to the results of our atomistic simulations. Consistent with our predictions,
our results show that the relaxation time $\tau$ of the material undergoes a crossover from super-Arrhenius
to Arrhenius behavior at a cooling-rate-dependent glass transition temperature $T_\text{g}$.
The slope of $\ln\tau$ with respect to inverse temperature exhibits a peak near $T_\text{g}$ that
grows more pronounced with slower cooling, matching our expectations qualitatively. Additionally,
the limiting value of this slope at low temperature shows remarkable quantitative agreement with
our predictions. Our results also show that the rate of short-time particle displacements deviates
from the equilibrium linear scaling around $T_\text{g}$, asymptotically approaching a different
linear scaling. To our surprise, these short-time displacements, the dynamic indicators of the
underlying excitations responsible for structural relaxation, show no spatial correlations
beyond a few particle diameters, both above and below $T_\text{g}$. This final result is contrary
to our expectation, based on previous results for East model glasses formed by cooling, that inter-excitation
correlations should emerge as the liquid vitrifies.
