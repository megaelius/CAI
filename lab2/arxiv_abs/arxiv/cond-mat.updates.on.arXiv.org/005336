Random search for one or more targets in a bounded domain occurs widely in nature, with examples ranging
from animal foraging to the transport of vesicles within cells. Most theoretical studies take a
searcher-centric viewpoint, focusing on the first passage time (FTP) problem to find a target.
This single search-and-capture event then triggers a downstream process or provides the searcher
with some resource such as food. In this paper we take a target-centric viewpoint, by analyzing the
accumulation of resources in a set of targets due to multiple rounds of search-and-capture events;
whenever a searcher finds a target it delivers a resource packet to the target, after which it escapes
and returns to its initial position (resetting after capture). The searcher is then resupplied
with cargo and a new search process is initiated after a random delay. Assuming that the accumulation
of resources is counterbalanced by degradation, one can derive general expressions for the moments
of the resource distribution. We develop the theory by considering diffusive search in two distinct
geometric configurations. First, we determine the mean and Fano factor of the distribution of resources
between pair of concentric spherical targets, and explore how these depend on the initial location
of the searcher, the dimension $d$, the degradation rate and the distribution of delays. Second,
we use asymptotic analysis to determine the mean number of resources in each of $N$ small interior
targets within a three-dimensional bounded domain. In particular, we show that the mean number
of resources in a target is proportional to its effective ``shape capacitance.'' Finally, we extend
the analysis to the case of diffusive search with stochastic resetting before capture.
