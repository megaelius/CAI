The in-plane acoustic phonon scattering in graphene is solved by considering fully inelastic acoustic
phonon scatterings in two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials for large range of temperature ($T$)
and chemical potential ($\mu$). Rigorous analytical solutions and symmetry properties of Fermionic
and Bosonic functions are obtained. We illustrate how doping alters the temperature dependence
of acoustic phonon scattering rates. It is shown that the quasi-elastic and ansatz equations previously
derived for acoustic phonon scatterings in graphene are limiting cases of the inelastic-scattering
equations derived here. For heavily-doped graphene, we found that the high-$T$ behavior of resistivity
is better described by $\rho(T, \mu) \propto T(1 - \zeta_a\mu^2/3(k_BT)^2)$ rather than a linear
$T$ behavior, and in the low $T$ regime we found $\tau^{-1} \propto (k_BT)^4$ but with a different
prefactor (i.e. $\sim$ 3 times smaller) in comparison with the existing quasi-elastic expressions.
Furthermore, we found a simple analytic "semi-inelastic" expression of the form $\tau^{-1} \propto
(k_BT)^4/(1+ c T^3)$ which matches nearly perfectly with the full inelastic results for any temperature
up to 500 K and $\mu$ up to 1 eV. Our simple analytic results agree well with previous first-principles
studies and available experimental data. Moreover, we obtain an analytical form for the acoustic
gauge field $\beta_A = 3\beta\gamma_0/4\sqrt{2}$. Our analyses pave a way for investigating scatterings
between electrons and other fundamental excitations with linear dispersion relation in 2D Dirac
material-based heterostructures such as bogolon-mediated electron scattering in graphene-based
hybrid Bose-Fermi systems.
