We have recently established that a number of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction driven canted
antiferromagnets or weak ferrromagnets (WFM) including hematite exhibit an ultra-slow magnetization
relaxation phenomenon, leading to the observation of a time-stable remanence (Phys. Rev. B 96,
104422 (2017)). In this work, our endeavor is to optimize the magnitude of this time-stable remanence
for the hematite crystallites, as a function of shape size and morphology. A substantial enhancement
in the magnitude of this unique remanence is observed in porous hematite, consisting of ultra-small
nano particles, as compared to crystallites grown in regular morphology, such as cuboids or hexagonal
plates. This time-stable remanence exhibits a peak-like pattern with magnetic field, which is
significantly sharper in porous sample. The extent and the magnitude of the spin canting associated
with the WFM phase can be best gauged by the presence of this remanence and its unusual magnetic field
dependence. Temperature variation of lattice parameters bring out correlations between strain
effects that alter the bond length and bond angle associated with primary super exchange paths,
which in-turn systematically alter the magnitude of the time-stable remanence. This study provides
insights regarding a long standing problems of anomalies in the magnitude of magnetization on repeated
cooling in case of hematite. Our data caps on these anomalies, which we argue, arise due to spontaneous
spin canting associated with WFM phase. Our results also elucidate on why thermal cycling protocols
during bulk magnetization measurements are even more crucial for hematite which exhibits both
canted as well as pure antiferromgnetic phase.
