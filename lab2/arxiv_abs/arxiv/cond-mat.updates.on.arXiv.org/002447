Controlling the shape and structure of metallic colloids is an important topic. Here, different
morphology-structure of colloidal gold particles is investigated for different parameters in
pulse-based electron-photon-solution interface process. Different gold tiny-shaped particles
are developed under different packets of nanoshape energy where merged atoms of monolayer assembly
in own shapes to a large number as per ratio of pulse OFF to ON time. Tiny particles in joined triangular-shape
developed under the certain ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time. However, under unipolar pulse,
triangular-shaped tiny particles directly developed in a triangular-shape. When the ratio of
bipolar pulse OFF to ON time was very large, the resulted particles developed in distorted shapes
while geometric shapes developed at smaller values of this ratio. When the ratio of bipolar pulse
OFF to ON time was 3, resulted particles developed in low aspect ratio to those developed at the inverse
value of this ratio. For longer pulse ON time, structures of smooth elements developed in width less
than inter-spacing distance and travelling photons along interface flat them further. Due to largely
deformed elongated atoms of tiny particles, they do not modify for structures of smooth elements
under influence of travelling photons along the interface where their electronic structures have
been spoiled to a large extent. Morphology and structure of tiny-sized particles and large-sized
particles under different pulse rate and polarity along with different distance between electron-photon
source and energy source is discussed here opening multiple routes of materials research and counterparts.
