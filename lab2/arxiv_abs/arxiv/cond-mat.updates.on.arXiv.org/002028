Exciton spectra of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in various dielectric environments
are studied. The screened hydrogen model (SHM) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 056401 (2016)] is examined
by comparing its exciton spectra with the radial equation (RE) solutions. While the SHM is found
to describe the nonhydrogenic exciton Rydberg series reasonably well, it fails to account for the
linear decrease of the exciton energy with the orbital quantum number $m$. The exciton Bohr orbit
shrinks as $\lvert m\rvert$ becomes larger resulting in increased strength of the electron-hole
interaction and a decrease of the exciton energy. The exciton effective radius expression of the
SHM can characterize the exciton radius's dependence on $n$, but it cannot properly describe the
exciton radius's dependence on $m$, which is the cause of the SHM's poor description of the exciton
energy's $m$-dependence. For monolayer WS$_2$ on the SiO$_2$ substrate, our calculated $s$ exciton
Rydberg series agrees closely with that measured by optical reflection spectroscopy [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 113, 076802 (2014)], while the calculated $p$ excitons offer an explanation for the two broad
features of a two-photon absorption spectrum [Nature 513, 214 (2014)]. Our calculated exciton
energies for monolayer TMDs in various dielectric environments compare favourably with experimental
data. Variational wave functions are obtained for a number of strongly bound exciton states and
further used to study the Stark effects in monolayer TMDs, an analytical expression being deduced
which yields a redshift of the ground state energy to a good accuracy. The numerical solution of the
RE combined with the variational method provides a simple and effective approach for the study of
excitons in monolayer TMDs.
