In crystalline solids the acoustic phonon is known to be the frequency-gapless Goldstone boson
emerging from the spontaneous breaking of the continuous Galilean symmetry induced by the crystal
lattice. It has also been described as the gauge boson that appears when the free electrons' Lagrangian
in the crystal is requested to be locally gauge invariant with respect to T(3), the group of the infinitesimal
spatial translations. However, the non-Abelianity of T(3) makes the acoustic phonon a frequency-gapped
mode, in contradiction with its description as Goldstone boson. A different perspective overcomes
this contradiction. In fact, we show that both the acoustic and optical phonon - the latter never
appearing following the other two approaches - emerge respectively as the gapless Goldstone (phase)
and the gapped Higgs (amplitude) fluctuation mode of an order parameter arising from the spontaneous
breaking of a global symmetry, without invoking the gauge principle. The optical phonon's frequency-gap
is present in all regimes, and it arises from a mass-like term in the Lagrangian due to the Higgs mechanism
itself. Instead, an eventual acoustic phonon's frequency-gap appears only in the strong nonlinear
regime, and it is due to an anharmonic term, the same term arising from the gauging of T(3), an approach
which did not provide any description of the optical phonon, though. In addition, the Higgs mechanism
describes all the phonon-phonon interactions, including a possible perturbation on the acoustic
phonon's frequency dispersion relation induced by the eventual optical phonon, a peculiar behavior
not described so far in these terms.
