Understanding the evolution of spin-orbit torque (SOT) with increasing heavy-metal thickness
in ferromagnet/normal metal (FM/NM) bilayers is critical for the development of magnetic memory
based on SOT. However, several experiments have revealed an apparent discrepancy between damping
enhancement and damping-like SOT regarding their dependence on NM thickness. Here, using linewidth
and phase-resolved amplitude analysis of vector network analyzer ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR)
measurements, we simultaneously extract damping enhancement and both field-like and damping-like
inverse SOT in Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Pt bilayers as a function of Pt thickness. By enforcing an interpretation
of the data which satisfies Onsager reciprocity, we find that both the damping enhancement and damping-like
inverse SOT can be described by a single spin diffusion length ($\approx$ 4 nm), and that we can separate
the spin pumping and spin memory loss (SML) contributions to the total damping. This analysis indicates
that less than 40% of the angular momentum pumped by FMR through the Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Pt interface
is transported as spin current into the Pt. On account of the SML and corresponding reduction in total
spin current available for spin-charge transduction in the Pt, we determine the Pt spin Hall conductivity
($\sigma_\mathrm{SH} = (2.36 \pm 0.04)\times10^6 \Omega^{-1} \mathrm{m}^{-1}$) and bulk spin
Hall angle ($\theta_\mathrm{SH}=0.387 \pm0.008$) to be larger than commonly-cited values. These
results suggest that Pt can be an extremely useful source of SOT if the FM/NM interface can be engineered
to minimize SML. Lastly, we find that self-consistent fitting of the damping and SOT data is best
achieved by a model with Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation and extrinsic inverse spin Hall effect,
such that both the spin diffusion length and spin Hall conductivity are proportional to the Pt charge
conductivity.
