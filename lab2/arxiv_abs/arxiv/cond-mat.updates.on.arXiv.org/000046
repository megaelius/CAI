We present a comprehensive study of two of the most experimentally relevant extensions of Kitaev's
spinless model of a 1D p-wave superconductor: those involving (i) longer range hopping and superconductivity
and (ii) inhomogeneous potentials. We commence with a pedagogical review of the spinless model
and, as a means of characterizing topological phases exhibited by the systems studied here, we introduce
bulk topological invariants as well as those derived from an explicit consideration of boundary
modes. In time-reversal invariant systems, we find that the longer range hopping leads to topological
phases characterized by multiple Majorana modes. In particular, we investigate a spin model, which
respects a duality and maps to a fermionic model with multiple Majorana modes; we highlight the connection
between these topological phases and the broken symmetry phases in the original spin model. In the
presence of time-reversal symmetry breaking terms, we show that the topological phase diagram
is characterized by an extended gapless regime. For the case of inhomogeneous potentials, we explore
phase diagrams of periodic, quasiperiodic, and disordered systems. We present a detailed mapping
between normal state localization properties of such systems and the topological phases of the
corresponding superconducting systems. This powerful tool allows us to leverage the analyses
of Hofstadter's butterfly and the vast literature on Anderson localization to the question of Majorana
modes in superconducting quasiperiodic and disordered systems, respectively. We briefly touch
upon the synergistic effects that can be expected in cases where long-range hopping and disorder
are both present.
