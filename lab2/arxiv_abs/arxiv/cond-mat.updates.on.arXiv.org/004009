At interface of the classical and quantum physics Maxwell and Schr\"odinger equations describe
how optical fields drive and control electronic phenomena at THz or PHz frequencies and on ultra-small
scales to enable lightwave electronics. Light striking a metal surface triggers electric field-electron
particle/wave interactions to coherently imprint and transfer its attributes on the attosecond
time scale. Here we create and image by ultrafast photoemission electron microscopy a new quasiparticle
of optical field-collective electron interaction where the design of geometrical phase creates
a plasmonic topological spin angular momentum texture. The spin texture resembles that of magnetic
meron quasiparticle, is localized within 1/2 wavelength of light, and exists on ~20 fs (2^10-14
s) time scale of the plasmonic field. The quasiparticle is created in a nanostructured silver film,
which converts coherent linearly polarized light pulse into an evanescent surface plasmon polariton
light-electron wave with a tailored geometric phase to form a plasmonic vortex. Ultrafast coherent
microscopy imaging of electromagnetic waves propagating at the local speed of light of 255 nm/fs,
electromagnetic simulations, and analytic theory find a new quasiparticle within the vortex core,
with topological spin properties of a meron that are defined by the optical field and sample geometry.
The new quasiparticle is an ultrafast topological defect whose chiral field breaks the time-inversion
symmetry on the nanoscale; its creation, symmetry breaking topology, and dynamics pertain to contexts
ranging from the cosmological structure creation to topological phase transitions in quantum
liquids and gases, and may act as a transducer for quantum information on the nanofemto scale.
