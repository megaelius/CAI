There is a dichotomy in the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many body systems. In the presence
of integrability, expectation values of local operators equilibrate to values described by a generalized
Gibbs ensemble, which retains extensive memory about the initial state of the system. On the other
hand, in generic systems such expectation values relax to stationary values described by the thermal
ensemble, fixed solely by the energy of the state. At the heart of understanding this dichotomy is
the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH): individual eigenstates in nonintegrable systems
are thermal, in the sense that expectation values agree with the thermal prediction at a temperature
set by the energy of the eigenstate. In systems where ETH is violated, thermalization can be avoided.
Thus establishing the range of validity of ETH is crucial in understanding whether a given quantum
system thermalizes. Here we study a simple model with confinement, the quantum Ising chain with
a longitudinal field, in which ETH is violated. Despite an absence of integrability, there exist
rare (nonthermal) states that persist far into the spectrum. These arise as a direct consequence
of confinement: pairs of particles are confined, forming new `meson' excitations whose energy
can be extensive in the system size. We show that such states are nonthermal in both the continuum
and in the low-energy spectrum of the corresponding lattice model. We highlight that the presence
of such states within the spectrum has important consequences, with certain quenches leading to
an absence of thermalization and local observables evolving anomalously.
