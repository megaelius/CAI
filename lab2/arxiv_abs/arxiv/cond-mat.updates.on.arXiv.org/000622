Layered LiMnO2 and Li2MnO3 are of great interest for lithium-ion battery cathodes because of their
high theoretical capacities. The practical application of these materials is, however, limited
due to poor electrochemical performance. We herein report a comprehensive first-principles study
of defect physics in LiMnO2 and Li2MnO3 using hybrid density functional calculations. We find that
manganese antisites have low formation energies in LiMnO2 and may act as nucleation sites for the
formation of impurity phases. The antisites can also occur with high concentrations in Li2MnO3;
however, unlike in LiMnO2, they can be eliminated by tuning the experimental conditions during
preparation. Other intrinsic point defects may also occur and have an impact on the materials' properties
and functioning. An analysis of the formation of lithium vacancies indicates that lithium extraction
from LiMnO2 is associated with oxidation at the manganese site, resulting in the formation of manganese
small hole polarons; whereas in Li2MnO3 the intrinsic delithiation mechanism involves oxidation
at the oxygen site, leading to the formation of bound oxygen hole polarons. The layered oxides are
found to have no or negligible band-like carriers and they cannot be doped n- or p-type. The electronic
conduction proceeds through hopping of hole and/or electron polarons; the ionic conduction occurs
through lithium monovacancy and/or divacancy migration mechanisms. Since the oxygen hole polarons
are not stable in the absence of negatively charged lithium vacancies in bulk Li2MnO3, the electronic
conduction near the start of delithiation is likely to be poor. We suggest that the electronic conduction
associated with these polarons and hence the electrochemical performance of Li2MnO3 can be improved
through nanostructuring and/or ion substitution.
