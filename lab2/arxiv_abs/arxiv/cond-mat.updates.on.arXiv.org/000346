Inverse statistical-mechanical methods have recently been employed to design optimized short-ranged
radial (isotropic) pair potentials that robustly produce novel targeted classical ground-state
many-particle configurations. The target structures considered in those studies were low-coordinated
crystals with a high degree of symmetry. In this paper, we further test the fundamental limitations
of radial pair potentials by targeting crystal structures with appreciably less symmetry, including
those in which the particles have different local structural environments. These challenging
target configurations demanded that we modify previous inverse optimization techniques. Using
this modified optimization technique, we have designed short-ranged radial pair potentials that
stabilize the two-dimensional kagome crystal, the rectangular kagome crystal, and rectangular
lattices, as well as the three-dimensional structure of CaF$_2$ crystal inhabited by a single particle
species. We verify our results by cooling liquid configurations to absolute zero temperature via
simulated annealing and ensuring that such states have stable phonon spectra. Except for the rectangular
kagome structure, all of the target structures can be stabilized with monotonic repulsive potentials.
Our work demonstrates that single-component systems with short-ranged radial pair potentials
can counterintuitively self-assemble into crystal ground states with low symmetry and different
local structural environments. Finally, we present general principles that offer guidance in
determining whether certain target structures can be achieved as ground states by radial pair potentials.
