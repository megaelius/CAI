The run-and-tumble (RT) dynamics followed by bacterial swimmers gives rise first to a ballistic
motion due to their persistence, and later, through consecutive tumbles, to a diffusive process.
Here we investigate how long it takes for a dilute swimmer suspension to reach the diffusive regime
as well as what is the amplitude of the deviations from the diffusive dynamics. A linear time dependence
of the mean-squared displacement (MSD) is insufficient to characterize diffusion and thus we also
focus on the excess kurtosis of the displacement distribution. Four swimming strategies are considered:
(i) the conventional RT model with complete reorientation after tumbling, (ii) the case of partial
reorientation, characterized by a distribution of tumbling angles, (iii) a run-and-reverse model
with rotational diffusion, and (iv) a RT particle where the tumbling rate depends on the stochastic
concentration of an internal protein. By analyzing the associated kinetic equations for the probability
density function and simulating the models, we find that for models (ii), (iii), and (iv) the relaxation
to diffusion can take much longer than the mean time between tumble events, evidencing the existence
of large tails in the particle displacements. Moreover, the excess kurtosis can assume large positive
values. In model (ii) it is possible for some distributions of tumbling angles that the MSD reaches
a linear time dependence but, still, the dynamics remains non-Gaussian for long times. This is also
the case in model (iii) for small rotational diffusivity. For all models, the long-time diffusion
coefficients are also obtained. The theoretical approach, which relies on eigenvalue and angular
Fourier expansions of the van Hove function, is in excellent agreement with the simulations.
