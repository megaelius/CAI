Quantitatively understanding of the dynamics of an active Brownian particle (ABP) interacting
with a viscoelastic polymer environment is a scientific challenge. It is intimately related to
several interdisciplinary topics such as the microrheology of active colloids in a polymer matrix
and the athermal dynamics of the in vivo chromosome or cytoskeletal networks. Based on Langevin
dynamics simulation and analytic theory, here we explore such a viscoelastic active system in depth
using a star polymer of functionality $f$ with the center cross-linker particle being ABP. We observe
that the ABP cross-linker, despite its self-propelled movement, attains an active subdiffusion
with the scaling $\langle\Delta \mathbf{R}^2(t)\rangle\sim t^\alpha$ with $\alpha\leq 1/2$,
through the viscoelastic feedback from the polymer. Counter-intuitively, the apparent anomaly
exponent $\alpha$ becomes smaller as the ABP is driven by a larger propulsion velocity, but is independent
of the functionality $f$ or the boundary conditions of the polymer. We set forth an exact theory,
and show that the motion of the active cross-linker is a gaussian non-Markovian process characterized
by two distinct power-law displacement correlations. At a moderate P{\'e}clet number, it seemingly
behaves as fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst exponent $H=\alpha/2$, whereas, at a high P{\'e}clet
number, the self-propelled noise in the polymer environment leads to a logarithmic growth of the
mean squared displacement ($\sim \ln t$) and a velocity autocorrelation decaying as $-t^{-2}$.
We demonstrate that the anomalous diffusion of the active cross-linker is precisely described
by a fractional Langevin equation with two distinct random noises.
