We propose a systematic approach to the systems of correlated electrons, the so-called $\mathbf{k}$-DE-GWF
method, based on reciprocal-space ($\mathbf{k}$-resolved) diagrammatic expansion of the variational
Gutzwiller-type wave function for parametrized models of correlated fermions. The present approach,
in contrast to either variational Monte-Carlo (VMC), or the recently developed real-space diagrammatic
expansion of the Gutzwiller-type wave function (direct-space DE-GWF technique), is applicable
directly in the thermodynamic limit and thus is suitable for describing selected singular features
of the wave-vector-dependent quantities. We employ the $\mathbf{k}$-DE-GWF method to extract
the non-analytic part of the two leading moments of the fermion spectral-density function across
the (two-dimensional) Brillouin zone for the Hubbard model and away from the half-filling. Those
moments are used to evaluate the nodal quasiparticle velocities and their spectral weights in the
correlated superconducting state. The two velocities determined in that manner exhibit scaling
with the electron concentration qualitatively different from that obtained earlier for the excited
states of the high-$T_c$ cuprates within the projected quasi-particle ansatz, and the results
are in a very good quantitative agreement with experimental data if interpreted as those characterizing
the spectrum below and above the observed kink. We provide a detailed discussion of the two gaps and
two excitation branches (two velocities) appearing naturally within our DE-GWF approach. The
two separate sets of characteristics distinguish the renormalized quasiparticle states very
close to the Fermi surface from the deeper correlated-state properties. Also, an enhancement of
the $\mathbf{k}$-dependent magnetic susceptibility is shown to contain a spin-fluctuation contribution
within our language.
