In this paper, we propose some new strongly correlated gapless states (or critical states) of spin-1/2
electrons in 1+1-dimensions, such as chiral metallic states. Other examples are the doped ferromagnetic
and anti-ferromagnetic spin-1/2 Ising chains that give rise to two distinct metallic phases with
identical symmetry. The metallic phase from doped anti-ferromagnetic Ising chain has a finite
energy gap for all charge-1 fermionic excitations even without pairing caused by attractions,
resembling the pseudo-gap phase of underdoped high Tc superconductors. Adding a transverse field
to the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic metallic phases can restore the $Z_2$ symmetry, which
gives rise to two distinct critical points despite that the two transitions have exactly the same
symmetry breaking pattern. Most of those gapless states are strongly correlated in the sense that
they do not belong to the usual Tomonaga-Luttinger phase of fermions, i.e., they cannot be smoothly
deformed into the non-interacting fermion systems. Our non-perturbative results are obtained
by noticing that gapless quantum systems usually have several decoupled low energy sectors. Those
decoupled sectors may have emergent symmetry, and more importantly, each sector may have a (non-invertible)
gravitational anomaly with the emergent symmetry. This leads to a general way to view gapless quantum
states as a combination of the anomalous sectors (i.e., as a combination of boundary states of a gapped
topological state in one higher dimension). Using the resulting modular covariance of the partition
functions, we are able to calculate the scaling dimensions and quantum numbers of all the low energy
operators for those strongly correlated gapless states.
