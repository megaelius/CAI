When a polarized light beam is incident upon the surface of a magnetic material, the reflected light
undergoes a polarization rotation. This magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) has been intensively
studied in a variety of ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials because it provides a powerful probe
for electronic and magnetic properties as well as for various applications including magneto-optical
recording. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in antiferromagnets (AFMs) as prospective
spintronic materials for high-density and ultrafast memory devices, owing to their vanishingly
small stray field and orders of magnitude faster spin dynamics compared to their ferromagnetic
counterparts. In fact, the MOKE has proven useful for the study and application of the antiferromagnetic
(AF) state. Although limited to insulators, certain types of AFMs are known to exhibit a large MOKE,
as they are weak ferromagnets due to canting of the otherwise collinear spin structure. Here we report
the first observation of a large MOKE signal in an AF metal at room temperature. In particular, we
find that despite a vanishingly small magnetization of $M \sim$0.002 $\mu_{\rm B}$/Mn, the non-collinear
AF metal Mn$_3$Sn exhibits a large zero-field MOKE with a polar Kerr rotation angle of 20 milli-degrees,
comparable to ferromagnetic metals. Our first-principles calculations have clarified that ferroic
ordering of magnetic octupoles in the non-collinear Neel state may cause a large MOKE even in its
fully compensated AF state without spin magnetization. This large MOKE further allows imaging
of the magnetic octupole domains and their reversal induced by magnetic field. The observation
of a large MOKE in an AF metal should open new avenues for the study of domain dynamics as well as spintronics
using AFMs.
