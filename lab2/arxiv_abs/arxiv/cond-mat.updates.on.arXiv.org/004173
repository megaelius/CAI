We drive periodically a two-dimensional diamond-octagon lattice model by switching between two
Hamiltonian corresponding two different magnetic flux piercing through diamond plaquette to
investigate the generation of topological flat bands. We show that in this way, the flatness and
topological nature of all the bands of the model can be tuned and Floquet quasi-sates can be made topologically
flat while its static counterpart does not support the existence of topology and flatness together.
By redefining the flatness accordingly in the context of non-equilibrium dynamics and correctly
justifying it using the Floquet joint density of states, one indeed obtains a better control of the
desired result when the input parameter space composed of temporal window associated with the step
Hamiltonian and flux becomes larger than the static parameter space consisting of magnetic flux
only. Interestingly, we find the generation of flux current. We systematically analyse the work
done and flux current in the asymptotic limit as a function of input parameters to show that topology
and flatness both share a close connection to the flux current and work done, respectively. We finally
extend our investigation to the aperiodic array of step Hamiltonian, where we find that the heating
up problem can be significantly reduced if the initial state is substantially flat as initial the
large degeneracy of states prevents the system from absorbing energy easily from the aperiodic
driving. We additionally show that the heating can be reduced if the values of the magnetic flux in
the step Hamiltonian are small, the duration of these flux are unequal and on the initial flatness
of the band. We successfully explain our finding by plausible analytical arguments.
