The spatial texture of internal degree of freedom of electrons has profound effects on the properties
of materials. Such texture in real space can manifest as an emergent magnetic field (or Berry curvature),
which is expected to induce interesting valley/spin-related transport phenomena. Moir\'e pattern,
which emerges as a spatial variation at the interface of 2D atomic crystals, provides a natural platform
for investigating such real space Berry curvature effects. Here we study moir\'e structures formed
in homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) due to twisting, various uniform strain
profiles, and their combinations, where electrons can reside in either layer with the layer index
serving as an internal degree of freedom. The layer pseudo-spin exhibits vortex/antivortex textures
in the moir\'e supercell, leading to a giant geometric magnetic field and a scalar potential. Within
a geometric picture, the moir\'e magnetic field is found as the cross product of the gradients of
the out-of-plane pseudo-spin and the in-plane pseudo-spin orientation respectively. We discover
dual roles of uniform strain: Besides being a cause of the moire atomic texture in the homobilayer,
it also contributes a pseudo-gauge potential that modifies the local phase of interlayer coupling.
Consequently, strain can be employed to tune the in-plane pseudo-spin texture, while interlayer
bias tunes the out-of-plane pseudo-spin, and we show how the moir\'e magnetic field's spatial profile,
intensity, and flux per supercell can be engineered. Through the geometric scalar correction,
the landscape of the scalar potential can also be engineered along with the moir\'e magnetic field,
forming distinct effective lattice structures. These properties render TMD moir\'e structures
promising to build tunable flux lattices for transport and topological material applications.
