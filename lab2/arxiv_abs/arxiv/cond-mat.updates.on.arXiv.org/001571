We investigate the effect of a time-reversal breaking impurity term on both the equilibrium and
non-equilibrium critical properties of entanglement entropy (EE) in a three-spin interacting
transverse Ising model which can be mapped to a one-dimensional p-wave superconductor with next-nearest-neighbor
hopping. Due to the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping, a new topological phase with two
zero-energy Majorana modes at each end of an open chain appears in the phase diagram. We show that
the derivative of EE with respect to one of the parameters of the Hamiltonian can detect the quantum
phase transitions by exhibiting cusp like structure at those points; impurity strength ($\la_d$)
can substantially modify the peak/dip height associated with the cusp. Importantly, we find that
the logarithmic scaling of the EE with block size remains unaffected by the application of the impurity
term, although, the coefficient (i.e., central charge) varies logarithmically with the impurity
strength for a lower range of $\la_d$ and eventually saturates with an exponential damping factor
($\sim \exp(-\la_d)$) for the phase boundaries shared with the phase containing two Majorana edge
modes. On the other hand, it receives a linear correction in term of $\la_d$ for an another phase boundary.
Finally, we focus to study the effect of the impurity in the time evolution of the EE for the critical
quenching case where impurity term is applied only to the final Hamiltonian. Interestingly, it
has been shown that for all the phase boundaries in contrary to the equilibrium case, the saturation
value of the EE increases logarithmically with the strength of impurity in a certain region of $\la_d$
and finally, for higher values of $\la_d$, it increases very slowly which is dictated by an exponential
damping factor.
