Discrete particle simulations are used to study the shear rheology of dense, stabilized, frictional
particulate suspensions in a viscous liquid, toward development of a constitutive model for steady
shear flows at arbitrary stress. These suspensions undergo increasingly strong continuous shear
thickening (CST) as solid volume fraction $\phi$ increases above a critical volume fraction, and
discontinuous shear thickening (DST) is observed for a range of $\phi$. When studied at controlled
stress, the DST behavior is associated with non-monotonic flow curves of the steady-state stress
as a function of shear rate. Recent studies have related shear thickening to a transition between
mostly lubricated to predominantly frictional contacts with the increase in stress. In this study,
the behavior is simulated over a wide range of the dimensionless parameters $(\phi,\tilde{\sigma}$,
and $\mu)$, with $\tilde{\sigma} = \sigma/\sigma_0$ the dimensionless shear stress and $\mu$
the coefficient of interparticle friction: the dimensional stress is $\sigma$, and $\sigma_0
\propto F_0/ a^2$, where $F_0$ is the magnitude of repulsive force at contact and $a$ is the particle
radius. The data have been used to populate the model of the lubricated-to-frictional rheology
of Wyart and Cates [Phys. Rev. Lett.{\bf 112}, 098302 (2014)], which is based on the concept of two
viscosity divergences or \textquotedblleft jamming\textquotedblright\ points at volume fraction
$\phi_{\rm J}^0 = \phi_{\rm rcp}$ (random close packing) for the low-stress lubricated state,
and at $\phi_{\rm J} (\mu) < \phi_{\rm J}^0$ for any nonzero $\mu$ in the frictional state; a generalization
provides the normal stress response as well as the shear stress. A flow state map of this material
is developed based on the simulation results.
