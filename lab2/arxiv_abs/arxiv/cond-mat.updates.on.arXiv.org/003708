We report studies of the phase diagrams of two two-dimensional systems composed of particles with
repulsive pair potentials, each of which supports a high-density Kagome lattice phase. The commonalities
in the phase diagrams of the systems we have studied and other 2D systems suggests the existence of
a universal mechanism driving all to favor a similar series of packing arrangements as the density
is increased, but the simulations considered show that the only such general rule proposed, namely
the S\"uto theorem, is not a necessary condition for the support of multiple distinct lattice structures
by a particular pair potential. We also find that close to the liquid-to-Kagome phase transition
the transient structured fluctuations in the liquid have Kagome symmetry whereas deeper in the
liquid phase the fluctuations have hexagonal symmetry. As the deviation of the liquid density from
the transition density decreases fluctuations with hexagonal symmetry are replaced with those
with Kagome symmetry. When the transition is string phase-to-Kagome phase the transient structured
fluctuations in the string phase near the transition have both six-fold and other than six-fold
symmetries, with stronger preference for six-fold symmetry in the Truskett system than in the Torquato
system. The path of the string-to-Kagome transition in the Truskett system involves intermediate
honeycomb configurations that subsequently buckle to form a Kagome lattice. The path of the string-to-Kagome
transition in the Torquato system suggests that the Kagome phase is formed by coiled strings merging
together; increasing density generates a Kagome phase with imperfections such as 8-particle rings.
