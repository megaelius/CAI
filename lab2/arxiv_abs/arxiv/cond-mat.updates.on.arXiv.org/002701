We use numerical simulations to study the flow of a bidisperse mixture of athermal, frictionless,
soft-core two dimensional spherocylinders driven in uniform steady state shear. Energy dissipation
is via a viscous drag with respect to a uniformly sheared host fluid, giving a model for a non-Brownian
suspension with a Newtonian rheology. We study pressure $p$ and deviatoric shear stress $\sigma$
as a function of packing fraction $\phi$, strain rate $\dot\gamma$, and a parameter $\alpha$ that
measures the asphericity of the particles. We consider the anisotropy of the stress tensor, the
macroscopic friction $\mu=\sigma/p$, and the divergence of the transport coefficient $\eta_p=p/\dot\gamma$
as $\phi$ is increased to the jamming $\phi_J$. From an analysis of Herschel-Bulkley rheology above
jamming, we estimate $\phi_J$ as a function of $\alpha$ and show that the variation of $\phi_J$ with
$\alpha$ is the main cause for differences in rheology as $\alpha$ is varied. However a detailed
scaling analysis of the divergence of $\eta_p$ for our most elongated particles suggests that the
jamming transition of spherocylinders may be in a different universality class than that of circular
disks. We compute the number of contacts per particle $Z$ in the system and show that at jamming $Z_J$
is a non-monotonic function of $\alpha$ that is always smaller than the isostatic value. We measure
the probability distribution of contacts per unit surface length $\mathcal{P}(\vartheta)$ at
polar angle $\vartheta$ with respect to the spherocylinder spine, and find that as $\alpha\to 0$
this distribution seems to diverge at $\vartheta=\pi/2$, giving a finite limiting probability
for contacts on the vanishingly small flat sides of the spherocylinder. Finally we consider the
variation of the average contact force as a function of location on the particle surface.
