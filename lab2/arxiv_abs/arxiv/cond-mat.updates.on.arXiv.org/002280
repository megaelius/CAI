In this paper, we study two different insulating three-dimensional (3D) quantum magnets. In the
first part of this paper, we propose a strain-induced topological phase transition in 3D topological
insulating antiferromagnets. Without loss of generality, we utilize the physically realistic
spin model of 3D insulating kagome chiral antiferromagnets. By applying (100) uniaxial strain,
we establish that the 3D antiferromagnetic WMs in this system are in fact an intermediate phase between
a strain-induced 3D MCI with integer Chern numbers and a 3D trivial magnon insulator with zero Chern
number. Remarkably, the strain-induced 3D MCI exhibits another topological phase transitions
with different lowest magnon Chern numbers for varying strain parameter. In addition, we show that
strain suppresses the 3D topological thermal Hall conductivity of magnons. Our results provide
a powerful mechanism for investigations of topological phase transitions in 3D chiral topological
antiferromagnets. Motivated by recent experimental observation of topological magnons in CrI$_3$
with a non-negligible interlayer coupling, in the second part of this paper we study the thermal
Hall effect of magnons in the 3D insulating honeycomb ferromagnet CrI$_3$. We utilize the Heisenberg
spin model with a non-negligible interlayer coupling and in-plane exchange interactions up to
third nearest-neighbours and an easy-axis anisotropy as observed in the experiment. Using the
experimentally deduced parameters, we compute the 3D thermal Hall conductivity of magnons in CrI$_3$
and show that it is not negligible and it is positively enhanced by the interlayer coupling and the
magnetic field. Our result provides an essential guide for future experimental measurements of
magnon thermal Hall conductivity in CrI$_3$.
