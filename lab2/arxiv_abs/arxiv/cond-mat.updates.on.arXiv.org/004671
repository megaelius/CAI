Water modeling is a challenging problem. Its anomalies are difficult to reproduce, promoting the
proliferation of a large number of computational models, among which researchers select the most
appropriate for the property they study. In this chapter, we introduce a coarse-grained model introduced
by Franzese and Stanley (FS) that accounts for the many-body interactions of water. We review mean-field
calculations and Monte Carlo simulations on water monolayers for a wide range of pressures and temperatures,
including extreme conditions. The results show the presence of two dynamic crossovers and explain
the origin of diffusion anomalies. Moreover, the model shows that all the different scenarios,
proposed in the last decades as alternative explanations of the experimental anomalies of water,
can be related by the fine-tuning of the many-body (cooperative) interaction. Once this parameter
is set from the experiments, the FS model predicts a phase transition between two liquids with different
densities and energies in the supercooled water region, ending in a liquid-liquid critical point.
From this critical point stems a liquid-liquid Widom line, i.e., the locus of maxima of the water
correlation length, that in the FS model can be directly calculated. The results are consistent
with the extrapolations from experiments. Furthermore, they agree with those from atomistic models
but make predictions over a much wider thermodynamic region, allowing for a better interpretation
of the available experimental data. All these findings provide a coherent picture of the properties
of water and confirm the validity of the FS model that has proved to be useful for large-scale simulations
of biological systems.
