We study the stability of composite fermion fractional quantum Hall states in Harper-Hofstadter
bands with Chern number $|C|>1$. We analyze the states of the composite fermion series for bosons
with contact interactions and (spinless) fermions with nearest-neighbor interactions. We examine
the scaling of the many-body gap as the bands are tuned to the effective continuum limit $n_\phi\to
1/|C|$. Near these points, the Hofstadter model realises large magnetic unit cells that yield bands
with perfectly flat dispersion and Berry curvature. We exploit the known scaling of energies in
the effective continuum limit in order to maintain a fixed square aspect ratio in finite-size calculations.
Based on exact diagonalization calculations of the band-projected Hamiltonian, we show that almost
all finite-size spectra yield the ground state degeneracy predicted by composite fermion theory.
We confirm that states at low ranks in the composite fermion hierarchy are the most robust, and yield
a clear gap in the thermodynamic limit. For bosons in $|C|=2$ and $|C|=3$ bands, our data for the composite
fermion states are compatible with a finite gap in the thermodynamic limit. We also report new evidence
for gapped incompressible states of fermions in $|C|>1$ bands, which have large entanglement gaps.
For cases with a clear spectral gap, we confirm that the thermodynamic limit commutes with the effective
continuum limit. We analyze the nature of the correlation functions for the Abelian composite fermion
states and find that they feature $|C|^2$ smooth sheets. We examine two cases associated with a bosonic
integer quantum Hall effect (BIQHE): for $\nu=2$ in $|C|=1$ bands, we find a strong competing state
with a higher ground state degeneracy, so no clear BIQHE is found in the band-projected Hofstadter
model; for $\nu=1$ in $|C|=2$ bands, we present additional data confirming the existence of a BIQHE
state.
