Particle motion and correlations in fluids within confined domains promise to provide challenges
and opportunities for experimental and theoretical studies. We report molecular dynamics simulations
of a Lennard-Jones gas mimicking argon under partial confinement for a wide range of densities at
a temperature of 300 K. The isotropic behavior of velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) and
mean squared displacement (MSD), seen in the bulk, breaks down due to partial confinement. A distinct
trend emerges in the VACF-perpendicular and MSD-perpendicular, corresponding to the confined
direction, while the trends in VACF-parallel and MSD-parallel, corresponding to the other two
unconfined directions are seen to be unaffected by the confinement. VACF-perpendicular displays
a minimum, at short timescales, that correlates with the separation between the reflective walls.
The effect of partial confinement on MSD-perpendicular is seen to manifest as a transition from
diffusive to subdiffusive motion with the transition time correlating with the minimum in the VACF-perpendicular.
When compared to the trends shown by MSD and VACF in the bulk, the MSD-perpendicular exhibits subdiffusive
behavior and the VACF-perpendicular features rapid decay, suggesting that confinement suppresses
the role of thermal fluctuations significantly. Repetitive wall-mediated collisions are identified
to give rise to the minima in VACF-perpendicular and in turn a characteristic frequency in its frequency
spectrum. The strong linear relation between the minima in VACF-perpendicular and wall-spacing
suggests the existence of collective motion propagating at the speed of sound. These numerical
experiments can offer interesting possibilities in the study of confined motion with observable
consequences.
