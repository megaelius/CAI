We extend a recently introduced prototypical stochastic model describing uniformly the search
and return of objects looking for new food sources around a given home. The model describes the kinematic
motion of the object with constant speed in two dimensions. The angular dynamics is driven by noise
and describes a "pursuit" and "escape" behavior of the heading and the position vectors. Pursuit
behavior ensures the return to the home and the escaping between the two vectors realizes exploration
of space in the vicinity of the given home. Noise is originated by environmental influences and during
decision making of the object. We take symmetric {\alpha}-stable noise since such noise is observed
in experiments. We now investigate for the simplest possible case, the consequences of limited
knowledge of the position angle of the home. We find that both noise type and noise strength can significantly
increase the probability of returning to the home. First, we review shortly main findings of the
model presented in the former manuscript. These are the stationary distance distribution of the
noise driven conservative dynamics and the observation of an optimal noise for finding new food
sources. Afterwards, we generalize the model by adding a constant shift {\gamma} within the interaction
rule between the two vectors. The latter might be created by a permanent uncertainty of the correct
home position. Non vanishing shifts transform the kinematics of the searcher to a dissipative dynamics.
For the latter we discuss the novel deterministic properties and calculate the stationary spatial
distribution around the home.
