We present thermoelectric properties of Be$_2$C monolayer based on density functional theory
based calculations combined with semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. First principles
calculations show the material is direct band gap semiconductor with band gap of 2.0 eV obtained
with Gaussian-attenuating Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (Gau-PBE) hybrid functionals. Kohn-Sham
eigen-states obtained with Gau-PBE are fed into Boltzmann transport equation which is solved under
constant relaxation time approximations resulting into thermoelectric (TE) coefficient in terms
of constant relaxation times ($\tau$). In this work, we have explicitly determined the relaxation
time by studying the electron-phonon interactions by means of electron-phonon coupling using
Wannier functions package to obtain the absolute TE coefficients along armchair and zigzag directions.
Our results shows that material has high TE coefficients like Seebeck coefficient ($\alpha$) and
electrical conductivity ($\sigma$) leading to high power factor ($\alpha^2\sigma$ $\sim$ 3.44
mW/mK$^2$) along zigzag direction with hole doping which is found in the similar order of the PF reported
for commercial TE materials.(J. Appl. Phys. 2003 (93) 368-374; J. Appl. Phys. 2008 (104) 053713-1-053713-5).
Further, third-order anharmonic theory reveals the slightly high lattice thermal conductivity
($\sim$ 66 W/mK) at 300 K giving rise to moderate values of ZT ($\sim$ 0.1) optimized with p-type doping
along zigzag direction. Our results suggest that Be$_2$C monolayer is promising material for thermoelectric
applications as far as high power factor is concerned. Additionally, the dynamical stability of
the Be$_2$C monolayer up to 14 % bi-axial strain shows that phonon tranport in the Be$_2$C monolayer
can be further improved through strain engineering.
