We present a detailed and self-contained analysis of the universal Schwinger-Keldysh effective
field theory which describes macroscopic thermal fluctuations of a relativistic field theory,
elaborating on our earlier construction in arXiv:1511.07809. We write an effective action for
appropriate hydrodynamic Goldstone modes and fluctuation fields, and discuss the symmetries
to be imposed. The constraints imposed by fluctuation-dissipation theorem are manifest in our
formalism. Consequently, the action reproduces hydrodynamic constitutive relations consistent
with the local second law at all orders in the derivative expansion, and captures the essential elements
of the eightfold classification of hydrodynamic transport of arXiv:1502.00636. We demonstrate
how to recover the hydrodynamic entropy and give predictions for the non-Gaussian hydrodynamic
fluctuations. The basic ingredients of our construction involve (i) doubling of degrees of freedom
a la Schwinger-Keldysh, (ii) an emergent thermal gauge symmetry associated with entropy which
is encapsulated in a Noether current a la Wald, and (iii) a BRST/topological supersymmetry imposing
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem a la Parisi-Sourlas. The overarching mathematical framework
for our construction is provided by the balanced equivariant cohomology of thermal translations,
which captures the basic constraints arising from the Schwinger-Keldysh doubling, and the thermal
Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relations. All these features are conveniently implemented in a covariant
superspace formalism. An added benefit is that the second law can be understood as being due to entropy
inflow from the Grassmann-odd directions of superspace.
