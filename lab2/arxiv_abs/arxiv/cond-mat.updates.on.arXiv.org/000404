Oblique anti-plane shear waves in periodic layered elastic composites are considered and the corresponding
frequency-band structure, group and energy-flux velocities are calculated. The composite's
unit cell may consist of any number of layers of any variable (with large discontinuities) mass-densities
and elastic shear moduli. Explicit series expressions are given for displacement, velocity, strain
and stress components, and energy-flux vector fields. The approach is based on a mixed variational
principle where the displacement and stress components are viewed as independent fields subject
to arbitrary variations. These fields are hence approximated independently, thereby ensuring
the necessary continuity conditions. The resulting computational method yields the composite's
frequency bands in terms of the wave-vector components. The calculations are direct and require
no iteration, accurately and efficiently producing the entire band structure of the composite.
This also allows for direct calculation of the components of the group velocity and the energy-flux
vectors as functions of frequency and wave-vector components over an entire frequency band. The
general results are illustrated using a two-phase and a three-phase unit cell with piecewise constant
properties. It is shown that the directions of the group-velocity and energy-flux vectors are essentially
indistinguishable for this class of problems, and that both the two-phase and the three-phase unit
cells can display negative refraction on their second frequency pass-band, where the phase and
group velocities are antiparallel (backward waves). The presented method is applicable and effective
also when some or all of the layers in a unit cell have spatially varying properties.
