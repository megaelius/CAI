The quaternary arsenide compounds XCuYAs (X=Zr, Hf; Y= Si, Ge) belong to the vast family of the 1111-type
quaternary compounds, which possess outstanding physical properties ranging from $p$-type transparent
semiconductors to high-temperature Fe-based superconductors. In this paper, we study the electronic
structure topology, spin Hall effect (SHE) and spin Nernst effect (SNE) in these compounds based
on density functional theory calculations. First we find that the four considered compounds are
Dirac semimetals with the nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected Dirac line nodes along the Brillouin
zone boundary $A$-$M$ and $X$-$R$ and low density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Second,
the intrinsic SHE and SNE in some of these considered compounds are found to be large. In particular,
the calculated spin Hall conductivity (SHC) of HfCuGeAs is as large as -514 ($\hbar$/e)(S/cm).
The spin Nernst conductivity (SNC) of HfCuGeAs at room temperature is also large, being -0.73 ($\hbar$/e)(A/m-K).
Moreover, both the magnitude and sign of the SHC and SNC in these compounds can be manipulated by varying
either the applied electric field direction or spin current direction. The SHE and SNE in these compounds
can also be enhanced by tuning the Fermi level via chemical doping or electric gating. Finally, a
detailed analysis of the band-decomposed and $k$-resolved spin Berry curvatures reveals that
these large SHC and SNC as well as their notable tunabilities originate largely from the presence
of a large number of spin-orbit coupling-gapped Dirac points near the Fermi level as well as the gapless
Dirac line-nodes, which give rise to large spin Berry curvatures. Our findings thus suggest that
the four XCuYAs compounds not only provide a valuable platform for exploring the interplay between
SHE, SNE and band topology but also have promising applications in spintronics and spin caloritronics.
