Prototypical three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetals (DSMs), such as Cd$_3$As$_2$
and Na$_3$Bi, contain electrons that obey a linear momentum-energy dispersion with different
Fermi velocities along the three orthogonal momentum dimensions. Despite being extensively studied
in recent years, the inherent \emph{Fermi velocity anisotropy} has often been neglected in the
theoretical and numerical studies of 3D DSMs. Although this omission does not qualitatively alter
the physics of light-driven massless quasiparticles in 3D DSMs, it does \emph{quantitatively}
change the optical coefficients which can lead to nontrivial implications in terms of nanophotonics
and plasmonics applications. Here we study the linear optical response of 3D DSMs for general Fermi
velocity values along each direction. Although the signature conductivity-frequency scaling,
$\sigma(\omega) \propto \omega$, of 3D Dirac fermion is well-protected from Fermi velocity anisotropy,
the linear optical response exhibits strong linear dichroism as captured by the \emph{universal}
extinction ratio scaling law, $\Lambda_{ij} = (v_i/v_j)^2$ (where $i\neq j$ denotes the three
spatial coordinates $x,y,z$, and $v_i$ is the $i$-direction Fermi velocity), which is independent
of frequency, temperature, doping, and carrier scattering lifetime. For Cd$_3$As$_2$ and Na$_3$Bi$_3$,
an exceptionally strong extinction ratio larger than 15 and covering broad terahertz window is
revealed. Our findings shed new light on the role of Fermi velocity anisotropy in the optical response
of Dirac semimetals and open up novel polarization-sensitive functionalities, such as photodetection
and light modulation.
