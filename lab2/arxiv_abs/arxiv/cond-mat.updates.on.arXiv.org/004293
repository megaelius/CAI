We present an implementation of the analytical string theory recently applied to the description
of glasses. These are modeled as continuum media with embedded elastic string heterogeneities,
randomly located and randomly oriented, which oscillate around a straight equilibrium position
with a fundamental frequency depending on their length. The existence of a length distribution
reflects then in a distribution of oscillation frequencies which is responsible for the Boson Peak
in the glass density of states. Previously, it has been shown that such a description can account
for the elastic anomalies reported at frequencies comparable with the Boson Peak. Here we start
from the generalized hydrodynamics to determine the dynamic correlation function $S(k,\omega)$
associated with the coherent, dispersive and attenuated, sound waves resulting from a sound-string
interference. Once the vibrational density of states has been measured, we can use it for univocally
fixing the string length distribution inherent to a given glass. The density-density correlation
function obtained using such distribution is strongly constrained, and able to account for the
experimental data collected on two prototypical glasses: glycerol and silica. The obtained string
length distribution is compatible with the typical size of elastic heterogeneities previously
reported for silica and supercooled liquids, and the atomic motion associated to the string dynamics
is consistent with the soft modes recently identified in large scale numerical simulations as non-phonon
modes responsible for the Boson Peak. The theory is thus in agreement with the most recent advances
in the understanding of the glass specific dynamics and offers an appealing simple understanding
of the microscopic origin of the latter, while raising new questions on the universality or material-specificity
of the string distribution properties.
