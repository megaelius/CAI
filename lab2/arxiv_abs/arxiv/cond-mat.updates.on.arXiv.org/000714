Tuning band gaps in two-dimensional (2D) materials is of great interest in the fundamental and practical
aspects of contemporary material sciences. Recently, black phosphorus (BP) consisting of stacked
layers of phosphorene was experimentally observed to show a widely tunable band gap by means of the
deposition of potassium (K) atoms on the surface, thereby allowing great flexibility in design
and optimization of electronic and optoelectronic devices. Here, based on the density-functional
theory calculations, we demonstrates that the donated electrons from K dopants are mostly localized
at the topmost BP layer and such a surface charging efficiently screens the K ion potential. It is
found that, as the K doping increases, the extreme surface charging and its screening of K atoms shift
the conduction bands down in energy, i.e., towards higher binding energy, because they have more
charge near the surface, while it has little influence on the valence bands having more charge in
the deeper layers. This result provides a different explanation for the observed tunable band gap
compared to the previously proposed giant Stark effect where a vertical electric field from the
positively ionized K overlayer to the negatively charged BP layers shifts the conduction band minimum
${\Gamma}_{\rm 1c}$ (valence band minimum ${\Gamma}_{\rm 8v}$) downwards (upwards). The present
prediction of ${\Gamma}_{\rm 1c}$ and ${\Gamma}_{\rm 8v}$ as a function of the K doping reproduces
well the widely tunable band gap, anisotropic Dirac semimetal state, and band-inverted semimetal
state, as observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment. Our findings shed
new light on a route for tunable band gap engineering of 2D materials through the surface doping of
alkali metals.
