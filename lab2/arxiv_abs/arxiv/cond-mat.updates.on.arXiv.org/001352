At present hydrogen-based compounds constitute one of the most promising classes of materials
towards their applications as a phonon-mediated high-temperature superconductors. Herein,
the behavior of the superconducting phase in tellurium hydride (HTe) at high pressure ($p=300$
GPa) is analyzed in details, in the framework of the isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The
chosen pressure conditions are considered here as a case study, which correspond to the highest
critical temperature value ($T_{c}$) in the analyzed material; as determined within recent density
functional theory simulations. It is found that the Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, which constitute
strong-coupling generalization of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, predicts that
the critical temperature value ($T_{c}=52.73$ K) is higher than previous estimates of the McMillan
formula. Further investigations show that the characteristic dimensionless ratios for the the
thermodynamic critical field, the specific heat for the superconducting state, and the superconducting
band gap exceeds the limits set by the BCS theory. In this context, also the effective electron mass
is not equal to the bare electron mass as provided by the BCS theory. On the basis of these findings
it is predicted that the strong-coupling and retardation effects play pivotal role in the superconducting
phase of HTe at 300 GPa, in agreement with similar theoretical estimates for the sibling hydrogen
and hydrogen-based compounds. Hence, it is suggested that the superconducting state in HTe cannot
be properly described within the mean-field picture of the BCS theory.
