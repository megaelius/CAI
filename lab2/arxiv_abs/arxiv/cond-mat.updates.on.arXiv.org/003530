The direct experimental probing of locally varying lattice parameters and anisotropic lattice
deformations in atomic multilayers is extremely challenging. Here, we develop a new combined numerical/graphical
method for the analysis of irregular moir\'e superstructures measured by scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) on a small-twist-angle ($\sim$0.6$^{\circ}$) graphene on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
(gr/HOPG). We observe distorted moir\'e patterns with a spatially varying period in annealed gr/HOPG.
The nanoscale modulation of the moir\'e period observed by STM reflects a locally strained (and
sheared) graphene with anisotropic variation of the lattice parameters. We use a specific algorithm
based on a rigid lattice Fourier method, which is able to reconstruct the irregular and distorted
moir\'e patterns emerging from strain-induced lattice deformations. Our model is universal and
can be used to study different moir\'e patterns occurring in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures.
Additionally, room temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show electronic
states at the Dirac point, localized on moir\'e hills, which increase significantly the apparent
corrugation of the moir\'e pattern. The measured topography is compared to classical molecular
dynamics simulations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that an AAB stacked
trilayer region itself can contribute electronic states near the Fermi-level, in agreement with
the measured peak in the local density of states. Furthermore, CMD calculations reveal direction-dependent
bond alternations ($\sim$0.5$\%$) around the stacking regions, induced by shear strain, which
could influence electronic properties.
