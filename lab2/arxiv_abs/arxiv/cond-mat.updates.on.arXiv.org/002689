We present a general method for calculating wave-packet evolution in the context of ultracold atoms
in matter-wave interferometers. This method provides an efficient tool for analyzing the performance
of atomic interferometers based on atom clouds initially prepared in a trap in a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) state or in a thermal distribution. Without having to solve explicitely the Gross-Pitaevskii
or the Schr\"odinger equation, this provides a good estimation of dynamic wave-packet properties
such as size and phase across the wave-packet, and slows to predict the coherence of the interferometer.
We develop a generalized Thomas-Fermi approximation for a BEC in a harmonic trap, which is valid
for any atom-atom interaction strength. In particular, this approximation also provides a good
estimation of the transition from a three-dimensional to a one-dimensional BEC in an elongated
trap. The approximation is followed by a theory of dynamic wave-packet evolution when the trap is
fully or partially switched off and the atoms are split and propagate, for example, in free space
or in a matter waveguide. The method is applied for studying two examples of interferometric effects:
reduction of coherence of two-state interferometers due to imperfect spatial recombination of
the two interferometer arms (the "Humpty-Dumpty effect") and phase diffusion due to number uncertainty
in the two interferometer arms, which was previously studied thoroughly only for interferometric
schemes where the BECs in the two arms stay trapped (for example, in a double-well potential). For
both effects we extend the applicability of the theory to a wide range of interferometric scenarios
that were not included in previous theories.
