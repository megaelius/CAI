We derive the finite temperature Keldysh response theory for interacting fermions in the presence
of quenched disorder, as applicable to any of the 10 Altland-Zirnbauer classes in an Anderson delocalized
phase with at least a U(1) continuous symmetry. In this formulation of the interacting Finkel'stein
nonlinear sigma model, the statistics of one-body wave functions are encoded by the constrained
matrix field, while physical correlations follow from the hydrodynamic density or spin response
field, which decouples the interactions. Integrating out the matrix field first, we obtain weak
(anti)localization and Altshuler-Aronov quantum conductance corrections from the hydrodynamic
response function. This procedure automatically incorporates the correct infrared physics,
and in particular gives the Altshuler-Aronov-Khmelnitsky (AAK) equations for dephasing of weak
(anti)localization due to electron-electron collisions. We explicate the method by deriving
known quantum corrections in two dimensions for the symplectic metal class AII, as well as the spin-SU(2)
invariant superconductor classes C and CI. We show that conductance corrections due to the special
modes at zero energy in nonstandard classes are automatically cut off by temperature, as previously
expected, while the Wigner-Dyson class Cooperon modes that persist to all energies are cut by dephasing.
We also show that for short-ranged interactions, the standard self-consistent solution for the
dephasing rate is equivalent to a diagrammatic summation via the self-consistent Born approximation.
This should be compared to the AAK solution for long-ranged Coulomb interactions, which exploits
the Markovian noise correlations induced by thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field.
We discuss prospects for exploring the many-body localization transition from the ergodic side
as a dephasing catastrophe in short-range interacting models.
