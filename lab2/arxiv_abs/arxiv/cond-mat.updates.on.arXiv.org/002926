In present study, the magnetic structure and spin reorientation of mixed doped orthoferrite Nd$_{0.5}$Dy$_{0.5}$FeO$_3$
have been investigated. Similar to both parent compounds (NdFeO$_3$ and DyFeO$_3$), the magnetic
structure of Fe$^{3+}$ belongs to ${\Gamma}_{4}$ irreducible representation (G$_{x}$, F$_{z}$)
at room temperature. The experimental measurements confirmed the spin reorientation where magnetic
structure of Fe$^{3+}$ changes from ${\Gamma}_{4}$ to ${\Gamma}_{2}$(F$_{x}$, G$_{z}$) between
75 and 20 \,K while maintaining G-type configuration. Such a gradual spin reorientation is unusual
since the large single ion anisotropy of Dy$^{3+}$ ions causes an abrupt ${\Gamma}_{4}$${\rightarrow}$
${\Gamma}_{1}$(G$_{y}$) spin reorientation in DyFeO$_3$. Between 20 and 10 \,K, the Fe$^{3+}$
magnetic structure is represented by ${\Gamma}_{2}$ (F$_{x}$, G$_{z}$). Unexpectedly, magnetic
structure of Fe$^{3+}$ with ${\Gamma}_{4}$ representation re-emerges below 10\,K which also
coincides with the development of rare-earth (Nd$^{3+}$/Dy$^{3+}$) magnetic ordering having
C$_{y}$ configuration with magnetic moment of 1.8 ${\mu}_{B}$. The absence of any signature of
second order phase transition in the specific heat confirms the role of $R$(Nd$^{3+}$/Dy$^{3+}$)-Fe$^{3+}$
exchange interaction in the observed "rare-earth ordering" unlike DyFeO$_3$ where Dy$^{3+}$
ordering takes place independently to the magnetic ordering of Fe$^{3+}$ magnetic structure.
Our (DFT+U+SO) calculations show that the C-type arrangement of rare-earth ions (Nd$^{3+}$/Dy$^{3+}$)
with ${\Gamma}_{2}$ configuration for Fe$^{3+}$ moments is the ground state whereas ${\Gamma}_{4}$
phase is energetically very close. Nd-Fe and Nd-Dy exchange interactions, estimated from DFT,
are observed to have significant roles in the rare earth ordering and Fe spin reorientation corroborating
our experimental results.
