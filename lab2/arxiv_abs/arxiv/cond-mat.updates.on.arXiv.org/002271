Bacteriophage viruses, one of the most abundant entities in our planet, lack the ability to move
independently. Instead, they crowd fluid environments in anticipation of a random encounter with
a bacterium. Once they land on the cell body of their victim, they are able to eject their genetic material
inside the host cell. Many phage species, however, first attach to the flagellar filaments of bacteria.
Being immotile, these so-called flagellotropic phages still manage to reach the cell body for infection,
and the process by which they move up the flagellar filament has intrigued the scientific community
for decades. In 1973, Berg and Anderson (Nature, 245, 380) proposed the nut-and-bolt mechanism
in which, similarly to a rotated nut that is able to move along a bolt, the phage wraps itself around
a flagellar filament possessing helical grooves (due to the helical rows of flagellin molecules)
and exploits the rotation of the flagellar filament in order to passively travel along it. One of
the main evidence for this mechanism is the fact that mutants of bacterial species such as Escherichia
coli and Salmonella typhimurium that possess straight flagellar filaments with a preserved helical
groove structure can still be infected by their relative phages. Using two distinct approaches
to address the short-range interactions between phages and flagellar filaments, we provide here
a first-principle theoretical model for the nut-and-bolt mechanism applicable to mutants possessing
straight flagellar filaments. Our model is fully analytical, is able to predict the speed of translocation
of a bacteriophage along a flagellar filament as a function of the geometry of both phage and bacterium,
the rotation rate of the flagellar filament, and the handedness of the helical grooves, and is consistent
with past experimental observations.
