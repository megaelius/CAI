The properties of a locally frozen (in a region of diameter 0.5 mm) magnetic field in a YBa2Cu3O7-x
slab 0.5 mm thick are investigated as a function of the value of the excitation field, the regime of
freezing, and the transport current through the sample. The first regime is cooling of the ceramic
to 77 K in the excitation field with a subsequent turning off of the excitation field, and the second
regime is cooling in the Earth's magnetic field with a subsequent turning on and off of the excitation
field. At an excitation field up to 2000 A/m in these regimes two different types of macroscopic current
vortex structures, which generate the frozen field, are formed. The local critical field of excitation
when the vortex structure is formed in the second regime exceeds the uniform perpendicular critical
field of the slab by a factor of 10 and equals 1700 A/m. On the other hand, the vortex structure of the
first type can be formed by practically any weak excitation field, including fields smaller than
the critical field of the vortex structure of the second type. In a representation of the ceramic
as a Josephson medium, physical models of the two types of vortex structures are proposed which correspond
most fully to the results of experiments. The displacement of the vortex structure of the first type
upon the passage of transport current through the slab, as a result of the action of the Lorentz force
on that structure, is registered. This makes it possible to calculate the pinning force Fp and to
estimate the value of the viscosity n for the motion of such a vortex structure in the ceramic: Fp=6x10-8
N, n =6x10-5 kg/s.
