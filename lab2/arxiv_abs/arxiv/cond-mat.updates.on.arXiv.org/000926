Lead halide perovskite semiconductors are soft, polar, materials. The strong driving force for
polaron formation (the dielectric electron-phonon coupling) is balanced by the light band effective-masses,
leading to a strongly-interacting large-polaron. A first-principles prediction of mobility
would help understand the fundamental mobility limits. Theories of mobility need to consider the
polaron (rather than free-carrier) state due to the strong interactions. In this material we expect
that at room temperature polar-optical phonon mode scattering will dominate, and so limit mobility.
We calculate the temperature-dependent polaron mobility of hybrid halide perovskites by variationally
solving the Feynman polaron model with the finite-temperature free-energies of \=Osaka. This
model considers a simplified effective-mass band-structure interacting with a continuum dielectric
of characteristic response frequency. We parametrise the model fully from electronic-structure
calculations. In methylammonium lead iodide at 300 K we predict electron and hole mobilities of
133 and 94 cm^2/V/s respectively. These are in acceptable agreement with single-crystal measurements,
suggesting that the intrinsic limit of the polaron charge carrier state has been reached. Repercussions
for hot-electron photo-excited states are discussed. As well as mobility, the model also exposes
the dynamic structure of the polaron. This can be used to interpret impedance measurements of the
charge-carrier state. We provide the phonon-drag mass-renormalisation, and scattering time
constants. These could be used as parameters for larger-scale device models and band-structure
dependent mobility simulations.
