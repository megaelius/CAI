In this paper, based on the numerical calculation of total energy utilizing the Green's function
method, we found that the external electric field applied to a microparticle-suspended nematic
liquid crystal cell, if reaching a critical value, combined with its direction, surface anchoring
feature and molecular dielectric anisotropy, is possible to create an anisotropic "bubble" around
the microparticle with a vertical fast "lane", in which the microparticle can, driven by the asymmetric
buoyant force, vertically move swiftly from the cell's midplane to a new equilibrium position,
triggering a positional transition discovered by the author previously. Such a new equilibrium
position is decided via a competition between the buoyant force and the effective force built upon
the microparticle by the elastic energy gradient along the "lane". The threshold value of external
field, depends on thickness $L$ and Frank elastic constant $K$ and slightly on the microparticle
size and density, in a Fr\'{e}edericksz-like manner, but by a factor. For a nematic liquid crystal
cell with planar surface alignment, a bistable equilibrium structure for the transition is found
when the direction of the applied electric field is (a) perpendicular to the two plates of the cell
with positive molecular dielectric anisotropy, or (b) parallel to the two plates and the anchoring
direction of the cell with negative molecular dielectric anisotropy. Except for the formation
of a vertical fast "lane", when the electric field applied is parallel to both the two plates and perpendicular
to the anchoring direction, the microparticle suspended in the nematic liquid crystal tends to
be trapped in the midplane, regardless of the sign of the molecular dielectric anisotropy. Such
phenomenon also occurs for negative molecular dielectric anisotropy while the external is applied
perpendicular to the two plates.
