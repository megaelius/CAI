Extensive first-principle calculations on embedded clusters containing few O, Y, Ti, and Cr atoms
as well as vacancies are performed to obtain interaction parameters to be applied in Metropolis
Monte Carlo simulations, within the framework of a rigid lattice model. A novel description using
both pair and triple parameters is shown to be more precise than the commonly used pair parameterization.
Simulated annealing provides comprehensive data on the energetics, structure and stoichiometry
of nm-size clusters at T=0. The results are fully consistent with the experimental finding of negligible
coarsening and a high dispersion of the clusters, with the observation that the presence of Ti reduces
the cluster size, and with the reported radiation tolerance of the clusters. In alloys without vacancies
clusters show a planar structure, whereas the presence of vacancies leads to three-dimensional
configurations. Additionally, Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations are carried out at high temperature
in order to investigate the dependence of nanocluster composition on temperature. A good agreement
between the existing experimental data on the ratios (Y+Ti):O, Y:Ti, (Y+Cr):O, and Y:Cr, and the
simulation results is found. In some cases it is even possible to draw the conclusion that the respective
alloys contained a certain amount of vacancies, and that the clusters analyzed were frozen-in high-temperature
configurations. The comparison of experimental data with those obtained by simulations demonstrates
that the assumption of nanoclusters consisting of nonstoichiometric oxides which are essentially
coherent with the bcc lattice of the Fe-Cr matrix leads to reasonable results.
