Using a Green's function approach, we study phonon-mediated superconducting pairing symmetries
that may arise in bilayer graphene where the monolayers are displaced in-plane with respect to each
other. We consider a generic coupling potential between the displaced graphene monolayers, which
is applicable to both shifted and commensurate twisted graphene layers; study intralayer and interlayer
phonon-mediated BCS pairings; and investigate AA and AB(AC) stacking orders. Our findings demonstrate
that at the charge neutrality point, the dominant pairings in both AA and AB stackings with intralayer
and interlayer electron-electron couplings can have even-parity $s$-wave class and odd-parity
$p$-wave class of symmetries with the possibility of invoking equal-pseudospin and odd-frequency
pair correlations. At a finite doping, however, the AB (and equivalently AC) stacking can develop
pseudospin-singlet and pseudospin-triplet $d$-wave symmetry, in addition to $s$-wave, $p$-wave,
$f$-wave, and their combinations, while the AA stacking order, similar to the undoped case, is unable
to host the $d$-wave symmetry. When we introduce a generic coupling potential, applicable to commensurate
twisted and shifted bilayers of graphene, $d$-wave symmetry can also appear at the charge neutrality
point. Inspired by a recent experiment where two phonon modes were observed in a twisted bilayer
graphene, we also discuss the possibility of the existence of two-gap superconductivity, where
the intralayer and interlayer phonon-mediated BCS picture is responsible for superconductivity.
These analyses may provide a useful tool in determining the superconducting pairing symmetries
and mechanism in bilayer graphene systems.
