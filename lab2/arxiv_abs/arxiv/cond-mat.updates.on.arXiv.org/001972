The influence of long-range dipole interactions on two dimensional magnetism has been studied
extensively in the spin-reorientation transition of ferromagnetic ultrathin films. Although
there is a great deal of experimental information on the perpendicular domain phase that is stabilized
by dipole interactions, the transitions to or from the domain phase are subtle and difficult to characterize
experimentally. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show no divergence in the vicinity of the
spin-reorientation transition as a function of thickness -- a null result that is difficult to interpret
with confidence. This article reports separate dynamical and equilibrium versions of the reorientation
transition in Fe/2ML Ni/W(110) films, using measurements of the magnetic susceptibility as the
films are grown. The dynamical version occurs when increasing the film thickness causes the domain
walls to depin, and the system moves from a configuration that minimizes local energetics to one
that minimizes global energetics. The dynamical transition \textit{is} marked by a divergent
magnetic susceptibility measured with a field applied along the in-plane W[001] direction. A comparative
study of the two versions of the same spin-reorientation transition aids in the experimental characterization
of the effects of dipole interactions on the phase transitions. This comparison confirms the original
null result found in magnetic susceptibility measurements of the equilibrium transition; despite
its name, the spin-reorientation transition in ferromagnetic ultrathin films has no critical
phase transition in either the magnetization or its orientation.
