The percolation behavior of aligned rigid rods of length $k$ ($k$-mers) on two-dimensional triangular
lattices has been studied by numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. The $k$-mers,
containing $k$ identical units (each one occupying a lattice site), were irreversibly deposited
along one of the directions of the lattice. The connectivity analysis was carried out by following
the probability $R_{L,k}(p)$ that a lattice composed of $L \times L$ sites percolates at a concentration
$p$ of sites occupied by particles of size $k$. The results, obtained for $k$ ranging from 2 to 80,
showed that the percolation threshold $p_c(k)$ exhibits a increasing function when it is plotted
as a function of the $k$-mer size. The dependence of $p_c(k)$ was determined, being $p_c(k)=A+B/(C+\sqrt{k})$,
where $A = p_c(k \rightarrow \infty)= 0.582(9)$ is the value of the percolation threshold by infinitely
long $k$-mers, $B =-0.47(0.21)$ and $C = 5.79(2.18)$. This behavior is completely different to
that observed for square lattices, where the percolation threshold decreases with $k$. In addition,
the effect of the anisotropy on the properties of the percolating phase was investigated. The results
revealed that, while for finite systems the anisotropy of the deposited layer favors the percolation
along the parallel direction to the nematic axis, in the thermodynamic limit, the value of the percolation
threshold is the same in both parallel and transversal directions. Finally, an exhaustive study
of critical exponents and universality was carried out, showing that the phase transition occurring
in the system belongs to the standard random percolation universality class regardless of the value
of $k$ considered.
