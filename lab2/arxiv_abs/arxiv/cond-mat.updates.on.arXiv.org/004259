We uncover the properties of complex tensor (d-wave) superconducting order in three-dimensional
Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals that host pseudospin-3/2 fermions at a fourfold linear band
crossing point. Although the general theory of d-wave order was originally developed for materials
displaying quadratic band touching, it directly applies to the case of semimetals with linear dispersion,
several candidate compounds of which have been discovered experimentally very recently. The spin-3/2
nature of the fermions allows for the formation of spin-2 Cooper pairs which may be described by a
complex second-rank tensor order parameter. In the case of linear dispersion, for the chemical
potential at the Fermi point and at strong coupling, the energetically preferred superconducting
state is the uniaxial nematic state, which preserves time-reversal symmetry and provides a full
(anisotropic) gap for quasiparticle excitations. In contrast, at a finite chemical potential,
we find that the usual weak-coupling instability is towards the "cyclic state", well known from
the studies of multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates, which breaks time reversal symmetry
maximally, has vanishing average value of angular momentum, and features 16 small Bogoliubov--Fermi
surfaces. The Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals provide therefore the first example of weakly
coupled, three-dimensional, isotropic d-wave superconductors where the ground state is uniquely
determined by the quartic expansion of the mean-field free energy, and not afflicted by the accidental
degeneracy first noticed by Mermin over 40 years ago. We discuss the appearance and stability of
the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces in absence of inversion symmetry in the electronic Hamiltonian,
as in the case at hand.
