Advanced microscopy and/or spectroscopy tools play indispensable role in nanoscience and nanotechnology
research, as it provides rich information about the growth mechanism, chemical compositions,
crystallography, and other important physical and chemical properties. However, the interpretation
of imaging data heavily relies on the "intuition" of experienced researchers. As a result, many
of the deep graphical features obtained through these tools are often unused because of difficulties
in processing the data and finding the correlations. Such challenges can be well addressed by deep
learning. In this work, we use the optical characterization of two-dimensional (2D) materials
as a case study, and demonstrate a neural-network-based algorithm for the material and thickness
identification of exfoliated 2D materials with high prediction accuracy and real-time processing
capability. Further analysis shows that the trained network can extract deep graphical features
such as contrast, color, edges, shapes, segment sizes and their distributions, based on which we
develop an ensemble approach topredict the most relevant physical properties of 2D materials.
Finally, a transfer learning technique is applied to adapt the pretrained network to other applications
such as identifying layer numbers of a new 2D material, or materials produced by a different synthetic
approach. Our artificial-intelligence-based material characterization approach is a powerful
tool that would speed up the preparation, initial characterization of 2D materials and other nanomaterials
and potentially accelerate new material discoveries.
