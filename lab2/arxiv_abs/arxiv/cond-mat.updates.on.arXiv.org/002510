Broken symmetries in solids involving higher order multipolar degrees of freedom are historically
referred to as "hidden orders" due to the formidable task of detecting them with conventional probes.
Examples of such hidden orders include spin-nematic order in quantum magnets, and quadrupolar
or higher multipolar orders in various correlated quantum materials. In this work, we theoretically
propose that the study of magnetostriction provides a powerful and novel tool to directly detect
higher-order multipolar symmetry breaking $-$ such as the elusive octupolar order $-$ by examining
its scaling behaviour with respect to an applied magnetic field $h$. As an illustrative example,
we examine such key scaling signatures in the context of Pr-based cage compounds with strongly correlated
$f$-electrons, Pr(Ti,V,Ir)$_2$(Al,Zn)$_{20}$, whose low energy degrees of freedom are composed
of purely higher-order multipoles: quadrupoles $\mathcal{O}_{20,22}$ and octupole $\mathcal{T}_{xyz}$.
Employing a symmetry-based Landau theory of multipolar moments coupled to lattice strain fields,
we demonstrate that a magnetic field applied along the [111] direction results in a length change
with a distinct linear-in-$h$ scaling behaviour, accompanied by hysteresis, below the octupolar
ordering temperature. We show that the resulting "magnetostriction coefficient" is directly
proportional to the octupolar order parameter, providing the first clear access to this subtle
order parameter. Along other field directions, we show that the field dependence of the magnetostriction
provides a window into quadrupolar orders. Our work provides a springboard for future experimental
and theoretical investigations of multipolar orders and their quantum phase transitions in a wide
variety of systems.
