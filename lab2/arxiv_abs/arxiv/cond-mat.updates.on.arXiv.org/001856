We introduce a powerful Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm for the atomistic simulation of bulk models of
oligo- and poly-thiophenes by redesigning MC moves originally developed for considerably simpler
polymer structures and architectures, such as linear and branched polyethylene, to account for
the ring structure of the thiophene monomer. Elementary MC moves implemented include bias reptation
of an end thiophene ring, flip of an internal thiophene ring, rotation of an end thiophene ring, concerted
rotation of three thiophene rings, rigid translation of an entire molecule, rotation of an entire
molecule and volume fluctuation. In the implementation of all moves we assume that thiophene ring
atoms remain rigid and strictly co-planar; on the other hand, inter-ring torsion and bond bending
angles remain fully flexible subject to suitable potential energy functions. Test simulations
with the new algorithm of an important thiophene oligomer, {\alpha}-sexithiophene ({\alpha}-6T),
at a high enough temperature (above its isotropic-to-nematic phase transition) using a new united
atom model specifically developed for the purpose of this work provide predictions for the volumetric,
conformational and structural properties that are remarkably close to those obtained from detailed
atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using an all-atom model. The new algorithm is particularly
promising for exploring the rich (and largely unexplored) phase behavior and nanoscale ordering
of very long (also more complex) thiophene-based polymers which cannot be addressed by conventional
MD methods due to the extremely long relaxation times characterizing chain dynamics in these systems.
