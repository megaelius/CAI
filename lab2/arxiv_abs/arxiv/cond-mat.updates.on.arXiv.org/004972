We report a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the high-pressure structural
and vibrational properties of terbium sesquioxide (Tb2O3). Powder x-ray diffraction and Raman
scattering measurements show that cubic (C-type) Tb2O3 undergoes two phase transitions up to 25
GPa. We observe a first irreversible reconstructive transition to the monoclinic (B-type) phase
at ~7 GPa and a subsequent reversible displacive transition from the monoclinic to the trigonal
(A-type) phase at ~12 GPa. Thus, Tb2O3 is found to follow the well-known C-B-A phase transition found
in other cubic rare-earth sesquioxides with cations of larger atomic mass than Tb. Our ab initio
theoretical calculations predict phase transition pressures and bulk moduli for the three phases
in rather good agreement with experimental results. Moreover, Raman-active modes of the three
phases have been monitored as a function of pressure and lattice-dynamics calculations have allowed
us to confirm the assignment of the experimental phonon modes in the C-type phase as well as to make
a tentative assignment of the symmetry of most vibrational modes in the B- and A-type phases. Finally,
we extract the bulk moduli and the Raman-active modes frequencies together with their pressure
coefficients for the three phases of Tb2O3. These results are thoroughly compared and discussed
in relation to those reported for rare-earth and other related sesquioxides. It is concluded that
the evolution of the volume and bulk modulus of all the three phases of these technologically relevant
compounds exhibit a nearly linear trend with respect to the third power of the ionic radii of the cations.
