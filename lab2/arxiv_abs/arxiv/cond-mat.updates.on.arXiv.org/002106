The field of topological electronic materials has seen rapid growth in recent years, in particular
with the increasing number of weakly interacting systems predicted and observed to host topologically
non-trivial bands. Given the broad appearance of topology in such systems, it is expected that correlated
electronic systems should also be capable of hosting topologically non-trivial states. Interest
in correlated platforms is heightened by the prospect that collective behavior therein may give
rise to new types of topological states and phenomena not possible in non-interacting systems.
However, to date only a limited number of correlated topological materials have been definitively
reported due to both the challenge in calculation of their electronic properties and the experimental
complexity of correlation effects imposed on the topological aspects of their electronic structure.
Here, we report a de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) study of the recently discovered kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn$_2$
mapping the massive Dirac states strongly coupled to the intrinsic ferromagnetic order. We observe
a pair of quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces arising from the massive Dirac states previously
detected by spectroscopic probes and show that these band areas and effective masses are systematically
modulated by the rotation of the ferromagnetic moment. Combined with measurements of Berry curvature
induced Hall conductivity, we find that along with the Dirac fermion mass, velocity, and energy
are suppressed with rotation of the moment towards the kagome plane. These observations demonstrate
that strong coupling of magnetic order to electronic structure similar to that observed in elemental
ferromagnets can be extended to topologically non-trivial electronic systems, suggesting pathways
for connecting topological states to robust spintronic technologies.
