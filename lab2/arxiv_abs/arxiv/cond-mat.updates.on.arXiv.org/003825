PN heterojunctions comprising layered van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors have been used to demonstrate
current rectifiers, photodetectors, and photovoltaic devices. However, a direct or near-direct
bandgap at the heterointerface that can significantly enhance optical generation, for high light
absorbing few/multi-layer vdW materials, has not yet been shown. In this work, for the first time,
few-layer group-6 transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) $WSe_2$ is shown to form a sizeable (0.7
eV) near-direct bandgap with type-II band alignment at its interface with the group-7 TMD $ReS_2$
through density functional theory calculations. Further, the type-II alignment and photogeneration
across the interlayer bandgap have been experimentally confirmed through micro-photoluminescence
and IR photodetection measurements, respectively. High optical absorption in few-layer flakes,
large conduction and valence band offsets for efficient electron-hole separation and stacking
of light facing, direct bandgap $ReS_2$ on top of gate tunable $WSe_2$ are shown to result in excellent
and tunable photodetection as well as photovoltaic performance through flake thickness dependent
optoelectronic measurements. Few-layer flakes demonstrate ultrafast response time (5 $\mu$s)
at high responsivity (3 A/W) and large photocurrent generation and responsivity enhancement at
the heterostructure overlap region (10-100X) for 532 nm laser illumination. Large open-circuit
voltage of 0.64 V and short-circuit current of 2.6 $\mu$A enables high output electrical power.
Finally, long term air-stability and a facile single contact metal fabrication process makes the
multi-functional few-layer $WSe_2$/$ReS_2$ heterostructure diode technologically promising
for next-generation optoelectronic applications.
