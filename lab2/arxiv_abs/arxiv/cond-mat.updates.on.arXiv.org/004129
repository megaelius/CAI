It has been observed that the direction in which a sand dune extends its crest line depends on seasonal
variation of wind direction; when the variation is small, the crest line develops more or less perpendicularly
to the mean wind direction to form a transverse dune with some undulation. In the case of bimodal wind
with a large relative angle, however, the dune extends its crest along the mean wind direction and
evolves into an almost straight longitudinal dune. Motivated by these observations, we investigate
the dynamical stability of isolated dunes using the crest line model, where the dune dynamics is
represented by its crest line motion. First, we extend the previous linear stability analysis under
the unidirectional wind to the case with non-zero slant angle between the wind direction and the
normal direction of the crest line, and show that the stability diagram does not depend on the slant
angle. Secondly, we examine how the linear stability is affected by the seasonal changes of wind
direction in the case of bimodal wind with equal strength and duration. For the transverse dune,
we find that the stability is virtually the same with that for the unidirectional wind as long as the
dune evolution during a season is small. On the other hand, in the case of the longitudinal dune, the
dispersions of the growth rates for the perturbation are drastically different from those of the
unidirectional wind, and we find that the largest growth rate is always located at $k = 0$. This is
because the growth of the perturbation with $k \ne 0$ is canceled by the alternating wind from opposite
sides of the crest line even though it grows during each duration period of the bimodal wind.
