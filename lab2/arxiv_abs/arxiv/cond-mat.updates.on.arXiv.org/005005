Free energies as a function of a selected set of collective variables are commonly computed in molecular
simulation and of significant value in understanding and engineering molecular behavior. These
free energy surfaces are most commonly estimated using variants of histogramming techniques,
but such approaches obscure two important facets of these functions. First, the empirical observations
along the collective variable are defined by an ensemble of discrete observations and the coarsening
of these observations into a histogram bins incurs unnecessary loss of information. Second, the
free energy surface is itself almost always a continuous function, and its representation by a histogram
introduces inherent approximations due to the discretization. In this study, we relate the observed
discrete observations from biased simulations to the inferred underlying continuous probability
distribution over the collective variables and derive histogram-free techniques for estimating
this free energy surface. We reformulate free energy surface estimation as minimization of a Kullback-Leibler
divergence between a continuous trial function and the discrete empirical distribution and show
that this is equivalent to likelihood maximization of a trial function given a set of sampled data.
We then present a fully Bayesian treatment of this formalism, which enables the incorporation of
powerful Bayesian tools such as the inclusion of regularizing priors, uncertainty quantification,
and model selection techniques. We demonstrate this new formalism in the analysis of umbrella sampling
simulations for the $\chi$ torsion of a valine sidechain in the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme with benzene
bound in the cavity.
