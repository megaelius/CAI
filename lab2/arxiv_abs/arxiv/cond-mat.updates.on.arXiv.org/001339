Many animal groups are heterogeneous and may even consist of individuals of different species,
called mixed-species flocks. Mathematical and computational models of collective animal movement
behaviour, however, typically assume that groups and populations consist of identical individuals.
In this paper, we develop and analyse a model of merge and split group dynamics, also called fission-fusion
dynamics, for heterogeneous populations that contain two types (or species) of individuals. We
assume that more heterogeneous groups experience higher split rates than homogeneous groups,
forming two daughter groups whose compositions are drawn uniformly from all possible partitions.
We derive a master equation for group size and compositions, and find mean-field steady-state solutions.
We predict that there is a critical group size below which groups are more likely to be homogeneous
and contain the abundant type/species. Groups larger than the critical size are representative
of the global heterogeneity, despite the propensity of heterogeneous groups to split at higher
rates. Thus, our model makes a testable prediction that composition of flocks are group-size dependent
and do not merely reflect population level heterogeneity. Furthermore, our results have implications
for many studies in community ecology that infer interspecies interactions from mixed-species
flock compositions. Such studies typically assume that deviation of flock composition from population
level heterogeneity reflects an underlying interaction. Our study highlights that the merge-split
dynamics of flocks must be accounted for when making inferences on interspecific interactions.
Broadly, our study presents a model that offers novel insights and testable predictions for empirical
studies on ecology and collective behaviour of heterogeneous flocking systems.
