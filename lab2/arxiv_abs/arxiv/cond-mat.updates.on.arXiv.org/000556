The Anderson impurity model with a density of states $\rho(\varepsilon) \propto |\varepsilon|^r$
containing a power-law pseudogap centered on the Fermi energy ($\varepsilon = 0$) features for
$0<r<1$ a Kondo-destruction quantum critical point (QCP) separating Kondo-screened and
local-moment phases. The observation of mixed valency in quantum critical $\beta$-YbAlB$_4$
has prompted study of this model away from particle-hole symmetry. The critical spin response associated
with all Kondo destruction QCPs has been shown to be accompanied, for $r=0.6$ and noninteger occupation
of the impurity site, by a divergence of the local charge susceptibility on both sides of the QCP.
In this work, we use the numerical renormalization-group method to characterize the Kondo-destruction
charge response using five critical exponents, which are found to assume nontrivial values only
for $0.55\lesssim r < 1$. For $0 < r \lesssim 0.55$, by contrast, the local charge susceptibility
shows no divergence at the QCP, but rather exhibits nonanalytic corrections to a regular leading
behavior. Both the charge critical exponents and the previously obtained spin critical exponents
satisfy a set of scaling relations derived from an ansatz for the free energy near the QCP. These critical
exponents can all be expressed in terms of just two underlying exponents: the correlation-length
exponent $\nu(r)$ and the gap exponent $\Delta(r)$. The ansatz predicts a divergent local charge
susceptibility for $\nu<2$, which coincides closely with the observed range $0.55\lesssim
r<1$. Many of these results are argued to generalize to interacting QCPs that have been found
in other quantum impurity models.
