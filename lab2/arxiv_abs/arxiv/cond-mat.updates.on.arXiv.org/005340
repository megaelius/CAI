The hyperuniformity concept provides a unified means to classify all perfect crystals, perfect
quasicrystals, and exotic amorphous states of matter according to their capacity to suppress large-scale
density fluctuations. While the classification of hyperuniform point configurations has received
considerable attention, much less is known about the classification of hyperuniform heterogeneous
two-phase media, which include composites, porous media, foams, cellular solids, colloidal suspensions
and polymer blends. The purpose of this article is to begin such a program for certain two-dimensional
models of hyperuniform two-phase media by ascertaining their local volume-fraction variances
$\sigma^2_{_V}(R)$ and the associated hyperuniformity order metrics $\overline{B}_V$. This
is a highly challenging task because the geometries and topologies of the phases are generally much
richer and more complex than point-configuration arrangements and one must ascertain a broadly
applicable length scale to make key quantities dimensionless. Therefore, we focus on a certain
class of two-dimensional periodic cellular networks, periodic and disordered/irregular packings,
some of which maximize their effective transport and elastic properties. Among the cellular networks
considered, the honeycomb networks have a minimal value of $\overline{B}_V$ across all volume
fractions. On the other hand, among all packings considered, the triangular-lattice packings
have the smallest values of $\overline{B}_V$ for the possible range of volume fractions. Among
all structures studied here, the triangular-lattice packing has the minimal order metric for almost
all volume fractions. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the establishment of hyperuniformity
order metrics for general two-phase media and a basis to discover new hyperuniform two-phase systems
by inverse design procedures.
