The theoretical description of the critical temperature Tc of a Fermi superfluid dates back to the
work by Gor'kov and Melik-Barkhudarov (GMB), who addressed it for a weakly-coupled (dilute) superfluid
in the BCS (weak-coupling) limit of the BCS-BEC crossover. The point made by GMB was that particle-particle
(pairing) excitations, which are responsible for superfluidity to occur below Tc, and particle-hole
excitations, which give rise to screening also in a normal system, get effectively disentangled
from each other in the BCS limit, thus yielding a reduction by a factor 2.2 of the value of Tc obtained
when neglecting screening effects. Subsequent work on this topic, aimed at extending the original
GMB argument away from the BCS limit with diagrammatic methods, has kept this disentangling between
pairing and screening throughout the BCS-BEC crossover, without realising that the conditions
for it to be valid are soon violated away from the BCS limit. Here, we reconsider this problem from
a more general perspective and argue that pairing and screening are intrinsically entangled with
each other along the whole BCS-BEC crossover but for the BCS limit considered by GMB. We perform a
detailed numerical calculation of the GMB diagrammatic contribution extended to the whole BCS-BEC
crossover, where the full wave-vector and frequency dependence occurring in the repeated in-medium
two-particle scattering is duly taken into account. Our numerical calculations are tested against
analytic results available in both the BCS and BEC limits, and the contribution of the GMB diagrammatic
term to the scattering length of composite bosons in the BEC limit is highlighted. We calculate Tc
throughout the BCS-BEC crossover and find that it agrees quite well with Quantum Monte Carlo calculations
and experimental data available in the unitarity regime.
