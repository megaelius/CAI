We show how low-energy electronic models derived from the first-principles electronic structure
calculations can help to rationalize the magnetic properties of two lacunar spinel compounds GaM4S8
with light (M=V) and heavy (M=Mo) transition-metal elements, which are responsible for different
spin-orbit interaction strength. In the model, each magnetic lattice point was associated with
the M4S4 molecule, and the model itself was formulated in the basis of molecular Wannier functions
constructed for three magnetic t2 bands. The effects of rhombohedral distortion, spin-orbit interaction,
band filling, and the screening of Coulomb interactions in the t2 bands are discussed in details.
The electronic model is further treated in the superexchange approximation, which allows us to
derive an effective spin model for the energy and electric polarization ($P$) depending on the relative
orientation of spins in the bonds, and study the properties of this model by means of classical Monte
Carlo simulations with the emphasis on the possible formation of the skyrmionic phase. While isotropic
exchange interactions clearly dominate in GaV4S8, all types of interactions -- isotropic, antisymmetric,
and symmetric anisotropic -- are comparable in the case of GaMo4S8. Particularly, large uniaxial
exchange anisotropy has a profound effect on the properties of GaMo4S8. On the one hand, it raises
the Curie temperature by opening a gap in the spectrum of magnon excitations. On the other hand, it
strongly affects the skyrmionic phase by playing the role of a molecular field, which facilitates
the formation of skyrmions, but makes them relatively insensitive to the external magnetic field
in the large part of the phase diagram. We predict reversal of the magnetic dependence of $P$ in the
case of GaMo4S8 caused by the reversal of direction of the rhombohedral distortion.
