The optimization of nonlinear optical processes at the nanoscale is a crucial step for the development
of nanoscale photon sources for quantum-optical networks. The development of innovative plasmonic
nanoantenna designs and hybrid nanostructures to enhance optical nonlinearities in very small
volumes represents one of the most promising routes. In such systems, the upconversion of photons
can be achieved with high efficiencies via third-order processes, such as third harmonic generation
(THG), thanks to the resonantly-enhanced volume currents. Conversely, second-order processes,
such as second harmonic generation (SHG), are often inhibited by the symmetry of metal lattices
and of common nanoantenna geometries. SHG and THG processes in plasmonic nanostructures are generally
treated independently, since they both represent a small perturbation in the light-matter interaction
mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that this paradigm does not hold in general, by providing
evidence of a cascaded process in THG, which is fueled by SHG and sizably contributes to the overall
yield. We address this mechanism by unveiling an anomalous fingerprint in the polarization state
of the nonlinear emission from non-centrosymmetric gold nanoantennas and point out that such cascaded
processes may also appear for structures that exhibit only moderate SHG yields - signifying its
general relevance in plasmon-enhanced nonlinear optics. The presence of this peculiar mechanism
in THG from plasmonic nanoantennas at telecommunication wavelengths allows gaining further insight
on the physics of plasmon-enhanced nonlinear optical processes. This could be crucial in the realization
of nanoscale elements for photon conversion and manipulation operating at room-temperature.
