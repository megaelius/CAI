Recently many results namely the Fluctuation theorems (FT), have been discovered for systems arbitrarily
away from equilibrium. Many of these relations have been experimentally tested. The system under
consideration is usually driven out of equilibrium by an external time-dependent parameter which
follows a particular {\it protocol}. One needs to perform several iterations of the same experiment
in order to find statistically relevant results. Since the systems are microscopic, fluctuations
dominate. Studying the convergence of relevant thermodynamics quantities with number of realizations
is also important as it gives a rough estimate of number of iterations one needs to perform. In each
iteration the protocol follows a predetermined {\it identical/fixed} form. However, the protocol
itself may be prone to fluctuations. In this work we are interested in looking at a simple non-equilibrium
system namely a Brownian particle trapped in a harmonic potential. The center of the trap is then
dragged according to a protocol. We however lift the condition of fixed protocol. In our case the
protocol in each realization is different. We consider one of the parameters of the protocol as a
random variable, chosen from some known distribution. We study the systems analytically as well
as numerically. We specifically study the convergence of the average work and free energy difference
with number of realizations. Interestingly, in several cases, randomness in the protocol does
not seem to affect the convergence when compared to fixed protocol results. We study symmetry functions.
A Brownian particle in a double well potential is also studied numerically. We believe that our results
can be experimentally verified.
