crystal is used as a generic model of solid to study the elastic properties of thin films as a function
of thickness and temperature. The Monte Carlo algorithm is used to calculate the average deformations
along the axes in the isostress-isothermal ensemble that mimics a real uniaxial loading experiment.
The four independent parameters (tetragonal symmetry without shear) have been calculated for
film thicknesses ranging from 4 to 12 atomic layers, and for five reduced temperatures between 0
and 0.5 sigma/kB, where sigma is the energetic parameter of the Lennard Jones potential and kB is
Boltzmann's constant. These parameters (Poisson's ratio and moduli) give the compliance matrix,
which is inverted to get the stiffness coefficients. It is shown that the three Poisson's ratios
exhibit a good linearity with the inverse of the film thickness, while this is not the case for the
moduli and the compliance coefficients. Remarkably, the stiffness coefficients do exhibit a good
linearity with the inverse of the film thickness, including the limiting value of infinite thickness
(bulk solid) obtained by applying periodic boundary conditions in all directions. This linearity
suggests to interpret the results in terms of a bulk+surface decomposition. However, the surface
stiffness matrix deduced from the slopes has nonzero components along the out-of-plane direction,
an unexpected observation in the framework of the surface stress theory.
