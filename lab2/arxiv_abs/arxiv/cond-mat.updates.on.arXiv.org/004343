Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), with rotational misalignment close to 1.1$^\circ$,
features isolated flat electronic bands that host a rich phase diagram of correlated insulating,
superconducting, ferromagnetic, and topological phases. The origins of the correlated insulators
and superconductivity, and the interplay between them, are particularly elusive. Both states
have been previously observed only for angles within $\pm0.1^\circ$ from the magic-angle value
and occur in adjacent or overlapping electron density ranges; nevertheless, it is still unclear
how the two states are related. Beyond the twist angle and strain, the dependence of the TBG phase
diagram on the alignment and thickness of insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) used to encapsulate
the graphene sheets indicates the importance of the microscopic dielectric environment. Here
we show that adding an insulating tungsten-diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer between hBN and TBG
stabilizes superconductivity at twist angles much smaller than the established magic-angle value.
For the smallest angle of $\theta$ = 0.79$^\circ$, we still observe clear superconducting signatures,
despite the complete absence of the correlated insulating states and vanishing gaps between the
dispersive and flat bands. These observations demonstrate that, even though electron correlations
may be important, superconductivity in TBG can exist even when TBG exhibits metallic behaviour
across the whole range of electron density. Finite-magnetic-field measurements further reveal
breaking of the four-fold spin-valley symmetry in the system, consistent with large spin-orbit
coupling induced in TBG via proximity to WSe$_2$. Our results highlight the importance of symmetry
breaking effects in stabilizing electronic states in TBG and open new avenues for engineering quantum
phases in moir\'e systems.
