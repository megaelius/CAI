The crystallographic, magnetic and thermal properties of BiMn2PO6 and BiZn2PO6 were investigated
by x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility \chi, heat capacity Cp, and 31P NMR measurements
as well as by density-functional band-theory calculations. Both compounds show a strong monotonic
lattice softening on cooling, where the Debye temperature decreases by a factor of two from \Theta_D=650K
at T=300K to \Theta_D=300K at T=2K. The \chi(T) data for BiMn2PO6 above 150K follow a Curie-Weiss
law with a Curie constant consistent with a S=5/2 with g=2 and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Weiss temperature
\theta_CW= -78K. The \chi data indicate long-range AFM ordering below TN=30K, confirmed by a sharp
lambda-type peak in Cp(T) at 28.8K. The band-theory calculations indicate that BiMn2PO6 is an AFM
compound with dominant interactions J1/kB= 6.7K and J3/kB= 5.6K along the legs and rungs of a two-leg
spin-ladder, respectively. In addition to the long-range AFM ordering at TN=30K, a second transition
at 10 K is observed from the \chi and NMR measurements but is not evident in the Cp data. The Cp data at
low T suggest a significant contribution from AFM spin waves moving in three dimensions and the absence
of a spin-wave gap. A detailed analysis of the NMR spectra indicates commensurate magnetic order
between 10K and 30K and a possible incommensurate modulation and/or spin canting below 10K. The
commensurate order is consistent with microscopic simulations that yield a collinear Neel-type
AFM spin arrangement both within and between the ladders, despite the presence of multiple weak
interactions frustrating this magnetic structure. Frustration for AFM ordering and 1D spatial
anisotropy of the 3D spin interactions are manifested in the frustration ratio f=|{\theta}CW|/TN=2.6,
indicating a suppression of TN from 68K in the absence of these effects to 30K in BiMn2PO6.
