The Haldane model on the honeycomb lattice is a paradigmatic example of a Hamiltonian featuring
topologically distinct phases of matter. It describes a mechanism through which a quantum Hall
effect can appear as an intrinsic property of a band-structure, rather than being caused by an external
magnetic field. Although an implementation in a material was considered unlikely, it has provided
the conceptual basis for theoretical and experimental research exploring topological insulators
and superconductors. Here we report on the experimental realisation of the Haldane model and the
characterisation of its topological band-structure, using ultracold fermionic atoms in a periodically
modulated optical honeycomb lattice. The model is based on breaking time-reversal symmetry as
well as inversion symmetry. The former is achieved through the introduction of complex next-nearest-neighbour
tunnelling terms, which we induce through circular modulation of the lattice position. For the
latter, we create an energy offset between neighbouring sites. Breaking either of these symmetries
opens a gap in the band-structure, which is probed using momentum-resolved interband transitions.
We explore the resulting Berry-curvatures of the lowest band by applying a constant force to the
atoms and find orthogonal drifts analogous to a Hall current. The competition between both broken
symmetries gives rise to a transition between topologically distinct regimes. By identifying
the vanishing gap at a single Dirac point, we map out this transition line experimentally and quantitatively
compare it to calculations using Floquet theory without free parameters. We verify that our approach,
which allows for dynamically tuning topological properties, is suitable even for interacting
fermionic systems. Furthermore, we propose a direct extension to realise spin-dependent topological
Hamiltonians.
