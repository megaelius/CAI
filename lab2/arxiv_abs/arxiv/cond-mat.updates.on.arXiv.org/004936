Understanding defect production and evolution under irradiation is a long-standing multi-scale
problem. Conventionally, experimental examination of irradiation-induced defects (IIDs) has
mainly relied on transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which offers high spatial resolution
but requires destructive sample preparation. Furthermore, limited field of view and low strain
sensitivity make multi-scale characterisation and quantitative strain measurements difficult.
Here we explore the potential of using advanced techniques in the scanning electron microscope
(SEM) to non-destructively probe irradiation damage at the surface of bulk materials. Electron
channelling contrast imaging (ECCI) is used to image nano-scale irradiation-induced defects
in 20 MeV self-ion irradiated tungsten, the main candidate material for fusion reactor armour.
The results show an evolution of the damage microstructure from uniformly and randomly distributed
nano-scale defects at 0.01 dpa (displacement per atom) to string structures extending over hundreds
of nanometres at 1 dpa. Cross-correlation based high-resolution EBSD (HR-EBSD) is used to probe
the lattice strain fields associated with IIDs. While there is little strain fluctuation at 0.01
dpa, significant heterogeneity in the lattice strains is observed at 0.1 dpa, increasing with dose
until saturation at 0.32 dpa. The characteristic length scale of strain fluctuations is ~500 nm.
Together, ECCI and HR-EBSD reveal a transition from a structure where defects are disordered to
a structure with long-range order driven by elastic interactions between pre-existing defects
and new cascade damage. This study demonstrates that SEM provides an attractive tool for rapid throughput,
non-destructive, multi-scale and multi-aspect characterisation of irradiation damage.
