In many studies, atoms deal with positive or negative charges by losing or gaining the electrons.
Atoms in gas or solid states execute electron dynamics when in a suitable state. In atoms of gaseous
and solid states, electrons deal with infinitesimal displacements by remaining clamped in their
energy knots, too. Such behaviors of the atoms indicate that they cannot ionize. Inert gas atoms
split into electron streams under the fields of propagating photons. As a result, continuing photons
of forcing energy leave distorting inter-state electron gaps of splitting atoms. They enter to
the air medium or solution medium where their characteristics become obvious while dissipating
heat energy. So, a glow of light known in plasma is visible. On splitting inert gas atoms, their electrons
also carry forcing energy of chasing photons. When carrying forced energy electrons impinge on
underneath elongated atoms at fixed angle, they further elongate them. When carrying forced energy
electrons do not impinge at fixed angle, instead of elongating the atoms further, impinging electrons
deform them by making the non-unidirectional stretching of energy knots clamped electrons. Such
kinds of atomic behaviors also indicate that atoms do not ionize. The splitting of inert gas atoms
into electrons, carrying of photons by electrons and appearing of light glow in travelling photons
validate that electric current is in fact a photonic current. A microscopic analysis of specimen
is due to resolving power of photons. A photonic current is due to photonic propagation through the
inter-state electron gap termed as photonic band gap. Some important principles are discussed
here inferring a photonic current. So, the study brings vast changes in the existing state of science
and technology.
