Based on ab initio band structure calculations we formulate a general theoretical method for description
of the temperature dependence of electric field gradient in solids. The method employs a procedure
of averaging multipole electron density component (l \neq 0) inside a sphere vibrating with the
nucleus at its center. As a result of averaging each Fourier component (K \neq 0) on the sphere is effectively
reduced by the square root of the Debye-Waller factor [exp(-W)]. The electric field gradient related
to a sum of K-components most frequently decreases with temperature (T), but under certain conditions
because of the interplay between terms of opposite signs it can also increase with T. The method is
applied to calculations of the temperature evolution of the electric field gradients of pristine
zinc and cadmium crystallized in the hexagonal lattice. For calculations within our model of crucial
importance is the temperature dependence of mean-square displacements which can be taken from
experiment or obtained from the phonon modes in the harmonic approximation. For the case of Zn we
have used data obtained from single crystal x-ray diffraction. In addition, for Zn and Cd we have
calculated mean-square displacements with the density functional perturbation treatment of
the Quantum Espresso package. With the experimental data for displacements in Zn our calculations
reproduce the temperature dependence of the electric field gradient very accurately. Within the
harmonic approximation of the Quantum Espresso package the decrease of electric field gradients
in Zn and Cd with temperature is overestimated. Our calculations indicate that the anharmonic effects
are of considerable importance in the temperature dependence of electric field gradients.
