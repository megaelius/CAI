We perform detailed computational and experimental measurements of the active dynamics of a dense,
uniform suspension of sedimented microrollers driven by a magnetic field rotating around an axis
parallel to the floor. We develop a lubrication-corrected Brownian Dynamics method for dense suspensions
of driven colloids sedimented above a bottom wall. The numerical method adds lubrication friction
between nearby pairs of particles, as well as particles and the bottom wall, to a minimally-resolved
model of the far-field hydrodynamic interactions. Our experiments combine fluorescent labeling
with particle tracking to trace the trajectories of individual particles in a dense suspension,
and to measure their propulsion velocities. Previous computational studies [B. Sprinkle et al.,
J. Chem. Phys., 147, 244103, 2017] predicted that at sufficiently high densities a uniform suspension
of microrollers separates into two layers, a slow monolayer right above the wall, and a fast layer
on top of the bottom layer. Here we verify this prediction, showing good quantitative agreement
between the bimodal distribution of particle velocities predicted by the lubrication-corrected
Brownian Dynamics and those measured in the experiments. The computational method accurately
predicts the rate at which particles are observed to switch between the slow and fast layers in the
experiments. We also use our numerical method to demonstrate the important role that pairwise lubrication
plays in motility-induced phase separation in dense monolayers of colloidal microrollers, as
recently suggested for suspensions of Quincke rollers [D. Geyer et al., Physical Review X, 9(3),
031043, 2019].
