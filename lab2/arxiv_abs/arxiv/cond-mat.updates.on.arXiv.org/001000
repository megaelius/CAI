Energy efficiency has become a key metric for digital computing, which conventionally relies on
irreversible logic gates. Reversible logic gates can provide an efficient alternative, as they
can avoid (irreversibly) dissipating potential energy to switch a bit state. However, previously
realized reversible logic uses adiabatic control, with the constraint that dissipation is at best
only proportional to the gate speed and thus substantial energy savings come at the cost of speed.
Conventional superconducting logic gates, efficient relative to CMOS, use the presence and absence
of flux quanta for bit states with different potential energy. The presented logic uses fluxons
for bit states and preserves the number of fluxons for conservation of potential energy in the bit
states. To change bit states, gate structures are made to elastically and conditionally change
fluxon polarity -- fluxons in Long Josephson Junctions (LJJ) freely propagate into the gate, encountering
a scattering interface, and scatter to another LJJ as a fluxon or antifluxon. Since the number of
topological particles is conserved and merely the polarities may change, all of the potential energy
is preserved, which comprises 80\% of the total fluxon energy. Additionally the dynamics can be
very close to ideal nondissipative processes where over 97\% of the energy is conserved in the presented
first set of gates. The gates have a operation time of only a few natural oscillation periods, showing
a fast efficient result that is beyond the standard adiabatic model and existing reversible logic.
The parameter margins for operation allow it to be manufactured. A test platform is proposed which
launches fluxons, executes a gate, and stores the output states as currents for readout. To better
understand the fluxon phenomena we use a collective coordinate ansatz which reduces the many-junction
system ...
