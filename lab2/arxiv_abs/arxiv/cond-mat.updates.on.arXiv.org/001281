By means of digital image correlation, we experimentally characterize the deformation of a dry
granular medium confined inside a Hele-Shaw cell due to air injection at a constant overpressure
high enough to deform it (from 50 to 250 kPa). Air injection at these overpressures leads to the formation
of so called pneumatic fractures, i.e. channels empty of beads, and we discuss the typical deformations
of the medium surrounding these structures. In addition we simulate the diffusion of the fluid overpressure
into the medium, comparing it with the Laplacian solution over time, and relating pressure gradients
with corresponding granular displacements. In the compacting medium we show that the diffusing
pressure field becomes similar to the Laplace solution on the order of a characteristic time given
by properties of the pore fluid, granular medium and the system size. However, before the diffusing
pressure approaches the Laplace solution on system scale, we find that it resembles the Laplacian
field near the channels, with the highest pressure gradients on the most advanced channel tips and
a screened pressure gradient behind them. We show that the granular displacements more or less always
move in the direction against the local pressure gradients, and when comparing granular velocities
with pressure gradients in the zone ahead of channels, we observe a Bingham type of rheology for the
granular paste (the mix of air and beads), with an effective viscosity $\mu\_B$ and displacement
thresholds $\nabla P\_c$ evolving during mobilization and compaction of the medium. Such a rheology,
with disorder in the displacement thresholds, could be responsible for placing the pattern growth
at moderate injection pressures in a universality class like the Dielectric Breakdown Model with
$\eta=2$, where fractal dimensions are found between 1.5 and 1.6 for the patterns.
