Micromagnetic simulations have been performed to investigate the suppression of the skyrmion
Hall effect in nanotracks with their magnetic properties strategically modified. In particular
we study two categories of nanotracks modified magnetically. One of them, repulsive edges have
been inserted in the nanotrack and, in the other, an attractive strip has been placed exactly on the
longest axis of the nanotrack. Attractive and repulsive interactions can be generate by the magnetic
properties engineering. For instance, it is known that the skyrmion is attracted by a region in which
the exchange stiffness constant is decreased. On the other hand, the skyrmion is repelled by a region
characterized by a local increase in the exchange stiffness constant. In order to provide a background
for experimental studies, we vary not only the magnetic material parameters (exchange stiffness,
perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya constant) but also
the width of the region magnetically modified, containing either a local reduction or a local increase
for each one of these magnetic properties. In the numerical simulations, the skyrmion motion was
induced by a spin-polarized current and the found results indicate that it is possible to transport
skyrmions around the longest axis of the nanotrack. In practice, the skyrmion Hall effect can be
completely suppressed in nanotracks with their magnetic properties strategically modified.
Furthermore, we discuss in detain 6 ways to suppress the skyrmion Hall effect by the usage of nanotracks
with repulsive edges and nanotracks with an attractive strip.
