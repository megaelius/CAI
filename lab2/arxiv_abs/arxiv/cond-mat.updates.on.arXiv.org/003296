Recently, half-quantum vortices -- the analogs of the cosmic Alice strings -- have been observed
in the polar phase of superfluid 3He in aerogel. Here we exploit these vortices to study the Kibble-Zurek
(KZ) mechanism of defect formation in the non-equilibrium second order phase transitions in the
presence of symmetry breaking bias. The symmetry breaking bias suppresses the formation of the
topological defects and makes the transition adiabatic, which is important both for thermodynamic
phase transitions and for the quantum phase transitions. In the polar phase the role of the symmetry
breaking bias is played either by the spin-orbit interaction, or by external magnetic field, and
we used both these factors to measure the suppression of creation of half-quantum vortices. We experimentally
measured the minimal bias required to suppress the formation of the KZ mechanism. The measured minimal
bias is in agreement with the theoretical expectation: the KZ mechanism is suppressed when the characteristic
length scale of the bias field becomes smaller than the characteristic KZ length which depends on
the quench time. The physical reason for the suppression of the KZ mechanism is that under the bias
the half quantum vortex becomes part of the composite topological object -- topological soliton
terminated by strings. The complicated symmetry breaking and the hierarchy of different energy
scales in the p-wave spin-triplet superfluid 3He allows us to consider different types of suppression
scenarios, where the creation of different topological defects, such as half-quantum vortices
and the conventional phase vortices, is suppressed by the different bias fields.
