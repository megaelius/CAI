It has been suggested that the nearest-neighbour (NN) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg (HAF) model
on the Kagome lattice may be a good starting point to understand the quantum spin-liquid (QSL) behaviour
discovered in Herbertsmithite. We investigate possible QSL phases in the presence of experimentally
relevant spin-rotation symmetry-breaking perturbations such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and
Ising interactions, as well as second-neighbour antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions.
We use the projective symmetry group analysis within the slave-fermion framework of QSL phases
and systematically classify possible QSLs in the presence of these perturbations. The dynamical
spin-structure factor for relevant QSLs is computed and their effects are studied. Our calculations
reveal dispersive features in the spin structure factor embedded in a generally diffuse background
due to the existence of fractionalized S=1/2 excitations called spinons. For two of the previously
proposed $Z_2$ states, the dispersive features are almost absent, and diffuse scattering dominates
over a large energy window throughout the Brillouin zone. This resembles the structure factor observed
in recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments on singlet crystals of Herbertsmithite. Furthermore,
one of the $Z_2$ states with the spin structure factor with mostly diffuse scattering is gapped,
and it may be adiabatically connected to the gapped QSL state observed in recent DMRG calculations
for the NN HAF. The above perturbations are found to enhance the diffuse nature of the spin structure
factor and reduce the momentum dependencies of the spin gap. We also calculate the electron spin
resonance absorption spectra that further characterize the role of spin-rotation symmetry breaking
perturbations, and can shed more light into the nature of the ground state in Herbertsmithite.
