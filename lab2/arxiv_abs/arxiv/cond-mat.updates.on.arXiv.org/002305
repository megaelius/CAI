It is demonstrated by explicit construction that three-dimensional bosonic crystalline symmetry
protected topological (cSPT) phases are classified by $H_{\phi}^{5}(G;\mathbb{Z})\oplus H_{\phi}^{1}(G;\mathbb{Z})$
for all 230 space groups $G$, where $H^n_\phi(G;\mathbb{Z})$ denotes the $n$th twisted group cohomology
of $G$ with $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients, and $\phi$ indicates that $g\in G$ acts non-trivially on
coefficients by sending them to their inverses if $g$ reverses spacetime orientation and acts trivially
otherwise. The previously known summand $H_{\phi}^{5}(G;\mathbb{Z})$ corresponds only to crystalline
phases built without the $E_8$ state or its multiples on 2-cells of space. It is the crystalline analogue
of the "group cohomology proposal" for classifying bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT)
phases, which takes the form $H_{\phi}^{d+2}(G;\mathbb{Z})\cong H_{\phi}^{d+1}(G;U(1))$
for finite internal symmetry groups in $d$ spatial dimensions. The new summand $H_{\phi}^{1}(G;\mathbb{Z})$
classifies possible configurations of $E_8$ states on 2-cells that can be used to build crystalline
phases beyond the group cohomology proposal. The completeness of our classification and the physical
meaning of $H_{\phi}^{1}(G;\mathbb{Z})$ are established through a combination of dimensional
reduction, surface topological order, and explicit cellular construction. The value of $H_{\phi}^{1}(G;\mathbb{Z})$
can be easily read off from the international symbol for $G$. Our classification agrees with the
prediction of the "generalized cohomology hypothesis," which concerns the general structure
of the classification of SPT phases, and therefore provides strong evidence for the validity of
the said hypothesis in the realm of crystalline symmetries.
