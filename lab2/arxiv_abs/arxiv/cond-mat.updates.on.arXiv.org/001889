The free standing solid polymer nanocomposite films has been prepared through standard solution
cast technique. The improvement in structural, microstructural and electrochemical properties
has been observed on the dispersion of nanofiller in polymer salt complex. X Ray diffraction studies
clearly reflect the formation of complex formation as no corresponding salt peak appeared in the
diffractograms. The FTIR analysis suggested a clear and convincing evidence of polymer ion, ion
ion and polymer ion nanofiller interaction. The highest ionic conductivity of the prepared solid
polymer electrolyte films is 5x10-5 S cm-1 for 7 wt. TiO2. The Linear Sweep Voltammetry provide the
electrochemical stability window of the prepared solid polymer electrolyte films, which is of
the order of 3.5 V. The ion transference number has been estimated, tion is 0.99 through dc polarization
technique. Dielectric spectroscopic studies were performed to understand the ion transport process
in polymer electrolytes. All solid polymer electrolyte possesses good thermal stability up to
300C. DSC analysis confirms the decrease of melting temperature and signal of glass transition
temperature with addition of nanofiller which indicates the decrease of crystallinity of polymer
matrix. An absolute correlation between diffusion coefficient, ion mobility, number density,
double layer capacitance, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, free ion area and
conductivity has been observed. A convincing model to study the role of nanofiller in polymer salt
complex has been proposed which supports the experimental findings. The prepared polymer electrolyte
system with significant ionic conductivity, high ionic transference number, good thermal, voltage
stability could be suggested as a potential candidate as electrolyte cum separator for fabrication
of rechargeable lithium-ion battery system.
