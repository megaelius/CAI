Solid solution is an important way to enhance the structural and functional performances of materials.
In this work, we develop a new structural modeling approach to solid-solution materials. Firstly,
the description of atomic environment (AE) of an atom on sublattice in solid solution is introduced
based on the concepts of atom cluster and lattice cluster. The average atomic environment of elements
in the same sublattice for a certain supercell configuration could be calculated and the similarity
to the desired fully disordered or short-range ordered (SRO) structure could be quantitatively
evaluated. Based on the assumption that the structure model should have similar atomic environment
(SAE) of the desired structure, the SAE approach is proposed by transferring the structural modeling
for solid solution to an optimization problem in the configuration space. A new type of SRO parameter
based on AE is introduced and the SRO could be naturally included in the SAE objective function, which
could offer finer description of SRO in solid solution. Secondly, we pay efforts to enhance the practicality
and functionality of this approach, including appropriate weight functions for atom clusters,
implementation techniques in Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling, and support for all 230 space groups.
Furthermore, the newly introduced SRO parameters are treated as constraints of the optimization
problem to construct solid solution. Taking the typical quinary CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy,
continuous solid-solution binary TaW alloy and ternary CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy with SRO as
prototypes, we apply our method in combination with ab initio calculations to investigate the structural
properties and compare the calculated results with experiments.
