Electric dipole radiation can be controlled by coherent optical feedback, as has previously been
studied by modulating the photonic environment for point dipoles placed both in optical cavities
and near metal mirrors. In experiments involving fluorescent molecules, trapped ions and quantum
dots the point nature of the dipole, its sub-unity quantum efficiency, and decoherence rate conspire
to severely limit any change in total linewidth. Here we show that the transverse coherence of exciton
emission in the monolayer two-dimensional (2D) material MoSe${}_2$ removes many of the fundamental
physical limitations present in previous experiments. The coherent interaction between excitons
and a photonic mode localized between the MoSe${}_2$ and a nearby planar mirror depends interferometrically
on mirror position, enabling full control over the radiative coupling rate from near-zero to 1.8
meV and a corresponding change in exciton total linewidth from 0.9 to 2.3 meV. The highly radiatively
broadened exciton resonance (a ratio of up to $3:1$ in our samples) necessary to observe this modulation
is made possible by recent advances in 2D materials sample fabrication. Our method of mirror translation
is free of any coupling to strain or DC electric field in the monolayer, which allows a fundamental
study of this photonic effect. The weak coherent driving field in our experiments yields a mean excitation
occupation number of ${\sim} 10^{-3}$ such that our experiments correspond to probing radiative
reaction in the regime of perturbative quantum electrodynamics. This system will serve as a testbed
for exploring new excitonic physics and quantum nonlinear optical effects.
