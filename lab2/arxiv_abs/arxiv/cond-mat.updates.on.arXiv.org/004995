We analyse the morphological, structural and luminescence properties of self-assembled ZnO nanowires
grown by chemical vapour transport on Si(001). The examination of nanowire ensembles by scanning
electron microscopy reveals that a non-negligible fraction of nanowires merge together forming
coalesced aggregates during growth. We show that the coalescence degree can be unambiguously quantified
by a statistical analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the nanowires. The examination of the
structural properties by X-ray diffraction evidences that the nanowires crystallize in the wurtzite
phase, elongate along the c-axis, and are randomly oriented in plane. The luminescence of the ZnO
nanowires, investigated by photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies, is characterized
by two bands, the nearband-edge emission and the characteristic defect-related green luminescence
of ZnO. The cross-correlation of scanning electron micrographs and monochromatic cathodoluminescence
intensity maps reveals that: (i) coalescence joints act as a source of non-radiative recombination,
and (ii) the luminescence of ZnO nanowires is inhomogeneously distributed at the single nanowire
level. Specifically, the near-band-edge emission arises from the nanowire cores, while the defect-related
green luminescence originates from the volume close to the nanowire sidewalls. Two-dimensional
simulations of the optical guided modes supported by ZnO nanowires allow us to exclude waveguiding
effects as the underlying reason for the luminescence inhomogeneities. We thus attribute this
observation to the formation of a core-shell structure in which the shell is characterized by a high
concentration of green-emitting radiative point defects with respect to the core.
