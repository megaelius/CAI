Ab initio low-energy effective Hamiltonians of two typical high-temperature copper-oxide superconductors,
whose mother compounds are La2CuO4 and HgBa2CuO4, are derived by utilizing the multi-scale ab initio
scheme for correlated electrons (MACE). The effective Hamiltonians obtained in the present study
serve as platforms of future studies to accurately solve the low-energy effective Hamiltonians
beyond the density functional theory and makes it possible to further study the superconducting
mechanism on the first principles and quantitative basis without adjustable parameters not only
for the available cuprates but also for future design of higher Tc in general. More concretely, we
derive effective Hamiltonians for three variations, 1)one-band Hamiltonian for the antibonding
orbital generated from strongly hybridized Cu 3d_x2-y2 and O 2p_sigma orbitals 2)two-band Hamiltonian
constructed from the antibonding orbital and Cu 3d_3z2-r2 orbital hybridized mainly with the apex
oxygen p_z orbital 3)three-band Hamiltonian consisting mainly of Cu 3d_x2-y2 orbitals and two
O 2p_sigma orbitals. Differences between the Hamiltonians for La2CuO4 and HgBa2CuO4, which have
relatively low and high critical temperatures, respectively, at optimally doped compounds, are
elucidated. The main differences are summarized as i) the oxygen 2p_sigma orbitals are farther(~3.7eV)
below from the Cu d_x2-y2 orbital for the La compound than the Hg compound(~2.4eV) in the three-band
Hamiltonian. This causes a substantial difference in the character of the d_x2-y2-2p_sigma antibonding
band at the Fermi level and makes the effective onsite Coulomb interaction U larger for the La compound
than the Hg compound for the two- and one-band Hamiltonians. ii)The ratio of the second-neighbor
to the nearest transfer t'/t is also substantially different (~0.26) for the Hg and ~0.15 for the
La compound in the one-band Hamiltonian.
