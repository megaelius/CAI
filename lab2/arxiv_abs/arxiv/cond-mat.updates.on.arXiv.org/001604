The phenomenon of phase separation into antiferromagnetic (AFM) and superconducting (SC) or normal-state
regions has great implication for the origin of high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity.
However, the occurrence of an intrinsic antiferromagnetism above the Tc of (Li, Fe)OHFeSe superconductor
is questioned. Here we report a systematic study on a series of (Li, Fe)OHFeSe single crystal samples
with Tc up to ~41 K. We observe an evident drop in the static magnetization at Tafm ~125 K, in some of
the SC (Tc < ~38 K, cell parameter c < ~9.27 {\AA}) and non-SC samples. We verify that this AFM signal
is intrinsic to (Li, Fe)OHFeSe. Thus, our observations indicate mesoscopic-to-macroscopic coexistence
of an AFM state with the normal (below Tafm) or SC (below Tc) state in (Li, Fe)OHFeSe. We explain such
coexistence by electronic phase separation, similar to that in high-Tc cuprates and iron arsenides.
However, such an AFM signal can be absent in some other samples of (Li, Fe)OHFeSe, particularly it
is never observed in the SC samples of Tc > ~38 K, owing to a spatial scale of the phase separation too
small for the macroscopic magnetic probe. For this case, we propose a microscopic electronic phase
separation. It is suggested that the microscopic static phase separation reaches vanishing point
in high-Tc (Li, Fe)OHFeSe, by the occurrence of two-dimensional AFM spin fluctuations below nearly
the same temperature as Tafm reported previously for a (Li, Fe)OHFeSe (Tc ~42 K) single crystal.
A complete phase diagram is thus established. Our study provides key information of the underlying
physics for high-Tc superconductivity.
