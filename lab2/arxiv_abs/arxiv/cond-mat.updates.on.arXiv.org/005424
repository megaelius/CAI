The electrical resistance of the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) which forms at the interface
of SrTiO3 (STO)-based heterostructures displays anisotropic transport with respect to the direction
of current flow at low temperature. We have investigated the influence of terraces at the surface
of STO substrates from which the 2DES are prepared. Such terraces are always present in commercially
available STO substrates due to the tolerance of surface preparation which result in small miscut
angles of the order of gamma ~ 0.1{\deg} with respect to the surface normal. By a controlled increase
of the substrate miscut we could systematically reduce the width of the terraces and thereby increase
the density of substrate surface steps. The in-plane anisotropy of the electrical resistance was
studied as a function of the miscut angle gamma and found to be mainly related to interfacial scattering
arising from the substrate surface steps. However, the influence of gamma was notably reduced by
the occurrence of step-bunching and lattice-dislocations in the STO substrate material. Magnetoresistance
(MR) depends on the current orientation as well, reflecting the anisotropy of carrier mobility.
For gamma >= 2{\deg}, MR is substantially enhanced and shows the trend towards a linear field dependence
which is typical for inhomogeneous conductors. From weak-antilocalization observed at small
magnetic field we deduce information on inelastic scattering and spin-orbit coupling. While the
field scale associated with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling in 2D weak-localization does not
show a pronounced correlation with gamma, distinct changes of the scale are associated with inelastic
scattering.
