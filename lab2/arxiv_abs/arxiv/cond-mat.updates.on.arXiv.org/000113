We show how statistical thermodynamics can be formulated in situations in which thermodynamics
applies, while equilibrium statistical mechanics does not. A typical case is, in the words of Landau
and Lifshitz, that of partial (or incomplete) equilibrium. One has a system of interest in equilibrium
with the environment, and measures one of its quantities, for example its specific heat, by raising
the temperature of the environment. However, within the observation time the global system settles
down to a state of apparent equilibrium, so that the measured value of the specific heat is different
from the equilibrium one. In such cases formulae for quantities such as the effective specific heat
exist, which are provided by Fluctuation Dissipation theory. However, what is lacking is a proof
that internal energy exists, i.e., that the fundamental differential form delta Q-delta W (difference
between the heat absorbed by the system and the work performed by it) is closed. Here we show how the
coefficients of the fundamental form can be expressed in such a way that the closure property of the
form becomes manifest, so that the first principle is proven. We then show that the second principle
too follows, and indeed as a consequence of microscopic time--reversibility. The treatment is
given in a classical Hamiltonian setting. One has a global time--independent Hamiltonian system
constituted by the system of interest and two auxiliary ones controlling temperature and pressure,
and the occurring of a process due to a change in the thermodynamic parameters is implemented by a
suitable choice of the measure for the initial data.
