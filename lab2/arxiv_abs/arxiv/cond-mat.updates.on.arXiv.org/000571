We use $G\times SO(\infty)$ and $O(\infty)$ non-linear $\sigma$-models (NL$\sigma$Ms) to systematically
construct the so called L-type symmetry-protected-trivial (SPT) phases, as well as the L-type
topologically-ordered phases that have no topological excitations [which will be referred as
invertible topologically-ordered (iTO) phases described by $iTO_L^d$], for bosonic systems.
We find that those L-type iTO phases are not described by oriented cobordism groups $\Omega^{SO}_d$,
but by their subgroups. For example, those L-type topologically-ordered phases in 2+1D are classified
by $Z$, generated by the $(E_8)^3$ bosonic quantum Hall state with chiral central charge $c=24$.
We also studied bosonic SPT states. Let $LSPT_G^d$ be the Abelian group formed by the L-type $G$ SPT
phases in $d$-dimensional space-time produced by the NL$\sigma$Ms. We find that the L-type time-reversal
$Z_2^T$ SPT phases are given by $LSPT_{Z_2^T}^1 = LSPT_{Z_2^T}^3 = LSPT_{Z_2^T}^5 =0$, $LSPT_{Z_2^T}^2=
Z_2$, $LSPT_{Z_2^T}^4= 2Z_2$, etc. They are not given by unoriented cobordism groups $\Omega^{O}_d$
(for example $LSPT_{Z_2^T}^5\neq \Omega^O_5$). In general, we find that all our constructed SPT
orders are classified by group cohomology $LSPT_G^d=\oplus_{k=1}^{d-1} H^k(G,iTO_L^{d-k})\oplus
H^d(G,R/Z)$ where $G$ may contain time-reversal. Here $H^d(G,R/Z)$ is the group cohomology class
with coefficient $R/Z$, which describes the so called pure SPT phases with pure gauge anomalous
boundary. On the other hand, the group cohomology class $\oplus_{k=1}^{d-1} H^k(G,iTO_L^{d-k})$
describes the so called mixed SPT phases with mixed gauge-gravity anomalous boundary. (Those mixed
SPT phases were also referred as beyond-group-cohomology, but now we see that they are within another
group cohomology classification.)
