Magneto-optical spectroscopy based on the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) is
a sensitive method for investigation of magnetically-ordered media. However, in magnetic materials
the optical transitions are usually characterized by spectrally broad resonances with widths
considerably exceeding the Zeeman splitting in the magnetic field. Here we investigate experimentally
and theoretically the TMOKE in the vicinity of relatively narrow optical resonances provided by
confined quantum systems. For experimental demonstration we use the exciton resonance in a (Cd,Mn)Te
diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum well, where the strong exchange interaction with magnetic
ions enables the giant Zeeman splitting of exciton spin states $\Delta$ in magnetic fields of a few
Tesla. In the weak coupling regime, when the splitting $\Delta$ is smaller than the spectral broadening
of the optical transitions $\Gamma$, the TMOKE magnitude grows linearly with the increase of the
Zeeman splitting and its spectrum has an S-shape, which remains virtually unchanged in this range.
In the strong coupling regime ($\Delta>\Gamma$) the TMOKE magnitude saturates, while its spectrum
is strongly modified resulting in the appearance of two separate peaks. The TMOKE is sensitive not
only to the sample surface but can be used to probe the confined electronic states in depth if the upper
layer is sufficiently transparent. Our results demonstrate that TMOKE of spectrally narrow resonances
serves as a versatile tool for probing the charge and spin structure of electronic states in various
confined quantum systems and can be used for spin tomography in combination with the conventional
polar Kerr effect.
