We consider a system of 2D fermions on a triangular lattice with well separated electron and hole
pockets of similar sizes, centered at certain high-symmetry-points in the Brillouin zone. We first
analyze Stoner-type spin-density-wave (SDW) magnetism. We show that SDW order is degenerate at
the mean-field level. Beyond mean-field, the degeneracy is lifted and is either $120^{\circ}$
"triangular" order (same as for localized spins), or a collinear order with antiferromagnetic
spin arrangement on two-thirds of sites, and non-magnetic on the rest of sites. We also study a time-reversal
symmetric directional spin bond order, which emerges when some interactions are repulsive and
some are attractive. We show that this order is also degenerate at a mean-field level, but beyond
mean-field the degeneracy is again lifted. We next consider the evolution of a magnetic order in
a magnetic field starting from an SDW state in zero field. We show that a field gives rise to a canting
of an SDW spin configuration. In addition, it necessarily triggers the directional bond order,
which, we argue, is linearly coupled to the SDW order in a finite field. We derive the corresponding
term in the Free energy. Finally, we consider the interplay between an SDW order and superconductivity
and charge order. For this, we analyze the flow of the couplings within parquet renormalization
group (pRG) scheme. We show that magnetism wins if all interactions are repulsive and there is little
energy space for pRG to develop. However, if system parameters are such that pRG runs over a wide range
of energies, the system may develop either superconductivity or an unconventional charge order,
which breaks time-reversal symmetry.
