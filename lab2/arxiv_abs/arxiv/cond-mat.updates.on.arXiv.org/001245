In the first two papers of this series, we characterized the structure of maximally random jammed
(MRJ) sphere packings across length scales by computing a variety of different correlation functions,
spectral functions, hole probabilities, and local density fluctuations. From the remarkable
structural features of the MRJ packings, especially its disordered hyperuniformity, exceptional
physical properties can be expected. Here, we employ these structural descriptors to estimate
effective transport and electromagnetic properties via rigorous bounds, exact expansions, and
accurate analytical approximation formulas. These property formulas include interfacial bounds
as well as universal scaling laws for the mean survival time and the fluid permeability. We also estimate
the principal relaxation time associated with Brownian motion among perfectly absorbing traps.
For the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the long-wavelength limit, we show that a dispersion
of dielectric MRJ spheres within a matrix of another dielectric material forms, to a very good approximation,
a dissipationless disordered and isotropic two-phase medium for any phase dielectric contrast
ratio. We compare the effective properties of the MRJ sphere packings to those of overlapping spheres,
equilibrium hard-sphere packings, and lattices of hard spheres. Moreover, we generalize results
to micro- and macroscopically anisotropic packings of spheroids with tensorial effective properties.
The analytic bounds predict the qualitative trend in the physical properties associated with these
structures, which provides guidance to more time-consuming simulations and experiments. They
especially provide impetus for experiments to design materials with unique bulk properties resulting
from hyperuniformity, including structural-color and color-sensing applications.
