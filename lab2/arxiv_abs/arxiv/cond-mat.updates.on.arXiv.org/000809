Molecular self-assembly is a well-known technique to create highly functional nanostructures
on surfaces. Self-assembly on two-dimensional materials is a developing field and has already
resulted in the discovery of several rich and interesting phenomena. Here, we review this progress
with an emphasis on the electronic properties of the adsorbates and the substrate in well-defined
systems, as unveiled by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We cover three aspects of the self-assembly.
The first one focuses on non-covalent self-assembly dealing with site-selectivity due to inherent
moire pattern present on 2D materials deposited on substrates. Modification of intermolecular
interactions and molecule-substrate interactions influences the assembly drastically and 2D
materials can also be used as a platform to carry out covalent and metal-coordinated assembly. The
second part deals with the electronic properties of molecules adsorbed on 2D materials. By virtue
of being inert and possessing low density of states near the Fermi level, 2D materials decouple molecules
electronically from the underlying metal substrate and allow high-resolution spectroscopy and
imaging of molecular orbitals. The moire pattern on the 2D materials causes site-selective gating
and charging of molecules in some cases. The last section covers the effects of self-assembled organic
molecules on the electronic properties of graphene as revealed by spectroscopy and electrical
transport measurements. Non-covalent functionalization of 2D materials has already been applied
for their application as catalysts and sensors. With the current surge of activity on building van
der Waals heterostructures from 2D materials, molecular self-assembly has the potential to add
an extra level of flexibility and functionality for applications ranging from flexible electronics
and OLEDs to novel electronic devices and spintronics.
