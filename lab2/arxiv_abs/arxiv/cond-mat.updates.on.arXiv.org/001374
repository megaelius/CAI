In the synthesis of all sorts of materials, it is ambiguous to understand the structural evolution.
Structural evolution of solid atoms under different conditions depends mainly on their electron-dynamics.
Electron-dynamics of targeted atoms are purely under the forces of poles instead of frictional
force or other means where they invite energy as per gauge under the maintenance of neutrality for
binding amalgamated atoms as per necessitating attained dynamics. Solid atoms of many elements
along with transformed states are restricted to evolve structure in one-dimension, two-dimension
and three-dimension while in surface format, space format and grounded format depending on the
continuity of regularity in attained dynamics and electron-dynamics. Configured energy of certain
shape under the execution of electron-dynamics of targeted atom connects to energy knot clamping
electron state of amalgamated atom which is because of the same nature resulting into their binding
at point of connect. Atoms of obeying conditions evolve structures of all dimensions and formats
where configured energy of targeted atom bind to energy knot clamping electron state of amalgamated
atom laterally above in the case of space format and laterally below in the case of grounded format
while adjacently in the case of surface format. In short-range or long-range order structure, a
mixed order dimension is resulted. Nature of the medium or substrate along with introduced conditions
influence evolution of structure both in terms of attaining dynamics of atoms and execution of electron-dynamics.
This fundamental revolution in the approach that how structural evolution of certain solid atoms
executed may shed new light in existing state of materials science.
