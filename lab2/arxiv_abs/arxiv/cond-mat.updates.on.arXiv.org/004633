Magnetic Tunnel Junctions whose basic element consists of two ferromagnetic electrodes separated
by an insulating non-magnetic barrier have become intensely studied and used in non-volatile spintronic
devices. Since ballistic tunnel of spin-polarized electrons sensitively depends on the chemical
composition and the atomic geometry of the lead/barrier interfaces their proper design is a key
issue for achieving the required functionality of the devices such as e.g. a high tunnel magneto
resistance. An important leap in the development of novel spintronic devices is to replace the insulating
barrier by a ferroelectric which adds new additional functionality induced by the polarization
direction in the barrier giving rise to the tunnel electro resistance (TER). The multiferroic tunnel
junction Co/PbZr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$O$_{3}$/La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (Co/PZT/LSMO)
represents an archetype system for which - despite intense studies - no consensus exists for the
interface geometry and their effect on transport properties. Here we provide the first analysis
of the Co/PZT interface at the atomic scale using complementary techniques, namely x-ray diffraction
and extended x-ray absorption fine structure in combination with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
and ab-initio calculations. The Co/PZT interface consists of one perovskite-type cobalt oxide
unit cell [CoO$_{2}$/CoO/Ti(Zr)O$_{2}$] on which a locally ordered cobalt film grows. Magnetic
moments (m) of cobalt lie in the range between m=2.3 and m=2.7$\mu_{B}$, while for the interfacial
titanium atoms they are small (m=+0.005 $\mu_{B}$) and parallel to cobalt which is attributed to
the presence of the cobalt-oxide interface layers. These insights into the atomistic relation
between interface and magnetic properties is expected to pave the way for future high TER devices.
