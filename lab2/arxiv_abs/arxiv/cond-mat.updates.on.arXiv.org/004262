Exploring new parameter regimes to realize and control novel phases of matter has been a main theme
in modern condensed matter physics research. The recent discovery of 2D magnetism in nearly freestanding
monolayer atomic crystals has already led to observations of a number of novel magnetic phenomena
absent in bulk counterparts. Such intricate interplays between magnetism and crystalline structures
provide ample opportunities for exploring quantum phase transitions in this new 2D parameter regime.
Here, using magnetic field and temperature dependent circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy
of phonons and magnons, we map out the phase diagram of CrI3 that has been known to be a layered AFM in
its 2D films and a FM in its 3D bulk. We, however, reveal a novel mixed state of layered AFM and FM in 3D
CrI3 bulk crystals where the layered AFM survives in the surface layers and the FM appears in deeper
bulk layers. We then show that the surface layered AFM transits into the FM at a critical magnetic
field of 2 T, similar to what was found in the few layer case. Interestingly, concurrent with this
magnetic phase transition, we discover a first-order structural phase transition that alters
the crystallographic point group from C3i to C2h and thus, from a symmetry perspective, this monoclinic
structural phase belongs to the 3D nematic order universality class. Our result not only unveils
the complex single magnon behavior in 3D CrI3, but also settles down the puzzle of how CrI3 transits
from a bulk FM to a thin layered AFM semiconductor, despite recent efforts in understanding the origin
of layered AFM in CrI3 thin layer, and reveals the intimate relationship between the layered AFM-to-FM
and the crystalline rhombohedral-to-monoclinic phase transitions. These findings further open
up opportunities for future 2D magnet-based magneto-mechanical devices.
