The phenomenon whereby atoms deal the positive or negative charge by losing or gaining the electron
forms the basis of familiar processes. In the elements where the atoms comprise unfilled states
of electrons can be thought of as eligible to execute electron-dynamics for certain force-energy
indicating that they can never be ionized. At required level of ground surface, solid atoms of transition
state belonging to suitable elements elongate as per exerting force in the surface format. In the
case of inert gas atoms, an alternative process takes place. Atoms of inert gases, when flowing in
suitable density, split into electron streams under the certain density of photons having wavelength
in current, which is through propagation in their inter-state electron gaps. As a result, photons
leaving the inter-state gaps enter to open medium by increasing the wavelengths to a visible range,
thus, they give the light-glow. Those electrons carrying force-energy on splitting of inert gas
atoms when impinge to elongated atoms of solid, they elongated them further. When electrons of carrying
force-energy do not impinge at a fixed suitable-orientation instead of elongation further of those
atoms, they deform them where clamped energy knots to electrons stretch non-orientationally.
On splitting of inert gas atoms into electrons and where these electrons traveled under carried
force-energy of releasing photons indicate that silicon solar cells and other similar kind of gadgets
generate a photonic current. All sorts of microscopes visualizing the morphology and structure
are under the resolving power of worked featured photons regulated by a certain analysis technique.
Selected area electron diffraction of structure is originally a selected area photon reflection.
These fundamental revolutions bring vast changes in the existing state of science.
