Present work provides extensive DFT study of TlReO4 using pseudopotential approach for understanding
the structural and vibrational properties and full-potential linearized augmented plane wave
method for electronic band structure and associated optical properties. Calculated bulk modulus
value 29.77 GPa using LDA functional is found to be close to experimental value 26 GPa. The order of
elastic constant along the principal axis clearly indicates the crucial role of Re and O3 atoms in
the structural and mechanical properties of this material. Analysis of Born effective charge (BEC)
along with gamma point phonon frequencies through density functional perturbation approach (DFPT)
have also shown the importance of these atoms. The anisotropic nature of BEC is mainly found to be
contributed due to O3 atoms. An asymmetric stretching of Re-O3 bond is found to be mainly responsible
for high intense IR peak in the high-frequency range whereas the second most intense peak is due to
the symmetric stretching of these bonds along with the asymmetric stretching of the Re-O2 bond.
To get exact electronic band structure, spin orbit coupling (SOC) in addition to Tran-Blaha Modified
Becke-Johnson (TB-mBJ) potential have been considered. Inclusion of SOC clearly shows a decreased
band gap of 4.71 eV from TB-mBJ implemented band gap 4.82 eV which mainly attributed to 0.08 eV splitting
of Re d-states. Study of density of states (DOS) reveals that conduction band bottom (CBB) is mainly
made up of Re d-states but main contribution to valence band top (VBT) is due to oxygen p-states. The
bonding nature of this material has also been addressed using DOS which is further verified through
the electron charge density plot. Though the optical properties of this material are found to be
anisotropic but optical isotropy can be seen in lower energy value.
