Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite devices have generated significant interest for LED,
photodetector, and solar cell applications due to their attractive optoelectronic properties
and substrate-choice flexibility1-4. These devices exhibit slow time-scale response, which
have been explained by point defect migration5-6. In this work, we report the discovery of a room
temperature intrinsic amplification process in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3)
that can be triggered by few photons, down to a single photon. The electrical properties of the material,
by way of photoresponse, are modified by an input energy as small as 0.19 attojoules, the energy of
a single photon. These observations cannot be explained by photo-excited electronic band-to-band
transitions or prevailing model of photo-excited point defect migration since none of the above
can explain the observed macroscopic property change by absorption of single or few photons. The
results suggest the existence of an avalanche-like collective motion of iodides and their accumulation
near the anode, which we will call ionic impact ionization (I3 mechanism). The proposed I3 process
is the ionic analog of the electronic impact ionization, and has been considered impossible before
because conventionally it takes far more energy to move ions out of their equilibrium position than
electrons. We have performed first principle calculations to show that in MAPbI3 the activation
energy for the I3 mechanism is appreciably lower than the literature value of the activation energy
for the electronic impact ionization. The discovery of I3 process in perovskite material opens
up possibilities for new classes of devices for photonic and electronic applications.
