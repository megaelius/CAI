This paper considers the stress-induced phase transitions of shape memory alloy slender cylinder,
and analytically studies the phase transition process and the associated instability. A three-dimensional
(3D) phenomenological model with an internal variable is adopted, which is simplified to a 1D system
of two strains in three regions (austenite, martensite and phase transition regions). Suitable
boundary conditions and interface conditions are proposed. Theoretically, it is a free boundary
problem, as the position and shape of phase interfaces are unknown. We then focus on planar interfaces
(which are energetically favored), and a symmetric case when phase transition occurs in the middle.
For given applied stress, two-region solutions, three-region solutions and the connecting solutions
between them are obtained analytically or semi-analytically, including many period-k solutions.
Two-region solutions show that phase transition does not take place at one point, but simultaneously
in a small region. The width of phase transition region is found analytically, revealing the roles
of the material and geometrical parameters. Three-region solutions represent localized inhomogeneous
deformations in experiments, and capture that the stress stays almost at the Maxwell stress during
propagation of transformation front. For displacement-controlled process, the transition process
is demonstrated by the stress-strain curve, which captures the stress drop/rise and the transition
from homogeneous deformations to period-1 localized inhomogeneous deformations. When the radius
is smaller than a critical value (given by material constants), the stress drop is very sharp due
to transition of solutions in a snap-back bifurcation. These features show good agreement with
experimental observations and shed light on the difficulties of numerical simulations.
