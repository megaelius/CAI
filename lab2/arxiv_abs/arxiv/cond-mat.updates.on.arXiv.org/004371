The phenomenon whereby atoms deal with the positive or negative charge by losing or gaining the electron
forms the basis of familiar processes. The elements in which the atoms comprise unfilled states
can be eligible for electron dynamics indicating that they cannot ionize. At suitable level of ground
surface, atoms of solid and gas both deal with transitional behaviors as per exerting force to their
electrons under the transitional energy. Transitional behaviors of such atoms are based on infinitesimal
displacements of electrons. So, electrons remain clamped within their energy knots. In inert gas
atoms, a different mechanism is involved. Under the excessive population of photons, atoms of inert
gas split distorting into the electron streams. As a result, progressing photons of forcing energy
leave distorting inter-state electron gaps of splitting atoms entering the air medium. Hence,
characteristics of photons under lowered forcing energy become obvious to reveal the glow of light
known as plasma. On splitting inert gas atoms, their electrons carry forcing energy of chasing photons.
When forced energy electrons impinge on underneath elongated atoms of solid at suitable inclination,
they elongate them further. When carrying forced energy electrons do not impinge at suitable inclination,
instead of elongating those atoms further, impinging electrons deform them by enabling non-orientationally
based stretching of energy knots. The splitting of inert gas atoms into electrons, carrying of photons
by electrons to impinge and the phenomenon of light glow by photons indicate that photonic current
rather than electric current is a source of power. As per set feature, a microscopic analysis is due
to the resolving power of working photons. A photonic current is due to photonic propagation, where
a consistent...
