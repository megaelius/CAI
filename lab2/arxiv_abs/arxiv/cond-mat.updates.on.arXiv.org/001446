Continuous Time Random Walk models (CTRW) of anomalous diffusion are studied, where the anomalous
exponent $\beta(x) \in (0,1)$ varies in space. This type of situation occurs e.g. in biophysics,
where the density of the intracellular matrix varies throughout a cell. Scaling limits of CTRWs
are known to have probability distributions which solve fractional Fokker-Planck type equations
(FFPE). This correspondence between stochastic processes and FFPE solutions has many useful extensions
e.g. to nonlinear particle interactions and reactions, but has not yet been sufficiently developed
for FFPEs of the"variable order" type with non-constant $\beta(x)$. In this article, variable
order FFPEs (VOFFPE) are derived from scaling limits of CTRWs. The key mathematical tool is the 1-1
correspondence of a CTRW scaling limit to a bivariate Langevin process, which tracks the cumulative
sum of jumps in one component and the cumulative sum of waiting times in the other. The spatially varying
anomalous exponent is modelled by spatially varying $\beta(x)$-stable L\'evy noise in the waiting
time component. The VOFFPE displays a spatially heterogeneous temporal scaling behaviour, with
generalized diffusivity and drift coefficients whose units are length$^2$/time$^{\beta(x)}$
resp. length/time$^{\beta(x)}$. A global change of the time scale results in a spatially varying
change in diffusivity and drift. A consequence of the mathematical derivation of a VOFFPE from CTRW
limits in this article is that a solution of a VOFFPE can be approximated via Monte Carlo simulations.
Based on such simulations, we are able to confirm that the VOFFPE is consistent under a change of the
global time scale.
