Contact unit size reduction is a widely studied mechanism as a means to improve adhesion in natural
fibrillar systems, such as those observed in beetles or geckos. However, these animals also display
complex structural features in the way the contact is subdivided in a hierarchical manner. Here,
we study the influence of hierarchical fibrillar architectures on the load distribution over the
contact elements of the adhesive system, and the corresponding delamination behaviour. We present
an analytical model to derive the load distribution in a fibrillar system, including hierarchical
splitting of contacts, i.e. a "hierarchical shear-lag" model that generalizes the well-known
shear-lag model used in mechanics. The influence on the detachment process is investigated introducing
a numerical procedure that allows the derivation of the maximum delamination force as a function
of the considered geometry, including statistical variability of local adhesive energy. Our study
suggests that contact splitting generates improved adhesion only in the ideal case of infinitely
compliant contacts. In real cases, to produce efficient adhesive performance, contact splitting
needs to be coupled with hierarchical architectures to counterbalance high load concentrations
resulting from contact unit size reduction, generating multiple delamination fronts and helping
to avoid detrimental non-uniform load distributions. We show that these results can be summarized
in a generalized adhesion scaling scheme for hierarchical structures, proving the beneficial
effect of multiple hierarchical levels. The model can thus be used to predict the adhesive performance
of hierarchical adhesive structures, as well as the mechanical behaviour of composite materials
with hierarchical reinforcements.
