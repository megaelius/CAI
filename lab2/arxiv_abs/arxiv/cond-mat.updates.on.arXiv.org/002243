Using the strong coupling diagram technique, magnetic and spectral properties of the two-dimensional
repulsive Hubbard model are investigated in the ranges of repulsions $t\leq U\leq 10t$, temperatures
$0.1t\lesssim T\lesssim 4t$ and electron concentrations $0.6\lesssim\bar{n}\leq 1$ with $t$
the hopping constant. The approach takes into account interactions of electrons with spin and charge
fluctuations of all ranges and fulfils the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Temperature and concentration
dependencies of the uniform magnetic susceptibility, the variation of the double occupancy with
the repulsion and the temperature dependence of the square of the site spin are in satisfactory agreement
with Monte Carlo results. Three types of the temperature variation of the electron energy spectrum
can be distinguished at half-filling. For $U\lesssim 3t$, at low temperatures, there are two nonintersecting
bands, which approach each other on the boundary of the magnetic Brillouin zone. With increasing
$T$ these bands merge into one band crossing the Fermi level. For $4t\lesssim U \lesssim 6t$, the
low-temperature picture described above is supplemented with a low-intensity spin-polaron band
located near the Fermi level. As its counterpart in the strong-correlation case, the band is formed
by bound states of electrons and spin excitations. However, in contrast to the former case, the band
exists even at half-filling and occupies the entire Brillouin zone. As for lower $U$, with increasing
temperature, all bands coalesce into a single band. For $U\gtrsim 7t$ and low temperatures the spectrum
has a pronounced four-band structure, which with increasing $T$ transforms into two Hubbard subbands.
