Magnetic skyrmions are topological quasiparticles with great potential for applications in future
information storage and processing devices because of their nanoscale size, high stability, and
large velocity. Recently, the high-frequency properties of skyrmions have been explored for magnon
nanodevices. Here we systematically study the dynamics of an isolated skyrmion under voltage excitation
through the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect in a circular thin film. A theoretical
model considering the demagnetization energy, which has often been neglected or treated superficially
in previous skyrmion research but is demonstrated to have importance in determining the skyrmion
dynamic state, is developed. With our model, the periodic oscillation of the skyrmion radius can
be solved numerically with similar precision compared to micromgnetic simulations, and the characteristic
frequency of the skyrmion breathing can be determined analytically with greater precision than
previous studies. Furthermore, we find that the breathing skyrmion can be analogized as a modulator
by investigating its linear modulation functionality under sinusoidal-form voltage excitation.
Different from the conventional modulation system with complex CMOS circuits, this skyrmion modulator
device integrates with both the modulation and carrier wave generation functionality, thus showing
greater convenience and efficiency in applications. Our findings can provide useful guidance
for both theoretical and experimental skyrmions research as well as the development of skyrmion-based
magnonic devices with significant potential applicability in future communication system.
