The dry release transfer of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, h-BN, and TMDs is a
versatile method for fabricating high-quality van der Waals heterostructures. Up until now, polydimethylpolysiloxane
(PDMS) sheets have been widely used for the dry release transfer of TMD materials. However, this
method has been known to have limitations that make it difficult to transfer few-layer-thick graphene
and h-BN because of the difficulty to fabricate these materials on PDMS. As an alternative method,
we demonstrate the dry release transfer of single- and bi-layer graphene and few-layer h-BN in this
study by utilizing poly(propylene) carbonate (PPC) films. Because of the strong adhesion between
PPC and 2D materials around room temperature, we demonstrate that single- to few-layer graphene,
as well as few-layer h-BN, can be fabricated on a spin-coated PPC film/290-nm-thick SiO2/Si substrate
via the mechanical exfoliation method. In addition, we show that these few-layer crystals are clearly
distinguishable using an optical microscope with the help of optical interference. Because of
the thermoplastic properties of PPC film, the adhesion force between the 2D materials and PPC significantly
decreases at about 70 {\deg}C. Therefore, we demonstrate that single- to few-layer graphene, as
well as few-layer h-BN flakes, on PPC can be easily dry-transferred onto another h-BN substrate.
This method enables a multilayer van der Waals heterostructure to be constructed with a minimum
amount of polymer contamination. We demonstrate the fabrication of encapsulated h-BN/graphene/h-BN
devices and graphene/few-layer h-BN/graphene vertical-tunnel-junction devices using this
method. Since devices fabricated by this method do not require an edge-contact scheme, our finding
provide a simples method for constructing high-quality graphene and h-BN-based van der Waals heterostructures.
