Dense packing of hydrophobic residues in the cores of globular proteins determines their stability.
Recently, we have shown that protein cores possess packing fraction $\phi \approx 0.56$, which
is the same as dense, random packing of amino acid-shaped particles. In this article, we compare
the structural properties of protein cores and jammed packings of amino acid-shaped particles
in much greater depth by measuring their local and connected void regions. We find that the distributions
of surface Voronoi cell volumes and local porosities obey similar statistics in both systems. We
also measure the probability that accessible, connected void regions percolate as a function of
the size of a spherical probe particle and show that both systems possess the same critical probe
size. By measuring the critical exponent $\tau$ that characterizes the size distribution of connected
void clusters at the onset of percolation, we show that void percolation in packings of amino acid-shaped
particles and protein cores belong to the same universality class, which is different from that
for void percolation in jammed sphere packings. We propose that the connected void regions of proteins
are a defining feature of proteins and can be used to differentiate experimentally observed proteins
from decoy structures that are generated using computational protein design software. This work
emphasizes that jammed packings of amino acid-shaped particles can serve as structural and mechanical
analogs of protein cores, and could therefore be useful in modeling the response of protein cores
to cavity-expanding and -reducing mutations.
