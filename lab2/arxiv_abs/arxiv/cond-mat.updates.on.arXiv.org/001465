Understanding the emergence of collective organizational phenomena is a major goal in many fields
of physics from condensed matter to cosmology. Using a recently introduced manybody perturbation
formalism for fermions, we propose a mechanism for the emergence of collective behavior, specifically
superfluidity, driven by quantum statistics and the enforcement of the Pauli principle through
the selection of normal modes. The method, which is called symmetry invariant perturbation theory
(SPT), uses group theory and graphical techniques to solve the manybody Schrodinger equation through
first order exactly. The solution at first order defines collective coordinates in terms of five
N-body normal modes, identified as breathing, center of mass, single particle angular excitation,
single particle radial excitation and phonon. A correspondence is established "on paper" that
enforces the Pauli principle through the assignment of specific normal mode quantum numbers. Applied
in the unitary regime, this normal mode assignment yields occupation only in an extremely low frequency
N-body phonon mode at ultralow temperatures. A single particle radial excitation mode at a much
higher frequency creates a gap that stabilizes the superfluidity at low temperatures. Coupled
with the corresponding values for the frequencies at unitarity obtained by this manybody calculation,
we obtain good agreement with experimental thermodynamic results including the lambda transition
in the specific heat. Our results suggest that the emergence of collective behavior in macroscopic
systems is driven by the Pauli principle and its selection of the correct collective coordinates
in the form of N-body normal modes.
