The metal diborides are a class of ceramic materials with crystal structures consisting of hexagonal
sheets of boron atoms alternating with planes of metal atoms held together with mixed character
ionic/covalent bonds. Many of the metal diborides are ultrahigh temperature ceramics like HfB$_2$,
TaB$_2$, and ZrB$_2$, which have melting points above 3000$^\circ$C, high mechanical hardness
and strength at high temperatures, and high chemical resistance, while MgB$_2$ is a superconductor
with a transition temperature of 39 K. Here we demonstrate that this diverse family of non-van der
Waals materials can be processed into stable dispersions of two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets using
ultrasonication-assisted exfoliation. We generate 2D nanosheets of the metal diborides AlB$_2$,
CrB$_2$, HfB$_2$, MgB$_2$, NbB$_2$, TaB$_2$, TiB$_2$, and ZrB$_2$, and use electron and scanning
probe microscopies to characterize their structures, morphologies, and compositions. The exfoliated
layers span up to micrometers in lateral dimension and reach thicknesses down to 2-3 nm, while retaining
their hexagonal atomic structure and chemical composition. We exploit the convenient solution-phase
dispersions of exfoliated CrB$_2$ nanosheets to incorporate them directly into polymer composites.
In contrast to the hard and brittle bulk CrB$_2$, we find that CrB$_2$ nanocomposites remain very
flexible and simultaneously provide increases in the elastic modulus and the ultimate tensile
strength of the polymer. The successful liquid-phase production of 2D metal diborides enables
their processing using scalable low-temperature solution-phase methods, extending their use
to previously unexplored applications, and reveals a new family of non-van der Waals materials
that can be efficiently exfoliated into 2D forms.
