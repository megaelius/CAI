A major goal in neuroscience is to understand how populations of neurons code for stimuli or actions.
While the number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously is increasing at a fast pace, in most
cases these recordings cannot access a complete population. In particular, it is hard to simultaneously
record all the neurons of the same type in a given area. Recent progress have made possible to profile
each recorded neuron in a given area thanks to genetic and physiological tools, and to pool together
recordings from neurons of the same type across different experimental sessions. However, it is
unclear how to infer the activity of a full population of neurons of the same type from these sequential
recordings. Neural networks exhibit collective behaviour, e.g. noise correlations and synchronous
activity, that are not directly captured by a conditionally-independent model that would just
put together the spike trains from sequential recordings. Here we show that we can infer the activity
of a full population of retina ganglion cells from sequential recordings, using a novel method based
on copula distributions and maximum entropy modeling. From just the spiking response of each ganglion
cell to a repeated stimulus, and a few pairwise recordings, we could predict the noise correlations
using copulas, and then the full activity of a large population of ganglion cells of the same type
using maximum entropy modeling. Remarkably, we could generalize to predict the population responses
to different stimuli and even to different experiments. We could therefore use our method to construct
a very large population merging cells' responses from different experiments. We predicted synchronous
activity accurately and showed it grew substantially with the number of neurons. This approach
is a promising way to infer population activity from sequential recordings in sensory areas.
