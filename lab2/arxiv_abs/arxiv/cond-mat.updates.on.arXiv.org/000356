We study the zero-temperature ground-state (GS) phase diagram of a spin-half ($s=\frac{1}{2}$)
$J_{1}$--$J_{2}$ $XY$ model on the honeycomb lattice with nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange coupling
$J_{1}>0$ and frustrating next-nearest-neighbor exchange coupling $J_{2} \equiv \kappa
J_{1}>0$, where both bonds are of the isotropic $XY$ type, using the coupled cluster method.
Results are presented for the GS energy per spin, magnetic order parameter, and staggered dimer
valence-bond crystalline (SDVBC) susceptibility, for values of the frustration parameter in
the range $0 \leq \kappa \leq 1$. In this range we find phases exhibiting, respectively, N\'{e}el
$xy$ planar [N(p)], N\'{e}el $z$-aligned [N($z$)], SDVBC, and collinear N\'{e}el-II $xy$ planar
[N-II(p)] orderings which break the lattice rotational symmetry. The N(p) state, which is stable
for the classical ($s \rightarrow \infty$) version of the model in the range $0 \leq \kappa \leq \frac{1}{6}$,
is found to form the GS phase out to a first quantum critical point at $\kappa_{c_{1}} = 0.216(5)$,
beyond which the stable GS phase has N($z$) order over the range $\kappa_{c_{1}} < \kappa <
\kappa_{c_{2}}=0.355(5)$. For values $\kappa > \kappa_{c_{2}}$ we find a strong competition
to form the GS phase between states with N-II(p) and SDVBC forms of order. Our best estimate, however,
is that the stable GS phase over the range $\kappa_{c_{2}} < \kappa < \kappa_{c_{3}} \approx
0.52(3)$ is the SDVBC state, and for values $\kappa > \kappa_{c_{3}}$ is the N-II(p) state, which
is stable at the classical ($s \rightarrow \infty$) level only at the highly degenerate point $\kappa=\frac{1}{2}$.
Over the range $0 \leq \kappa \leq 1$ we find no evidence for any of the spiral phases that are present
classically ($s \rightarrow \infty$) for all values $\kappa > \frac{1}{6}$, nor for any quantum
spin-liquid state.
