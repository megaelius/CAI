In a recent high-quality experimental work for normal metal-superconducting nanowire junctions
[J.D.S. Bommer \textit{et al}., arXiv:1807.01940 (2018)], strong anisotropic suppression of
induced superconductivity has been observed in tunnel conductance measurements in the presence
of applied magnetic field with variable orientation. Following this new finding, we investigate
theoretically the dependence of tunnel conductance on the direction of the Zeeman field in order
to understand the operational mechanisms and to extract effective system parameters. Second,
motivated by a generic discrepancy between experiment and theory, i.e., many in-gap and above-gap
conductance features predicted by theory are barely observed in experiments, we study several
mechanisms possibly responsible for the suppression of the theoretically predicted conductance
features (e.g., length of the nanowire, self-energy effect due to the proximity effect, finite
temperature, finite dissipation, and multi-band effect). One essential finding in the current
work is that only by a combined understanding of both suppression mechanisms can we extract effective
system parameters from the experimental data (e.g., the effective nanowire-superconductor coupling,
the effective Land\'e $g$-factor, and the chemical potential of the semiconducting nanowire).
In addition, we consider topologically trivial Andreev bound states in hybrid nanowires in the
presence of potential inhomogeneities, such as external quantum dots or potential inhomogeneities
inside the nanowire. We compare the anisotropic, field-dependent features induced by these non-topological
Andreev bound states with the corresponding features produced by topological Majorana zero modes
in pristine nanostructures, so that we can provide guidance to differentiate between the topologically
trivial and non-trivial cases.
