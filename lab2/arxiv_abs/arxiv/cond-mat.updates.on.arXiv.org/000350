Thermodynamics is a theory for ensembles. With the postulate of equal a priori probability Boltzmann
identified entropy as the number of microstates of an equilibrium ensemble. However, a direct application
of Boltzmann's idea to non-equilibrium seems not plausible due to the ill-defined notion of a macrostate,
leaving the problem unsolved for more than a century. Here we avoid the ambiguity of a non-equilibrium
macrostate by regarding a single microstate as an ensemble by considering trajectories to the microstate.
We count the accessible number of paths to the microstate, which allows us to identify three key spatio-temporally
local yet statistical quantities, information, entropy, and free energy, which are experimentally
measurable. These quantities display highly organized behaviour between microstates, which
enables us to extend Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution and Landauer's principle to include arbitrary
fluctuations. Specifically, when heat dissipates, it is encoded as local information so that it
could be retracted when information is consumed to do work, and local free energy encodes work contents
for conversions between microstates. When a work content is relatively high, it collapses spontaneously
through exchanging local information and entropy. The energetic cost is mediated by heat with less
than 100% efficiency resulting in a net loss of information on average. Such details have so far been
thought beyond the scope of thermodynamics and not to be observed from individual realizations
of a fluctuating system. This trajectory-ensemble-based approach would provide a novel framework
to analyse non-equilibrium systems.
