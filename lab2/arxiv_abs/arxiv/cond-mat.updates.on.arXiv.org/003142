We present a $T=0K$ renormalization group (RG) phase diagram for the electronic Hubbard model in
two dimensions on the square lattice at, and away from, half filling. The RG treats quantum fluctuations
in the single particle occupation number nonperturbatively via the unitarily decoupling of one
electronic state at every RG step. The resulting phase diagram thus possess the quantum fluctuation
energy scale ($\omega$) as one of its axes. A relation is derived between $\omega$ and the effective
temperature scale upto which gapless, as well as emergent gapped, phases can be obtained. We find
that the transition in the half-filled Hubbard model involves, for any on-site repulsion, passage
from a marginal Fermi liquid to a topologically-ordered gapped Mott liquid through a pseudogapped
phase bookended by Fermi surface topology-changing Lifshitz transitions. Using effective Hamiltonians
and wavefunctions for the low-energy many-body eigenstates for the doped Mott liquid obtained
from the stable fixed point of the RG flow, we demonstrate the collapse of the pseudogap for charge
excitations (Mottness) at a quantum critical point. d-wave Superconducting order is shown to arise
from this quantum critical state of matter. Benchmarking of the ground state energy per particle
and the double-occupancy fraction against existing numerical results also yields excellent agreement.
We present detailed insight into the $T=0$ origin of several experimentally observed findings
in the cuprates, including Homes law and Planckian dissipation. We also establish that the heirarchy
of temperature scales obtained from our analysis is quantitatively consistent with that observed
experimentally for some members of the cuprates. Our results offer insight on the ubiquitous origin
of superconductivity in doped Mott insulating states.
