The effect of slip transfer on the deformation mechanisms of Al bicrystals was explored using a rate-dependent
dislocation-based crystal plasticity model. Three different types of grain boundaries (GBs)
were included in the model by modifying the rate of dislocation accumulation near the GB in the Kocks-Mecking
law, leading to fully-opaque (dislocation blocking), fully-transparent and partially-transparent
GBs. In the latter, slip transmission is only allowed in pairs of SS in neighbour grains that are suitably
oriented for slip transfer according to the Luster-Morris parameter. Modifications of the GB character
led to important changes in the deformation mechanisms at the GB. In general, bicrystals with fully-opaque
boundaries showed an increase in the dislocation density near the GB, which was associated with
an increase in the Von Mises stress. In contrast, the dislocation pile-ups and the stress concentration
were less pronounced in the case of partially-transparent boundaries as the slip in one grain can
progress into the next grain with some degree of continuity. No stress concentrations were found
at these boundaries for fully-transparent boundaries, and there was continuity of strain across
the boundary, which is not typical of most experimentally observed GBs. Simulations of ideal bicrystals
oriented for favorable slip transfer on the most highly favored slip system in grains with high Schmid
factors for slip transfer depends on the number of active SS in operation in the neighborhood and
that most boundaries will lead to nearly opaque conditions while some boundaries will be transparent.
Finally, the model was applied to a particular experimentally observed GB in which slip transfer
was clearly operating indicating that the model predicted a nearly transparent GB.
