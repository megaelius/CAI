We compare here the performances of two approaches to achieve such transfer: PRESTO (Phase-shifted
Recoupling Effects a Smooth Transfer of Order), which is currently the method of choice to achieve
the magnetization transfer from protons to quadrupolar nuclei and which has been shown to supersede
Cross-Polarization under Magic-Angle Spinning (MAS) for quadrupolar nuclei and D-RINEPT (Dipolar-mediated
Refocused Insensitive Nuclei Enhanced by Polarization Transfer) using symmetry-based SR4${}_1{}^2$
recoupling, which has already been employed to transfer the magnetization in the reverse way from
half-integer quadrupolar spin to protons. We also test the PRESTO sequence with R16${}_7{}^6$
recoupling using 270${}_0$90${}_180$ composite $\pi$-pulses as inversion elements. This recoupling
scheme has not so far been employed to reintroduce dipolar couplings with protons. These various
techniques to transfer the magnetization from protons to quadrupolar nuclei are analyzed using
(i) an average Hamiltonian theory, (ii) numerical simulations of spin dynamics, and (iii) experimental
${}^1$H $\rightarrow {}^{27}$Al and ${}^{1}$H $\rightarrow {}^{17}$O transfers in as-synthesized
AlPO4-14 and ${}^{17}$O-labelled fumed silica, respectively. The experiments and simulations
are done at two magnetic fields (9.4 and 18.8 T) and several spinning speeds (15, 18-24 and 60 kHz).
This analysis indicates that owing to its $\gamma$-encoded character, PRESTO yields the highest
transfer efficiency at low magnetic fields and MAS frequencies, whereas owing to its higher robustness
to rf-field inhomogeneity and chemical shifts, D-RINEPT is more sensitive at high fields and MAS
frequencies, notably for protons exhibiting large offset or CSA, such as those involved in hydrogen
bonds.
