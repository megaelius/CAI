We investigate the many-body dynamics of entanglement entropy (EE) and participation ratio (PR)
considering a one-dimensional non-interacting long-range power-law hopping model with un-correlated
(referred as model I) and correlated (referred as model II) disorder. Model I, supporting algebraically
localized phase and model II, containing multifractal and mobility edge phases, allow us to venture
the finite time growth of EE, saturation characteristics of EE (denoted by $S_\infty$) and PR (denoted
by $PR_{\infty}$) in versatile phases. We predict for algebraically localized phase in model I,
$S_{\infty}$ ($PR_{\infty}$) scales as $L^{\gamma}$ ($L^{\beta}$), with $\gamma, \beta<1$;
this is in contrast to the exponentially localized system where both become system size independent
$\sim L^0$. Interestingly, in the presence of a finite fraction of delocalized single particle
states (SPSs) as observed in model II, $S_{\infty}$ obeys volume law, while $PR_{\infty}$ can be
sub-extensive $L^\beta$, $\beta\le 1$. The above non-equilibrium results can be qualitatively
understood from the analysis of many-body eigenstates that satisfy similar scaling relation.
Our study further suggests that an admixture of two species of SPSs (ergodic delocalized and non-ergodic
multifractal or localized) can lead to a secondary slow growth of EE in finite time regime that is
absent in model I. Moreover, EE accounts for the long distance properties of SPS and duality in the
long-tail decay exponent of it in model I is clearly captured, on the contrary, PR encapsulates the
short distance properties of SPS and hence the long distance duality of SPS states does not appear.
