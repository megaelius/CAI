In syntheses of different materials, it is ambiguous to understand structure evolution of atoms.
Solid atoms of all elements executing confined inter-state electron-dynamics evolve structure
on amalgamating under appreciably attained dynamics. Their different schemes of structure for
each respective format depend on the number of exerting forces to certain electron of executing
dynamics. Such atoms when are in the neutral state transform heat energy into bind energy shape-like
tick, integral or Gaussian distribution symbol depending on the nature of electron-dynamics.
In atoms evolving structure at nearly the same level, they deal force to execute confined inter-state
electron-dynamics nearly in the same format -for atoms of space format evolving structure is just
at above typical-leveled ground surface, for atoms of surface format evolving structure is at typical-leveled
ground surface and for atoms of grounded format evolving structure is at above typical-leveled
ground surface. As per number of electrons executed dynamics together, their atoms evolve structure
of different dimensionality by engaging energy of different shape. A different mechanism is involved
in atoms of three-dimensional structure. Atoms bind at the points of generated energy because of
the same nature. In structure evolution of space format, amalgamated atoms bind to the targeted
atom from the upward-side more in a lateral manner and same is the case of atoms evolving structure
in grounded format, but amalgamated atoms bind to the targeted atom from the downward-side. In structure
evolution of surface format, amalgamated atoms bind to the targeted atom adjacently. A mixed-dimension
structure develops under the frustrated amalgamation of atoms. This fundamental revolution of
how a structure of solid atoms involving conservative forces may shed a new light in the existing
state of materials science.
