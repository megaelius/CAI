Electrical stimulation of neural systems is a key tool for understanding neural dynamics and ultimately
for developing clinical treatments. Many applications of electrical stimulation affect large
populations of neurons. However, computational models of large networks of spiking neurons are
inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We evaluate a reduced mean-field model of excitatory and
inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons which can be used to efficiently
study the effects of electrical stimulation on large neural populations. The rich dynamical properties
of this basic cortical model are described in detail and validated using large network simulations.
Bifurcation diagrams reflecting the network's state reveal asynchronous up and down-states,
bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow
excitation-adaptation feedback loops. The biophysical parameters of the AdEx neuron can be coupled
to an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated up to the population
description. We show how on the edge of bifurcation, direct electrical inputs cause network state
transitions, such as turning on and off oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input
can frequency-entrain and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. Relatively weak electric field
strengths on the order of 1 V/m are able to produce these effects, indicating that field effects are
strongly amplified in the network. The effects of time-varying external stimulation are well-predicted
by the mean-field model, further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.
