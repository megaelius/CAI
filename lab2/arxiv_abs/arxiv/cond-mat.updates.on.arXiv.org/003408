A quantum quench is the simplest protocol to investigate nonequilibrium many-body quantum dynamics.
Previous studies on the entanglement properties of quenched quantum many-body systems mainly
focus on the growth of entanglement entropy. Several rigorous results and phenomenological guiding
principles have been established, such as the no-faster-than-linear entanglement growth generated
by generic local Hamiltonians and the peculiar logarithmic growth for many-body localized systems.
However, little is known about the dynamical behavior of the full entanglement spectrum, which
is a refined character closely related to the topological nature of the wave function. Here, we establish
a rigorous and universal result for the entanglement spectra of 1D SPT systems evolving out of equilibrium.
Our result is derived both for free-fermion SPT systems and interacting ones. For free-fermion
systems with AZ symmetries, we prove that the single-particle entanglement gap after quenches
obeys essentially the same Lieb-Robinson bound as that on the equal-time correlation, provided
that there is no dynamical symmetry breaking. As a notable byproduct, we obtain a new type of Lieb-Robinson
velocity which is related to the band dispersion with a complex wave number and reaches the minimum
as the maximal (relative) group velocity. Within the framework of tensor networks, i.e., for SPT
MPSs evolved by symmetric and trivial MPUs, we also identify a Lieb-Robinson bound on the many-body
entanglement gap for general quenched interacting SPT systems. This result suggests high potential
of tensor-network approaches for exploring rigorous results on long-time quantum dynamics. Influence
of partial symmetry breaking, effects of disorder, and the relaxation property in the long-time
limit are also discussed. Our work establishes a paradigm for exploring rigorous results of SPT
systems out of equilibrium.
