With conformal-invariance methods, Burkhardt, Guim, and Xue studied the critical Ising model,
defined on the upper half plane $y>0$ with different boundary conditions $a$ and $b$ on the negative
and positive $x$ axes. For $ab=-+$ and $f+$, they determined the one and two-point averages of the
spin $\sigma$ and energy $\epsilon$. Here $+$, $-$, and $f$ stand for spin-up, spin-down, and free-spin
boundaries, respectively. The case $+-+-+\dots$, where the boundary conditions switch between
$+$ and $-$ at arbitrary points, $\zeta_1$, $\zeta_2$, $\dots$ on the $x$ axis was also analyzed.
In this paper the alternating boundary conditions $+f+f+\dots$ and the case $-f+$ of three different
boundary conditions are considered. Exact results for the one and two-point averages of $\sigma$,
$\epsilon$, and the stress tensor $T$ are derived. Using the results for $\langle T\rangle$, the
critical Casimir interaction with the boundary of a wedge-shaped inclusion is analyzed for mixed
boundary conditions. The paper also includes a comprehensive discussion of boundary-operator
expansions in two-dimensional critical systems with mixed boundary conditions. Two types of expansions
- away from switching points of the boundary condition and at switching points - are considered.
The asymptotic behavior of two-point averages is expressed in terms of one-point averages with
the help of the expansions. We also consider the strip geometry with mixed boundary conditions and
derive the distant-wall corrections to one-point averages near one edge due to the other edge using
the boundary-operator expansions. The predictions of the boundary-operator expansions are consistent
with exact results for Ising systems.
