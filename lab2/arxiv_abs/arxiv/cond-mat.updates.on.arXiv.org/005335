In our previous work [Y. Nozawa and H. Tsunetsugu, Phys. Rev. B 101, 035121 (2020)], we studied quench
dynamics in the one-dimensional Hubbard model based on the generalized hydrodynamics theory for
a partitioning protocol and showed the presence of a clogging phenomenon. Clogging is a phenomenon
that vanishing charge current coexists with nonzero energy current, and was found when the protocol
uses the initial condition that the left half of the system is prepared to be half filling at high temperatures
with the right half being empty. Clogging occurs at all the sites in the left half and lasts for a time
proportional to its distance from the connection point. In this paper, we use various different
initial conditions and discuss two issues. The first issue is the possibility of clogging in a stationary
state. When the electron density in the right half is initially set nonzero, we have found that the
left half-filled part expands for various sets of parameters in the initial condition. This means
that the clogging phenomenon occurs at all the sites in the long-time stationary state, and we also
discuss its origin. In addition, stationary clogging is accompanied by back current, namely, particle
density current flows towards the high-density region. We have also found spin clogging occurs
for some initial conditions, i.e., vanishing spin current coexists with nonzero energy current.
The second issue is the proportionality of spin and charge currents. We have found two spatio-temporal
regions where the current ratio is fixed to a nonzero constant. We have numerically studied how the
current ratio depends on various initial conditions. We have also studied the ratio of charge and
energy currents.
