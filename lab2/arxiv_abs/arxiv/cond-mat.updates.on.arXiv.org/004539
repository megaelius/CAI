We suggest a way to disentangle self- from cross-correlation contributions in the dielectric spectra
of glycerol. Recently it was demonstrated for monohydroxy alcohols that a detailed comparison
of the dynamic susceptibilities of photon correlation and broadband dielectric spectroscopy
allows to unambiguously disentangle a collective relaxation mode known as the Debye process, which
could arises due to supramolecular structures, and the $\alpha$-relaxation, which proves to be
identical in both methods. In the present paper, we apply the same idea and analysis to the paradigmatic
glass former glycerol. For that purpose we present new light scattering data from photon correlation
spectroscopy measurements and combine these with literature data to obtain a data set covering
a dynamic range from $10^{-4}-10^{13}\,$Hz. Then we apply the above mentioned analysis by comparing
this data set with a corresponding set of broadband dielectric data. Our finding is that even in a
polyalcohol self- and cross-correlation contributions can approximately be disentangled in
that way and that the emerging picture is very similar to that in monohydroxy alcohols. This is further
supported by comparing the data with fast field cycling NMR measurements and dynamic shear relaxation
data from the literature, and it turns out that, within the described approach, the $\alpha$-process
appears very similar in all methods, while the pronounced differences observed in the spectral
density are due to a different expression of the slow collective relaxational contribution. In
the dielectric spectra the strength of this peak is reasonably well estimated by the Kirkwood correlation
factor, which supports the view that it arises due to dynamic cross-correlations, which were previously
often assumed to be negligible in dielectric measurements.
