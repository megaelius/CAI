Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is of vital importance in the field of experimental mechanics,
yet, producing suitable DIC patterns for demanding in-situ mechanical tests remains challenging,
especially for ultra-fine patterns, despite the large number of patterning techniques in the literature.
Therefore, we propose a simple, flexible, one-step technique (only requiring a conventional deposition
machine) to obtain scalable, high-quality, robust DIC patterns, suitable for a range of microscopic
techniques, by deposition of a low melting temperature solder alloy in so-called 'island growth'
mode, without elevating the substrate temperature. Proof of principle is shown by (near-)room-temperature
deposition of InSn patterns, yielding highly dense, homogeneous DIC patterns over large areas
with a feature size that can be tuned from as small as 10nm to 2um and with control over the feature shape
and density by changing the deposition parameters. Pattern optimization, in terms of feature size,
density, and contrast, is demonstrated for imaging with atomic force microscopy, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy and profilometry. Moreover, the performance of the InSn
DIC patterns and their robustness to large deformations is validated in two challenging case studies
of in-situ micro-mechanical testing: (i) self-adaptive isogeometric digital height correlation
of optical surface height profiles of a coarse, bimodal InSn pattern providing microscopic 3D deformation
fields (illustrated for delamination of aluminum interconnects on a polyimide substrate) and
(ii) DIC on SEM images of a much finer InSn pattern allowing quantification of high strains near fracture
locations (illustrated for rupture of a Fe foil). As such, the high controllability, performance
and scalability of the DIC patterns offers a promising step towards more routine DIC-based in-situ
micro-mechanical testing.
