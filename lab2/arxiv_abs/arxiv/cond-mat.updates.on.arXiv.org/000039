We argue that many aspects of improper ferroelectric activity in orthorhombic manganites can be
rationalized by considering the limit of infinite intra-atomic splitting between the majority-
and minority-spin states (or the double exchange limit), which reduces the problem to the analysis
of a spinless double exchange (DE) Hamiltonian. We apply this strategy to the low-energy model,
derived from the first-principles calculations, and combine it with the Berry-phase theory of
electric polarization. We start with the simplest two-orbital model, describing the behavior
of the eg bands, and apply it to the E-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, which in the DE limit effectively
breaks up into one-dimensional zigzag chains. We derive an analytical expression for the electronic
polarization (Pel) and explain how it depends on the orbital ordering and the energy splitting Delta
between eg states. Then, we evaluate parameters of this model, starting from a more general five-orbital
model for all Mn 3d bands and constructing a new downfolded model for the eg bands. From the analysis
of these parameters, we conclude that the behavior of Pel in realistic manganites corresponds to
the limit of large Delta. We further utilize this property in order to derive an analytical expression
for Pel in a general two-fold periodic magnetic texture, based on the five-orbital model and the
perturbation-theory expansion for the Wannier functions in the first order of 1/Delta. This expression
explains the functional dependence of Pel on the relative directions of spins. Furthermore, it
suggests that Pel is related to the asymmetry of the transfer integrals, which should simultaneously
have symmetric and antisymmetric components. Finally, we explain how the polarization can be switched
between orthorhombic directions a and c by inverting the zigzag AFM texture in every second ab plane.
