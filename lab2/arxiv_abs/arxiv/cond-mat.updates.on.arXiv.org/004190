We consider a random two-phase process which we call a reset-return one. The particle starts its
motion at the origin. The first, displacement, phase corresponds to a stochastic motion of a particle
and is finished at a resetting event. The second, return, phase corresponds to the particle's motion
towards the origin from the position it attained at the end of the displacement phase. This motion
towards the origin takes place according to a given equation of motion. The whole process is a renewal
one. We provide general expressions for the stationary probability density function of the particle's
position and for the mean hitting time in one dimension. We perform explicit analysis for the Brownian
motion during the displacement phase and three different types of the return motion: return at a
constant speed, return at a constant acceleration with zero initial speed and return under the action
of a harmonic force. We assume that the waiting times for resetting events follow an exponential
distribution, or that resetting takes place at a constant pace. For the first two types of return
motion and the exponential resetting the stationary probability density function of the particle's
position is invariant under return speed (acceleration), while no such invariance is found for
deterministic resetting, and for exponential resetting with return under the action of the harmonic
force. We discuss necessary conditions for such invariance of the stationary PDF of the positions
with respect to the properties of the return process, and demonstrate some additional examples
when this invariance does or does not take place.
