Clustering is often presumed to lead to enhanced agglomeration between cohesive grains due to the
reduced relative velocities of particles within a cluster. Our discrete-particle simulations
on gravity-driven, gas-solid flows of cohesive grains exhibit the opposite trend, revealing a
new mechanism we coin "cluster-induced deagglomeration." Specifically, we examine relatively
dilute gas-solid flows and isolate agglomerates of cohesive origin from overall heterogeneities
in the system, i.e., agglomerates of cohesive origin and clusters of hydrodynamic origin. We observe
enhanced clustering with an increasing system size (as is the norm for noncohesive systems) as well
as reduced agglomeration. The reduced agglomeration is traced to the increased collisional impact
velocities of particles at the surface of a cluster; i.e., higher levels of clustering lead to larger
relative velocities between the clustered and nonclustered regions, thereby serving as an additional
source of granular temperature. This physical picture is further evidenced by a theoretical model
based on a balance between the generation and breakage rates of agglomerates. Finally, cluster-induced
deagglomeration also provides an explanation for a surprising saturation of agglomeration levels
in gravity-driven, gas-solid systems with increasing levels of cohesion, as opposed to the monotonically
increasing behavior seen in free-evolving or driven granular systems in the absence of gravity.
Namely, higher cohesion leads to more energy dissipation, which is associated with competing effects:
enhanced agglomeration and enhanced clustering, the latter of which results in more cluster-induced
deagglomeration.
