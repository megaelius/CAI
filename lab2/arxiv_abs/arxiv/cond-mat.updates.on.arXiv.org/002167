One-parameter interpolations between any two unitary matrices (e.g., quantum gates) $U_1$ and
$U_2$ along efficient paths contained in the unitary group are constructed. Motivated by applications,
we propose the continuous unitary path $U(\theta)$ obtained from the QR-factorization \[ U(\theta)R(\theta)=(1-\theta)A+\theta
B, \] where $U_1 R_1=A$ and $U_2 R_2=B$ are the QR-factorizations of $A$ and $B$, and $U(\theta)$
is a unitary for all $\theta$ with $U(0)=U_1$ and $U(1)=U_2$. The QR-algorithm is modified to, instead
of $U(\theta)$, output a matrix whose columns are proportional to the corresponding columns of
$U(\theta)$ and whose entries are polynomial or rational functions of $\theta$. By an extension
of the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm we show that rational functions can be efficiently and exactly
interpolated with respect to $\theta$. We then construct probability distributions over unitaries
that are arbitrarily close to the Haar measure. Demonstration of computational advantages of NISQ
over classical computers is an imperative near-term goal, especially with the exuberant experimental
frontier in academia and industry (e.g., IBM and Google). A candidate for quantum computational
supremacy is Random Circuit Sampling (RCS), which is the task of sampling from the output distribution
of a random circuit. The aforementioned mathematical results provide a new way of scrambling quantum
circuits and are applied to prove that exact RCS is $\#P$-Hard on average, which is a simpler alternative
to Bouland et al's. (Dis)Proving the quantum supremacy conjecture requires "approximate" average
case hardness; this remains an open problem for all quantum supremacy proposals.
