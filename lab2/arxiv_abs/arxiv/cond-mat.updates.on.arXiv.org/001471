Wavefunctions for large electron numbers $N$ are plagued by the Exponential Wall Problem (EWP),
i.e., an exponential increase in the dimensions of Hilbert space with $N$. Therefore they loose
their meaning for macroscopic systems, a point stressed in particular by W. Kohn. The EWP has to be
resolved in order to be able to perform electronic structure calculations, e.g., for solids. The
origin of the EWP is the multiplicative property of wavefunctions when independent subsystems
are considered. Therefore it can only be avoided when wavefunctions are formulated so that they
are additive instead, in particular when matrix elements involving them are calculated. We describe
how this is done for the ground state of a macroscopic electron system. Going over from a multiplicative
to an additive quantity requires taking a logarithm. Here it implies going over from Hilbert space
to the operator- or Liouville space with a metric based on cumulants. The operators which define
the ground-state wavefunction generate fluctuations from a mean-field state. The latter does
not suffer from an EWP and therefore may serve as a vacuum state. The fluctuations have to be {\it connected}
like the ones caused by pair interactions in a classical gas when the free energy is calculated (Meyer's
cluster expansion). This fixes the metric in Liouville space. The scheme presented here provides
a solid basis for electronic structure calculations for the ground state of solids. In fact, its
applicability has already been proven. We discuss also matrix product states, which have been applied
to one-dimensional systems with results of high precision. Although these states are formulated
in Hilbert space they are processed by using operators in Liouville space. We show that they fit into
the general formalism described above.
