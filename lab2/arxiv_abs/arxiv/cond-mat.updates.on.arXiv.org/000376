The isomorph theory provides an explanation for the so-called power law density scaling which has
been observed in many molecular and polymeric glass formers, both experimentally and in simulations.
Power law density scaling (relaxation times and transport coefficients being functions of $\rho^\gamma/T$,
where $\rho$ is density, $T$ is temperature, and $\gamma$ is a material specific scaling exponent)
is an approximation to a more general scaling predicted by the isomorph theory. Furthermore, the
isomorph theory provides an explanation for Rosenfeld scaling (relaxation times and transport
coefficients being functions of excess entropy) which has been observed in simulations of both
molecular and polymeric systems. Doing molecular dynamics simulations of flexible Lennard-Jones
chains (LJC), we provide the first detailed test of the isomorph theory applied to flexible chain
molecules. We confirm the existence of ``isomorphs'', which are curves in the phase diagram along
which the dynamics is invariant in the appropriate reduced units. This holds not only for the relaxation
times but also for the full time dependence of the dynamics, including chain specific dynamics such
as the end-to-end vector autocorrelation function, and the relaxation of the Rouse modes. As predicted
by the isomorph theory, jumps between different state points on the same isomorph happen instantaneously
without any slow relaxation. Since the LJC is a simple coarse-grained model for alkanes and polymers,
our results provide a possible explanation for why power-law density scaling is observed experimentally
in alkanes and many polymeric systems. The theory provides an independent method of determining
the scaling exponent, which is usually treated as a empirical scaling parameter.
