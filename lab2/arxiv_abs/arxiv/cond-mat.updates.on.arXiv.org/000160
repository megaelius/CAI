With this paper we provide an effective method to solve a large class of problems related to the electromagnetic
behavior of thin superconductors. Here all the problems are reduced to finding the weight functions
for the Green integrals that represent the magnetic field components; these latter must satisfy
the mixed boundary value conditions that naturally arise from the critical state assumptions.
The use of the Erd\'elyi-Kober operators and of the Hankel transforms (and mostly the employment
of their composition properties) is the keystone to unify the method toward the solution. In fact,
the procedure consists always of the same steps and does not require any peculiar invention. For
this reason the method, here presented in detail for the simplest cases that can be handled in analytical
way (two parts boundary), can be directly extended to many other more complex geometries (three
or more parts), which usually will require a numerical treatment. In this paper we use the operator
technique to derive the current density and field distributions in perfectly conducting and superconducting
thin discs and tapes subjected to a uniform magnetic field or carrying a transport current. Although
analytical expressions for the field and current distributions have already been found by other
authors in the past by using several other methods, their derivation is often cumbersome or missing
key details, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully understand the derivation of the analytical
formulas and, more importantly, to extend the same methods to solve similar new problems. On the
contrary, the characterization of these cases as mixed boundary conditions has the advantage of
referring to an immediate and na\"{i}ve translation of physics into a consistent mathematical
formulation whose possible extension to other cases is self-evident.
