We consider a problem of obtaining information about the scattering potentials of the monolayer
graphene sample using available experimental data on its resistance. We have in mind a development
of the study describing super-high mobility electrons in suspended samples without chemical doping.
As far as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the Coulomb scattering negligible,
we consider models of the short-range scattering potentials. The model of short-range potential
is assumed to be supported by the close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter
of circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The empty core of the model
potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical shortwave modes. Two models are investigated:
the delta function on the circumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well. An advantage
of the former is simplicity, while a virtue of the latter is regularity. We consider scattering of
electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit formulae for the scattering data. We here
discuss application of these formulae for calculation of observables. Namely, we analyze the contribution
of this scattering into the graphene resistance and plot the resistivity as a function of the Fermi
energy according to our theoretical formulae. The obtained results are consistent with experiment,
where the resistance was measured as a function of the Fermi momentum on the suspended annealed graphene.
This fact gives a possibility to find parameters of the modeled potential on the base of the available
experimental data on resistance of the suspended graphene sample with the gate voltage controlled
Fermi level position. It is clear to be very important for applications.
