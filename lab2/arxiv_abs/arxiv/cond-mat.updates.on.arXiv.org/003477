We present a theory of the entanglement transition tuned by measurement strength in one dimensional
qudit arrays evolved by random unitary circuits and subject to either weak or random projective
measurements. The transition can be understood as a nonanalytic change in the amount of information
extracted by the measurements about the system initial state, quantified by the Fisher information.
To compute the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S$ and the Fisher information $\mathcal{F}$,
we apply a replica method based on a sequence of quantities $\tilde{S}^{(n)}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{(n)}$
that depend on the $n$-th moments of density matrices and reduce to $S$ and $\mathcal{F}$ in the limit
$n\to 1$. These quantities with $n\ge 2$ are mapped to free energies of classical $n!$-state Potts
models in two dimensions with specific boundary conditions. In particular, $\tilde{S}^{(n)}$
is the excess free energy of a domain wall terminating on the top boundary of the spin model. $\mathcal{F}^{(n)}$
is related to the magnetization of the spins on the bottom boundary. Phase transitions occur as the
spin models undergo ordering transitions in the bulk. We analytically compute the critical measurement
probability $p_c^{(n)}$ for $n \ge 2$ in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension $q$ and
show that the transitions with different $n$ belong to distinct universality classes. Analytic
continuation as $n\to 1$ identifies the phase transition as a bond percolation in a 2D square lattice.
We extract the critical point in the large $q$ limit, which is in good agreement with numerical simulations
even when $q=2$. Finally, we show there is no phase transition if the measurements are allowed in
an arbitrary nonlocal basis, thereby highlighting the relation between the phase transition and
information scrambling. We discuss implications of our results to experimental observations
of the transition.
