For many nonlinear physical systems, approximate solutions are pursued by conventional perturbation
theory in powers of the non-linear terms. Unfortunately, this often produces divergent asymptotic
series, collectively dismissed by Abel as "an invention of the devil." An alternative method, the
self-consistent expansion, has been introduced by Schwartz and Edwards. Its basic idea is a rescaling
of the zeroth-order system around which the solution is expanded, to achieve optimal results. While
low-order self-consistent calculations have been remarkably successful in describing the dynamics
of non-equilibrium many-body systems (e.g., the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation), its convergence
properties have not been elucidated before. To address this issue we apply this technique to the
canonical partition function of the classical harmonic oscillator with a quartic $gx^{4}$ anharmonicity,
for which perturbation theory's divergence is well-known. We explicitly obtain the $N^{\text{th}}$
order self-consistent expansion for the partition function, which is rigorously found to converge
exponentially fast in $N$, and uniformly in $g$, for any coupling $g>0$. Comparing the self-consistent
expansion with other methods that improve upon perturbation theory (Borel resummation, hyperasymptotics,
Pad\'e approximants, and the Lanczos $\tau$-method), it compares favorably with all of them for
small $g$ and dominates over them for large $g$. Remarkably, the self-consistent expansion is shown
to successfully capture the correct partition function for the double-well potential case, where
no perturbative expansion exists. Our treatment is generalized to the case of many oscillators,
as well as to a more general nonlinearity of the form $g|x|^{q}$ with $q\ge0$ and complex $g$. These
results allow us to treat the Airy function, and to see the fingerprints of Stokes lines in the self-consistent
expansion.
