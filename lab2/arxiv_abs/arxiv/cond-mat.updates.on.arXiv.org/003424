We present a detailed study of the structure-dynamics relationship of regio-regular and regio-random
PEHT using different neutron scattering techniques. Deuteration is employed to modulate the coherent
and incoherent cross-sections, allowing particularly to access both self-motions and collective
dynamics of the materials. The measurements are underpinned by extensive quantitative calculations
using classical MD, as well as first principles quantum chemistry. MD reproduced well the main structural
features and slow motions, and shed light on differences in collective dynamics between Q-values
linked with the $\pi-\pi$ stacking and the lamellar stacking, with the crystalline phase being
the most impacted. On the other hand MD led to a limited description of molecular vibrations. In this
context, first principles molecular calculations described well the high-energy vibrational
features ( $>$ 900 cm$^{-1}$ ), while periodic calculations allowed to better describe the low-
and mid-energy vibrational ranges ( 200-900 cm$^{-1}$ ). The mid-energy range is predominantly
associated with both intra-molecular and inter-molecular mode coupling, which encloses information
about both the polymer conformation and the polymer packing at short range. One of the outcomes of
this study is the validation of the common assumption made that RRa-P3HT is a good approximation
for the amorphous phase of RR-P3HT at the macroscopic level. The present work helps to clarify unambiguously
the latter point which has been largely overlooked in the literature. We highlight the importance
to complement optical spectroscopy techniques with inelastic neutron scattering. The latter
offering the advantage of being insensitive to the delocalized $\pi$-electron system, and thus
enabling to infer relevant quantities like conjugation lengths, for instance, impacting properties
of conjugated polymer.
