We present a general methodology towards the systematic characterization of crystalline topological
insulating phases with time reversal symmetry (TRS).~In particular, taking the two-dimensional
spinful hexagonal lattice as a proof of principle we study windings of Wilson loop spectra over cuts
in the Brillouin zone that are dictated by the underlying lattice symmetries.~Our approach finds
a prominent use in elucidating and quantifying the recently proposed ``topological quantum chemistry"
(TQC) concept.~Namely, we prove that the split of an elementary band representation (EBR) by a band
gap must lead to a topological phase.~For this we first show that in addition to the Fu-Kane-Mele
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, there is $C_2\mathcal{T}$-symmetry protected $\mathbb{Z}$
classification of two-band subspaces that is obstructed by the other crystalline symmetries,
i.e.~forbidding the trivial phase. This accounts for all nontrivial Wilson loop windings of split
EBRs \textit{that are independent of the parameterization of the flow of Wilson loops}.~Then,
we show that while Wilson loop winding of split EBRs can unwind when embedded in higher-dimensional
band space, two-band subspaces that remain separated by a band gap from the other bands conserve
their Wilson loop winding, hence revealing that split EBRs are at least "stably trivial", i.e. necessarily
non-trivial in the non-stable (few-band) limit but possibly trivial in the stable (many-band)
limit.~This clarifies the nature of \textit{fragile} topology that has appeared very recently.~We
then argue that in the many-band limit the stable Wilson loop winding is only determined by the Fu-Kane-Mele
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant implying that further stable topological phases must belong to the class
of higher-order topological insulators.
