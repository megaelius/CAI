The recent experimental observations of decaying energy oscillations in semiconductor-superconductor
Majorana nanowires is in contrast with the typical expectations based on the presence of Majorana
zero modes localized at the ends of the system, when the amplitude of the hybridization energy oscillations
is predicted to increase with the applied magnetic field. These observations have been theoretically
justified recently by considering a position-dependent, step-like spin-orbit coupling near
end of the nanowire, which could arise due to the presence of tunnel gates in a standard tunneling
conductance experiment. Here, we show that the window in parameter space where this phenomenology
occurs is vanishingly small, when compared to the parameter region where Majorana oscillations
increase in amplitude with the applied field. Further, including a position-dependent effective
potential, which is also induced naturally near the end of the wire by, e.g., tunnel gates, practically
removes the small window associated with decaying oscillations. Using extensive numerical calculations,
we show that, as expected, increasing amplitude oscillations of the hybridization energy represent
a generic property of topological Majorana zero modes, while decreasing amplitude oscillations
are a generic property of low-energy trivial Andreev bound states that typically emerge in non-homogeneous
systems. By averaging over several realistic parameter configurations, we identify robust features
of the hybridization energy that can be observed in a typical differential conductance experiment
without fine-tuning the control parameters.
