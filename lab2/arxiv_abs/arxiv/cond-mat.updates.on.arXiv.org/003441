In this study, we investigate the suitability of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations
to predict the dynamics of polymer chains in dilute polymer solutions, where the chain is represented
by a set of beads connected by almost inextensible springs. In terms of behaviour, these springs
closely mimic rods that serve as representations of Kuhn steps. We find that the predictions depend
on the value of the repulsive parameter for bead-bead pairwise interactions used in the DPD simulations
($a_{ij}$). For all systems, the chain sizes and the relaxation time spectrum are analyzed. For
$a_{ij} = 0$, theta solvent behaviour is obtained for the chain size, whereas the dynamics at equilibrium
agrees well with the predictions of the Zimm model. For higher values of $a_{ij}$, the static properties
of the chain show good solvent behaviour. However, the scaling laws for the chain dynamics at equilibrium
show wide variations, with consistent results obtained only at an intermediate value of $a_{ij}
= 25$. At higher values of the repulsive parameter ($a_{ij} \geq 25$), our simulations are also able
to predict the abrupt cut-off in the relaxation spectrum, which has been observed earlier in experiments
of dilute solutions. The cut-off reached an extent that, for chain lengths of 10 Kuhn steps, the spectrum
consists of a single time scale. This agrees remarkably well with earlier experiments and MD simulations.
To verify further, we also studied the chain dynamics in shear flow using DPD simulations. Specifically,
we analysed the variation of the chain stretch and end-over-end tumbling with shear rates. Overall,
the trends obtained from DPD simulations agree well with those observed in earlier BD simulations.
