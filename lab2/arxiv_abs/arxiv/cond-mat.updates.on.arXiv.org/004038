Many integrable stochastic particle systems in one space dimension (such as TASEP - Totally Asymmetric
Simple Exclusion Process - and its various deformations, with a notable exception of ASEP) remain
integrable when we equip each particle $x_i$ with its own jump rate parameter $\nu_i$. It is a consequence
of integrability that the distribution of each particle $x_n(t)$ in a system started from the step
initial configuration depends on the parameters $\nu_j$, $j\le n$, in a symmetric way. A transposition
$\nu_n \leftrightarrow \nu_{n+1}$ of the parameters thus affects only the distribution of $x_n(t)$.
For $q$-Hahn TASEP and its degenerations (namely, $q$-TASEP and beta polymer) we realize the transposition
$\nu_n \leftrightarrow \nu_{n+1}$ as an explicit Markov swap operator acting on the single particle
$x_n(t)$. For beta polymer, the swap operator can be interpreted as a simple modification of the
lattice on which the polymer is considered. Our main tools are Markov duality and contour integral
formulas for joint moments. In particular, our constructions lead to a continuous time Markov process
$\mathsf{Q}^{(\mathsf{t})}$ preserving the time $\mathsf{t}$ distribution of the $q$-TASEP
(with step initial configuration, where $\mathsf{t}\in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is fixed). The dual
system is a certain transient modification of the stochastic $q$-Boson system. We identify asymptotic
survival probabilities of this transient process with $q$-moments of the $q$-TASEP, and use this
to show convergence of the process $\mathsf{Q}^{(\mathsf{t})}$ with arbitrary initial data to
its stationary distribution. Setting $q=0$, we recover the results about the usual TASEP established
recently in arXiv:1907.09155 [math.PR] by a different approach based on Gibbs ensembles of interlacing
particles in two dimensions.
