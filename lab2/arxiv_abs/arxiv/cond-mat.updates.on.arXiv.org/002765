To make progress in understanding the issue of memory loss and history dependence in evolving complex
systems, we consider the mixing rate that specifies how fast the future states become independent
of the initial condition. We propose a simple measure for assessing the mixing rate that can be directly
applied to experimental data observed in any metric space $X$. For a compact phase space $X \subset
R^M$, we prove the following statement. If the underlying dynamical system has a unique physical
measure and its dynamics is strongly mixing with respect to this measure, then our method provides
an upper bound of the mixing rate. We employ our method to analyze memory loss for the system of slowly
sheared granular particles with a small inertial number $I$. The shear is induced by the moving walls
as well as by the linear motion of the support surface that ensures approximately linear shear throughout
the sample. We show that even if $I$ is kept fixed, the rate of memory loss (considered at the time scale
given by the inverse shear rate) depends erratically on the shear rate. Our study suggests a presence
of bifurcations at which the rate of memory loss increases with the shear rate while it decreases
away from these points. We also find that the memory loss is not a smooth process. Its rate is closely
related to frequency of the sudden transitions of the force network. The loss of memory, quantified
by observing evolution of force networks, is found to be correlated with the loss of correlation
of shear stress measured on the system scale. Thus, we have established a direct link between the
evolution of force networks and macroscopic properties of the considered system.
