The first-principles calculations for exploring half-metallic (HM) ferromagnets with wide band
gap around Fermi energy in minority spin channel remains challenging in treatment of correlation
effect. The DFT+U method, in which the Hubbard-type effective on-site Coulomb parameters ($U_{eff}$)
is theoretically determined from linear response (LR) approach, is a suitable method on a practical
level because of an advantage of efficient computational cost. We apply this method for Co-based
ternary Heusler alloys Co$_2$YSi where Y is $3d$ transition metal. Based on detailed analyses of
calculated band structures for Co$_2$MnSi, we propose an energy diagram that reveals an important
atomic-orbital hybridization of Co-Mn $t_{2g}$ state, which is newly discovered and governs minority
HM gap around Fermi energy. This unified diagram provides a new insight in that the HM property is
possible to be tuned by $t_{2g}$ coupling through a choose of Y atom. We also investigated the role
of $U_{eff}$ parameters on the Mn and Co sites independently and found that the correlation effect
of Mn site is more significant than that of Co to reproduce the ground-state electronic and magnetic
structures in consistent of experimental results. Our LR-based DFT+U method were, further, extended
to other compounds including quaternary system Co$_2$(Y,Mn)Si, where a part of Mn is substituted
with Y, to explore a possibility of the HM ferromagnetism in Co-based full Heusler alloys. The results
indicate that the quaternary compound have a potential to be a HM ferromagnet when a composition
of substituting element is appropriately selected, i.e., Y$=\rm{Ti}$, V, Fe. Particularly, Co$_2$(Fe$_{0.25}$,Mn$_{0.75}$)Si
shows great promise in the spintronics applications due to a sizable minority HM gap and Fermi energy
position being at center of the gap, which lead to high thermal stability in terms of the HM band structure.
