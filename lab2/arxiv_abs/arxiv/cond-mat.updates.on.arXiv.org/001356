Density functional theory calculations are carried out to investigate the structural, elastic
and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbide and nitride based pristine
and functionalized MXenes. Simulation results show that carbide-based MXenes have larger lattice
constants and monolayer thicknesses than nitride-based MXenes. The in-plane elastic moduli of
titanium nitride based pristine MXenes are larger than those of titanium carbide based pristine
MXenes, whereas in both systems they decrease with the increase of the monolayer thickness. Cohesive
energy calculations indicate that MXenes with a larger monolayer thickness have a better structural
stability. The nitride-based MXenes are found to be less stable with respect to carbide-based MXenes,
similar to experimental reports. However, adsorption energy calculations imply that titanium
nitride based pristine MXenes has stronger preference to adhere to the terminal groups, particularly
the -O groups, which suggests more active surfaces. By analyzing the electron localization function
and charge density distribution, the interactions between Ti-C, Ti-N, Ti-T are determined to be
essentially ionic bonding. More importantly, nearly free electron states are observed to exist
outside the surfaces of -OH functionalized carbide and nitride based MXenes, which provide almost
perfect transmission channels without nuclear scattering for electron transport. Density of
states analysis shows that the overall electrical conductivity of nitride-based MXenes is higher
than that of carbide-based MXenes. The exceptional properties of titanium nitride based MXenes,
including strong surface adsorption, high elastic constants and elastic modulus, and good metallic
conductivity, make them promising materials for catalysis and energy storage applications.
