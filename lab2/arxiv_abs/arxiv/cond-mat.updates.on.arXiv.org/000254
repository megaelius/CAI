Predictions and discoveries of new phases of superfluid $^3$He in confined geometries, as well
as novel topological excitations confined to surfaces and edges of near a bounding surface of $^3$He,
are driving the fields of superfluid $^3$He infused into porous media, as well as the fabrication
of sub-micron to nano-scale devices for controlled studies of quantum fluids. In this report we
consider superfluid $^3$He confined in a periodic geometry, specifically a two-dimensional lattice
of square, sub-micron-scale boundaries ("posts") with translational invariance in the third
dimension. The equilibrium phase(s) are inhomogeneous and depend on the microscopic boundary
conditions imposed by a periodic array of posts. We present results for the order parameter and phase
diagram based on strong pair breaking at the boundaries. The ordered phases are obtained by numerically
minimizing the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional. We report results for the weak-coupling
limit, appropriate at ambient pressure, as a function of temperature T, lattice spacing L, and post
edge dimension, $d$. For all $d$ in which a superfluid transition occurs, we find a transition from
the normal state to a periodic, inhomogeneous "polar" phase with $T_{c_1} < T_c$ for bulk superfluid
$^3$He. For fixed lattice spacing, L, there is a critical post dimension, d_c, above which only the
periodic polar phase is stable. For $d < d_c$ we find a second, low-temperature phase onsetting
at $T_{c_2} < T_{c_1}$ from the polar phase to a periodic "B-like" phase. The low temperature
phase is inhomogeneous, anisotropic and preserves time-reversal symmetry, but unlike the bulk
B-phase has only $D_{4h}$ point symmetry.
