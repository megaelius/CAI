We investigate theoretically the effect of injection of plasmonic carriers from an optically-excited
metal nanocrystal to a semiconductor contact or to attached molecules. The distributions of optically-excited
hot carriers are dramatically different in metal nanocrystals with large and small sizes. In large
nanocrystals, most carriers have very small energies and the hot carrier distribution resembles
the case of a plasmon wave in bulk. In nanocrystals smaller than 20nm, the carrier distribution extends
to larger energies and occupies the whole region E_{F}<E<omega. The physical reason for
the above behaviors is non-conservation of momentum in a nanocrystal. Because of the above properties,
nanocrystals of small sizes are most suitable for designing of opto-electronic and photosynthetic
devices based on injection of plasmonic electrons and holes. The central parameter of the problem
is DeltaN=omega/q_{L}*v_{F}, where q_{L} is the momentum transfer and v_{F} is the Fermi velocity.
In gold nanocrystals, when DeltaN<7, the high-energy hot-electron generation is efficient.
For larger parameters DeltaN, the number of high-energy electrons is greatly reduced. Another
important factor is the polarization of the exciting light. For efficient excitation of carriers
with high energies, the electric-field polarization vector should be perpendicular to a prism-like
nanoantenna (slab or platelet) with a small width ~ 10-20 nm. We also show the relation between our
theory for injection in plasmonic nanocrystals and the Fowler theory of injection from a bulk metal.
Along with a prism geometry (or platelet geometry), we consider cubes. The results can be applied
to design both purely solid-state opto-electronic devices and systems for photo-catalysis and
solar conversion.
