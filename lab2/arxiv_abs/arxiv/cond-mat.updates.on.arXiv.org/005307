Twisted double bilayer graphene has recently emerged as an interesting moir\'e material that exhibits
strong correlation phenomena that are tunable by an applied electric field. Here, we study the atomic
and electronic properties of three different graphene double bilayers: double bilayers composed
of two AB stacked bilayers (AB/AB), double bilayers composed of two AA stacked bilayers (AA/AA)
as well as heterosystems composed of one AB and one AA bilayer (AB/AA). First, the atomic structure
is determined using classical force fields. We find that the inner layers of the double bilayer exhibit
significant in-plane and out-of-plane relaxations, similar to twisted bilayer graphene. The
relaxations of the outer layers depend on the stacking: outer-layer atoms in AB bilayers follow
the relaxations of the inner layers, while outer-layer atoms in AA bilayers attempt to avoid higher-energy
AA stacking. For the relaxed structures, we calculate the electronic band structures using the
tight-binding method. All double bilayers exhibit flat bands at small twist angles, but the shape
of the bands depends sensitively on the stacking of the outer layers. To gain further insight, we
study the evolution of the band structure as the outer layers are rigidly moved away from the inner
layers, while preserving their atomic relaxations. This reveals that the hybridization with the
outer layers results in an additional flattening of the inner-layer flat band manifold. Our results
establish AA/AA and AB/AA twisted double bilayers as interesting moir\'e materials with different
flat band physics compared to the widely studied AB/AB system.
