Ballistic relocation of atoms produced by irradiation drives materials to out-of-equilibrium
states. Under sustained ballistic forcing exchanges between atoms within the displacement cascade,
standard thermodynamic and kinetic methods do not apply because of the loss of the microscopic detailed
balance. In this case, the competition between activated jumps satisfying the microscopic detailed
balance and the ballistic relocations leads to non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). The resolution
of the microscopic Master Equation describing the transitions between different on-lattice configurations
allows us to define dynamical short-range order (SRO) parameters under stationary conditions.
We extend the Self-Consistent Mean Field (SCMF) theory to migration mechanisms which do not satisfy
the microscopic detailed balance. We deduce a first shell analytical approximation of the macroscopic
fluxes of point defects and atoms and highlight the non-symmetry property of the corresponding
effective Onsager matrix. An implementation of the extended theory into the code KineCluE yields
converged calculations of the effective Onsager coefficients in excellent agreement with Monte
Carlo simulations and a systematic parametric study of the diffusion properties with respect to
the relocation model and the alloy thermodynamics. The effect of the ballistic relocation on the
vacancy-solute flux coupling and the solute tracer diffusion is non-negligible when: (i) the solute-vacancy
thermodynamic attraction is large, (ii) the magnitude of the thermal jump frequencies is in the
same order of magnitude as the relocation exchange frequency, and (iii) the range of the energy interactions
between the point-defects and the solutes atoms is close to the ballistic relocation distances.
