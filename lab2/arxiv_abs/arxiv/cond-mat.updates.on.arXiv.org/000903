Thermodynamical arguments are known to be useful in the construction of physically motivated Lyapunov
functionals for nonlinear stability analysis of spatially homogeneous equilibrium steady states
in thermodynamically isolated systems. Unfortunately, the limitation to thermodynamically
isolated systems is essential, and standard arguments are not applicable even for some very simple
thermodynamically open systems. On the other hand, the nonlinear stability of inhomogenous non-equilibrium
states in thermodynamically open systems is usually investigated using the so-called energy method.
However, when the method is used in the stability analysis of coupled thermomechanical systems,
the designation "energy method" is clearly a misnomer. The reason is that one of the key quantities
of interest is the volume integral of the square of temperature field, which is by no means linked
to the energy in the physical sense of the word. This indicates that the mathematical method is used
rather artificially without a tight link to the physics. Consequently, it would seem that thermodynamical
concepts are of no use in the nonlinear stability analysis of thermodynamically open systems. We
show that this is not true. In particular, we propose a construction that in the case of simple heat
conduction problem leads to a physically well-motivated Lyapunov functional, which effectively
replaces the artificial Lyapunov functional used in the standard energy method. The proposed construction
seems to be general enough to be applied in more complex thermomechanical settings, hence it could
provide a tool for nonlinear stability analysis of thermodynamically open systems that are currently
beyond the reach of the standard energy method.
