Active agents - like phoretic particles, bacteria, sperm, and cytoskeletal filaments in motility
assays - show a large variety of motility-induced collective behaviors, such as aggregation, clustering
and phase separation. The behavior of dense suspensions of phoretic particles and of bacteria during
biofilm formation is determined by two principle physical mechanisms: (i) volume exclusion (short-range
steric repulsion) and (ii) quorum sensing (longer-range reduced propulsion due to alteration
of the local chemical environment). To systematically characterize such systems, we study semi-penetrable
self-propelled rods in two dimensions, with a propulsion force that decreases with increasing
local rod density, by employing Brownian Dynamics simulations. Volume exclusion and quorum sensing
both lead to phase separation, however, the structure and rod dynamics vastly differ. Quorum sensing
enhances the polarity of the clusters, induces perpendicularity of rods at the cluster borders,
and enhances cluster formation. For systems, where the rods essentially become passive at high
densities, formation of asters and stripes is observed. Systems of rods with larger aspect ratios
show more ordered structures compared to those with smaller aspect ratios, due to their stronger
alignment, with almost circular asters for strongly density-dependent propulsion force. With
increasing range of the quorum-sensing interaction, the local density decreases, asters become
less stable, and polar hedgehog clusters and clusters with domains appear. Our results characterize
structure formation and dynamics due to the competition of two qualitatively different interaction
mechanisms, steric hindrance and quorum sensing, which are both relevant for engineered phoretic
microswimmers as well as for bacteria in biofilm formation.
