A generalized disclination (g.disclination) theory [AF15] has been recently introduced that
goes beyond treating standard translational and rotational Volterra defects in a continuously
distributed defects approach; it is capable of treating the kinematics and dynamics of terminating
lines of elastic strain and rotation discontinuities. In this work, a numerical method is developed
to solve for the stress and distortion fields of g.disclination systems. Problems of small and finite
deformation theory are considered. The fields of a single disclination, a single dislocation treated
as a disclination dipole, a tilt grain boundary, a misfitting grain boundary with disconnections,
a through twin boundary, a terminating twin boundary, a through grain boundary, a star disclination/penta-twin,
a disclination loop (with twist and wedge segments), and a plate, a lenticular, and a needle inclusion
are approximated. It is demonstrated that while the far-field topological identity of a dislocation
of appropriate strength and a disclination-dipole plus a slip dislocation comprising a disconnection
are the same, the latter microstructure is energetically favorable. This underscores the complementary
importance of all of topology, geometry, and energetics in understanding defect mechanics. It
is established that finite element approximations of fields of interfacial and bulk line defects
can be achieved in a systematic and routine manner, thus contributing to the study of intricate defect
microstructures in the scientific understanding and predictive design of materials. Our work
also represents one systematic way of studying the interaction of (g.)disclinations and dislocations
as topological defects, a subject of considerable subtlety and conceptual importance [Mer79,
AMK17].
