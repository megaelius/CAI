Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), whether in bulk or in monolayer form, exhibit a rich variety
of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases and stronger periodic lattice distortions. While the actual
role of nesting has been under debate, it is well understood that the microscopic interaction responsible
for the CDWs is the electron-phonon coupling. The case of TiSe$_2$ is however unique in this family
in that the normal state above the critical temperature $T_\mathrm{CDW}$ is characterized by a
small quasiparticle bandgap as measured by ARPES, so that no nesting-derived enhancement of the
susceptibility is present. It has therefore been argued that the mechanism responsible for this
CDW should be different and that this material realizes the excitonic insulator phase proposed
by Walter Kohn. On the other hand, it has also been suggested that the whole phase diagram can be explained
by a sufficiently strong electron-phonon coupling. In this work, in order to estimate how close
this material is to the pure excitonic insulator instability, we quantify the strength of electron-hole
interactions by computing the exciton band structure at the level of hybrid density functional
theory, focusing on the monolayer. We find that in a certain range of parameters the indirect gap
at $q_{\mathrm{CDW}}$ is significantly reduced by excitonic effects. We discuss the consequences
of those results regarding the debate on the physical mechanism responsible for this CDW. Based
on the dependence of the calculated exciton binding energies as a function of the mixing parameter
of hybrid DFT, we conjecture that a necessary condition for a pure excitonic insulator is that its
noninteracting electronic structure is metallic.
