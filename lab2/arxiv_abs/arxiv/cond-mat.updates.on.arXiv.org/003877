CVD growth is capable of producing multiple single crystal islands of atomically thin TMDs over
large area substrates, with potential control of their morphology, lateral size, and epitaxial
alignment to substrates with hexagonal symmetry. Subsequent merging of epitaxial domains can
lead to single-crystal monolayer sheets - a step towards scalable production of high quality TMDs.
For CVD growth to be effectively used for such production it is necessary to be able to rapidly assess
the quality of material across entire large area substrates. To date characterisation has been
limited to sub 0.1 mm2 areas, where the properties measured are not necessarily representative
of an entire sample. Here, we apply photoluminescence (PL) imaging and computer vision techniques
to create an automated analysis for large area samples of semiconducting TMDs, measuring the properties
of island size, density of islands, relative PL intensity and homogeneity, and orientation of triangular
domains. The analysis is applied to 20x magnification optical microscopy images that completely
map samples of WSe2 on hBN, 5.0 mm x 5.0 mm in size, and MoSe2-WS2 on SiO2/Si, 11.2 mm x 5.8 mm in size.
For the latter sample 100,245 objects were identified and their properties measured, with an orientation
extracted from 27,779 objects that displayed a triangular morphology. In the substrates studied,
two prevailing orientations of epitaxial growth were observed in WSe2 grown on hBN and four predominant
orientations were observed in MoSe2, initially grown on c-plane sapphire. The proposed analysis
will greatly reduce the time needed to study freshly synthesised material over large area substrates
and provide feedback to optimise growth conditions, advancing techniques to produce high quality
TMD monolayer sheets for commercial applications.
