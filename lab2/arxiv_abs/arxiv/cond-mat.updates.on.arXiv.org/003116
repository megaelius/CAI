We present the cationic impurity assisted band offset phenomena in NixCd1-xO (x= 0, 0.02, 0.05,
0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1) thin films and further discussed in the light of orbital hybridization modification.
Compositional and structural studies revealed that cationic substitution of Cd2+ by Ni2+ ions
leads to a monotonic shift in (220) diffraction peak, indicating the suppression of lattice distortion
while evolution of local strain with increasing Ni concentration mainly associated to the mismatch
in electro-negativity of Cd2+ and Ni2+ ion. In fact, Fermi level pinning towards conduction band
minima takes place with increasing Ni concentration at the cost of electronically compensated
oxygen vacancies, resulting modification in the distribution of carrier concentration which
eventually affects the band edge effective mass of conduction band electrons and further endorses
band gap renormalization. Besides that, the appearance of longitudinal optical (LO) mode at 477
cm-1 as manifested by Raman spectroscopy also indicate the active involvement of electron-phonon
scattering whereas modification in local coordination environment particularly anti-crossing
interaction in conjunction with presence of satellite features and shake-up states with Ni doping
is confirmed by X-ray absorption near-edge and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. These
results manifest the gradual reduction of orbital hybridization with Ni incorporation, leading
to decrement in the band edge effective mass of electron. Finally, molecular dynamics simulation
reflects 13% reduction in lattice parameter for NiO thin film as compared to undoped one while projected
density of states calculation further supports the experimental observation of reduced orbital
hybridization with increasing Ni concentration.
