The center of mass dynamics of cold atoms and the Bose-Einstein condensate in one dimensional optical
lattice is considered both in the absence and in the presence of external forcing. We discuss three
situations for matter waves: first, the cold atoms; second, sufficiently dilute condensate where
the dynamics are governed by the single particle wave packet dynamics; third, strong interaction
regime, where, inter-atomic interaction can no longer be ignored. The analytical formalism developed
for the two regimes, namely, deep optical lattice and shallow optical lattice. Parametric dependencies
of energy spectrum and classical period, revival time and super revival are explained for the two
regimes. The dynamics of condensate in driven optical lattice crystal are analyzed by studying
dynamical stability of the condensate. The stability is determined by the dispersion behavior
of the condensate excited in driven optical lattice. The recurrence behavior of the condensate
close to the nonlinear resonances is analyzed as a function of time for delicate recurrences which
take place for instance when lattice is weakly perturbed and robust recurrences which may manifest
themselves for sufficiently strong external driving force. The analysis is not only valid for dilute
condensate but also applicable for strongly interacting homogeneous condensate provided, the
external modulation causes no significant change in density profile of the condensate. We explain
parametric dependence of the dynamical recurrence times which can easily be realized in laboratory
experiments. In addition, we find a good agreement between the obtained analytical results and
numerical calculations. The stability of condensate is also explored in driven optical lattice
numerically.
