We consider a linear chain of quantum harmonic oscillators, in which the number of the individual
oscillators is given by an arbitrary number N, and each oscillator is coupled at an arbitrary strength
kappa to its nearest neighbors ("intra-coupling"), as well as the two end oscillators of the chain
are coupled at an arbitrary strength c_nu to two separate baths at arbitrarily different temperatures,
respectively. We derive an exact closed expression for the steady-state heat current flowing from
a hot bath through the chain to a cold bath, in the Drude-Ullersma damping model going beyond the Markovian
damping. This allows us to explore the behavior of heat current relative to the intra-coupling strength
as a control parameter, especially in pursuit of the heat power amplification. Then it turns out
that in the weak-coupling regime (kappa, c_nu << 1), the heat current is small, as expected,
and almost independent of chain length N, hence violating Fourier's law of heat conduction, which
is consistent to the result in [1] obtained within the rotating wave approximation for the intra-coupling
as well as the Born-Markov approximation for the chain-bath coupling. Beyond the weak-coupling
regime, on the other hand, we typically observe that with increase of the intra-coupling strength
the heat current is gradually amplified, and reaches its maximum value at some specific coupling
strength kappa_R "resonant" to a given chain-bath coupling strength. Also, the behavior of heat
current versus chain length appears typically in such a way that the magnitude of current reaches
its maximum with N=1 and then gradually decreases with increase of the chain length, being in fact
almost N-independent in the range of N large enough. As a result, Fourier's law proves violated also
in this regime.
