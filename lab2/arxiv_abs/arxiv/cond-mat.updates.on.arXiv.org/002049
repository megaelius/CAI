In some metals containing a sub-lattice of rare earth or actinide ions, free local $f$ spins at high
temperatures dissolve into the sea of quantum conduction electrons at low temperatures, where
they become mobile excitations. Once mobile, the spins acquire charge, forming electrons of heavy
mass, known as heavy fermions. In turn, the incorporation of heavy charges into the conduction sea
leads to an increase in the volume of the Fermi surface. This process, called Kondo scattering, is
accompanied by a dramatic, temperature dependent transformation of the electronic interactions
and masses. Since the Kondo phenomena is controlled by quantum fluctuations, here we ask, at which
point does the Fermi surface change character? A priori, the answer is not clear, since near its onset,
the Kondo effect cannot be described as a simple hybridization of electronic eigenstates. Conventional
descriptions of this Kondo scattering process consider that hybridization, Fermi volume change,
and $f$-electron mobility occur simultaneously. However, using angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy to measure the evolution of excitations, we find that the changes of the Fermi surface
emerge at temperatures an order of magnitude higher than the opening of the hybridization gap, and
two orders of magnitude higher than the onset of the coherent character of the $f$-electrons. We
suggest that the large changes in Fermi volume, driven by electronic fluctuations, occur at temperatures
where the various $\Gamma_x \to \Gamma_y$ crystal field-split $f$ levels become accessible to
conduction states of the corresponding symmetries. The separation of these energy scales significantly
modifies the conventional description of the Kondo lattice effect, which still lacks a full theoretical
description.
