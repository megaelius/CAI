The class of SPA entropies, which can be represented as an increasing continuous transformation
of Shannon and R\'enyi entropies, have intensively been studied in previous decades. Although
their mathematical structure has thoroughly been explored and established by GSK axioms, the analysis
of their thermostatistical properties have mostly been limited to special cases which belong to
two parameter Sharma-Mittal entropy class, such as Tsallis, Renyi and Gaussian entropies. In this
paper we present a general analysis of SPA entropies thermostatistics by taking into account both
linear and escort constraints on internal energy. We develop two types of dualities between the
thermostatistics formalisms. By the first one, the formalism of R\'enyi entropy is transformed
in the formalism of SPA entropy under general energy constraint and, by the second one, the generalized
thermostatistics which corresponds to the linear constraint is transformed into the one which
corresponds to the escort constraint. Thus, we establish the equivalence between four different
thermostatistics formalisms based on R\'enyi and SPA entropies coupled with linear and escort
constraints and we provide the transformation formulas. In this way we obtain a general framework
which is applicable to the wide class of entropies and constraints previously discussed in the literature.
As an example, we rederive maximum entropy distributions for Sharma-Mittal entropy and we establish
new relationships between the corresponding thermodynamic potentials. We obtain, as special
cases, previously developed expressions for maximum entropy distributions and thermodynamic
quantities for Tsallis, R\'enyi and Gaussian entropies. In addition, the results are applied for
derivation of thermostatistical relationships for supra-extensive entropy, which has not previously
been considered.
