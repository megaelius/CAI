We combine first principles density functional calculations with empirical relationships for
the Coulomb interactions in the `monomer' model of $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$. This enables us
to calculate the parameters for the model of coupled dipolar and spin degrees of freedom proposed
by Hotta [Phys. Rev. B $\textbf{82}$, 241104 (2010)], and Naka and Ishihara [J. Phys. Soc. Japan
$\textbf{79}$, 063707 (2010)]. In all materials studied, retaining only the largest interactions
leads to a transverse field Ising model of the dipoles. This quantifies, justifies and confirms
recent claims that the dipoles are of crucial importance for understanding these materials. We
show that two effects are responsible for a range of behaviors found in the dipoles in different $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$
salts. (i) The inter-dimer hopping, $t_{b1}$, which gives rise to the "transverse field" in the
Ising model for the dipoles ($H^T=2t_{b1}$), is between a third and a tenth smaller in the mercuric
materials than for the mercury-free salts. (ii) The Ising model of dipoles is in the quasi-one-dimensional
limit for the mercuric salts, but quasi-two-dimensional (between the square and isotropic triangular
limits) for the mercury-free materials. Thus, the dimensionless critical field is much smaller
in the mercuric compounds. Effect (ii) is much larger than effect (i). Simple explanations of both
effects based on the band structures of the different salts are given. We show that dipolar order
and even short-range dipolar correlations have a profound impact on the nature of the interdimer
magnetic (superexchange) interactions. For example, dipole crystallization drives the materials
towards quasi-one-dimensional magnetic interactions, which could be important for understanding
the spin liquids found in some of these materials.
