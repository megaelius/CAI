MXenes, a family of layered transition metal carbides and nitrides, have shown great promise for
use in emerging electrochemical energy storage devices, including batteries and supercapacitors.
MXene surfaces are terminated by mixed -O, -F and -OH functional groups as a result of the chemical
etching production process. These functional groups are known to be randomly distributed over
the surfaces, with limited experimental control over their composition. There is considerable
debate regarding the contribution of these functional groups to the properties of the underlying
MXene material. For instance, their measured Li or Na capacity is far lower than that predicted by
theoretical simulations, which generally assume uniformly terminated surfaces. The extent to
which this structural simplification contributes to such discrepancies is unknown. We address
this issue by employing first-principles calculations to compare the structural, electronic
and electrochemical properties of two common MXenes, namely Ti3C2Tx and V2CTx, with both uniform
terminating groups and explicitly mixed terminations. Weighted averages of uniformly-terminated
layer properties are found to give excellent approximations to those of more realistic, randomly-terminated
structures. The sodium storage capacity and volume change during sodiation in the interlayer space
of these MXenes with mixed surface terminations are also investigated. The redox reaction is shown
to be confined to the terminating groups for low concentrations of intercalated Na, with the oxidation
state of the metal atoms unaffected until higher concentrations of intercalated Na are achieved.
Finally, the average open circuit voltage is shown to be very similar for both Ti3C2T2Na and V2CT2Na
with mixed terminations, although it is highly sensitive to the particular composition of the terminating
groups.
