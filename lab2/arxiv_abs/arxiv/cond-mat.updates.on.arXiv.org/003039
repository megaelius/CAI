The attenuation of long-wavelength phonons (waves) by glassy disorder plays a central role in various
glass anomalies, yet it is neither fully characterized, nor fully understood. Of particular importance
is the scaling of the attenuation rate $\Gamma(k)$ with small wavenumbers $k\!\to\!0$ in the thermodynamic
limit of macroscopic glasses. Here we use a combination of theory and extensive computer simulations
to show that the macroscopic low-frequency behavior emerges at intermediate frequencies in finite-size
glasses, above a recently identified crossover wavenumber $k_\dagger$, where phonons are no longer
quantized into bands. For $k\!<\!k_\dagger$, finite-size effects dominate $\Gamma(k)$, which
is quantitatively described by a theory of disordered phonon bands. For $k\!>\!k_\dagger$, we
find that $\Gamma(k)$ is affected by the number of quasilocalized nonphononic excitations, a generic
signature of glasses that feature a universal density of states. In particular, we show that in a
frequency range in which this number is small, $\Gamma(k)$ follows a Rayleigh scattering scaling
$\sim\!k^{d+1}$ ($d$ is the spatial dimension), and that in a frequency range in which this number
is sufficiently large, the recently observed generalized-Rayleigh scaling of the form $\sim\!k^{d+1}\log\!{(k_0/k)}$
emerges ($k_0\!>k_\dagger$ is a characteristic wavenumber). Our results suggest that macroscopic
glasses --- and, in particular, glasses generated by conventional laboratory quenches that are
known to strongly suppress quasilocalized nonphononic excitations --- exhibit Rayleigh scaling
at the lowest wavenumbers $k$ and a crossover to generalized-Rayleigh scaling at higher $k$. Some
supporting experimental evidence from recent literature is presented.
