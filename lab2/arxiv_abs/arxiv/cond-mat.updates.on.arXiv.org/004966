We provide research findings on the physics of aerosol dispersion relevant to the hypothesized
aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We utilize physics-based modeling at different levels of
complexity, and literature on coronaviruses, to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission.
The previous literature, our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical
calculations, indicate that the typical size range of speech and cough originated droplets (d <
20microns) allows lingering in the air for O(1h) so that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the
previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up
to sizes O(100microns), into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the literature and
the public media sources, we provide evidence that the infected individuals could have been exposed
to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them in significant numbers e.g. O(100). By 3D computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we give examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols (d<20microns)
over distances O(10m) in generic environments. We study susceptible and infected individuals
in generic public places by Monte-Carlo modeling. The model accounts for the locally varying aerosol
concentration levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept,
'exposure time' to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the traditional 'safety
distance' thinking. We show that the exposure time to inhale O(100) aerosols could range from O(1s)
to O(1min) or even to O(1h) depending on the situation. The Monte Carlo analysis provides clear quantitative
insight to the exposure time in different public indoor environments.
