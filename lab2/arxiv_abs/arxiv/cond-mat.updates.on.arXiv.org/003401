Topology is a powerful recent concept asserting that quantum states could be globally protected
against local perturbations. Dissipationless topologically protected states are thus of major
fundamental interest as well as of practical importance in metrology and quantum information technology.
Although topological protection can be robust theoretically, in realistic devices it is often
fragile against various dissipative mechanisms, which are difficult to probe directly because
of their microscopic origins. By utilizing scanning nanothermometry, we visualize and investigate
microscopic mechanisms undermining the apparent topological protection in the quantum Hall state
in graphene. Our simultaneous nanoscale thermal and scanning gate microscopy shows that the dissipation
is governed by crosstalk between counterpropagating pairs of downstream and upstream channels
that appear at graphene boundaries because of edge reconstruction. Instead of local Joule heating,
however, the dissipation mechanism comprises two distinct and spatially separated processes.
The work generating process that we image directly and which involves elastic tunneling of charge
carriers between the quantum channels, determines the transport properties but does not generate
local heat. The independently visualized heat and entropy generation process, in contrast, occurs
nonlocally upon inelastic resonant scattering off single atomic defects at graphene edges, while
not affecting the transport. Our findings offer a crucial insight into the mechanisms concealing
the true topological protection and suggest venues for engineering more robust quantum states
for device applications.
