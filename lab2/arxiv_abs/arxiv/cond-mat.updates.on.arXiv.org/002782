The frustrated rare-earth pyrochlore Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is remarkable among magnetic materials:
despite a ferromagnetically ordered ground state it exhibits a broad, nearly gapless, continuum
of excitations. This broad continuum connects smoothly to the sharp one-magnon excitations expected,
and indeed observed, at high magnetic fields, raising the question: how does this picture of sharp
magnons break down as the field is lowered? In this paper, we consider the effects of magnon interactions
in Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, showing that their inclusion greatly extends the reach of spin-wave theory.
First, we show that magnon interactions shift the phase boundary between the (splayed) ferromagnet
(SFM) and the antiferromagnetic $\Gamma_5$ phase so that Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ lies very close to
it. Next, we show how the high-field limit connects to lower fields; this includes corrections to
the critical fields for the $[111]$ and $[1\bar{1}0]$ directions, bringing them closer to the observed
experimental values, as well as accounting for the departures from linear spin wave theory that
appear in $[001]$ applied fields below 3 T [Thompson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 057203 (2017)].
Turning to low-fields, though the extent of the experimentally observed broadening is not quite
reproduced, we find a rough correspondence between non-linear spin-wave theory and inelastic
neutron scattering data on both a single-crystal sample, as well as on a powder sample [Pe\c{c}anha-Antonio
et al., Phys. Rev. B, 96, 214415 (2017)]. We conclude with an outlook on implications for future experimental
and theoretical work on Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and related materials, highlighting the importance
of proximity to the splayed ferromagnet-$\Gamma_5$ phase boundary and its potential role in intrinsic
or extrinsic explanations of the low-field physics of Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.
