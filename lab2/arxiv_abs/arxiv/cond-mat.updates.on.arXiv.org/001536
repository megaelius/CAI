In addition to the self-governing properties, tiny-sized particles of metallic colloids are the
building blocks of large-sized particles. Thus, their study has been the subject of many publications.
A tiny particle developed at solution surface or inside the solution depends on the attained dynamics
of atoms where different mechanism of binding involved. A monolayer assembly enabled three-dimensional
structure of tiny particle when packet of nano energy placed to bind certain transition state atoms.
Atoms of each one-dimensional arrays of tiny particle elongated under the exertion of surface format
force, thus, converted into structure of smooth elements. At solution surface, impinging electron
streams at fixed angle results into further elongate the elongated atoms of tiny particle as per
exerting force. Where photons of adequate forcing energy traveled aside to elongated atoms, they
further acquired shaping of smooth elements. Amalgamated gold atoms where maintained neutral
state as per suitable amount of heat energy, they bound in tiny particle under the execution of confined
inter-state dynamics of electrons. Thus, those atoms do not require to uplift at solution surface
for undertaking a certain transition state and bind into tiny particle under the packet of nano shape
energy. Gold atoms evolve the mix dimension structure of a tiny particle while attained dynamics
inside the solution or near the interface. A tiny particle of gold evolves structure of original
format and dimension if attained dynamics of atoms remained uniform followed execution of electron-dynamics
under appropriate coincide. This study highlights the fundamental process of formation of tiny
particles under different transition of electrons and localized dynamics of gold atoms. Such a
tool of processing materials opens several possibilities to develop engineered materials with
specific properties.
