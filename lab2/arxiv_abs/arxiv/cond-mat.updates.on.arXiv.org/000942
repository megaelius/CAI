In the present study we are performing simulation of simple model of two patch colloidal particles
undergoing irreversible diffusion limited cluster aggregation using patchy Brownian cluster
dynamics. In addition to the irreversible aggregation of patches, the spheres are coupled with
isotropic reversible aggregation through the Kern-Frenkel potential. Due to the presence of anisotropic
and isotropic potential we have also defined 3 different kinds of clusters formed due to anisotropic
potential and isotropic potential only as well as both the potentials together. We have investigated
the effect of patch size on self-assembly under different solvent qualities for various volume
fractions. We will show that at low volume fractions during aggregation process, we end up in a chain
conformation for smaller patch size while in a globular conformation for bigger patch size. We also
observed a chain to bundle transformation depending on the attractive interaction strength between
the chains or in other words depending on the quality of the solvent. We will also show that bundling
process is very similar to nucleation and growth phenomena observed in colloidal system with short
range attraction. We have also studied the bond angle distribution for this system, where for small
patches only 2 angles are more probable indicating chain formation, while for bundling at very low
volume fraction a tail is developed in the distribution. While for the case of higher patch angle
this distribution is broad compared to the case of low patch angles showing we have a more globular
conformation. We are also proposing a model for the formation of bundles which are similar to amyloid
fibers using two patch colloidal particles.
