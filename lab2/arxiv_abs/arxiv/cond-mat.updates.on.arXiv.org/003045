A palladium-based (Pd-based) core@shell catalyst can be modified to achieve the desired oxygen
adsorption properties by selecting an appropriate core composition, surface alloying, and compressive
strain. Herein, we present the effects of compressive strain, core composition, and surface alloying
in Pd3Ni@PdIr(111), Pd3CuNi@PdIr(111), and Pd3Cu@PdIr(111) alloy-core@alloy-shell catalysts
on dioxygen adsorption. Using experimental lattice parameters for the unstrained catalysts,
-1% to -5%, the strain was systematically introduced. The calculated dioxygen-adsorption energies
for the surface Pd and surface Ir atoms reveal that the Pd3CuNi@PdIr catalyst has the lowest dioxygen-adsorption
energy at a given compressive strain. Bader charge calculations show that the Pd3CuNi@PdIr catalyst
surface is the most charge depleted. The d-band model displays an intermediate d-band center downshift
for the surface Pd atoms, and the highest downshift for the surface Ir atoms. Due to synergism between
charge depletion, the d-band center shift, and the surface alloy effect, the Pd3CuNi@PdIr catalyst
has the lowest dioxygen-adsorption energy. The relationship between the experimentally obtained
catalyst-surface mass activity and the theoretically calculated d-band center of the surface
Pd and the surface Ir is volcano shaped, with the Pd3CuNi@PdIr catalyst at the apex of the volcano.
The catalytic activities of these catalysts were observed to follow the order: Pd3CuNi@PdIr > Pd3Cu@PdIr
> Pd3Ni@PdIr. This work sheds light on the importance of ligand and strain effects, as well as surface
alloying for the fine-tuning of alloy-core@alloy-shell-catalysts during the rational design
of catalysts from first principles.
