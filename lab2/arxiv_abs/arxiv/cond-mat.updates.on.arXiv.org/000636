Interest in finite-size systems has risen in the last decades, due to the focus on nanotechnological
applications and because they are convenient for numerical treatment that can subsequently be
extrapolated to infinite lattices. Independently of the envisioned application, special attention
must be given to boundary condition, which may or may not preserve the symmetry of the infinite lattice.
Here we present a detailed study of the compatibility between boundary conditions and conservation
laws. The conflict between open boundary conditions and momentum conservation is well understood,
but we examine other symmetries, as well: we discuss gauge invariance, inversion, spin, and particle-hole
symmetry and their compatibility with open, periodic, and twisted boundary conditions. We develop
the reasoning in the framework of the one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model, whose Hamiltonian
displays a variety of symmetries. Our discussion includes analytical and numerical results. Our
analytical survey shows that boundary conditions break one or more symmetries of the infinite-lattice
Hamiltonian. The exception is twisted boundary condition with the special torsion $\Theta=\pi
L/2$, where $L$ is the lattice size. Our numerical results for the ground-state energy at half-filling
and the energy gap for $L=2$--$7$ show how the breaking of symmetry affects the convergence to the
$L\to\infty$ limit. We compare the computed energies and gaps with the exact results for the infinite
lattice drawn from the Bethe-Ansatz solution. The deviations are boundary-condition dependent.
The special torsion yields more rapid convergence than open or periodic boundary conditions. For
sizes as small as $L=7$, the numerical results for twisted condition are very close to the $L\to\infty$
limit. We also discuss the ground-state electronic density and magnetization at half filling under
the three boundary conditions.
