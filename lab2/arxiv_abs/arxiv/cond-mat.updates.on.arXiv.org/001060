Metamaterials (MMs), i.e. artificial media designed to achieve properties not available in natural
materials, have been the focus of intense research during the last two decades. Many properties
have been discovered and multiple designs have been devised that lead to multiple conceptual and
practical applications. Superconducting MMs have the advantage of ultra low losses, a highly desirable
feature. The additional use of the Josephson effect and SQUID configurations produce further specificity
and functionality. SQUID-based MMs are both theoretically investigated but also fabricated and
analyzed experimentally in many labs and exciting new phenomena have been found both in the classical
and quantum realms. The SQUID is a unique nonlinear oscillator that can be manipulated through multiple
external means. This flexibility is inherited to SQUID-based MMs, i.e. extended units that contain
a large arrangement of SQUIDs. Such an assembly of weakly coupled nonlinear oscillators presents
a nonlinear dynamics laboratory where numerous complex spatio-temporal phenomena may be explored.
We focus primarily on SQUID-based MMs and present basic properties related to their individual
and collective responses to external drives. We start by showing how a SQUID-based system acts as
a genuine MM, demonstrate that the Josephson nonlinearity leads to wide-band tunability, intrinsic
nonlinear as well as flat band localization. We explore further properties such as multistability
and self-organization and the emergence of chimera states. We then dwell into the truly quantum
regime and explore the interaction of electromagnetic pulses with superconducting qubits where
the coupling between the two yields self-induced transparency and superradiance. We thus attempt
to present the rich behavior of coupled superconducting units and point to their basic properties
and practical utility.
