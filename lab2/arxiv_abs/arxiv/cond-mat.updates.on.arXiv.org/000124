Anyon systems are studied in connection with several interesting applications including high
$T_C$ superconductivity and topological quantum computing. In this work we show that these systems
can be realized starting from directed polymers braided together to form a nontrivial link configuration
belonging to the topological class of plats. The statistical sum of a such plat is related here to
the partition function of a two-component anyon gas. The constraints that preserve the topological
configuration of the plat are imposed on the polymer trajectories using the so-called Gauss linking
number, a topological invariant that has already been well studied in polymer physics. Due to these
constraints, short-range forces act on the monomers or, equivalently, on the anyon quasiparticles
in a way that closely resembles the appearance of reaction forces in the constrained systems of classical
mechanics. If the polymers are homogeneous, the anyon system reaches a self-dual point, in which
these forces vanish exactly. A class of self-dual solutions that minimize the energy of the anyons
is derived. The two anyon gas discussed here obeys an abelian statistics, while for quantum computing
it is known that nonabelian anyons are necessary. However, this is a limitation due to the use of the
Gauss linking invariant to impose the topological constraints, which is a poor topological invariant
and is thus unable to capture the nonabelian characteristics of the braided polymer chains. A more
refined treatment of the topological constraints would require more sophisticated topological
invariants, but so far their application to the statistical mechanics of linked polymers is an open
problem.
