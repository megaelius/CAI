We study the quantum phases driven by interaction in a semimetal with a quadratic band touching at
the Fermi level. By combining the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), analytical power
expanded Gibbs potential method, and the weak coupling renormalization group, we study a spinless
fermion system on a checkerboard lattice at half-filling, which has a quadratic band touching in
the absence of interaction. In the presence of strong nearest-neighbor ($V_1$) and next-nearest-neighbor
($V_2$) interactions, we identify a site nematic insulator phase, a stripe insulator phase, and
a phase separation region, in agreement with the phase diagram obtained analytically in the strong
coupling limit (i.e. in the absence of fermion hopping). In the intermediate interaction regime,
we establish a quantum anomalous Hall phase in the DMRG as evidenced by the spontaneous time-reversal
symmetry breaking and the appearance of a quantized Chern number $C = 1$. For weak interaction, we
utilize the power expanded Gibbs potential method that treats $V_1$ and $V_2$ on equal footing,
as well as the weak coupling renormalization group. Our analytical results reveal that not only
the repulsive $V_1$ interaction, but also the $V_2$ interaction (both repulsive and attractive),
can drive the quantum anomalous Hall phase. We also determine the phase boundary in the $V_1$-$V_2$
plane that separates the semimetal from the quantum anomalous Hall state. Finally, we show that
the nematic semimetal, which was proposed for $|V_2| \gg V_1$ at weak coupling in a previous study,
is absent, and the quantum anomalous Hall state is the only weak coupling instability of the spinless
quadratic band touching semimetal.
