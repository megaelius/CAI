The influence of spin and charge fluctuations on spectra of the two-dimensional fermionic Hubbard
model is considered using the strong coupling diagram technique. Infinite sequences of diagrams
containing ladder inserts, which describe the interaction of electrons with these fluctuations,
are summed, and obtained equations are self-consistently solved for the ranges of Hubbard repulsions
$2t\leq U\leq 10t$, temperatures $0.2t\lesssim T\lesssim t$ and electron concentrations $0.7\lesssim\bar{n}\leq1$
with $t$ the intersite hopping constant. For all considered $U$ the system exhibits a transition
to the long-range antiferromagnetic order at $T_{\rm AF}\approx 0.2t$. At the same time no indication
of charge ordering is observed. Obtained solutions agree satisfactorily with results of other
approaches and obey moments sum rules. In the considered region of the $U$-$T$ plane, the curve separating
metallic solutions passes from $U\approx6t$ at the highest temperatures to $U=2t$ at $T\approx
T_{\rm AF}$ for half-filling. If only short-range fluctuations are allowed for the remaining part
of this region is occupied by insulating solutions. Taking into account long-range fluctuations
leads to strengthening of maxima tails, which transform a part of insulating solutions into bad-metal
states. For low $T$, obtained results allow us to trace the gradual transition from the regime of
strong correlations with the pronounced four-band structure and well-defined Mott gap for $U\gtrsim6t$
to the Slater regime of weak correlations with the spectral intensity having a dip along the boundary
of the magnetic Brillouin zone due to an antiferromagnetic ordering for $U\lesssim3t$. For $T\approx
T_{\rm AF}$ and $U\gtrsim 7t$ doping leads to the occurrence of a pseudogap near the Fermi level,
which is a consequence of the splitting out of a narrow band from a Hubbard subband.
