We investigate thermodynamic and structural properties of colloidal dumbbells in the framework
provided by the Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) theory of molecular fluids and Monte Carlo
simulations. We consider two different models: in the first one we set identical square-well attractions
on the two tangent spheres composing the molecule (SW-SW model); in the second scheme, one of square-well
interactions is switched off (HS-SW model). Appreciable differences emerge between the physical
properties of the two models. Specifically, the $k \to 0$ behavior of SW-SW structure factors $S(k)$
points to the presence of a gas-liquid coexistence, as confirmed by subsequent fluid phase equilibria
calculations. Conversely, the HS-SW $S(k)$ develops a low-$k$ peak, signaling the presence of
aggregates; such a process destabilizes the gas-liquid phase separation, promoting at low temperatures
the formation of a cluster phase, whose structure depends on the system density. We further investigate
such differences by studying the phase behavior of a series of intermediate models, obtained from
the original SW-SW by progressively reducing the depth of one square-well interaction. RISM structural
predictions positively reproduce the simulation data, including the rise of $S(k \to 0$) in the
SW-SW model and the low-$k$ peak in the HS-SW structure factor. As for the phase behavior, RISM agrees
with Monte Carlo simulations in predicting a gas-liquid coexistence for the SW-SW model (though
the critical parameters appears overestimated by the theory) and its progressive disappearance
moving toward the HS-SW model.
