We study the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with a disordered potential of the form $V
(x) = \phi(x)^2+\phi'(x) + \kappa(x) $ where $\phi(x)$ is a Gaussian white noise with mean $\mu g$
and variance $g$, and $\kappa(x)$ is a random superposition of delta functions distributed uniformly
on the real line with mean density $\rho$ and mean strength $v$. Our study is motivated by the close
connection between this problem and classical diffusion in a random environment (the Sinai problem)
in the presence of random absorbers~: $\phi(x)$ models the force field acting on the diffusing particle
and $\kappa(x)$ models the absorption properties of the medium in which the diffusion takes place.
The focus is on the calculation of the complex Lyapunov exponent $ \Omega(E) = \gamma(E) - \mathrm{i}
\pi N(E) $, where $N$ is the integrated density of states per unit length and $\gamma$ the reciprocal
of the localisation length. By using the continuous version of the Dyson-Schmidt method, we find
an exact formula, in terms of a Hankel function, in the particular case where the strength of the delta
functions is exponentially-distributed with mean $v=2g$. Building on this result, we then solve
the general case -- in the low-energy limit -- in terms of an infinite sum of Hankel functions. Our
main result, valid without restrictions on the parameters of the model, is that the integrated density
of states exhibits the power law behaviour $$ N(E) \underset{E\to0+}{\sim} E^\nu \hspace{0.5cm}
\mbox{where } \nu=\sqrt{\mu^2+2\rho/g}\:. $$ This confirms and extends several results obtained
previously by approximate methods.
