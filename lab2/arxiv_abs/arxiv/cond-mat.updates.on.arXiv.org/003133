Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) has been extensively used to study thermal transport
at various length scales in many materials. In this method, two local thermostats at different temperatures
are used to generate a nonequilibrium steady state with a constant heat flux. Conventionally, the
thermal conductivity of a finite system is calculated as the ratio between the heat flux and the temperature
gradient extracted from the linear part of the temperature profile away from the local thermostats.
Here we show that, with a proper choice of the thermostat, the nonlinear part of the temperature profile
should actually not be excluded in thermal transport calculations. We compare NEMD results against
those from the atomistic Green's function method in the ballistic regime, and those from the homogeneous
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method in the ballistic-to-diffusive regime. These comparisons
suggest that in all the transport regimes, one should directly calculate the thermal conductance
from the temperature difference between the heat source and sink and, if needed, convert it to the
thermal conductivity by multiplying it with the system length. Furthermore, we find that the Langevin
thermostat outperforms the Nos\'{e}-Hoover (chain) thermostat in NEMD simulations because of
its stochastic and local nature. We show that this is particularly important for studying asymmetric
carbon-based nanostructures, for which the Nos\'{e}-Hoover thermostat can produce artifacts
leading to unphysical thermal rectification. Our findings are important to obtain correct results
from molecular dynamics simulations of nanoscale heat transport as the accuracy of the interatomic
potentials is rapidly improving.
