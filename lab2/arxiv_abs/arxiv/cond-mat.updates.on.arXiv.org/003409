Wannier90 is an open-source computer program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions
(MLWFs) from a set of Bloch states. It is interfaced to many widely used electronic-structure codes
thanks to its independence from the basis sets representing these Bloch states. In the past few years
the development of Wannier90 has transitioned to a community-driven model; this has resulted in
a number of new developments that have been recently released in Wannier90 v3.0. In this article
we describe these new functionalities, that include the implementation of new features for wannierisation
and disentanglement (symmetry-adapted Wannier functions, selectively-localised Wannier functions,
selected columns of the density matrix) and the ability to calculate new properties (shift currents
and Berry-curvature dipole, and a new interface to many-body perturbation theory); performance
improvements, including parallelisation of the core code; enhancements in functionality (support
for spinor-valued Wannier functions, more accurate methods to interpolate quantities in the Brillouin
zone); improved usability (improved plotting routines, integration with high-throughput automation
frameworks), as well as the implementation of modern software engineering practices (unit testing,
continuous integration, and automatic source-code documentation). These new features, capabilities,
and code development model aim to further sustain and expand the community uptake and range of applicability,
that nowadays spans complex and accurate dielectric, electronic, magnetic, optical, topological
and transport properties of materials.
