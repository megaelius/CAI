Cracks, the major vehicle for material failure, tend to accelerate to high velocities in brittle
materials. In three-dimensions, cracks generically undergo a micro-branching instability at
about 40% of their sonic limiting velocity. Recent experiments showed that in sufficiently thin
systems cracks unprecedentedly accelerate to nearly their limiting velocity without micro-branching,
until they undergo an oscillatory instability. Despite their fundamental importance and apparent
similarities to other instabilities in condensed-matter physics and materials science, these
dynamic fracture instabilities remain poorly understood. They are not described by the classical
theory of cracks, which assumes that linear elasticity is valid inside a stressed material and uses
an extraneous local symmetry criterion to predict crack paths. Here we develop a model of two-dimensional
dynamic brittle fracture capable of predicting arbitrary paths of ultra-high-speed cracks in
the presence of elastic nonlinearity without extraneous criteria. We show, by extensive computations,
that cracks undergo a dynamic oscillatory instability controlled by small-scale elastic nonlinearity
near the crack tip. This instability occurs above a ultra-high critical velocity and features an
intrinsic wavelength that increases proportionally to the ratio of the fracture energy to an elastic
modulus, in quantitative agreement with experiments. This ratio emerges as a fundamental scaling
length assumed to play no role in the classical theory of cracks, but shown here to strongly influence
crack dynamics. Those results pave the way for resolving other long-standing puzzles in the failure
of materials.
