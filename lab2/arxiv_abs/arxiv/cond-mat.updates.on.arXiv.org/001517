We carry out both the tight-binding model and the $ab\ initio$ to study the layered silicene, the
spin, valley, sublattice degrees of freedom are taken into consider and the effects of electric
field, magnetic field, and even the light in finite frequency together with its interesting optical
propertice, which are all closely related to the spin-orbit coupling and Rashba coupling and lead
to the tunable phase transitions (between the nontrivial topological phase which has nonzero Chern
number or nonzero spin Chern number and the trivial phase). An exotic quantum anomalous Hall insulator
phase are found which has nonzero spin Chern number and nonzero valley Chern number and as a giant-application-potential
spintronic and valleytronics in the two-ternimate devices based on the monolayer silicene for
the information transmission. In fact, the gap-out action can be understanded by analyse the Dirac
mass as well as the Zeeman splitting or the external-field-induced symmetry-broken, and the changes
of gap has a general nonmonotone-variation characteristic under both the effects of electron filed-induced
Rashba-coupling $R_{2}(E_{\perp})$ and the electron field-induced band gap, and the band inversion
related to the spin-orbit coupling which absorbs both the spin and orbital angular of momentum may
happen during this process. The quantized Hall/longitudinal conductivity together with the optical
conductivity are also explored, we see that even in the quantum spin Hall phase without any magnetic
field, the two-terminate conductivity can be reduced to the value $e^{2}/h$ by controlling the
helical edge model, and it can be further reduced to $e^{2}/2h$ by applying the magnetic field which
similar to the graphene.
