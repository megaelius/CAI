We present a detailed quantitative analysis of spectral correlations in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
(SYK) model. We find that the deviations from universal Random Matrix Theory (RMT) behavior are
due to a small number of long-wavelength fluctuations from one realization of the ensemble to the
next one. These modes can be parameterized effectively in terms of Q-Hermite orthogonal polynomials,
the main contribution being the scale fluctuations for which we give a simple estimate. Our numerical
results for $N=32$ show that only the lowest eight polynomials are needed to eliminate the nonuniversal
part of the spectral fluctuations. The covariance matrix of the coefficients of this expansion
is obtained analytically from low-order double-trace moments. We evaluate the covariance matrix
of the first six moments and find that it agrees with the numerics. We also analyze the spectral correlation
using a nonlinear $\sigma$-model, which is derived through a Fierz transformation, and evaluate
the one and two-point spectral correlator to two-loop order. The wide correlator is given by the
sum of the universal RMT result and corrections whose lowest-order term corresponds to scale fluctuations.
However, the loop expansion of the $\sigma$-model results in an ill-behaved expansion of the resolvent,
and it gives universal RMT fluctuations not only for $q=4$ but also for the $q=2$ SYK model while the
correct result in this case should have been Poisson statistics. We analyze the number variance
and spectral form factor for $N=32$ and $q=4$ numerically. We show that the quadratic deviation
of the number variance for large energies appears as a peak for small times in the spectral form factor.
After eliminating the long-wavelength fluctuations, we find quantitative agreement with RMT
up to an exponentially large number of level spacings or exponentially short times, respectively.
