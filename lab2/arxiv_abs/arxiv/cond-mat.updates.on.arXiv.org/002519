Memory behavior of fast ion conducting AgI-Ag2O-MoO3 glasses, over a wide range of compositions
within the glass forming region, proportioning a balance between glass matrix former (MoO3) and
glass matrix expander (AgI), has been scrutinized thoroughly to understand the switching mechanism
of bulk samples with inert electrode. The ion transport, the agility to reach the threshold voltage
(Vth), Vth - composition (x) profile and thickness dependence of Vth have been explained in the lights
of Mott-Gurney model for electric field driven thermally activated ion hopping. A feature of alteration
in memory behavior from reversible to irreversible, due to change in electrode type from active
to passive has been observed and discussed. Being a decoupled system, Vth - x profile exhibits a seemingly
scattered nature while glass transition temperature (Tg) - x profile is monotonically increasing,
indicating growing network connectivity. Besides, these two profiles together narrow down the
composition region where the most thermally stable, with minimum power loss and fast switching
performing samples lie. During switching, a metallic filament forms between two electrodes. Raman
and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy study find no traces of molybdenum, oxygen and electrode
material in the filament. Scanning electron microscopy image shows bubble formation in the vicinity
of anode - electrolyte interface which is analogous to oxidation reaction but no evidence of anionic
transport has been found. This in turns helps us to understand the corrosion mechanism in the glass
matrix due to the electrochemical process. Overall, the focus of this research work is to understand
some crucial issues regarding the memory behavior of this specific material to enable us to exploit
the material for further development in the non-volatile memory technology.
