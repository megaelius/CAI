We compute the $K$ and $L_{3}$ -edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectrum of the
columnar and the staggered quantum dimer states accessible to the square lattice Heisenberg magnet.
Utilizing a bond operator representation mean field theory we investigate the RIXS features of
the one- and two-triplon excitation spectrum supported by the quantum dimer model in the background
of condensed singlet excitation. We find that the two-triplon excitation boundary lies within
a 124 (78) meV to (414) 345 meV energy range for the columnar (staggered) phase. We estimated the two-triplon
gap to be 124 (78) meV for the columnar (staggered) dimer phase. The highest intensity of the $K$ -edge
RIXS spectrum is centralized approximately around the $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ point for both the columnar
and the staggered phases. At the $L_{3}$ -edge we study the one- and two- triplon signal considering
experimental scattering geometry, polarization restriction, and experimental resolution effects.
Our calculations find an additional contribution to the two-triplon RIXS signal, not previously
reported in the literature, that originates from the local hard-core dimer constraint. This leads
to a finite non-zero signal at the (0,0) momentum transfer which can offer an explanation for the
existing ladder RIXS experiments and also predicts a non-zero signal for the two-dimensional quantum
dimer system. We find that the $L_3$ edge RIXS response of the one- and two-triplon signal could exist
in antiphase rung modulation for zero and $\pi$ as found in inelastic neutron scattering. We also
consider static crystal twinning at the $L_3$ -edge RIXS signal to mimic realistic crystal effects.
Since the disordered phase has the potential to harbor a variety of quantum paramagnetic states,
our RIXS calculations provide useful signatures to identify the true nature of the ordering pattern.
