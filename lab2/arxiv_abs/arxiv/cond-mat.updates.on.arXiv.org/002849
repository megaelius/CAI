Through molecular dynamics simulations, we examined hydrodynamic behavior of the Brownian motion
of fullerene particles based on molecular interactions. The solvation free energy and the velocity
autocorrelation function (VACF) were calculated by using the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen
(WCA) potentials for the solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions and by changing the
size of the fullerene particles. We also measured the diffusion constant of the fullerene particles
and the shear viscosity of the host fluid, and then the hydrodynamic radius $a_\mathrm{HD}$ was
quantified from the Stokes-Einstein relation. The $a_\mathrm{HD}$ value exceeds that of the gyration
radius of the fullerene when the solvation free energy exhibits largely negative values using the
LJ potential. In contrast, $a_\mathrm{HD}$ becomes comparable to the size of bare fullerene, when
the solvation free energy is positive using the WCA potential. Furthermore, the VACF of the fullerene
particles is directly comparable with the analytical expressions utilizing the Navier-Stokes
equations both in incompressible and compressible forms. Hydrodynamic long-time tail $t^{-3/2}$
is demonstrated for timescales longer than the kinematic time of the momentum diffusion over the
particles' size. However, the VACF in shorter timescales deviates from the hydrodynamic description,
particularly for smaller fullerene particles and for the LJ potential. This occurs even though
the compressible effect is considered when characterizing the decay of VACF around the sound propagation
time scale over the particles' size. These results indicate that the nanoscale Brownian motion
is influenced by the solvation structure around the solute particles originating from the molecular
interaction.
