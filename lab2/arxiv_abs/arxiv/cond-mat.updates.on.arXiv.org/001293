A fundamental motif in frustrated magnetism is the fully mutually coupled cluster of $N$ spins,
with each spin coupled to every other spin. Clusters with $N=2$ and $3$ have been extensively studied
as building blocks of square and triangular lattice antiferromagnets. In both cases, large-$S$
semiclassical descriptions have been fruitfully constructed, providing insights into the physics
of macroscopic magnetic systems. Here, we develop a semiclassical theory for the $N=4$ cluster.
This problem has rich mathematical structure with a ground state space that has non-trivial topology.
We show that the ground states are appropriately parametrized by a unit vector order parameter and
a rotation matrix. Remarkably, in the low energy description, the physics of the cluster reduces
to that of an emergent free spin-$S$ spin and a rigid rotor. This successfully explains the spectrum
of the quadrumer and its associated degeneracies. However, this mapping does not hold in the vicinity
of collinear ground states due to a subtle effect that arises from the non-manifold nature of the
ground state space. We demonstrate this by an analysis of soft fluctuations, showing that collinear
states have a larger number of soft modes. Nevertheless, as these singularities only occur on a subset
of measure zero, the mapping to a spin and a rotor provides a good description of the quadrumer. We
interpret thermodynamic properties of the quadrumer that are accessible in molecular magnets,
in terms of the rotor and spin degrees of freedom. Our study paves the way for field theoretic descriptions
of systems such as pyrochlore magnets.
