Novel two-dimensional (2D) emergent fermions and negative Poisson's ratio in 2D materials are
fascinating subjects of research. Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical
analysis, we predict that the hexacoordinated Mg$_{2}$C monolayer hosts both exotic properties.
We analyze its phonon spectrum, reveal the Raman active modes, and show that it has small in-plane
stiffness constants. Particularly, under the tensile strain in the zigzag direction, the Mg$_{2}$C
monolayer shows an intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio $\sim -0.023$, stemming from its unique
puckered hinge structure. The material is metallic at its equilibrium state. A moderate biaxial
strain can induce a metal-semimetal-semiconductor phase transition, during which several novel
types of 2D fermions emerge, including the anisotropic Dirac fermions around 12 tilted Dirac points
in the metallic phase, the $2$D double Weyl fermions in the semimetal phase where the conduction
and valence bands touch quadratically at a single Fermi point, and the 2D pseudospin-1 fermions
at the critical point of the semimetal-semiconductor phase transition where three bands cross
at a single point on the Fermi level. In addition, uniaxial strains along the high-symmetry directions
break the three-fold rotational symmetry and reduce the number of Dirac points. Interestingly,
it also generates 2D type-II Dirac points. We construct effective models to characterize the properties
of these novel fermions. Our result reveals Mg$_{2}$C monolayer as an intriguing platform for the
study of novel 2D fermions, and also suggests its great potential for nanoscale device applications.
