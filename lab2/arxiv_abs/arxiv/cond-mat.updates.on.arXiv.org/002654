Crystalline materials at elevated temperatures and pressures can exhibit properties more reminiscent
of simple liquids than ideal crystalline materials. Superionic crystalline materials having
a liquid-like conductivity {\sigma} are particularly interesting for battery, fuel cell, and
other energy applications, and we study UO2 as a prototypical superionic material since this material
is widely studied given its commercial importance as reactor fuel. Using molecular dynamics, we
first investigate basic thermodynamic and structural properties. We then quantify structural
relaxation, dynamic heterogeneity, and average ions mobility. We find that the non-Arrhenius
diffusion and structural relaxation time of this prototypical superionic material can be quantitatively
described in terms of a generalized activated transport model ('string model') in which the activation
energy varies in direct proportion to the average string length. Our transport data can also be described
equally well by an Adam-Gibbs model in which the excess entropy density of the crystalline material
is estimated from specific heat and thermal expansion data, consistent with the average scale of
string-like collective motion scaling inversely with the excess entropy of the crystal. Strong
differences in the temperature dependence of the interfacial mobility from non-ionic materials
are observed, and we suggest that this difference is due to the relatively high cohesive interaction
of ionic materials. In summary, the study of superionic UO2 provides insight into the role of cooperative
motion in enhancing ion mobility in ionic materials and offers design principles for the development
of new superionic materials for use in diverse energy applications.
