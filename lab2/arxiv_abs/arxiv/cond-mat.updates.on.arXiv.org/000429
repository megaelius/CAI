\emph{Ab-initio} calculations were performed on the scheelite type MGeO$_4$ (M = Hf, and Zr) compounds
which find wide range of applications such as in x-ray imaging. We have studied the high pressure
structural stability, elastic constants, electronic structure and optical properties of these
compounds through density functional theory calculations. Two different density functional
approaches namely plane wave pseudopotential method (PW-PP) and full potential linearized augmented
plane wave method (FP-LAPW) were used for the present study. The ground state structural and vibrational
properties are calculated and found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The compressibility
of Zr and Hf germanates is found to be anisotropic as the a-axis is less compressible over c-axis due
to the presence of Ge-O bonds along a-axis which is further confirmed from the ordering of the elastic
constants that follows C$_{11}$ $>$ C$_{33}$. The electronic structure of the compounds has
been calculated through recently developed Tran Blaha-modified Becke Johnson potential. The
calculated electronic structure shows that the compounds are insulators with a gap of 5.39 eV for
ZrGeO$_4$ and 6.25 eV for HfGeO$_4$ respectively. Optical anisotropy of these compounds are revealed
from the computed optical properties such as complex dielectric function, refractive index, and
absorption coefficient. In addition, it is observed that Ti doped ZrGeO$_4$ and HfGeO$_4$ turns
out to be a good phosphor as the pristine compounds have the energy gap greater than the visible range
upon Ti doping bandgap reduces as a result emission spectra occurs in the visible region and is well
explained in the present study.
