We perform a systematic analysis of the influence of phonon driving on the superconducting Holstein
model coupled to heat baths by studying both the transient dynamics and the nonequilibrium steady
state (NESS) in the weak and strong electron-phonon coupling regimes. Our study is based on the nonequilibrium
dynamical mean-field theory, and for the NESS we present a Floquet formulation adapted to electron-phonon
systems. The analysis of the phonon propagator suggests that the effective attractive interaction
can be strongly enhanced in a parametric resonant regime because of the Floquet side bands of phonons.
While this may be expected to enhance the superconductivity (SC), our fully self-consistent calculations,
which include the effects of heating and nonthermal distributions, show that the parametric phonon
driving generically results in a suppression or complete melting of the SC order. In the strong coupling
regime, the NESS always shows a suppression of the SC gap, the SC order parameter and the superfluid
density as a result of the driving, and this tendency is most prominent at the parametric resonance.
Using the real-time nonequilibrium DMFT formalism, we also study the dynamics towards the NESS,
which shows that the heating effect dominates the transient dynamics, and SC is weakened by the external
modulations, in particular at the parametric resonance. In the weak coupling regime, we find that
the SC fluctuations above the transition temperature are generally weakened under the driving.
The strongest suppression occurs again around the parametric resonances because of the efficient
energy absorption.
