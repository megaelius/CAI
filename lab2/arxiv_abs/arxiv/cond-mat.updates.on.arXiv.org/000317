The classical $n$-vector $\phi^4$ model with $O(n)$ symmetrical Hamiltonian ${\cal H}$ is considered
in a $\infty^2\times L$ slab geometry bounded by a pair of parallel free surface planes at separation
$L$. The temperature-dependent scaling functions of the excess free energy and the thermodynamic
Casimir force are computed in the large-$n$ limit for temperatures $T$ at, above, and below the bulk
critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$. Their $n=\infty$ limits can be expressed exactly in terms of
the eigensystem of a self-consistent one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. This equation
is solved by numerical means for two distinct discretized versions of the model: in the first ("model
A"), only the coordinate $z$ across the slab is discretized and the integrations over momenta conjugate
to the lateral coordinates are regularized dimensionally; in the second ("model B"), a simple cubic
lattice with periodic boundary conditions along the lateral directions is used. Renormalization-group
ideas are invoked to show that, in addition to corrections to scaling $\propto L^{-1}$, anomalous
ones $\propto L^{-1}\ln L$ should occur. They can be considerably decreased by taking an appropriate
$g\to\infty$ ($T_{\rm c}\to\infty$) limit of the $\phi^4$ interaction constant $g$. Depending
on the model A or B, they can be absorbed completely or to a large extent in an effective thickness $L_{\rm
eff}=L+\delta L$. Excellent data collapses and consistent high-precision results for both models
are obtained. The approach to the low-temperature Goldstone values of the scaling functions is
shown to involve logarithmic anomalies. The scaling functions exhibit all qualitative features
seen in experiments on the thinning of wetting layers of ${}^4$He and Monte Carlo simulations of
$XY$ models, including a pronounced minimum of the Casimir force below $T_{\rm c}$.
