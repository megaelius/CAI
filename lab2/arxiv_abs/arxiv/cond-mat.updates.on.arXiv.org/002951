We introduce a model based on the one-dimensional nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLSE) with
the critical (quintic) or supercritical self-focusing nonlinearity. We demonstrate that a family
of solitons, which are unstable in this setting against collapse, is stabilized by pinning to an
attractive defect, that may also include a parity-time (PT)-symmetric gain-loss component. The
model can be realized as a planar waveguide in optics, and in a super-Tonks-Girardeau bosonic gas.
For the attractive defect with the delta-functional profile, a full family of the pinned solitons
is found in an exact form. In the absence of the gain-loss term, the solitons' stability is investigated
analytically too, by means of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion; in the presence of the PT-balanced
gain and loss, the stability is explored by means of numerical methods. In particular, the entire
family of pinned solitons is stable in the quintic medium if the gain-loss term is absent. A stability
region for the pinned solitons persists in the model with an arbitrarily high power of the self-focusing
nonlinearity. A weak gain-loss component gives rise to alternations of stability and instability
in the system's parameter plane. Those solitons which are unstable under the action of the supercritical
self-attraction are destroyed by the collapse. If the self-attraction-driven instability is
weak and the gain-loss term is present, unstable solitons spontaneously transform into localized
breathers. The same outcome may be caused by a combination of the critical nonlinearity with the
gain and loss. Instability of the solitons is also possible when the PT-symmetric gain-loss term
is added to the subcritical nonlinearity. The system with self-repulsive nonlinearity is briefly
considered too, producing completely stable families of pinned localized states.
