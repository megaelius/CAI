Molecular dynamics simulation is employed to understand the thermodynamic behavior of cuboctahedron
(cub) and icosahedron (ico) nanoparticles with 2-20 number of full shells. The original embedded
atom method (EAM) was compared to the more recent highly optimized version as inter-atomic potential.
The thermal stability of clusters were probed using potential energy and specific heat capacity
as well as structure analysis by radial distribution function, G(r), and common neighbor analysis
(CNA), simultaneously, to make a comprehensive picture of the solid state and melting transitions.
The result shows ico is the only stable shape of small clusters (Pd55-Pd309 using original EAM and
Pd55 using optimized version) those are melting uniformly due to their small diameter. An exception
is cub Pd309 modeled via optimized EAM that transforms to ico at elevated temperatures. A similar
cub to ico transition was predicted by original EAM for Pd923-Pd2075 clusters while for the larger
clusters both cub and ico are stable up to the melting point. As detected by G(r) and CNA, moderate
and large cub clusters were showing surface melting by nucleation of the liquid phase at (100) planes
and growth of liquid phase at the surface before inward growth. While diagonal (one corner to another)
melting was dominating over ico clusters owing to their partitioned structure which retarded the
growth of the liquid phase. The large ico cluster, using optimized EAM, presented a combination
of surface and diagonal melting due to the simultaneous diagonal melting started from different
corners. Finally, the melting temperature as well as latent heat of fusion were calculated and compared
with available models and previous studies which showed, unlike the present result, the models
failed to predict size-dependent motif crossover.
