The notion of a simple ordered state implies homogeneity. If the order is established by a broken
symmetry, elementary Landau theory of phase transitions shows that only one symmetry mode describes
this state. Precisely at points of phase coexistence domain states formed of large regions of different
phases can be stabilized by long range interactions. In uniaxial antiferromagnets the so-called
metamagnetism is an example of such a behavior, when an antiferromagnetic and field-induced spin-polarized
paramagnetic/ferromagnetic state co-exist at a jump-like transition in the magnetic phase diagram.
Here, combining experiment with theoretical analysis, we show that a different type of mixed state
between antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism can be created in certain acentric materials.
In the small-angle neutron scattering experiments we observe a field-driven spin-state in the
layered antiferromagnet Ca3Ru2O7, which is modulated on a scale between 8 and 20 nm and has both antiferromagnetic
and ferromagnetic parts. We call this state a metamagnetic texture and explain its appearance by
the chiral twisting effects of the asymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange. The observation
can be understood as an extraordinary coexistence, in one thermodynamic state, of spin orders belonging
to different symmetries. Experimentally, the complex nature of this metamagnetic state is demonstrated
by measurements of anomalies in electronic transport which reflect the spin-polarization in the
metamagnetic texture, determination of the magnetic orbital moments, which supports the existence
of strong spin-orbit effects, a pre-requisite for the mechanism of twisted magnetic states in this
material.
