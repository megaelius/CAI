We explore the ground-state phase diagram of the $S=1/2$ two-leg ladder with different leg interactions.
The $xy$ and $z$ components of the leg interactions between nearest-neighbor spins in the $a$ ($b$)
leg are denoted, respectively, by $J_{{\rm l},a}$ and $\Delta_{\rm l} J_{{\rm l},a}$ ($J_{{\rm
l},b}$ and $\Delta_{\rm l} J_{{\rm l},b}$). On the other hand, the $xy$ and $z$ components of the
uniform rung interactions are, respectively, denoted by $\Gamma_{\rm r} J_{{\rm r}}$ and $J_{{\rm
r}}$. In the above, $\Delta_{\rm l}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm r}$ are the $XXZ$-type anisotropy parameters
for the leg and rung interactions, respectively. This system has a frustration when $J_{{\rm l},a}
J_{{\rm l},b}<0$ irrespective of the sign of $J_{\rm r}$. The phase diagram on the $\Delta_{\rm
l}$ ($|\Delta_{\rm l}| \leq 1.0$) versus $J_{{\rm l},b}$ ($-2.0\leq J_{{\rm l},b}\leq 3.0$) plane
in the case where $J_{{\rm l},a}=0.2$, $J_{{\rm r}}=-1.0$, and $\Gamma_{\rm r} = 0.5$ is determined
numerically. We employ the physical consideration, and the level spectroscopy and phenomenological
renormalization-group analyses of the numerical date obtained by the exact diagonalization method.
The resultant phase diagram contains the ferromagnetic, Haldane, N{\'e}el, nematic Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquid (TLL), partial ferrimagnetic, and $XY1$ phases. Interestingly enough, the nematic TLL
phase appears in the strong-rung unfrustrated region as well as in the strong-rung frustrated one.
We perform the first-order perturbational calculations from the strong rung coupling limit to
elucidate the characteristic features of the phase diagram. Furthermore, we make the density-matrix
renormalization-group calculations for some physical quantities such as the energy gaps, the
local magnetization, and the spin correlation functions to supplement the reliability of the phase
diagram.
