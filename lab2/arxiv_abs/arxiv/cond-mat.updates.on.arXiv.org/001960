A condensate of pairs in an isolated, homogeneous, unpolarised, finite-size spin 1/2 Fermi gas
at an arbitrarily low nonzero temperature T, undergoes with time a phase change with a random component,
due at least to the coupling to the thermal phonons of the gas. Thanks to the quantum second Josephson
relation connecting the derivative of the condensate phase operator to the phonon occupation numbers,
and to linearised kinetic equations giving the evolution of the occupation number fluctuations,
we access the behaviour of the phase change variance at times much longer than the phonon collision
time. The case where the phonon branch has a convex start is similar to the Bose gas case: the leading
collisional processes are the Beliaev-Landau three-phonons processes, and the variance is the
sum of a ballistic term and of a delayed diffusive term, whose analytical expressions are given in
the thermodynamic limit. The concave case is much more exotic. It is analysed at time scales $T^{-9}$,
allowing one to restrict to the 2 phonons $\rightarrow$ 2 phonons small-angle Landau-Khalatnikov
processes. The total number of phonons is conserved and the phonon mean occupation numbers at equilibrium
can exhibit a negative chemical potential, assumed to be isotropic. The phase change variance is
then the sum of a ballistic term, of a diffusive term, of exotic subsubleading terms and of a constant
term. The analytic expression of some of the corresponding coefficients is obtained, as well as
the diverging leading behavior of the other ones when the phonon chemical potential tends to zero.
When this chemical potential is zero, the variance sub-ballistic part becomes superdiffusive,
with an exponent 5/3 and an exactly-known coefficient. For a nonzero infinitesimal phonon chemical
potential, a law is found, that interpolates between the superdiffusive phase spreading and the
diffusive one. As by-products, new results are obtained on the phonon Landau-Khalatnikov damping
rate..
