Some magnets due to particular geometry of the exchange bonds do not undergo transition to the conventional
magnetically ordered state despite of the presence of significant exchange couplings. Instead,
a collective paramagnetic state is formed. The later state can remain stable down to $T=0$ if the
ground state of this magnet turns out to be nonmagnetic singlet separated from the excited triplet
states by an energy gap. Low-temperature spin dynamics of the collective paramagnets with gapped
excitations spectrum (or spin-gap magnets) can be described in terms of a dilute gas of the triplet
excitations. Applied magnetic field can suppress the energy gap, resulting in the formation of
the gapless spin-liquid state or even leading to the unusual phenomenon of field-induced antiferromagnetic
order. Introduction of defects in the crystallographic structure of the spin-gap magnet can result
either in the formation of multi-spin paramagnetic center or in the formation of randomly distributed
modified exchange bonds in the crystal. This review includes results of electron spin resonance
(ESR) spectroscopy study of several representative quantum paramagnets with gapped excitations
spectrum: quasy-two-dimensional magnet \phcc{}, quasy-one-dimensional magnets of "spin-tube"
type \sul{} and "spin-ladder" type \dimpy{}. We will demonstrate that ESR absorption spectra reveal
common features of these systems: ESR spectroscopy allows to observe and characterize fine structure
if the triplet energy levels, to identify many-particles relaxation processes in the gas of triplet
excitations and to observe collective spin-wave oscillations in the field induced antiferromagnetically
ordered state, as well as to observe some individual features of the studied systems.
