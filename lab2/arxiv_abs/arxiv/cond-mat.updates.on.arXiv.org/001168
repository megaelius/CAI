The spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry in periodically driven quantum systems
leads to a new phase of matter: discrete time crystals (DTC). This phase exhibits collective subharmonic
oscillations that depend upon an interplay of non-equilibrium driving, many-body interactions,
and the breakdown of ergodicity. However, subharmonic responses are also a well-known feature
of classical dynamical systems ranging from predator-prey models to Faraday waves and AC-driven
charge density waves. This raises the question of whether these classical phenomena display the
same rigidity characteristic of a quantum DTC. In this work, we explore this question in the context
of periodically driven Hamiltonian dynamics coupled to a finite-temperature bath, which provides
both friction and, crucially, noise. Focusing on one-dimensional chains, where in equilibrium
any transition would be forbidden at finite temperature, we provide evidence that the combination
of noise and interactions drives a sharp, first-order dynamical phase transition between a discrete
time-translation invariant phase and an activated classical discrete time crystal (CDTC) in which
time-translation symmetry is broken out to exponentially-long time scales. Power-law correlations
are present along a first-order line which terminates at a critical point. We analyze the transition
by mapping it to the locked-to-sliding transition of a DC-driven charge density wave. Our work points
to a classical limit for quantum time crystals, and raises several intriguing questions concerning
the non-equilibrium universality class of the CDTC critical point.
