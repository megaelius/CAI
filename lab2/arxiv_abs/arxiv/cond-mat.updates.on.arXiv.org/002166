Harvesting non-equilibrium hot carriers from photo-excited metal nanoparticles has enabled
plasmon-driven photochemical transformations and tunable photodetection with resonant nanoantennas.
Despite numerous studies on the ultrafast dynamics of hot electrons, to date, the temporal evolution
of hot holes in metal-semiconductor heterostructures remains unknown. An improved understanding
of the carrier dynamics in hot-hole-driven systems is needed to help expand the scope of hot-carrier
optoelectronics beyond hot-electron-based devices. Here, using ultrafast transient absorption
spectroscopy, we show that plasmon-induced hot-hole injection from gold (Au) nanoparticles into
the valence band of p-type gallium nitride (p-GaN) occurs within 200 fs, placing hot-hole transfer
on a similar timescale as hot-electron transfer. We further observed that the removal of hot holes
from below the Au Fermi level exerts a discernible influence on the thermalization of hot electrons
above it, reducing the peak electronic temperature and decreasing the electron-phonon coupling
time relative to Au samples without a pathway for hot-hole collection. First principles calculations
corroborate these experimental observations, suggesting that hot-hole injection modifies the
relaxation dynamics of hot electrons in Au nanoparticles through ultrafast modulation of the d-band
electronic structure. Taken together, these ultrafast studies substantially advance our understanding
of the temporal evolution of hot holes in metal-semiconductor heterostructures and suggest new
strategies for manipulating and controlling the energy distributions of hot carriers on ultrafast
timescales.
