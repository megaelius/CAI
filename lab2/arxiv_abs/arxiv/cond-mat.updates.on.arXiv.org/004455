The nature of the pseudogap phase of cuprates remains a major puzzle. One of its new signatures is
a large negative thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xy}$, which appears for dopings $p$ below
the pseudogap critical doping $p^*$, but whose origin is as yet unknown. Because this large $\kappa_{\rm
xy}$ is observed even in the undoped Mott insulator La$_2$CuO$_4$, it cannot come from charge carriers,
these being localized at $p = 0$. Here we show that the thermal Hall conductivity of La$_2$CuO$_4$
is roughly isotropic, being nearly the same for heat transport parallel and normal to the CuO$_2$
planes, i.e. $\kappa_{\rm zy}(T) \approx \kappa_{\rm xy} (T)$. This shows that the Hall response
must come from phonons, these being the only heat carriers able to move as easily normal and parallel
to the planes . At $p > p^*$, in both La$_{\rm 1.6-x}$Nd$_{\rm 0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and La$_{\rm 1.8-x}$Eu$_{\rm
0.2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ with $p = 0.24$, we observe no c-axis Hall signal, i.e. $\kappa_{\rm zy}(T)
= 0$, showing that phonons have zero Hall response outside the pseudogap phase. The phonon Hall response
appears immediately below $p^* = 0.23$, as confirmed by the large $\kappa_{\rm zy}(T)$ signal we
find in La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{\rm 0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ with $p = 0.21$. The microscopic mechanism by
which phonons become chiral in cuprates remains to be identified. This mechanism must be intrinsic
- from a coupling of phonons to their electronic environment - rather than extrinsic, from structural
defects or impurities, as these are the same on both sides of $p^*$. This intrinsic phonon Hall effect
provides a new window on quantum materials and it may explain the thermal Hall signal observed in
other topologically nontrivial insulators.
