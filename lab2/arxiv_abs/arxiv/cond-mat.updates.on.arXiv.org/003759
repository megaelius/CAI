We study spin transport in the one-dimensional anisotropic S = 1 Heisenberg model. Particular emphasis
is given to dynamics at infinite temperature, where current autocorrelations and spatio-temporal
correlation functions are obtained by means of an efficient pure-state approach based on the concept
of typicality. Our comprehensive numerical analysis unveils that high-temperature spin transport
is diffusive in the easy-axis regime for strong exchange anisotropies. This finding is based on
the combination of numerous signatures, such as (i) Gaussian spreading of correlations, (ii) a
time-independent diffusion coefficient, (iii) power-law decay of equal-site correlations,
(iv) exponentially decaying long-wavelength modes, and (v) Lorentzian line shapes of the dynamical
structure factor. Moreover, we provide evidence that some of these signatures are not exclusively
restricted to the infinite-temperature limit, but can persist at lower temperatures as well, where
we complement our results by additional quantum Monte Carlo simulations of large systems. In contrast
to the easy-axis regime, we show that in the case of an isotropic chain, the signatures (i) - (v) are
much less pronounced or even entirely absent, suggesting the existence of anomalous spin transport
despite the nonintegrability of the model. Eventually, upon introducing a random on-site magnetic
field, we observe a breakdown of diffusion and distinctly slower dynamics. In particular, our results
exhibit qualitative similarities to disordered spin-1/2 chains and might be consistent with the
onset of many-body localization in the S = 1 model for sufficiently strong disorder.
