Two experimental studies reported the spontaneous formation of amorphous and crystalline structures
of C60 intercalated between graphene and a substrate. They observed interesting phenomena ranging
from reaction between C60 molecules under graphene to graphene sagging between the molecules and
control of strain in graphene. Motivated by these works, we performed fully atomistic reactive
molecular dynamics simulations to study the formation and thermal stability of graphene wrinkles
as well as graphene attachment to and detachment from the substrate when graphene is laid over a previously
distributed array of C60 molecules on a copper substrate at different values of temperature. As
graphene compresses the C60 molecules against the substrate, and graphene attachment to the substrate
between C60s ("C60s" stands for plural of C60) depends on the height of graphene wrinkles, configurations
with both frozen and non-frozen C60s structures were investigated in order to verify the experimental
result of stable sagged graphene when the distance between C60s is about 4 nm and height of graphene
wrinkles is about 0.8 nm. Below the distance of 4 nm between C60s, graphene becomes locally suspended
and less strained. We show that this happens when C60s are allowed to deform under the compressive
action of graphene. If we keep the C60s frozen, spontaneous "blanketing" of graphene happens only
when the distance between them are equal or above 7 nm. Both above results for the existence of stable
sagged graphene for C60 distances of 4 or 7 nm are shown to agree with a mechanical model relating the
rigidity of graphene to the energy of graphene-substrate adhesion. In particular, this study might
help the development of 2D confined nanoreactors that are considered in literature to be the next
advanced step on chemical reactions.
