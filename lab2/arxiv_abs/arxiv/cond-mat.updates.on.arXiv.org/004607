The investigation of the behavior of both classical and quantum systems on non-Euclidean surfaces
near the phase transition point represents an interesting research area of modern physics. In the
case of classical spin systems, a generalization of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization
Group algorithm has been developed and successfully applied to spin models on infinitely many regular
hyperbolic lattices. In this work, we extend these studies to specific types of lattices. It is important
to say that no suitable algorithms for numerical analysis of ground-states of quantum systems in
similar conditions have been implemented yet. In this work, we offer a particular solution by proposing
a variational numerical algorithm Tensor Product Variational Formulation, which assumes a quantum
ground-state written in the form of a low-dimensional uniform tensor product state. We apply the
Tensor Product Variational Formulation to three typical quantum models on a variety of regular
hyperbolic lattices. The main outcomes are the following: (1) We propose an algorithm for calculation
and classification of the thermodynamic properties of the Ising model on triangular-tiled hyperbolic
lattices. In addition, we investigate the origin of the mean-field universality on a series of weakly
curved lattices. (2) We develop the Tensor Product Variational Formulation algorithm for the numerical
analysis of the ground-state of the quantum systems on the hyperbolic lattices. (3) We study quantum
phase transition phenomena for the three selected spin models on various types of the hyperbolic
lattices including the Bethe lattice.
