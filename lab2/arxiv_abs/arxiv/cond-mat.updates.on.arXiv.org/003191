It is ambiguous to understand the structure evolution in atoms executing confined inter-state
electron dynamics. Such atoms evolve structure while they amalgamate under significant attained
dynamics. A structure evolution is in a different format depending on the ground point of atoms.
Atoms of each format deal different forced exertions for their electrons. Under neutral state,
they transform heat energy into bind energy having a shape like tick, integral or Gaussian distribution
symbol as per mechanism of electron dynamics. In atoms evolving structure at same level of ground
points, they also deal forced exertions for feasible electrons in the same format. In atoms of space
format, evolving structure starts just above the typical level ground surface. In atoms of grounded
format, evolving structure starts below typical level ground surface. Atoms, as per number of quadrants
simultaneously executing electron dynamics, evolve structure of different dimensions. Atoms,
executing electron dynamics in three quadrants, show a bit different mechanism of structure evolution.
Atoms bind at the points of their generated energy because of their identical nature. Amalgamating
atoms bind in a lateral way to the targeted atom from upward side and downward side respectively in
structure evolution of space format and grounded format. In structure of surface format, amalgamated
atoms bind to targeted atom in adjacent manner. Binding atoms in layers for each definite format
is by means of trapping force and energy. As a result of chemical activity of force and energy, their
chemical reactivity adheres to mono-layers of atoms bound under electron dynamics. A mixed orientation
structure develops under frustrated amalgamation of atoms. This fundamental revolution related
to the process whereby structures of atoms executing electron dynamics
