Preparation of solid solutions represents an effective means to improve the photocatalytic properties
of semiconductor-based materials. Nevertheless, the effects of site-occupancy disorder on the
mixing stability and electronic properties of the resulting compounds are difficult to predict
and consequently many experimental trials may be required before achieving enhanced photocatalytic
activity. Here, we employ first-principles methods based on density functional theory to estimate
the mixing free energy and the structural and electronic properties of (GaP)$_{x}$(ZnS)$_{1-x}$
solid solutions, a representative semiconductor-based optoelectronic material. Our method
relies on a multi-configurational supercell approach that takes into account the configurational
and vibrational contributions to the free energy. Phase competition among the zinc-blende and
wurtzite polymorphs is also considered. We demonstrate overall excellent agreement with the available
experimental data: (1)~zinc-blende emerges as the energetically most favorable phase, (2)~the
solid solution energy band gap lies within the $2$--$3$~eV range for all compositions, and (3)~the
energy band gap of the solid solution is direct for compositions $x \le 75$\%. We find that at ambient
conditions most (GaP)$_{x}$(ZnS)$_{1-x}$ solid solutions are slightly unstable against decomposition
into GaP- and ZnS-rich regions. Nevertheless, compositions $x \approx 25$, 50, and 75\% render
robust metastable states that owing to their favorable energy band gaps and band levels relative
to vacuum are promising hydrogen evolution photocatalysts for water splitting under visible light.
The employed theoretical approach provides valuable insights into the physicochemical properties
of potential solid-solution photocatalysts and offers useful guides for their experimental realization.
