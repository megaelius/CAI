The conditions of field and voltage for inducing steady state excitations in fully perpendicular
magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs), adapted for memory applications, were numerically investigated
by the resolution of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the macrospin approach. Both damping-like
and the field-like spin transfer torque terms were taken into account in the simulations, as well
as the contribution of the second order uniaxial anisotropy term (K2), which has been recently revealed
in MgO-based pMTJs. An in-plane applied magnetic field balances the out of plane symmetry of the
pMTJ and allows the signal detection. Using this model, we assessed the states of the free layer magnetization
as a function of strength of K2 and polar theta_H angle of the applied field (varied from 90 to 60 deg.).
There are two stable states, with the magnetization in-plane or out of plane of the layer, and two
dynamic states with self-sustained oscillations, called in-plane precession state (IPP) or out
of plane precession state (OPP). The IPP mode, with oscillation frequencies up to 7 GHz, appears
only for positive voltages if theta_H = 90 deg. However, it shows a more complex distribution when
the field is slightly tilted out of plane. The OPP mode is excited only if K2 is considered and reaches
a maximum oscillation frequency of 15 GHz. Large areas of dynamic states with high frequencies are
obtained for strong values of the field-like torque and K2, when applying a slightly tilted external
field toward the out of plane direction. The non-zero temperature does not modify the phase diagrams,
but reduces drastically the power spectral density peak amplitudes.
