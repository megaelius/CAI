Ultrafast phenomena on a femtosecond timescale are commonly examined by pump-probe experiments.
This implies multiple measurements where the sample under investigation is pumped with a short
light pulse and then probed with a second pulse at various time delays to follow its dynamics. Recently,
the principle of streaking extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses in the temporal domain has enabled
recording the dynamics of a system within a single pulse. However, separate pump-probe experiments
at different absorption edges still lack a unified timing, when comparing the dynamics in complex
systems. Here we report on an experiment using a dedicated optical element and the two-color emission
of the FERMI XUV free-electron laser to follow the charge and spin dynamics in composite materials
at two distinct absorption edges, simultaneously. The sample, consisting of ferromagnetic Fe
and Ni layers, separated by a Cu layer, is pumped by an infrared laser and probed by a two-color XUV
pulse with photon energies tuned to the M edges of these two transition metals. The experimental
geometry intrinsically avoids any timing uncertainty between the two elements and unambiguously
reveals an approximately 100 fs delay of the magnetic response with respect to the electronic excitation
for both Fe and Ni. This delay shows that the electronic and spin degrees of freedom are decoupled
during the demagnetization process. These observations underline the importance of simultaneous
investigation of the temporal response of both charge and spin in multi-component materials. In
a more general scenario, the experimental approach can be extended to continuous energy ranges,
promising the development of jitter-free transient absorption spectroscopy in the XUV and soft
X-ray regimes.
