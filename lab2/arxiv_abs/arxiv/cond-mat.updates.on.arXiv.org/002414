Nonlocal quantum theory of one-component scalar field in $D$-dimensional Euclidean spacetime
is studied in representations of $\mathcal{S}$-matrix theory for both polynomial and nonpolynomial
interaction Lagrangians. The theory is formulated on coupling constant $g$ in the form of an infrared
smooth function of argument $x$ for space without boundary. Nonlocality is given by evolution of
Gaussian propagator for the local free theory with ultraviolet form factors depending on ultraviolet
length parameter $l$. By representation of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix in terms of abstract functional
integral over primary scalar field, the $\mathcal{S}$ form of a grand canonical partition function
is found. And, by expression of $\mathcal{S}$-matrix in terms of the partition function, the representation
for $\mathcal{S}$ in terms of basis functions is obtained. Derivations are given for discrete case
where basis functions are Hermite functions, and for continuous case where basis functions are
trigonometric functions. The obtained expressions for the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix are investigated
within the framework of variational principle based on Jensen inequality. Equations with separable
kernels satisfied by variational function $q$ are found and solved, yielding results for both the
polynomial theory $\varphi^{4}$ and the nonpolynomial sine-Gordon theory. A new definition of
the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix is proposed to solve additional divergences which arise in application
of Jensen inequality for the continuous case. Analytical results are illustrated numerically.
For simplicity of numerical calculation: the $D=1$ case is considered, and propagator for the free
theory $G$ is in the form of Gaussian function typically in the Virton-Quark model. The formulation
for nonlocal QFT in momentum $k$ space of extra dimensions with subsequent compactification into
physical spacetime is discussed.
