We compare the structural and mechanical properties of mechanically stable (MS) packings of frictional
disks in two spatial dimensions (2D) generated with isotropic compression and simple shear protocols
from discrete element modeling (DEM) simulations. We find that the average contact number and packing
fraction at jamming onset are similar (with relative deviations $< 0.5\%$) for MS packings generated
via compression and shear. In contrast, the average stress anisotropy $\langle {\hat \Sigma}_{xy}
\rangle = 0$ for MS packings generated via isotropic compression, whereas $\langle {\hat \Sigma}_{xy}
\rangle >0$ for MS packings generated via simple shear. To investigate the difference in the stress
state of MS packings, we develop packing-generation protocols to first unjam the MS packings, remove
the frictional contacts, and then rejam them. Using these protocols, we are able to obtain rejammed
packings with nearly identical particle positions and stress anisotropy distributions compared
to the original jammed packings. However, we find that when we directly compare the original jammed
packings and rejammed ones, there are finite stress anisotropy deviations $\Delta {\hat \Sigma}_{xy}$.
The deviations are smaller than the stress anisotropy fluctuations obtained by enumerating the
force solutions within the null space of the contact networks generated via the DEM simulations.
These results emphasize that even though the compression and shear jamming protocols generate
packings with the same contact networks, there can be residual differences in the normal and tangential
forces at each contact, and thus differences in the stress anisotropy.
