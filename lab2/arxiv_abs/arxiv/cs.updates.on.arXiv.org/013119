Decentralization is a key indicator for the evaluation of public blockchains. While existing works
have evaluated the degree of decentralization in Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains represented
by Bitcoin and Ethereum, there have been few studies on measuring the actual level of decentralization
between PoW blockchains and blockchains powered by other decentralized consensus protocols.
This paper presents a comparison study of the level of decentralization in Bitcoin and Steem, a leading
Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchain. In Bitcoin, miners with higher computational power
generate more blocks. In contrast, blocks in Steem are equally generated by witnesses while witnesses
are periodically elected by stakeholders. Our study analyzes the process of stake-weighted election
of witnesses in the DPoS consensus protocol and measures the actual stake invested by each stakeholder
in Steem. We then quantify and compare the actual degree of decentralization in these two blockchains
by computing the Shannon entropy of the distribution of computational power among miners in Bitcoin
and the distribution of invested stake among stakeholders in Steem. Our measurements indicate
that, compared with Steem, Bitcoin tends to be more decentralized among top miners but less decentralized
in general. Our study is designed to provide insights into the current state of the degree of decentralization
in representative DPoS and PoW blockchains. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this
paper can facilitate future studies of decentralization in other blockchain systems employing
different consensus protocols.
