In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to optimize the downlink multi-user communication
of a millimeter wave base station, which is assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent reflector
(IR). In particular, a channel estimation approach is developed to measure the channel state information
(CSI) in real-time. First, for a perfect CSI scenario, the optimal precoding transmission and power
allocation is derived so as to maximize the sum of downlink rates towards multiple users, followed
by the optimization of IR reflection coefficient to enhance the upper bound of the downlink transmission.
Next, in the imperfect CSI scenario, a distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is
proposed to learn the optimal IR reflection and maximize the expectation of downlink capacity.
In order to model the transmission rate's probability distribution, a learning algorithm, based
on quantile regression (QR), is developed, and the proposed QR-DRL method is proved to converge
to a stable distribution of downlink transmission rate. Simulation results show that, in the error-free
CSI scenario, the proposed transmission approach yields over 20% and 2-fold increase in the downlink
sum-rate, compared with a fixed IR reflection scheme and direct transmission scheme, respectively.
Simulation results also show that by increasing the number of IR components, the downlink rate can
be improved faster than by increasing the number of antennas at the BS. Furthermore, under limited
knowledge of CSI, simulation results show that the proposed QR-DRL method, which learns a full distribution
of the downlink rate, yields a better prediction accuracy and improves the downlink rate by 10% for
online deployments, compared with a Q-learning baseline.
