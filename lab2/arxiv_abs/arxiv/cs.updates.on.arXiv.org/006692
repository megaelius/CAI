Artificial Neural Networks are connectionist systems that perform a given task by learning on examples
without having prior knowledge about the task. This is done by finding an optimal point estimate
for the weights in every node. Generally, the network using point estimates as weights perform well
with large datasets, but they fail to express uncertainty in regions with little or no data, leading
to overconfident decisions. In this paper, Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BayesCNN)
using Variational Inference is proposed, that introduces probability distribution over the weights.
Furthermore, the proposed BayesCNN architecture is applied to tasks like Image Classification,
Image Super-Resolution and Generative Adversarial Networks. The results are compared to point-estimates
based architectures on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets for Image CLassification task,
on BSD300 dataset for Image Super Resolution task and on CIFAR10 dataset again for Generative Adversarial
Network task. BayesCNN is based on Bayes by Backprop which derives a variational approximation
to the true posterior. We, therefore, introduce the idea of applying two convolutional operations,
one for the mean and one for the variance. Our proposed method not only achieves performances equivalent
to frequentist inference in identical architectures but also incorporate a measurement for uncertainties
and regularisation. It further eliminates the use of dropout in the model. Moreover, we predict
how certain the model prediction is based on the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties and empirically
show how the uncertainty can decrease, allowing the decisions made by the network to become more
deterministic as the training accuracy increases. Finally, we propose ways to prune the Bayesian
architecture and to make it more computational and time effective.
