Temporal object detection has attracted significant attention, but most popular detection methods
cannot leverage rich temporal information in videos. Very recently, many algorithms have been
developed for video detection task, yet very few approaches can achieve \emph{real-time online}
object detection in videos. In this paper, based on attention mechanism and convolutional long
short-term memory (ConvLSTM), we propose a temporal single-shot detector (TSSD) for real-world
detection. Distinct from previous methods, we take aim at temporally integrating pyramidal feature
hierarchy using ConvLSTM, and design a novel structure including a low-level temporal unit as well
as a high-level one (LH-TU) for multi-scale feature maps. Moreover, we develop a creative temporal
analysis unit, namely, attentional ConvLSTM (AC-LSTM), in which a temporal attention mechanism
is specially tailored for background suppression and scale suppression while a ConvLSTM integrates
attention-aware features across time. An association loss and a multi-step training are designed
for temporal coherence. Besides, an online tubelet analysis (OTA) is exploited for identification.
Our framework is evaluated on ImageNet VID dataset and 2DMOT15 dataset. Extensive comparisons
on the detection and tracking capability validate the superiority of the proposed approach. Consequently,
the developed TSSD-OTA achieves a fast speed and an overall competitive performance in terms of
detection and tracking. Finally, a real-world maneuver is conducted for underwater object grasping.
