In the past few years co-clustering has emerged as an important data mining tool for two way data analysis.
Co-clustering is more advantageous over traditional one dimensional clustering in many ways such
as, ability to find highly correlated sub-groups of rows and columns. However, one of the overlooked
benefits of co-clustering is that, it can be used to extract meaningful knowledge for various other
knowledge extraction purposes. For example, building predictive models with high dimensional
data and heterogeneous population is a non-trivial task. Co-clusters extracted from such data,
which shows similar pattern in both the dimension, can be used for a more accurate predictive model
building. Several applications such as finding patient-disease cohorts in health care analysis,
finding user-genre groups in recommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit
from co-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data to generate co-clusters
for improved data analysis. In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive Overlapping Co-Clustering
(POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective and improved predictive analysis. Our algorithm
generates optimal co-clusters by maximizing predictive power of the co-clusters subject to the
constraints on the number of row and column clusters. In this paper precision, recall and f-measure
have been used as evaluation measures of the resulting co-clusters. Results of our algorithm has
been compared with two other well-known techniques - K-means and Spectral co-clustering, over
four real data set namely, Leukemia, Internet-Ads, Ovarian cancer and MovieLens data set. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our algorithm POCC in practice.
