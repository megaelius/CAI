Indoor positioning systems (IPS) are emerging technologies due to an increasing popularity and
demand in location based service (LBS). Because traditional positioning systems such as GPS are
limited to outdoor applications, many IPS have been proposed in literature. WLAN-based IPS are
the most promising due to its proven accuracy and infrastructure deployment. Several WLAN-based
IPS have been proposed in the past, from which the best results have been shown by so-called fingerprint-based
systems. This paper proposes an indoor positioning system which extends traditional WLAN fingerprinting
by using received signal strength (RSS) measurements along with channel estimates as an effort
to improve classification accuracy for scenarios with a low number of Access Points (APs). The channel
estimates aim to characterize complex indoor environments making it a unique signature for fingerprinting-based
IPS and therefore improving pattern recognition in radio-maps. Since commercial WLAN cards offer
limited measurement information, software-defined radio (SDR) as an emerging trend for fast prototyping
and research integration is chosen as the best cost-effective option to extract channel estimates.
Therefore, this paper first proposes an 802.11b WLAN SDR beacon receiver capable of measuring RSS
and channel estimates. The SDR is designed using LabVIEW (LV) environment and leverages several
inherent platform acceleration features that achieve real-time capturing. The receiver achieves
a fast-rate measurement capture of 9 packets per second per AP. The classification of the propose
IPS uses a support vector machine (SVM) for offline training and online navigation. Several tests
are conducted in a cluttered indoor environment with a single AP in 802.11b legacy mode. Finally,
navigation accuracy results are discussed.
