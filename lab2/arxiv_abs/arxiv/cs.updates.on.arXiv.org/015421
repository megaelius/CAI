The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly all over the world and it is affecting the
whole society. The current gold standard test for screening COVID-19 patients is the polymerase
chain reaction test. However, the COVID-19 test kits are not widely available and time-consuming.
Thus, as an alternative, chest X-rays are being considered for quick screening. Since the presentation
of COVID-19 in chest X-rays is varied in features and specialization in reading COVID-19 chest X-rays
are required thus limiting its use for diagnosis. To address this challenge of reading chest X-rays
by radiologists quickly, we present a multi-channel transfer learning model based on ResNet architecture
to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-ray. Three ResNet-based models (Models a, b, and
c) were retrained using Dataset_A (1579 normal and 4429 diseased), Dataset_B (4245 pneumonia and
1763 non-pneumonia), and Dataset_C (184 COVID-19 and 5824 Non-COVID19), respectively, to classify
(a) normal or diseased, (b) pneumonia or non-pneumonia, and (c) COVID-19 or non-COVID19. Finally,
these three models were ensembled and fine-tuned using Dataset_D (1579 normal, 4245 pneumonia,
and 184 COVID-19) to classify normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. Our results show that the ensemble
model is more accurate than the single ResNet model, which is also re-trained using Dataset_D as
it extracts more relevant semantic features for each class. Our approach provides a precision of
94 % and a recall of 100%. Thus, our method could potentially help clinicians in screening patients
for COVID-19, thus facilitating immediate triaging and treatment for better outcomes.
