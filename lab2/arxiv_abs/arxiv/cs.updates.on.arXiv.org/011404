This paper provides a framework to evaluate the performance of single and double integrator networks
over arbitrary directed graphs. Adopting vehicular network terminology, we consider quadratic
performance metrics defined by the L2-norm of position and velocity based response functions given
impulsive inputs to each vehicle. We exploit the spectral properties of weighted graph Laplacians
and output performance matrices to derive a novel method of computing the closed-form solutions
for this general class of performance metrics, which include H2-norm based quantities as special
cases. We then explore the effect of the interplay between network properties (e.g. edge directionality
and connectivity) and the control strategy on the overall network performance. More precisely,
for systems whose interconnection is described by graphs with normal Laplacian L, we characterize
the role of directionality by comparing their performance with that of their undirected counterparts,
represented by the Hermitian part of L. We show that, for single-integrator networks, directed
and undirected graphs perform identically. However, for double-integrator networks, graph directionality
-- expressed by the eigenvalues of L with nonzero imaginary part -- can significantly degrade performance.
Interestingly in many cases, well-designed feedback can also exploit directionality to mitigate
degradation or even improve the performance to exceed that of the undirected case. Finally we focus
on a system coherence metric -- aggregate deviation from the state average -- to investigate the
relationship between performance and degree of connectivity, leading to somewhat surprising
findings. For example increasing the number of neighbors on a \omega-nearest neighbor directed
graph does not necessarily improve performance. Similarly, we demonstrate equivalence in performance
between all-to-one and all-to-all communication graphs.
