DNA methylation is a well-studied genetic modification crucial to regulate the functioning of
the genome. Its alterations play an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor-suppression. Thus,
studying DNA methylation data may help biomarker discovery in cancer. Since public data on DNA methylation
become abundant, and considering the high number of methylated sites (features) present in the
genome, it is important to have a method for efficiently processing such large datasets. Relying
on big data technologies, we propose BIGBIOCL an algorithm that can apply supervised classification
methods to datasets with hundreds of thousands of features. It is designed for the extraction of
alternative and equivalent classification models through iterative deletion of selected features.
We run experiments on DNA methylation datasets extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas, focusing
on three tumor types: breast, kidney, and thyroid carcinomas. We perform classifications extracting
several methylated sites and their associated genes with accurate performance. Results suggest
that BIGBIOCL can perform hundreds of classification iterations on hundreds of thousands of features
in few hours. Moreover, we compare the performance of our method with other state-of-the-art classifiers
and with a wide-spread DNA methylation analysis method based on network analysis. Finally, we are
able to efficiently compute multiple alternative classification models and extract, from DNA-methylation
large datasets, a set of candidate genes to be further investigated to determine their active role
in cancer. BIGBIOCL, results of experiments, and a guide to carry on new experiments are freely available
on GitHub.
