Given a graph $G$, a source node $s$ and a target node $t$, the personalized PageRank (PPR) of $t$ with
respect to $s$ is the probability that a random walk starting from $s$ terminates at $t$. An important
variant of the PPR query is single-source PPR (SSPPR), which enumerates all nodes in $G$, and returns
the top-$k$ nodes with the highest PPR values with respect to a given source $s$. PPR in general and
SSPPR in particular have important applications in web search and social networks, e.g., in Twitter's
Who-To-Follow recommendation service. However, PPR computation is known to be expensive on large
graphs, and resistant to indexing. Consequently, previous solutions either use heuristics, which
do not guarantee result quality, or rely on the strong computing power of modern data centers, which
is costly. Motivated by this, we propose effective index-free and index-based algorithms for approximate
PPR processing, with rigorous guarantees on result quality. We first present FORA, an approximate
SSPPR solution that combines two existing methods Forward Push (which is fast but does not guarantee
quality) and Monte Carlo Random Walk (accurate but slow) in a simple and yet non-trivial way, leading
to both high accuracy and efficiency. Further, FORA includes a simple and effective indexing scheme,
as well as a module for top-$k$ selection with high pruning power. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed solutions are orders of magnitude more efficient than their respective competitors.
Notably, on a billion-edge Twitter dataset, FORA answers a top-500 approximate SSPPR query within
1 second, using a single commodity server.
