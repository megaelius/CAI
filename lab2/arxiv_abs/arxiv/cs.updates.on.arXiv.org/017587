Objectives: The aims of this study are to identify factors in physical environments that contribute
to patient falls in hospitals and to propose a computational model to evaluate patient room designs.
Background: The existing fall risk assessment tools have an acceptable level of sensitivity and
specificity, however, they only consider intrinsic factors and medications, making the prediction
very limited in terms of how the physical environment contributes to fall risk. Methods: We provide
a computational model for risk of fall based on physical-environment and patient-motion factors.
We use a trajectory optimization approach for patient motion prediction. Results: We run the proposed
model on four room designs as examples of various room design categories. Results show the capabilities
of the proposed model in identifying risky locations within the room. Conclusions: Our study shows
the potential capabilities of the proposed model. Due to lack of enough evidence for the examined
factors, it is not possible at this point to gain robust confidence in the final evaluations. More
studies using quantitative, relational, or causal designs are recommended to inform the proposed
model for patient falls. Application: Developing a comprehensive fall risk model is a significant
step in understanding and solving the problem of patient falls in hospitals. It can provide guidance
for healthcare decision makers to optimize effective interventions to reduce risk of falls while
promoting safe patient mobility in the hospital room environment. We can also use it in healthcare
technologies such as assistive robots to provide informed assistance.
