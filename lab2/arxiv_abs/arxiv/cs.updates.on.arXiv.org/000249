The famous new money Bitcoin is classified as a technical informational money (TIM). Besides introducing
the idea of a TIM, a more extreme notion of informational money will be developed: exclusively informational
money (EXIM). The informational coins (INCOs) of an EXIM can be in control of an agent but are not owned
by any agent. INCOs of an EXIM cannot be stolen, but they can be lost, or thrown away. The difference
between an EXIM and a TIM shows up when considering a user perspective on security matters. Security
for an EXIM user is discussed in substantial detail, with the remarkable conclusion that computer
security (security models, access control, user names, passwords, firewalls etc.) is not always
essential for an EXIM, while the application of cryptography based information security is unavoidable
for the use of an EXIM. Bitcoin seems to meet the criteria of an EXIM, but the assertion that "Bitcoin
is an EXIM", might also be considered problematic. As a thought experiment we will contemplate Bitguilder,
a hypothetical copy of Bitcoin that qualifies as an EXIM. A business ethics assessment of Bitcoin
is made which reveals a number of worries. By combining Bitguilder with a so-called technical informational
near-money (TINM) a dual money system, having two units with a fluctuating rate, may be obtained.
It seems that a dual money can remedy some, but not all, of the ethical worries that arise when contemplating
Bitcoin after hypothetically having become a dominant form of money. The contributions that Bitcoin's
designers can potentially make to the evolution of EXIMs and TIMs is analyzed in terms of the update
of the portfolio of money related natural kinds that comes with Bitcoin.
