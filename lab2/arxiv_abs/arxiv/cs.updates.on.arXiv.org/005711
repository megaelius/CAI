Disseminating accurate travel time information to road users helps achieve traffic equilibrium
and reduce traffic congestion. The deployment of Connected Vehicles technology will provide unique
opportunities for the implementation of travel time prediction models. The aim of this study is
twofold: (1) estimate travel times in the freeway network at five-minute intervals using Basic
Safety Messages (BSM); (2) develop an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model for short-term travel
time prediction on freeways. The XGB tree-based ensemble prediction model is evaluated against
common tree-based ensemble algorithms and the evaluations are performed at five-minute intervals
over a 30-minute horizon. BSMs generated by the Safety Pilot Model Deployment conducted in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, were used. Nearly two billion messages were processed for providing travel time estimates
for the entire freeway network. A Combination of grid search and five-fold cross-validation techniques
using the travel time estimates were used for developing the prediction models and tuning their
parameters. About 9.6 km freeway stretch was used for evaluating the XGB together with the most common
tree-based ensemble algorithms. The results show that XGB is superior to all other algorithms,
followed by the Gradient Boosting. XGB travel time predictions were accurate and consistent with
variations during peak periods, with mean absolute percentage error in prediction about 5.9% and
7.8% for 5-minute and 30-minute horizons, respectively. Additionally, through applying the developed
models to another 4.7 km stretch along the eastbound segment of M-14, the XGB demonstrated its considerable
advantages in travel time prediction during congested and uncongested conditions.
