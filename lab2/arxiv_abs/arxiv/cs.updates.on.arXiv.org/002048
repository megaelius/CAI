Coordination is a key problem for addressing goal-action gaps in many human endeavors. We define
interpersonal coordination as a type of communicative action characterized by low interpersonal
belief and goal conflict. Such situations are particularly well described as having collectively
"intelligent", "common good" solutions, viz., ones that almost everyone would agree constitute
social improvements. Coordination is useful across the spectrum of interpersonal communication
-- from isolated individuals to organizational teams. Much attention has been paid to coordination
in teams and organizations. In this paper we focus on the looser interpersonal structures we call
active support networks (ASNs), and on technology that meets their needs. We describe two needfinding
investigations focused on social support, which examined (a) four application areas for improving
coordination in ASNs: (i) academic coaching, (ii) vocational training, (iii) early learning intervention,
and (iv) volunteer coordination; and (b) existing technology relevant to ASNs. We find a thus-far
unmet need for personal task management software that allows smooth integration with an individual's
active support network. Based on identified needs, we then describe an open architecture for coordination
that has been developed into working software. The design includes a set of capabilities we call
"social prompting," as well as templates for accomplishing multi-task goals, and an engine that
controls coordination in the network. The resulting tool is currently available and in continuing
development. We explain its use in ASNs with an example. Follow-up studies are underway in which
the technology is being applied in existing support networks.
