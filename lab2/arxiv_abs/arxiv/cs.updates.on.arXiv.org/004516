We study the interaction between a fleet of electric, self-driving vehicles servicing on-demand
transportation requests (referred to as Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand, or AMoD, system) and
the electric power network. We propose a model that captures the coupling between the two systems
stemming from the vehicles' charging requirements and captures time-varying customer demand
and power generation costs, road congestion, battery depreciation, and power transmission and
distribution constraints. We then leverage the model to jointly optimize the operation of both
systems. We devise an algorithmic procedure to losslessly reduce the problem size by bundling customer
requests, allowing it to be efficiently solved by off-the-shelf linear programming solvers. Next,
we show that the socially optimal solution to the joint problem can be enforced as a general equilibrium,
and we provide a dual decomposition algorithm that allows self-interested agents to compute the
market clearing prices without sharing private information. We assess the performance of the mode
by studying a hypothetical AMoD system in Dallas-Fort Worth and its impact on the Texas power network.
Lack of coordination between the AMoD system and the power network can cause a 4.4% increase in the
price of electricity in Dallas-Fort Worth; conversely, coordination between the AMoD system and
the power network could reduce electricity expenditure compared to the case where no cars are present
(despite the increased demand for electricity) and yield savings of up $147M/year. Finally, we
provide a receding-horizon implementation and assess its performance with agent-based simulations.
Collectively, the results of this paper provide a first-of-a-kind characterization of the interaction
between electric-powered AMoD systems and the power network, and shed additional light on the economic
and societal value of AMoD.
