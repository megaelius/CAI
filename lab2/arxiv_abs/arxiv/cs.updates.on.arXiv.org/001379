Human beings cannot be happy with any kind of tiredness based work, so they focused on machines to
work on behalf of humans. The Internet-based latest technology provides the platforms for human
beings to relax and unburden feeling. The Internet of Things (IoT) field efficiently helps human
beings with smart decisions through Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication all over the world.
It has been difficult to ignore the importance of the IoT field with the new development of applications
such as a smartphone in the present era. The IoT field sensor plays a vital role in sensing the intelligent
object/things and making an intelligent decision after sensing the objects. The rapid development
of new applications using smartphones in the world caused all users of the IoT community to be faced
with one major challenge of security in the form of side channel attacks against highly intensive
3D printing systems. The smartphone formulated Intellectual property (IP) of side channel attacks
investigate against 3D printer in the physical domain through reconstructed G-code file through
primitive operations. The smartphone (Nexus 5) solved the main problems such as orientation fixing,
model accuracy of frame size and validate the feasibility and effectiveness in real case studies
against the 3D printer. The 3D printing estimated value reached 20.2 billion of dollars in 2021.
The thermal camera is used for exploring the side channel attacks after reconstructing the objects
against 3D printers. The researcher analyzed IoT security relevant issues which were avoided in
future by enhanced strong security mechanism strategy, encryption, and machine learning-based
algorithms, latest technologies, schemes and protocols utilized in an efficient way. Keywords:
