The systems that operate the infrastructure of cities have evolved in a fragmented fashion across
several generations of technology, causing city utilities and services to operate sub-optimally
and limiting the creation of new value-added services and restrict opportunities for cost-saving.
The integration of cross-domain city data offers a new wave of opportunities to mitigate some of
these impacts and enables city systems to draw effectively on interoperable data that will be used
to deliver smarter cities. Despite the considerable potential of city data, current smart cities
initiatives have mainly addressed the problem of data management from a technology perspective,
and have disregarded stakeholders and data needs. As a consequence, such initiatives are susceptible
to failure from inadequate stakeholder input, requirements neglecting, and information fragmentation
and overload. They are also likely to be limited in terms of both scalability and future proofing
against technological, commercial and legislative change. This paper proposes a systematic business-modeldriven
framework to guide the design of large and highly interconnected data infrastructures which are
provided and supported by multiple stakeholders. The framework is used to model, elicit and reason
about the requirements of the service, technology, organization, value, and governance aspects
of smart cities. The requirements serve as an input to a closed-loop supply chain model, which is
designed and managed to explicitly consider the activities and processes that enables the stakeholders
of smart cities to efficiently leverage their collective knowledge. We demonstrate how our approach
can be used to design data infrastructures by examining a series of exemplary scenarios and by demonstrating
how our approach handles the holistic design of a data infrastructure and informs the decision making
process.
