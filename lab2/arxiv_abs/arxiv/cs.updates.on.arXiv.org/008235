In this paper, an improved numerical solver to evaluate the time-dependent radiative transfer
equation (RTE) for underwater optical wireless communications (UOWC) is investigated. The RTE
evaluates the optical path-loss of light wave in an underwater channel in terms of the inherent optical
properties related to the environments, namely the absorption and scattering coefficients as
well as the phase scattering function (PSF). The proposed numerical algorithm was improved based
on the ones proposed in [1]-[4], by modifying the finite difference scheme proposed in [1] as well
as an enhancement of the quadrature method proposed in [2] by involving a more accurate 7-points
quadrature scheme in order to calculate the quadrature weight coefficients corresponding to the
integral term of the RTE. Furthermore, the scattering angular discretization algorithm used in
[3] and [4] was modified, based on which the receiver's field of view discretization was adapted
correspondingly. Interestingly, the RTE solver has been applied to three volume scattering functions,
namely: the single-term HG phase function, the two-term HG phase function [5], and the Fournier-Forand
phase function [6], over Harbor-I and Harbor-II water types. Based on the normalized received power
evaluated through the proposed algorithm, the bit error rate performance of the UOWC system is investigated
in terms of system and channel parameters. The enhanced algorithm gives a tightly close performance
to its Monte Carlo counterpart improved based on the simulations provided in [7], by adjusting the
numerical cumulative distribution function computation method as well as optimizing the number
of scattering angles. Matlab codes for the proposed RTE solver are presented in [8].
