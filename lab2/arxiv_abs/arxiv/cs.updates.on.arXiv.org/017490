In many classic clustering problems, we seek to sketch a massive data set of $n$ points in a metric
space, by segmenting them into $k$ categories or clusters, each cluster represented concisely
by a single point in the metric space. Two notable examples are the $k$-center/$k$-supplier problem
and the $k$-median problem. In practical applications of clustering, the data set may evolve over
time, reflecting an evolution of the underlying clustering model. In this paper, we initiate the
study of a dynamic version of clustering problems that aims to capture these considerations. In
this version there are $T$ time steps, and in each time step $t\in\{1,2,\dots,T\}$, the set of clients
needed to be clustered may change, and we can move the $k$ facilities between time steps. More specifically,
we study two concrete problems in this framework: the Dynamic Ordered $k$-Median and the Dynamic
$k$-Supplier problem. We first consider the Dynamic Ordered $k$-Median problem, where the objective
is to minimize the weighted sum of ordered distances over all time steps, plus the total cost of moving
the facilities between time steps. We present one constant-factor approximation algorithm for
$T=2$ and another approximation algorithm for fixed $T \geq 3$. Then we consider the Dynamic $k$-Supplier
problem, where the objective is to minimize the maximum distance from any client to its facility,
subject to the constraint that between time steps the maximum distance moved by any facility is no
more than a given threshold. When the number of time steps $T$ is 2, we present a simple constant factor
approximation algorithm and a bi-criteria constant factor approximation algorithm for the outlier
version, where some of the clients can be discarded. We also show that it is NP-hard to approximate
the problem with any factor for $T \geq 3$.
