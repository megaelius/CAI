Safe autonomous navigation is an essential and challenging problem for robots operating in highly
unstructured or completely unknown environments. Under these conditions, not only robotic systems
must deal with limited localisation information, but also their manoeuvrability is constrained
by their dynamics and often suffer from uncertainty. In order to cope with these constraints, this
manuscript proposes an uncertainty-based framework for mapping and planning feasible motions
online with probabilistic safety-guarantees. The proposed approach deals with the motion, probabilistic
safety, and online computation constraints by: (i) incrementally mapping the surroundings to
build an uncertainty-aware representation of the environment, and (ii) iteratively (re)planning
trajectories to goal that are kinodynamically feasible and probabilistically safe through a multi-layered
sampling-based planner in the belief space. In-depth empirical analyses illustrate some important
properties of this approach, namely, (a) the multi-layered planning strategy enables rapid exploration
of the high-dimensional belief space while preserving asymptotic optimality and completeness
guarantees, and (b) the proposed routine for probabilistic collision checking results in tighter
probability bounds in comparison to other uncertainty-aware planners in the literature. Furthermore,
real-world in-water experimental evaluation on a non-holonomic torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater
vehicle and simulated trials in the Stairwell scenario of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge 2019
on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle demonstrate the efficacy of the method as well as its suitability
for systems with limited on-board computational power.
