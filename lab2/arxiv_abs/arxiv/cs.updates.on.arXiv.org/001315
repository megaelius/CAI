Although the definition of what empathetic preferences exactly are is still evolving, there is
a general consensus in the psychology, science and engineering communities that the evolution
toward players' behaviors in interactive decision-making problems will be accompanied by the
exploitation of their empathy, sympathy, compassion, antipathy, spitefulness, selfishness,
altruism, and self-abnegating states in the payoffs. In this article, we study one-shot bimatrix
games from a psychological game theory viewpoint. A new empathetic payoff model is calculated to
fit empirical observations and both pure and mixed equilibria are investigated. For a realized
empathy structure, the bimatrix game is categorized among four generic class of games. Number of
interesting results are derived. A notable level of involvement can be observed in the empathetic
one-shot game compared the non-empathetic one and this holds even for games with dominated strategies.
Partial altruism can help in breaking symmetry, in reducing payoff-inequality and in selecting
social welfare and more efficient outcomes. By contrast, partial spite and self-abnegating may
worsen payoff equity. Empathetic evolutionary game dynamics are introduced to capture the resulting
empathetic evolutionarily stable strategies under wide range of revision protocols including
Brown-von Neumann-Nash, Smith, imitation, replicator, and hybrid dynamics. Finally, mutual
support and Berge solution are investigated and their connection with empathetic preferences
are established. We show that pure altruism is logically inconsistent, only by balancing it with
some partial selfishness does it create a consistent psychology.
