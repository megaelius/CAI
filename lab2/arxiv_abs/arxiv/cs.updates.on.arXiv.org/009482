Typically, a medical image offers spatial information on the anatomy (and pathology) modulated
by imaging specific characteristics. Many imaging modalities including Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) can be interpreted in this way. We can venture further and consider
that a medical image naturally factors into some spatial factors depicting anatomy and factors
that denote the imaging characteristics. Here, we explicitly learn this decomposed (factorised)
representation of imaging data, focusing in particular on cardiac images. We propose Spatial Decomposition
Network (SDNet), which factorises 2D medical images into spatial anatomical factors and non-spatial
modality factors. We demonstrate that this high-level representation is ideally suited for several
medical image analysis tasks, such as semi-supervised segmentation, multi-task segmentation
and regression, and image-to-image synthesis. Specifically, we show that our model can match the
performance of fully supervised segmentation models, using only a fraction of the labelled images.
Critically, we show that our factorised representation also benefits from supervision obtained
either when we use auxiliary tasks to train the model in a multi-task setting (e.g. regressing to
known cardiac indices), or when aggregating multimodal data from different sources (e.g. pooling
together MRI and CT data). To explore the properties of the learned factorisation, we perform latent-space
arithmetic and show that we can synthesise CT from MR and vice versa, by swapping the modality factors.
We also demonstrate that the factor holding image specific information can be used to predict the
input modality with high accuracy. Code will be made available at https://github.com/agis85/anatomy_modality_decomposition.
