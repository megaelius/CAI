Mobile app distribution platforms such as Google Play Store allow users to share their feedback
about downloaded apps in the form of a review comment and a corresponding star rating. Typically,
the star rating ranges from one to five stars, with one star denoting a high sense of dissatisfaction
with the app and five stars denoting a high sense of satisfaction. Unfortunately, due to a variety
of reasons, often the star rating provided by a user is inconsistent with the opinion expressed in
the review. For example, consider the following review for the Facebook App on Android; "Awesome
App". One would reasonably expect the rating for this review to be five stars, but the actual rating
is one star! Such inconsistent ratings can lead to a deflated (or inflated) overall average rating
of an app which can affect user downloads, as typically users look at the average star ratings while
making a decision on downloading an app. Also, the app developers receive a biased feedback about
the application that does not represent ground reality. This is especially significant for small
apps with a few thousand downloads as even a small number of mismatched reviews can bring down the
average rating drastically. In this paper, we conducted a study on this review-rating mismatch
problem. We manually examined 8600 reviews from 10 popular Android apps and found that 20% of the
ratings in our dataset were inconsistent with the review. Further, we developed three systems;
two of which were based on traditional machine learning and one on deep learning to automatically
identify reviews whose rating did not match with the opinion expressed in the review. Our deep learning
system performed the best and had an accuracy of 92% in identifying the correct star rating to be associated
with a given review.
