Rapid advances in wireless communication technologies coupled with ongoing massive development
in vehicular networking standards and innovations in computing, sensing, and analytics have paved
the way for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) to develop rapidly in the near future. ITS
provides a complete solution for the efficient and intelligent management of real-time traffic,
wherein sensory data is collected from within the vehicles (i.e., via their onboard units) as well
as data exchanged between the vehicles, between the vehicles and their supporting roadside infrastructure/network,
among the vehicles and vulnerable pedestrians, subsequently paving the way for the realization
of the futuristic Internet of Vehicles. The traditional intent of an ITS system is to detect, monitor,
control, and subsequently reduce traffic congestion based on a real-time analysis of the data pertinent
to certain patterns of the road traffic, including traffic density at a geographical area of interest,
precise velocity of vehicles, current and predicted travelling trajectories and times, etc. However,
merely relying on an ITS framework is not an optimal solution. In case of dense traffic environments,
where communication broadcasts from hundreds of thousands of vehicles could potentially choke
the entire network (and so could lead to fatal accidents in the case of autonomous vehicles that depend
on reliable communications for their operational safety), a fall back to the traditional decentralized
vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) approach becomes necessary. It is therefore of critical importance
to enhance the situational awareness of vehicular drivers so as to enable them to make quick but well-founded
manual decisions in such safety-critical situations.
