Artefacts play a vital role in software and systems development processes. Other terms like documents,
deliverables, or work products are widely used in software development communities instead of
the term artefact. In the following, we use the term `artefact' including all these other terms.
Despite its relevance, the exact denotation of the term `artefact' is still not clear due to a variety
of different understandings of the term and to a careless negligent usage. This often leads to approaches
being grounded in a fuzzy, unclear understanding of the essential concepts involved. In fact, there
does not exist a common terminology. Therefore, it is our goal that the term artefact be standardised
so that researchers and practitioners have a common understanding for discussions and contributions.
In this position paper, we provide a positioning and critical reflection upon the notion of artefact
in software engineering at different levels of perception and how these relate to each other. We
further contribute a meta model that provides a description of an artefact that is independent from
any underlying process model. This meta model defines artefacts at three levels. Abstraction and
refinement relations between these levels allow correlating artefacts to each other and defining
the notion of related, refined, and equivalent artefacts. Our contribution shall foster the long
overdue and too often underestimated terminological discussion on what artefacts are to provide
a common ground with clearer concepts and principles for future software engineering contributions,
such as the design of artefact-oriented development processes and tools.
