Collective sensing is an emergent phenomenon which enables individuals to estimate a hidden property
of the environment through the observation of social interactions. Previous work on collective
sensing shows that gregarious individuals obtain an evolutionary advantage by exploiting collective
sensing when competing against solitary individuals. This work addresses the question of whether
collective sensing allows for the emergence of groups from a population of individuals without
predetermined behaviors. It is assumed that group membership does not lessen competition on the
limited resources in the environment, e.g. groups do not improve foraging efficiency. Experiments
are run in an agent-based evolutionary model of a foraging task, where the fitness of the agents depends
on their foraging strategy. The foraging strategy of agents is determined by a neural network, which
does not require explicit modeling of the environment and of the interactions between agents. Experiments
demonstrate that gregarious behavior is not the evolutionary-fittest strategy if resources are
abundant, thus invalidating previous findings in a specific region of the parameter space. In other
words, resource scarcity makes gregarious behavior so valuable as to make up for the increased competition
over the few available resources. Furthermore, it is shown that a population of solitary agents
can evolve gregarious behavior in response to a sudden scarcity of resources, thus individuating
a possible mechanism that leads to gregarious behavior in nature. The evolutionary process operates
on the whole parameter space of the neural networks, hence these behaviors are selected among an
unconstrained set of behavioral models.
