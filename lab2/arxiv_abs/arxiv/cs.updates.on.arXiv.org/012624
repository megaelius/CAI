In many research fields, the sizes of the existing datasets vary widely. Hence, there is a need for
machine learning techniques which are well-suited for these different datasets. One possible
technique is the self-organizing map (SOM), a type of artificial neural network which is, so far,
weakly represented in the field of machine learning. The SOM's unique characteristic is the neighborhood
relationship of the output neurons. This relationship improves the ability of generalization
on small datasets. SOMs are mostly applied in unsupervised learning and few studies focus on using
SOMs as supervised learning approach. Furthermore, no appropriate SOM package is available with
respect to machine learning standards and in the widely used programming language Python. In this
paper, we introduce the freely available Supervised Self-organizing maps (SuSi) Python package
which performs supervised regression and classification. The implementation of SuSi is described
with respect to the underlying mathematics. Then, we present first evaluations of the SOM for regression
and classification datasets from two different domains of geospatial image analysis. Despite
the early stage of its development, the SuSi framework performs well and is characterized by only
small performance differences between the training and the test datasets. A comparison of the SuSi
framework with existing Python and R packages demonstrates the importance of the SuSi framework.
In future work, the SuSi framework will be extended, optimized and upgraded e.g. with tools to better
understand and visualize the input data as well as the handling of missing and incomplete data.
