Financial crime is a large and growing problem, in some way touching almost every financial institution.
Financial institutions are the front line in the war against financial crime and accordingly, must
devote substantial human and technology resources to this effort. Current processes to detect
financial misconduct have limitations in their ability to effectively differentiate between
malicious behavior and ordinary financial activity. These limitations tend to result in gross
over-reporting of suspicious activity that necessitate time-intensive and costly manual review.
Advances in technology used in this domain, including machine learning based approaches, can improve
upon the effectiveness of financial institutions' existing processes, however, a key challenge
that most financial institutions continue to face is that they address financial crimes in isolation
without any insight from other firms. Where financial institutions address financial crimes through
the lens of their own firm, perpetrators may devise sophisticated strategies that may span across
institutions and geographies. Financial institutions continue to work relentlessly to advance
their capabilities, forming partnerships across institutions to share insights, patterns and
capabilities. These public-private partnerships are subject to stringent regulatory and data
privacy requirements, thereby making it difficult to rely on traditional technology solutions.
In this paper, we propose a methodology to share key information across institutions by using a federated
graph learning platform that enables us to build more accurate machine learning models by leveraging
federated learning and also graph learning approaches. We demonstrated that our federated model
outperforms local model by 20% with the UK FCA TechSprint data set. This new platform opens up a door
to efficiently detecting global money laundering activity.
