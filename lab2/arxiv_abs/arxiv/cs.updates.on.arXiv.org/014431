Due to the pivotal role of UV photodiodes in many technological applications in tandem with the high
efficiency achieved by machine learning techniques in regression and classification problems,
different artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are adopted to simulate and model the performance
of organic/inorganic heterojunction UV photodiode. Herein, the performance of a fabricated Au/NTCDA/p-Si/Al
photodiode was explained in details and showed an excellent responsivity, and detectivity for
UV light of intensities ranges from 20 to 80 ${mW/cm^2}$. The fabricated photodiodes exhibited
a linear current-irradiance relationship under illumination up to 65 ${mW/cm^2}$. It also exhibits
good response times of t_rise = 408 ms and t_fall = 490 ms. Furthermore, we have not only fitted the
characteristic I-V curve at the highlighted intensities but also evaluated three classical algorithms;
k-nearest neighbour (KNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and genetic programming (GP) besides
using a quantum neural network (QNN) to predict the behaviour of the fabricated device inside and
outside the studied illumination intensity range. The ANN method achieved the highest accuracy
under dark and illumination conditions with a mean squared error ${~1.6812\times10^{-11}}$ on
the testing data. On the other hand, the Continuous-Variable (CV) QNN - using only one Qumode - has
been used for the first time to model the performance of the fabricated photodiode and achieved an
acceptable result with the lowest parameter set. Besides, we have utilised the full space of only
one Qumode for encoding the two features using the Displaced Squeezed state preparation routine.
