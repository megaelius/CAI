Dynamic contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) is an imaging technique that provides critical
information on the relationship of vascular structure and dynamics in the context of underlying
anatomy. A key challenge for image processing with contrast enhanced CT is that phase discrepancies
are latent in different tissues due to contrast protocols, vascular dynamics, and metabolism variance.
Previous studies with deep learning frameworks have been proposed for classifying contrast enhancement
with networks inspired by computer vision. Here, we revisit the challenge in the context of whole
abdomen contrast enhanced CTs. To capture and compensate for the complex contrast changes, we propose
a novel discriminator in the form of a multi-domain disentangled representation learning network.
The goal of this network is to learn an intermediate representation that separates contrast enhancement
from anatomy and enables classification of images with varying contrast time. Briefly, our unpaired
contrast disentangling GAN(CD-GAN) Discriminator follows the ResNet architecture to classify
a CT scan from different enhancement phases. To evaluate the approach, we trained the enhancement
phase classifier on 21060 slices from two clinical cohorts of 230 subjects. Testing was performed
on 9100 slices from 30 independent subjects who had been imaged with CT scans from all contrast phases.
Performance was quantified in terms of the multi-class normalized confusion matrix. The proposed
network significantly improved correspondence over baseline UNet, ResNet50 and StarGAN performance
of accuracy scores 0.54. 0.55, 0.62 and 0.91, respectively. The proposed discriminator from the
disentangled network presents a promising technique that may allow deeper modeling of dynamic
imaging against patient specific anatomies.
