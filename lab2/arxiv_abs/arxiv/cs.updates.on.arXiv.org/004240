The analysis of glandular morphology within colon histopathology images is a crucial step in determining
the stage of colon cancer. Despite the importance of this task, manual segmentation is laborious,
time-consuming and can suffer from subjectivity among pathologists. The rise of computational
pathology has led to the development of automated methods for gland segmentation that aim to overcome
the challenges of manual segmentation. However, this task is non-trivial due to the large variability
in glandular appearance and the difficulty in differentiating between certain glandular and non-glandular
histological structures. Furthermore, within pathological practice, a measure of uncertainty
is essential for diagnostic decision making. For example, ambiguous areas may require further
examination from numerous pathologists. To address these challenges, we propose a fully convolutional
neural network that counters the loss of information caused by max- pooling by re-introducing the
original image at multiple points within the network. We also use atrous spatial pyramid pooling
with varying dilation rates for resolution maintenance and multi-level aggregation. To incorporate
uncertainty, we introduce random transformations during test time for an enhanced segmentation
result that simultaneously generates an uncertainty map, highlighting areas of ambiguity. We
show that this map can be used to define a metric for disregarding predictions with high uncertainty.
The proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GlaS challenge dataset, as
part of MICCAI 2015, and on a second independent colorectal adenocarcinoma dataset.
