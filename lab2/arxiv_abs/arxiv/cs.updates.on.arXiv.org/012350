The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming our physical world into a complex and dynamic system
of connected devices on an unprecedented scale. Connecting everyday physical objects is creating
new business models, improving processes and reducing costs and risks. Recently, blockchain technology
has received a lot of attention from the community as a possible solution to overcome security issues
in IoT. However, traditional blockchains (such as the ones used in Bitcoin and Ethereum) are not
well suited to the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices and also with the large volume of information
that is expected to be generated from typical IoT deployments. To overcome these issues, several
researchers have presented lightweight instances of blockchains tailored for IoT. For example,
proposing novel data structures based on blocks with decoupled and appendable data. However, these
researchers did not discuss how the consensus algorithm would impact their solutions, i.e., the
decision of which consensus algorithm would be better suited was left as an open issue. In this paper,
we improved an appendable-block blockchain framework to support different consensus algorithms
through a modular design. We evaluated the performance of this improved version in different emulated
scenarios and studied the impact of varying the number of devices and transactions and employing
different consensus algorithms. Even adopting different consensus algorithms, results indicate
that the latency to append a new block is less than 161ms (in the more demanding scenario) and the delay
for processing a new transaction is less than 7ms, suggesting that our improved version of the appendable-block
blockchain is efficient and scalable, and thus well suited for IoT scenarios.
