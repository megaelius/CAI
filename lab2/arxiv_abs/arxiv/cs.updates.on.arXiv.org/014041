The Attitude Determination and Control System is one of the critical boards of any satellite, specially
the micro-satellites. The ADCS is the bridge linking sensors data to actuators by several computationally
complex algorithms such as Extended Kalman Filter, Detumbling and Tumbling controller and so on.
In this thesis, I will focus on the implementation of each of the required algorithms and then make
a whole integrated package. This thesis focuses on developing the first version of the on-board
computer software for ADCS of SSS-1P and required preliminary tests to assure the minimum performance
of the provided package with Software-In-the-Loop and Processor-In-the-Loop tests. In this thesis,
I will introduce the fundamental dynamic and kinematic non-linear equations. The linearization
for a specific prerational condition and the assumptions to achieve the linearization will be introduced.
The model will be linearized for a specific operating condition for the design and development of
the controllers. The disturbances including atmospheric drag, solar radiation and so on are also
introduced with regarding to the operating Altitude (500 ~ 600 km). The brief introduction of different
magnetic field models and their differences will be introduced as well. In addition, the SGP4 predictive
model to estimate the position and the velocity of the satellite discussed. In addition, the thesis
describes the software development phase, some additional algorithms that I implemented but they
are not a part of mathematical models, such as system manager, time manager and so on with pseudo code.
The architecture of the software is also described in this section. Finally, the numerical simulations
are analysed and the simple compression between tests results from PIL, SIL, and MATLAB simulation
are presented. This section will presents the validation and the trustworthy of the final package.
