Food packaging labels provide important information for public health, such as allergens and use-by
dates. Off-the-shelf Optical Character Verification (OCV) systems are good solutions for automating
food label quality assessments, but are known to under perform on complex data. This paper proposes
a Deep Learning based system that can identify inadequate images for OCV, due to their poor label
quality, by employing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, and
practical Bayesian inference techniques for automatic self-annotation. We propose a practical
domain adaptation procedure based on k-means clustering of CNN latent variables, followed by a
k-Nearest Neighbour classification for handling high label variability between different dataset
distributions. Moreover, Supervised Learning has proven useful in such systems but manual annotation
of large amounts of data is usually required. This is practically intractable in most real world
problems due to time/labour constraints. In an attempt to address this issue, we introduce a self-annotating
prediction model based on Self-Training of a Bayesian CNN, that leverages modern variational inference
methods of deep models. In this context, we propose a new inverse uncertainty weighting technique
that encourages the Self-Training model to learn from more informative data over time, potentially
preventing it from becoming lazy by only selecting easy examples to learn from. An experimental
study is presented illustrating the superior performance of the proposed approach over standard
Self-Training, and highlighting the importance of predictive uncertainty estimates in safety-critical
domains.
