In this paper I elaborated on the idea of David Harel and Amir Pnueli to distinguish systems according
to their compositional behavior. The basic idea is to assume a functional relation between state
functions as the system-constituting property, allowing to partition the world into a system and
a rest. The obvious idea to base the composition of systems on the concept of computable functions
and their compositional behavior leads to supersystem formation by composing simple and recursive
systems. But this approach does not allow to account adequately for systems that interact with many
other systems in a stateful and nondeterministic way which is why I introduce the concept of interactivity
and cooperation. In order to describe interactive systems satisfactorily, a balance is needed
between the representation of their relationship to all the other systems and what happens within
the systems. I thus introduce the complementary descriptions of external interactions and internal
coordination, both based on a role concept in the sense of a projection of a system onto its interactions.
Beside the interesting distinction between composition, cooperation and coordination, the presented
approach also fits well with other rather well known concepts. First the concept of components and
interfaces. Components become systems with a well defined compositional behavior were the interface
concept captures both, the transformational and the compositional behavior of a system in its interactions.
Another tightly related concept is that of decisions and games. I introduce the concept of decisions
as an additional internal input alphabet in order to determine nondeterministic interactions
and thus fictitiously assume a system function where we actually do not have the knowledge to do so.
Thus, the close relationship between protocols and games becomes obvious.
