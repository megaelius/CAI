The Lightning Network promises to alleviate Bitcoin's known scalability problems. The operation
of such second layer approaches relies on the ability of participants to turn to the blockchain to
claim funds at any time, which is assumed to happen rarely. One of the risks that was identified early
on is that of a wide systemic attack on the protocol, in which an attacker triggers the closure of many
Lightning channels at once. The resulting high volume of transactions in the blockchain will not
allow for the proper settlement of all debts, and attackers may get away with stealing some funds.
This paper explores the details of such an attack and evaluates its cost and overall impact on Bitcoin
and the Lightning Network. Specifically, we show that an attacker is able to simultaneously cause
victim nodes to overload the Bitcoin blockchain with requests and to steal funds that were locked
in channels. We go on to examine the interaction of Lightning nodes with the fee estimation mechanism
and show that the attacker can continuously lower the fee of transactions that will later be used
by the victim in its attempts to recover funds - eventually reaching a state in which only low fractions
of the block are available for lightning transactions. Our attack is made easier even further as
the Lightning protocol allows the attacker to increase the fee offered by his own transactions.
We continue to empirically show that the vast majority of nodes agree to channel opening requests
from unknown sources and are therefore susceptible to this attack. We highlight differences between
various implementations of the Lightning Network protocol and review the susceptibility of each
one to the attack. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies to lower the systemic attack risk of
the network.
