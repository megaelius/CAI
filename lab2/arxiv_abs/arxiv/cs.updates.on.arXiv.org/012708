With the ever increasing power rates of wind turbines, more advanced control techniques are needed
to facilitate tall towers that are low-weight and cost effective, but in effect more flexible. Such
soft-soft tower configurations generally have their fundamental side-side frequency in the below-rated
operational domain. Because the turbine rotor practically has or develops a mass imbalance over
time, a periodic and rotor-speed dependent side-side excitation is present during below-rated
operation. Persistent operation at the coinciding tower and rotational frequency degrades the
expected structural life span. To reduce this effect, earlier work has shown the effectiveness
of active tower damping control strategies using collective pitch control. A more passive approach
is frequency skipping by inclusion of speed exclusion zones, which avoids prolonged operation
near the critical frequency. However, neither of the methods incorporate a convenient way of performing
a trade-off between energy maximization and fatigue load minimization. Therefore, this paper
introduces a quasi-linear parameter varying model predictive control (qLPV-MPC) scheme, exploiting
the beneficial (convex) properties of a qLPV system description. The qLPV model is obtained by a
demodulation transformation, and is subsequently augmented with a simple wind turbine model.
Results show the effectiveness of the algorithm in synthetic and realistic simulations using the
NREL 5-MW reference wind turbine in high-fidelity simulation code. Prolonged rotor speed operation
at the tower side-side natural frequency is prevented, whereas when the trade-off is in favor of
energy production, the algorithm decides to rapidly pass over the natural frequency to attain higher
rotor speeds and power productions.
