In this paper, we propose a novel design of image deblurring in the form of one-shot convolution filtering
that can directly convolve with naturally blurred images for restoration. The problem of optical
blurring is a common disadvantage to many imaging applications that suffer from optical imperfections.
Despite numerous deconvolution methods that blindly estimate blurring in either inclusive or
exclusive forms, they are practically challenging due to high computational cost and limited image
quality reconstruction. Both conditions of high accuracy and high speed are prerequisite for high-throughput
imaging platforms in digital archiving. It becomes equally important as reconstruction accuracy
that how quickly the implemented algorithms are capable of recovering the latent images? In such
platforms, deblurring is required after image acquisition to feed into the communication pipeline
to be either stored, previewed, or processed for high-level interpretation. Therefore, on-the-fly
correction of such images are highly preferred to avoid possible time delays, mitigate computational
expenses, and increase the image perception quality. We bridge this gap by synthesizing a deconvolution
kernel as a linear combination of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) even derivative filters that can
be directly convolved with input blurry images to boost the frequency falloff of the Point Spread
Function (PSF) associated with the optical blur. We employ a Gaussian lowpass filter to decouple
the image denoising problem for image edge deblurring. Furthermore, we propose a blind approach
to estimate the PSF statistics for two Gaussian and Laplacian models that are common in many imaging
pipelines. Thorough experiments are designed to test and validate the efficiency of the proposed
method using 2054 naturally blurred images across six imaging applications and seven state-of-the-art
deconvolution methods.
