This paper introduces a packet-based dual-rate control strategy to face time-varying network-induced
delays, packet dropouts and packet disorder in a Networked Control System. Slow-rate sensing enables
to achieve energy saving by reducing network load. In addition, choosing a slower sensing period
than the longest round-trip time delay can avoid packet disorder. On the other hand, a slow-rate
sensing usually degrades control performance in a conventional control framework. Therefore,
including dual-rate control techniques can be useful to maintain the desired performance, since
the controller is able to generate a fast-rate control signal from a slow-rate sensing signal. A
dual-rate PID controller is used, which can be split into two parts: a slow-rate PI controller is
located at the remote side (with no permanent communication to the plant) and a fast-rate PD controller,
at the local side (close to the plant, sensor, and inside the actuator, which can offer a low computation
power). In addition, at the remote side, where a powerful computation device is located, a prediction
stage is included in order to generate the packet of future, estimated slow-rate control actions
to be sent to the local side. At this side, these actions are converted to fast-rate ones and used when
a packet does not arrive due to the network-induced delay or due to occurring dropouts. The control
proposal is able to reach the nominal (no-dropout, no-delay) performance despite the existence
of time-varying delays and packet dropouts. Via real-time control for a Cartesian robot, results
clearly reveal the superiority of the control approach compared to a previous authors\' proposal,
where the time-varying delays are faced by means of a gain scheduling control strategy.
