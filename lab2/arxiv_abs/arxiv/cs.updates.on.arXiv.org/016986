In robotics, methods and softwares usually require optimizations of hyperparameters in order
to be efficient for specific tasks, for instance industrial bin-picking from homogeneous heaps
of different objects. We present a developmental framework based on long-term memory and reasoning
modules (Bayesian Optimisation, visual similarity and parameters bounds reduction) allowing
a robot to use meta-learning mechanism increasing the efficiency of such continuous and constrained
parameters optimizations. The new optimization, viewed as a learning for the robot, can take advantage
of past experiences (stored in the episodic and procedural memories) to shrink the search space
by using reduced parameters bounds computed from the best optimizations realized by the robot with
similar tasks of the new one (e.g. bin-picking from an homogenous heap of a similar object, based
on visual similarity of objects stored in the semantic memory). As example, we have confronted the
system to the constrained optimizations of 9 continuous hyperparameters for a professional software
(Kamido) in industrial robotic arm bin-picking tasks, a step that is needed each time to handle correctly
new object. We used a simulator to create bin-picking tasks for 8 different objects (7 in simulation
and one with real setup, without and with meta-learning with experiences coming from other similar
objects) achieving goods results despite a very small optimization budget, with a better performance
reached when meta-learning is used (84.3% vs 78.9% of success overall, with a small budget of 30 iterations
for each optimization) for every object tested (p-value=0.036).
