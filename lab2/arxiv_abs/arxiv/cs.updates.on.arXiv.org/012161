A two-layer neural network model that systematically includes correlations among input variables
to arbitrary order and is designed to implement Bayes inference has been adapted to classify breast
cancer tumors as malignant or benign, assigning a probability for either outcome. The inputs to
the network represent measured characteristics of cell nuclei imaged in Fine Needle Aspiration
biopsies. The present machine-learning approach to diagnosis (known as HOPP, for higher-order
probabilistic perceptron) is tested on the much-studied, open-access Breast Cancer Wisconsin
(Diagnosis) Data Set of Wolberg et al. This set lists, for each tumor, measured physical parameters
of the cell nuclei of each sample. The HOPP model can identify the key factors -- input features and
their combinations -- most relevant for reliable diagnosis. HOPP networks were trained on 90\%
of the examples in the Wisconsin database, and tested on the remaining 10\%. Referred to ensembles
of 300 networks, selected randomly for cross-validation, accuracy of classification for the test
sets of up to 97\% was readily achieved, with standard deviation around 2\%, together with average
Matthews correlation coefficients reaching 0.94 indicating excellent predictive performance.
Demonstrably, the HOPP is capable of matching the predictive power attained by other advanced machine-learning
algorithms applied to this much-studied database, over several decades. Analysis shows that in
this special problem, which is almost linearly separable, the effects of irreducible correlations
among the measured features of the Wisconsin database are of relatively minor importance, as the
Naive Bayes approximation can itself yield predictive accuracy approaching 95\%. The advantages
of the HOPP algorithm will be more clearly revealed in application to more challenging machine-learning
problems.
