Because of their capacity-approaching performance and their complexity/latency advantages,
spatially-coupled (SC) codes are among the most attractive error-correcting codes for use in modern
dense data storage systems. SC codes are constructed by partitioning an underlying block code and
coupling the partitioned components. Here, we focus on circulant-based SC codes. Recently, the
optimal overlap (OO), circulant power optimizer (CPO) approach was introduced to construct high
performance SC codes for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Flash channels. The OO stage operates
on the protograph of the SC code to derive the optimal partitioning that minimizes the number of graphical
objects that undermine the performance of SC codes under iterative decoding. Then, the CPO optimizes
the circulant powers to further reduce this number. Since the nature of detrimental objects in the
graph of a code critically depends on the characteristics of the channel of interest, extending
the OO-CPO approach to construct SC codes for channels with intrinsic memory is not a straightforward
task. In this paper, we tackle one relevant extension; we construct high performance SC codes for
practical 1-D magnetic recording channels, i.e., partial-response (PR) channels. Via combinatorial
techniques, we carefully build and solve the optimization problem of the OO partitioning, focusing
on the objects of interest in the case of PR channels. Then, we customize the CPO to further reduce
the number of these objects in the graph of the code. SC codes designed using the proposed OO-CPO approach
for PR channels outperform prior state-of-the-art SC codes by up to around 3 orders of magnitude
in frame error rate (FER) and 1.1 dB in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). More intriguingly, our SC codes
outperform structured block codes of the same length and rate by up to around 1.8 orders of magnitude
in FER and 0.4 dB in SNR.
