Hysteresis phenomena have been observed in different branches of physics and engineering sciences.
Therefore, several models have been proposed for hysteresis simulation in different fields; however,
almost neither of them can be utilized universally. In this paper by inspiring of Preisach Neural
Network which was inspired by the Preisach model that basically stemmed from Madelungs rules and
using the learning capability of the neural networks, an adaptive universal model for hysteresis
is introduced and called Extended Preisach Neural Network Model. It is comprised of input, output
and, two hidden layers. The input and output layers contain linear neurons while the first hidden
layer incorporates neurons called Deteriorating Stop neurons, which their activation function
follows Deteriorating Stop operator. Deteriorating Stop operators can generate non-congruent
hysteresis loops. The second hidden layer includes Sigmoidal neurons. Adding the second hidden
layer, helps the neural network learn non-Masing and asymmetric hysteresis loops very smoothly.
At the input layer, besides input data the rate at which input data changes, is included as well in
order to give the model the capability of learning rate-dependent hysteresis loops. Hence, the
proposed approach has the capability of the simulation of both rate-independent and rate-dependent
hysteresis with either congruent or non-congruent loops as well as symmetric and asymmetric loops.
A new hybridized algorithm has been adopted for training the model which is based on a combination
of the Genetic Algorithm and the optimization method of sub-gradient with space dilatation. The
generality of the proposed model has been evaluated by applying it to various hysteresis from different
areas of engineering with different characteristics. The results show that the model is successful
in the identification of the considered hystereses.
