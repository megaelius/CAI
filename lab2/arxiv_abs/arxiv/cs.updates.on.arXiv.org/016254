Face morphing attacks have raised critical concerns as they demonstrate a new vulnerability of
Face Recognition Systems (FRS), which are widely deployed in border control applications. The
face morphing process uses the images from multiple data subjects and performs an image blending
operation to generate a morphed image of high quality. The generated morphed image exhibits similar
visual characteristics corresponding to the biometric characteristics of the data subjects that
contributed to the composite image and thus making it difficult for both humans and FRS, to detect
such attacks. In this paper, we report a systematic investigation on the vulnerability of the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf
(COTS) FRS when morphed images under the influence of ageing are presented. To this extent, we have
introduced a new morphed face dataset with ageing derived from the publicly available MORPH II face
dataset, which we refer to as MorphAge dataset. The dataset has two bins based on age intervals, the
first bin - MorphAge-I dataset has 1002 unique data subjects with the age variation of 1 year to 2 years
while the MorphAge-II dataset consists of 516 data subjects whose age intervals are from 2 years
to 5 years. To effectively evaluate the vulnerability for morphing attacks, we also introduce a
new evaluation metric, namely the Fully Mated Morphed Presentation Match Rate (FMMPMR), to quantify
the vulnerability effectively in a realistic scenario. Extensive experiments are carried out
by using two different COTS FRS (COTS I - Cognitec and COTS II - Neurotechnology) to quantify the vulnerability
with ageing. Further, we also evaluate five different Morph Attack Detection (MAD) techniques
to benchmark their detection performance with ageing.
