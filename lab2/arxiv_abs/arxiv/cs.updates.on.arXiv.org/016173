Cluster of viral pneumonia occurrences during a short period of time may be a harbinger of an outbreak
or pandemic, like SARS, MERS, and recent COVID-19. Rapid and accurate detection of viral pneumonia
using chest X-ray can be significantly useful in large-scale screening and epidemic prevention,
particularly when other chest imaging modalities are less available. Viral pneumonia often have
diverse causes and exhibit notably different visual appearances on X-ray images. The evolution
of viruses and the emergence of novel mutated viruses further result in substantial dataset shift,
which greatly limits the performance of classification approaches. In this paper, we formulate
the task of differentiating viral pneumonia from non-viral pneumonia and healthy controls into
an one-class classification-based anomaly detection problem, and thus propose the confidence-aware
anomaly detection (CAAD) model, which consists of a shared feature extractor, an anomaly detection
module, and a confidence prediction module. If the anomaly score produced by the anomaly detection
module is large enough or the confidence score estimated by the confidence prediction module is
small enough, we accept the input as an anomaly case (i.e., viral pneumonia). The major advantage
of our approach over binary classification is that we avoid modeling individual viral pneumonia
classes explicitly and treat all known viral pneumonia cases as anomalies to reinforce the one-class
model. The proposed model outperforms binary classification models on the clinical X-VIRAL dataset
that contains 5,977 viral pneumonia (no COVID-19) cases, 18,619 non-viral pneumonia cases, and
18,774 healthy controls.
