Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is an established methodology to support decision making
of multi-objective problems. For conducting a MCDA, in most cases a set of objectives (SOO) is required
which consists of a hierarchical structure with objectives, criteria and indicators. The development
of a SOO may require high organizational effort. This article introduces elementary interactions
as a key paradigm for the development of a SOO. Elementary interactions are self-contained information
requests that can be answered with little cognitive effort, which are made and processed with the
help of a web platform. Each elementary interaction contributes to the stepwise development of
a SOO. Based on the hypothesis that a SOO can be developed exclusively with elementary interactions,
a platform concept is described. Essential components of the platform are a Model Aggregator, an
Elementary Interaction Stream Generator, a Participant Manager and a Discussion Forum. The platform
concept has been evaluated in a pilot study using a web-based prototype. In summary, the proposed
concept demonstrates the potential to advance the development of sets of objectives for MCDA applications:
(1) The platform concept does not restrict the application domain, (2) it is intended to work with
little administration efforts, (3) it lowers the organizational effort for developing a SOO. (3)
it supports the further development of an existing SOO in the event of significant changes in external
conditions. (4) The development process of the SOO can be recorded by the platform and thus becomes
retraceable. The reproducibility may have a positive effect on the spread of MCDA applications.
The traceability and the use of elementary interactions make the platform appear to be a suitable
medium for Citizen Science-based approaches to the development of MCDA applications.
