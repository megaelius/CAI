The reconstruction of a species phylogeny from genomic data faces two significant hurdles: 1) the
trees describing the evolution of each individual gene--i.e., the gene trees--may differ from
the species phylogeny and 2) the molecular sequences corresponding to each gene often provide limited
information about the gene trees themselves. In this paper we consider an approach to species tree
reconstruction that addresses both these hurdles. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for phylogeny
reconstruction under the multispecies coalescent model with a standard model of site substitution.
The multispecies coalescent is commonly used to model gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage
sorting, a well-studied population-genetic effect. In previous work, an information-theoretic
trade-off was derived in this context between the number of loci, $m$, needed for an accurate reconstruction
and the length of the locus sequences, $k$. It was shown that to reconstruct an internal branch of
length $f$, one needs $m$ to be of the order of $1/[f^{2} \sqrt{k}]$. That previous result was obtained
under the molecular clock assumption, i.e., under the assumption that mutation rates (as well as
population sizes) are constant across the species phylogeny. Here we generalize this result beyond
the restrictive molecular clock assumption, and obtain a new reconstruction algorithm that has
the same data requirement (up to log factors). Our main contribution is a novel reduction to the molecular
clock case under the multispecies coalescent. As a corollary, we also obtain a new identifiability
result of independent interest: for any species tree with $n \geq 3$ species, the rooted species
tree can be identified from the distribution of its unrooted weighted gene trees even in the absence
of a molecular clock.
