Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enables power-domain multiplexing via successive interference
cancellation (SIC) and has been viewed as a promising technology for 5G communication. The full
benefit of NOMA depends on resource allocation, including power allocation and channel assignment,
for all users, which, however, leads to mixed integer programs. In the literature, the optimal power
allocation has only been found in some special cases, while the joint optimization of power allocation
and channel assignment generally requires exhaustive search. In this paper, we investigate resource
allocation in downlink NOMA systems. As the main contribution, we analytically characterize the
optimal power allocation with given channel assignment over multiple channels under different
performance criteria. Specifically, we consider the maximin fairness, weighted sum rate maximization,
sum rate maximization with quality of service (QoS) constraints, energy efficiency maximization
with weights or QoS constraints in NOMA systems. We also take explicitly into account the order constraints
on the powers of the users on each channel, which are often ignored in theexisting works, and show
that they have a significant impact on SIC in NOMA systems. Then, we provide the optimal power allocation
for the considered criteria in closed or semi-closed form. We also propose a low-complexity efficient
method to jointly optimize channel assignment and power allocation in NOMA systems by incorporating
the matching algorithm with the optimal power allocation. Simulation results show that the joint
resource optimization using our optimal power allocation yields better performance than the existing
schemes.
