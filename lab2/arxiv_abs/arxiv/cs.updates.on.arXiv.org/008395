The practical use of many types of near-term quantum computers requires accounting for their limited
connectivity. One way of overcoming limited connectivity is to insert swaps in the circuit so that
logical operations can be performed on physically adjacent qubits, which we refer to as solving
the `routing via matchings' problem. We address the routing problem for families of quantum circuits
defined by a hypergraph wherein each hyperedge corresponds to a potential gate. Our main result
is that any unordered set of $k$-qubit gates on distinct $k$-qubit subsets of $n$ logical qubits
can be ordered and parallelized in $O(n^{k-1})$ depth using a linear arrangement of $n$ physical
qubits; the construction is completely general and achieves optimal scaling in the case where gates
acting on all $\binom{n}{k}$ sets of $k$ qubits are desired. We highlight two classes of problems
for which our method is particularly useful. First, it applies to sets of mutually commuting gates,
as in the (diagonal) phase separators of Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm) circuits. For example, a single level of a QAOA circuit for Maximum Cut
can be implemented in linear depth, and a single level for $3$-SAT in quadratic depth. Second, it
applies to sets of gates that do not commute but for which compilation efficiency is the dominant
criterion in their ordering. In particular, it can be adapted to Trotterized time-evolution of
fermionic Hamiltonians under the Jordan-Wigner transformation, and also to non-standard mixers
in QAOA. Using our method, a single Trotter step of the electronic structure Hamiltonian in an arbitrary
basis of $n$ orbitals can be done in $O(n^3)$ depth while a Trotter step of the unitary coupled cluster
singles and doubles method can be implemented in $O(n^2 \eta)$ depth, where $\eta$ is the number
of electrons.
