In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of class imbalance on classification performance
of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and compare frequently used methods to address the issue.
Class imbalance is a common problem that has been comprehensively studied in classical machine
learning, yet very limited systematic research is available in the context of deep learning. In
our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet,
to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison
of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and
thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main evaluation metric is area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) adjusted to multi-class tasks since
overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data.
Based on results from our experiments we conclude that (i) the effect of class imbalance on classification
performance is detrimental; (ii) the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant
in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; (iii) oversampling should be applied to the
level that completely eliminates the imbalance, whereas the optimal undersampling ratio depends
on the extent of imbalance; (iv) as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling
does not cause overfitting of CNNs; (v) thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class
probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.
