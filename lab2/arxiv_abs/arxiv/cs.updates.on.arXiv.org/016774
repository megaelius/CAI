The Metric $k$-median problem over a metric space $(\mathcal{X}, d)$ is defined as follows: given
a set $L \subseteq \mathcal{X}$ of facility locations and a set $C \subseteq \mathcal{X}$ of clients,
open a set $F \subseteq L$ of $k$ facilities such that the total service cost, defined as $\Phi(F,
C) \equiv \sum_{x \in C} \min_{f \in F} d(x, f)$, is minimised. The metric $k$-means problem is defined
similarly using squared distances. In many applications there are additional constraints that
any solution needs to satisfy. This gives rise to different constrained versions of the problem
such as $r$-gather, fault-tolerant, outlier $k$-means/$k$-median problem. Surprisingly, for
many of these constrained problems, no constant-approximation algorithm is known. We give FPT
algorithms with constant approximation guarantee for a range of constrained $k$-median/means
problems. For some of the constrained problems, ours is the first constant factor approximation
algorithm whereas for others, we improve or match the approximation guarantee of previous works.
We work within the unified framework of Ding and Xu that allows us to simultaneously obtain algorithms
for a range of constrained problems. In particular, we obtain a $(3+\varepsilon)$-approximation
and $(9+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the constrained versions of the $k$-median and $k$-means
problem respectively in FPT time. In many practical settings of the $k$-median/means problem,
one is allowed to open a facility at any client location, i.e., $C \subseteq L$. For this special case,
our algorithm gives a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation and $(4+\varepsilon)$-approximation
for the constrained versions of $k$-median and $k$-means problem respectively in FPT time. Since
our algorithm is based on simple sampling technique, it can also be converted to a constant-pass
log-space streaming algorithm.
