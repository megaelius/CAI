This paper examines attribute dependencies in data that involve grades, such as a grade to which
an object is red or a grade to which two objects are similar. We thus extend the classical agenda by
allowing graded, or fuzzy, attributes instead of Boolean attributes in case of attribute implications,
and allowing approximate match based on degrees of similarity instead of exact match in case of functional
dependencies. In a sense, we move from bivalence, inherently present in the now-available theories
of dependencies, to a more flexible setting that involves grades. Such a shift has far-reaching
consequences. We argue that a reasonable theory of dependencies may be developed by making use of
mathematical fuzzy logic. Namely, the theory of dependencies is then based on a solid logic calculus
the same way the classical dependencies are based on classical logic. For instance, rather than
handling degrees of similarity in an ad hoc manner, we consistently treat them as truth values, the
same way as true (match) and false (mismatch) are treated in classical theories. In addition, several
notions intuitively embraced in the presence of grades, such as a degree of validity of a particular
dependence or a degree of entailment, naturally emerge and receive a conceptually clean treatment
in the presented approach. In the paper, we discuss motivations, provide basic notions of syntax
and semantics, and develop basic results which include entailment of dependencies, associated
closure structures, a logic of dependencies with two versions of completeness theorem, results
and algorithms regarding complete non-redundant sets of dependencies, relationship to and a possible
reductionist interface to classical dependencies, and relationship to functional dependencies
over domains with similarity.
