Large-scale networks are widely used to represent object relationships in many real world applications.
The occurrence of large-scale networks presents significant computational challenges to process,
analyze, and extract information from such networks. Network summarization techniques are commonly
used to reduce the computational load while attempting to maintain the basic structural properties
of the original network. Previous works have primarily focused on some type of network partitioning
strategies with application-dependent regularizations, most often resulting in strongly connected
clusters. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective regarding the network summarization
problem based on concepts from spectral graph theory. We propose a new distance measurement to characterize
the spectral differences between the original and coarsened networks. We rigorously justify the
spectral distance with the interlacing theorem as well the results from the stochastic block model.
We provide an efficient algorithm to generate the coarsened networks that maximally preserves
the spectral properties of the original network. Our proposed network summarization framework
allows the flexibility to generate a set of coarsened networks with significantly different structures
preserved from different aspects of the original network, which distinguishes our work from others.
We conduct extensive experimental tests on a variety of large-scale networks, both from real-world
applications and the random graph model. We show that our proposed algorithms consistently perform
better results in terms of the spectral measurements and running time compared to previous network
summarization algorithms.
