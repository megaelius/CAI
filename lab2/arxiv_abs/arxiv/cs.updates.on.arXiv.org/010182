Objective: Acute intracranial hypertension is an important risk factor of secondary brain damage
after traumatic brain injury. Hypertensive episodes are often diagnosed reactively and time is
lost before counteractive measures are taken. A pro-active approach that predicts critical events
several hours ahead of time could be beneficial for the patient. Methods: We developed a prediction
framework that forecasts onsets of acute intracranial hypertension in the next 8 hours. It jointly
uses cerebral auto-regulation indices, spectral energies and morphological pulse metrics to
describe the neurological state of the patient. One-minute base windows were compressed by computing
signal metrics, and then stored in a multi-scale history, from which physiological features were
derived. Results: Our model predicted events up to 8 hours in advance with alarm recall rates of 90%
at a precision of 36% in the MIMIC-II waveform database, improving upon two baselines from the literature.
We found that features derived from high-frequency waveforms substantially improved the prediction
performance over simple statistical summaries of low-frequency time series, and each of the three
feature classes contributed to the performance gain. The inclusion of long-term history up to 8
hours was especially important. Conclusion: Our approach showed promising performance and enabled
us to gain insights about the critical components of the prediction model. Significance: Our results
highlight the importance of information contained in high-frequency waveforms in the neurological
intensive care unit. They could motivate future studies on pre-hypertensive patterns and the design
of new alarm algorithms for critical events in the injured brain.
