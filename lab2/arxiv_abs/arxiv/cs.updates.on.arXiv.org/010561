A system with sporadic errors (SSE) is a controller which produces high quality output but it may
occasionally violate a critical requirement REQ(I,O). A run-time enforcement shield is a controller
which takes (I,O) (coming from SSE) as its input, and it produces a corrected output O' which guarantees
the invariance of requirement REQ(I,O'). Moreover, the output sequence O' must deviate from O "as
little as possible" to maintain the quality. In this paper, we give a method for logical specification
of shields using formulas of logic Quantified Discrete Duration Calculus (QDDC). The specification
consists of a correctness requirement REQ as well as a hard deviation constraint HDC which must both
be mandatorily and invariantly satisfied by the shield. Moreover, we also use quantitative optimization
to give a shield which minimizes the expected value of cumulative deviation in an H-optimal fashion.
We show how tool DCSynth implementing soft requirement guided synthesis can be used for automatic
synthesis of shields from a given specification. Next, we give logical formulas specifying several
notions of shields including the k-Stabilizing shield of Bloem "et al." as well as the Burst-error
shield of Wu "et al.", and a new e,d-shield. Shields can be automatically synthesized for all these
specifications using the tool DCSynth. We give experimental results showing the performance of
our shield synthesis tool in relation to previous work. We also compare the performance of the shields
synthesized under diverse hard deviation constraints in terms of their expected deviation and
the worst case burst-deviation latency.
