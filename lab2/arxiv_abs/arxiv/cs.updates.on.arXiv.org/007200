Responding to emergencies in alpine terrain is quite challenging as air ambulances and mountain
rescue services are often confronted with logistics challenges and adverse weather conditions
that extend the response times to provide life-saving support. Among other medical emergencies,
sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the most time-sensitive event that requires the quick provision
of medical treatment including cardiopulmonary resuscitation and electric shocks by automated
external defibrillators (AED). An emerging technology called unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones)
is regarded as a means to support mountain rescuers in overcoming the time criticality of these emergencies
by reducing the time span between SCA and early defibrillation. A drone that is equipped with portable
AED can fly from a base station to the patients' site where a bystander receives it and starts treatment.
This paper considers this response system and proposes an integer linear program to determine the
optimal allocation of drone base stations in a given geographical region. In detail, the developed
model follows the objectives to minimize the number of used drones and to minimize the average travel
times of defibrillator drones to SCA events. In an example of application, under consideration
of historical helicopter response times, the authors test the developed model and demonstrate
the capability of drones to fasten the delivery of AEDs to SCA patients. Results indicate that time
spans between SCA and early defibrillation can be reduced by the optimal allocation of drone base
stations in a given geographical region, thus increasing the survival rate of SCA patients.
