Radiologists use time series of medical images to monitor the progression of a patient condition.
They compare information gleaned from sequences of images to gain insight on progression or remission
of the lesions, thus evaluating the progress of a patient condition or response to therapy. Visual
methods of determining differences between one series of images to another can be subjective or
fail to detect very small differences. We propose the use of quantization errors obtained from Self
Organizing Maps for image content analysis. We tested this technique with MRI images to which we
progressively added synthetic lesions. We have used a global approach that considers changes on
the entire image as opposed to changes in segmented lesion regions only. We claim that this approach
does not suffer from the limitations imposed by segmentation, which may compromise the results.
Results show quantization errors increased with the increase in lesions on the images. The results
are also consistent with previous studies using alternative approaches. We then compared the detectability
ability of our method to that of human novice observers having to detect very small local differences
in random-dot images. The quantization errors of the SOM outputs compared with correct positive
rates, after subtraction of false positive rates (guess rates), increased noticeably and consistently
with small increases in local dot size that were not detectable by humans. We conclude that our method
detects very small changes in complex images and suggest that it could be implemented to assist human
operators in image based decision making.
