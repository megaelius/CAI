This paper introduces a new solution concept for non-cooperative games in normal form with no ties
and pure strategies: the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium. The players are rational in all possible
worlds and know each other's strategies in all possible worlds, which together we refer to as Perfect
Prediction. The anticipation of a player's decision by their opponents is counterfactually dependent
on the decision, unlike in Nash Equilibra where the decisions are made independently. The equilibrium,
when it exists, is unique and is Pareto optimal. This equilibrium is the normal-form counterpart
of the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium; the prediction happens "in another room" rather than in
the past. The equilibrium can also be seen as a natural extension of Hofstadter's superrationality
to non-symmetric games. Algorithmically, an iterated elimination of non-individually-rational
strategy profiles is performed until at most one remains. An equilibrium is a strategy profile that
is immune against knowledge of strategies in all possible worlds and rationality in all possible
worlds, a stronger concept than common knowledge of rationality but also than common counterfactual
belief of rationality. We formalize and contrast the Non-Nashian Decision Theory paradigm, common
to this and several other papers, with Causal Decision Theory and Evidential Decision Theory. We
define the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium algorithmically and, when it exists, prove its uniqueness,
its Pareto-optimality, and that it coincides with the Hofstadter's Superrationality on symmetric
games. We also relate to concepts found in literature such as Individual Rationality, Minimax-Rationalizability,
the Correlated Equilibrium. Finally, we specifically discuss inclusion relationships on the
special case of symmetric games and contrast them with asymmetric games.
