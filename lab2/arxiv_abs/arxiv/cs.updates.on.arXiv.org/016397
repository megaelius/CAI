Submodular function maximization has been a central topic in the theoretical computer science
community over the last decade. Plenty of well-performing approximation algorithms have been
designed for the maximization of monotone/non-monotone submodular functions over a variety of
constraints. In this paper, we consider the submodular multiple knapsack problem (SMKP), which
is the submodular version of the well-studied multiple knapsack problem (MKP). Roughly speaking,
the problem asks to maximize a monotone submodular function over multiple bins (knapsacks). Recently,
Fairstein et al. (ESA20) presented a tight $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation randomized algorithm
for SMKP. Their algorithm is based on the continuous greedy technique which inherently involves
randomness. However, the deterministic algorithm of this problem has not been understood very
well previously. In this paper, we present deterministic algorithms with improved approximation
ratios for SMKP. We first considered the case when the number of bins is a constant. Previously a randomized
approximation algorithm can obtain approximation ratio $(1 - 1/e-\epsilon)$ based on the involved
continuous greedy technique. Here we provide a simple combinatorial deterministic algorithm
with ratio $(1-1/e)$ by directly applying the greedy technique. We then generalized the result
to arbitrary number of bins. When the capacity of bins are identical, we design a combinatorial and
deterministic algorithm which can achieve the tight approximation ratio $(1 - 1 / e-\epsilon)$.
In the general case, we provide a $(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm which is also combinatorial
and deterministic. We finally show a $1-1/e-\epsilon$ randomized algorithm for the general case,
thus achieving the same result as Fairstein et al. (ESA20).
