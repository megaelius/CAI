The resource-constrained nature of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, poses a challenge in designing
a secure, reliable, and particularly high-performance communication for this family of devices.
Although side-channel resistant ciphers (either block cipher or stream cipher) are the well-suited
solution to establish a guaranteed secure communication, the energy-intensive nature of these
ciphers makes them undesirable for particularly lightweight IoT solutions. In this paper, we introduce
ExTru, a novel encrypted communication protocol based on stream ciphers that adds a configurable
switching & toggling network (CSTN) to not only boost the performance of the communication in lightweight
IoT devices, it also consumes far less energy compared with the conventional side-channel resistant
ciphers. Although the overall structure of the proposed scheme is leaky against physical attacks,
such as side-channel or new scan-based Boolean satisfiability (SAT) attack or algebraic attack,
we introduce a dynamic encryption mechanism that removes this vulnerability. We demonstrate how
each communicated message in the proposed scheme reduces the level of trust. Accordingly, since
a specific number of messages, N, could break the communication and extract the key, by using the
dynamic encryption mechanism, ExTru can re-initiate the level of trust periodically after T messages
where T<N, to protect the communication against side-channel and scan-based attacks (e.g. SAT
attack). Furthermore, we demonstrate that by properly configuring the value of T, ExTru not only
increases the strength of security from per "device" to per "message", it also significantly improves
energy consumption as well as throughput in comparison with an architecture that only uses a conventional
side-channel resistant block/stream cipher.
