Where appropriate repositories are not available to support all relevant astronomical data products,
data can fall into darkness: unseen and unavailable for future reference and re-use. Some data in
this category are legacy or old data, but newer datasets are also often uncurated and could remain
"dark". This paper provides a description of the design motivation and development of Astrolabe,
a cyberinfrastructure project that addresses a set of community recommendations for locating
and ensuring the long-term curation of dark or otherwise at-risk data and integrated computing.
This paper also describes the outcomes of the series of community workshops that informed creation
of Astrolabe. According to participants in these workshops, much astronomical dark data currently
exist that are not curated elsewhere, as well as software that can only be executed by a few individuals
and therefore becomes unusable because of changes in computing platforms. Additional astronomical
research questions and challenges would be better addressed with integrated data and computational
resources that fall outside the scope of existing observatory and space mission projects. As a solution,
the design of the Astrolabe system is aimed at developing new resources for management of astronomical
data. The project is based in CyVerse cyberinfrastructure technology and is a collaboration between
the University of Arizona and the American Astronomical Society. Overall the project aims to support
open access to research data by leveraging existing cyberinfrastructure resources and promoting
scientific discovery by making potentially-useful data in a computable format broadly available
to the astronomical community.
