A major challenge in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is to accurately identify both the location
and severity of damage using the dynamic response information acquired. While in theory the vibration-based
and impedance-based methods may facilitate damage identification with the assistance of a credible
baseline finite element model since the changes of stationary wave responses are used in these methods,
the response information is generally limited and the measurements may be heterogeneous, making
an inverse analysis using sensitivity matrix difficult. Aiming at fundamental advancement, in
this research we cast the damage identification problem into an optimization problem where possible
changes of finite element properties due to damage occurrence are treated as unknowns. We employ
the multiple damage location assurance criterion (MDLAC), which characterizes the relation between
measurements and predictions (under sampled elemental property changes), as the vector-form
objective function. We then develop an enhanced, multi-objective version of the DIRECT approach
to solve the optimization problem. The underlying idea of the multi-objective DIRECT approach
is to branch and bound the unknown parametric space to converge to a set of optimal solutions. A new
sampling scheme is established, which significantly increases the efficiency in minimizing the
error between measurements and predictions. The enhanced DIRECT algorithm is particularly suitable
to solving for unknowns that are sparse, as in practical situations structural damage affect only
a small number of finite elements. A number of test cases using vibration response information are
executed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.
