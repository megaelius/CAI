An emerging trend of next generation communication systems is to provide network edges with additional
capabilities such as storage resources in the form of caches to reduce file delivery latency. To
investigate this aspect, we study the fundamental limits of a cache-aided broadcast-relay wireless
network consisting of one central base station, $M$ cache-equipped transceivers and $K$ receivers
from a latency-centric perspective. We use the normalized delivery time (NDT) to capture the per-bit
latency for the worst-case file request pattern, normalized with respect to a reference interference-free
system with unlimited transceiver cache capabilities. The objective is to design the schemes for
cache placement and file delivery in order to minimize the NDT. To this end, we establish a novel converse
and two types of achievability schemes applicable to both time-variant and invariant channels.
The first scheme is a general one-shot scheme for any $M$ and $K$ that synergistically exploits both
multicasting (coded) caching and distributed zero-forcing opportunities. We show that the proposed
one-shot scheme (i) attains gains attributed to both individual and collective transceiver caches
(ii) is NDT-optimal for various parameter settings, particularly at higher cache sizes. The second
scheme, on the other hand, designs beamformers to facilitate both subspace interference alignment
and zero-forcing at lower cache sizes. Exploiting both schemes, we are able to characterize for
various special cases of $M$ and $K$ which satisfy $K+M\leq 4$ the optimal tradeoff between cache
storage and latency. The tradeoff illustrates that the NDT is the preferred choice to capture the
latency of a system rather than the commonly used sum degrees-of-freedom (DoF). In fact, our optimal
tradeoff refutes the popular belief that increasing cache sizes translates to increasing the achievable
sum DoF.
