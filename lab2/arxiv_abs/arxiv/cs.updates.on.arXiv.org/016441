Interval graphs, intersection graphs of segments on a real line (intervals), play a key role in the
study of algorithms and special structural properties. Unit interval graphs, their proper subclass,
where each interval has a unit length, has also been extensively studied. We study mixed unit interval
graphs---a generalization of unit interval graphs where each interval has still a unit length,
but intervals of more than one type (open, closed, semi-closed) are allowed. This small modification
captures a much richer class of graphs. In particular, mixed unit interval graphs are not claw-free,
compared to unit interval graphs. Heggernes, Meister, and Papadopoulos defined a representation
of unit interval graphs called the bubble model which turned out to be useful in algorithm design.
We extend this model to the class of mixed unit interval graphs and demonstrate the advantages of
this generalized model by providing a subexponential-time algorithm for solving the MaxCut problem
on mixed unit interval graphs. In addition, we derive a polynomial-time algorithm for certain subclasses
of mixed unit interval graphs. We point out a substantial mistake in the proof of the polynomiality
of the MaxCut problem on unit interval graphs by Boyaci, Ekim, and Shalom (2017). Hence, the time
complexity of this problem on unit interval graphs remains open. We further provide a better algorithmic
upper-bound on the clique-width of mixed unit interval graphs. Clique-width is one of the most general
structural graph parameters, where a large group of natural problems is still solvable in the tractable
time when an efficient representation is given. Unfortunately, the exact computation of the clique-width
representation is \NP-hard. Therefore, good upper-bounds on clique-width are highly appreciated,
in particular, when such a bound is algorithmic.
