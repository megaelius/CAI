Background. When selecting predictive tools, clinicians and healthcare professionals are challenged
with an overwhelming number of tools, most of which have never been evaluated for comparative effectiveness.
To overcome this challenge, the authors developed and validated an evidence-based framework for
grading and assessment of predictive tools (GRASP), based on the critical appraisal of published
evidence. Methods. To examine GRASP impact on professionals decisions, a controlled experiment
was conducted through an online survey. Randomising two groups of tools and two scenarios; participants
were asked to select the best tools; most validated or implemented, with and without GRASP. A wide
group of international participants were invited. Task completion time, rate of correct decisions,
rate of objective vs subjective decisions, and level of decisional conflict were measured. Results.
Valid responses received were 194. Compared to not using the framework, GRASP significantly increased
correct decisions by 64% (T=8.53, p<0.001), increased objective decision making by 32% (T=9.24,
p<0.001), and decreased subjective decision making; based on guessing and based on prior knowledge
or experience by 20% (T=-5.47, p<0.001) and 8% (T=-2.99, p=0.003) respectively. GRASP significantly
decreased decisional conflict; increasing confidence and satisfaction of participants with
their decisions by 11% (T=4.27, p<0.001) and 13% (T=4.89, p<0.001) respectively. GRASP decreased
task completion time by 52% (T=-0.87, p=0.384). The average system usability scale of GRASP was
very good; 72.5%, and 88% of participants found GRASP useful. Discussion and Conclusions. Using
GRASP has positively supported and significantly improved evidence-based decision making and
increased accuracy and efficiency of selecting predictive tools.
