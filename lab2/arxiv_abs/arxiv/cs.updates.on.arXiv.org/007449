Formal models of learning from teachers need to respect certain criteria to avoid collusion. The
most commonly accepted notion of collusion-freeness was proposed by Goldman and Mathias (1996),
and various teaching models obeying their criterion have been studied. For each model $M$ and each
concept class $\mathcal{C}$, a parameter $M$-$\mathrm{TD}(\mathcal{C})$ refers to the teaching
dimension of concept class $\mathcal{C}$ in model $M$---defined to be the number of examples required
for teaching a concept, in the worst case over all concepts in $\mathcal{C}$. This paper introduces
a new model of teaching, called no-clash teaching, together with the corresponding parameter $\mathrm{NCTD}(\mathcal{C})$.
No-clash teaching is provably optimal in the strong sense that, given any concept class $\mathcal{C}$
and any model $M$ obeying Goldman and Mathias's collusion-freeness criterion, one obtains $\mathrm{NCTD}(\mathcal{C})\le
M$-$\mathrm{TD}(\mathcal{C})$. We also study a corresponding notion $\mathrm{NCTD}^+$ for
the case of learning from positive data only, establish useful bounds on $\mathrm{NCTD}$ and $\mathrm{NCTD}^+$,
and discuss relations of these parameters to the VC-dimension and to sample compression. In addition
to formulating an optimal model of collusion-free teaching, our main results are on the computational
complexity of deciding whether $\mathrm{NCTD}^+(\mathcal{C})=k$ (or $\mathrm{NCTD}(\mathcal{C})=k$)
for given $\mathcal{C}$ and $k$. We show some such decision problems to be equivalent to the existence
question for certain constrained matchings in bipartite graphs. Our NP-hardness results for the
latter are of independent interest in the study of constrained graph matchings.
