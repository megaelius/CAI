Despite rapid advances in image-based machine learning, the threat identification of a knife wielding
attacker has not garnered substantial academic attention. This relative research gap appears
less understandable given the high knife assault rate (>100,000 annually) and the increasing availability
of public video surveillance to analyze and forensically document. We present three complementary
methods for scoring automated threat identification using multiple knife image datasets, each
with the goal of narrowing down possible assault intentions while minimizing misidentifying false
positives and risky false negatives. To alert an observer to the knife-wielding threat, we test
and deploy classification built around MobileNet in a sparse and pruned neural network with a small
memory requirement (< 2.2 megabytes) and 95% test accuracy. We secondly train a detection algorithm
(MaskRCNN) to segment the hand from the knife in a single image and assign probable certainty to their
relative location. This segmentation accomplishes both localization with bounding boxes but
also relative positions to infer overhand threats. A final model built on the PoseNet architecture
assigns anatomical waypoints or skeletal features to narrow the threat characteristics and reduce
misunderstood intentions. We further identify and supplement existing data gaps that might blind
a deployed knife threat detector such as collecting innocuous hand and fist images as important
negative training sets. When automated on commodity hardware and software solutions one original
research contribution is this systematic survey of timely and readily available image-based alerts
to task and prioritize crime prevention countermeasures prior to a tragic outcome.
