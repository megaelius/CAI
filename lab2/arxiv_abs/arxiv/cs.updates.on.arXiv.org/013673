This paper studies the energy and traffic impact of a proposed Anticipative Cruise Controller in
a PTV VISSIM microsimulation environment. We dissect our controller into two parts: 1. the anticipative
mode, more immediately beneficial when automated vehicle fleet penetration is low, and 2. the connected
mode, beneficial in coordinated car-following scenarios and high automated vehicle penetrations
appropriate for autonomous vehicle specific applications. Probabilistic constraints handle
safety considerations, and vehicle constraints for acceleration capabilities are expressed
through the use of powertrain maps. Real traffic scenarios are then modeled using time headway distributions
from traffic data. To study impact over a range of demands, we vary input vehicle volume from low to
high and then vary automated vehicle penetration from low to high. When examining all-human driving
scenarios, network capacity failed to meet demand in high-volume scenarios, such as rush-hour
traffic. We further find that with automated vehicles introduced which utilize probabilistic
constraints to balance safety and traffic compactness, network capacity was improved to support
the high-volume scenarios. Finally, we examine energy efficiencies of the fleet for conventional,
electric, and hybrid vehicles. We find that automated vehicles perform at a 10% - 20% higher energy
efficiency over human drivers when considering conventional powertrains, and find that automated
vehicles perform at a 3% - 9% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering electric
and hybrid powertrains. Due to secondary effects of smoothing traffic flow, energy benefits also
apply to human-driven vehicles that interact with automated ones. Such simulated humans were found
to drive up to 10% more energy-efficiently than they did in the baseline all-human scenario.
