This paper presents a high-level conceptual framework to help orient the discussion and implementation
of open-endedness in evolutionary systems. Drawing upon earlier work by Banzhaf et al., three different
kinds of open-endedness are identified: exploratory, expansive, and transformational. These
are characterised in terms of their relationship to the search space of phenotypic behaviours.
A formalism is introduced to describe three key processes required for an evolutionary process:
the generation of a phenotype from a genetic description, the evaluation of that phenotype, and
the reproduction with variation of individuals according to their evaluation. The formalism makes
explicit various influences in each of these processes that can easily be overlooked. The distinction
is made between intrinsic and extrinsic implementations of these processes. A discussion then
investigates how various interactions between these processes, and their modes of implementation,
can lead to open-endedness. However, it is demonstrated that these considerations relate to exploratory
open-endedness only. Conditions for the implementation of the more interesting kinds of open-endedness
- expansive and transformational - are also discussed, emphasizing factors such as multiple domains
of behaviour, transdomain bridges, and non-additive compositional systems. In contrast to a traditional
"neo-Darwinian" analysis, these factors relate not to the generic evolutionary properties of
individuals, but rather to the nature of the building blocks out of which individual organisms are
constructed, and the laws and properties of the environment in which they exist. The paper ends with
suggestions of how the framework can be used to categorise and compare the open-ended evolutionary
potential of different systems, and how it might guide the design of systems with greater capacity
for open-ended evolution.
