The ability to timely process significant amounts of continuously updated spatial data is mandatory
for an increasing number of applications. Parallelism enables such applications to face this data-intensive
challenge and allows the devised systems to feature low latency and high scalability. In this paper
we focus on a specific data-intensive problem, concerning the repeated processing of huge amounts
of range queries over massive sets of moving objects, where the spatial extents of queries and objects
are continuously modified over time. To tackle this problem and significantly accelerate query
processing we devise a hybrid CPU/GPU pipeline that compresses data output and save query processing
work. The devised system relies on an ad-hoc spatial index leading to a problem decomposition that
results in a set of independent data-parallel tasks. The index is based on a point-region quadtree
space decomposition and allows to tackle effectively a broad range of spatial object distributions,
even those very skewed. Also, to deal with the architectural peculiarities and limitations of the
GPUs, we adopt non-trivial GPU data structures that avoid the need of locked memory accesses and
favour coalesced memory accesses, thus enhancing the overall memory throughput. To the best of
our knowledge this is the first work that exploits GPUs to efficiently solve repeated range queries
over massive sets of continuously moving objects, characterized by highly skewed spatial distributions.
In comparison with state-of-the-art CPU-based implementations, our method highlights significant
speedups in the order of 14x-20x, depending on the datasets, even when considering very cheap GPUs.
