In this work, we propose efficient algorithms for joint independent subspace analysis (JISA),
an extension of independent component analysis that deals with parallel mixtures, where not all
the components are independent. We derive an algorithmic framework for JISA based on the majorization-minimization
(MM) optimization technique (JISA-MM). We use a well-known inequality for super-Gaussian sources
to derive a surrogate function of the negative log-likelihood of the observed data. The minimization
of this surrogate function leads to a variant of the hybrid exact-approximate diagonalization
problem, but where multiple demixing vectors are grouped together. In the spirit of auxiliary function
based independent vector analysis (AuxIVA), we propose several updates that can be applied alternately
to one, or jointly to two, groups of demixing vectors. Recently, blind extraction of one or more sources
has gained interest as a reasonable way of exploiting larger microphone arrays to achieve better
separation. In particular, several MM algorithms have been proposed for overdetermined IVA (OverIVA).
By applying JISA-MM, we are not only able to rederive these in a general manner, but also find several
new algorithms. We run extensive numerical experiments to evaluate their performance, and compare
it to that of full separation with AuxIVA. We find that algorithms using pairwise updates of two sources,
or of one source and the background have the fastest convergence, and are able to separate target
sources quickly and precisely from the background. In addition, we characterize the performance
of all algorithms under a large number of noise, reverberation, and background mismatch conditions.
