Corporate research and development (R&D) activities have long been highly concentrated in a handful
of world cities. This is due to the fact that these cities (e.g., Tokyo, New York, London, and Paris)
are home to the largest and most powerful transnational corporations and are globally important
sites for innovative start-up firms that operate in the fastest growing industries. However, in
tandem with the rapid technological changes of our age, corporate R&D activities have shifted towards
newly emerging and now globally significant R&D centres, like San Jose, San Francisco, and Boston
in the United States, and Beijing, Seoul, and Shenzhen in East Asia. In this paper, I will conduct
a bibliometric analysis to define which cities are centres of corporate R&D activities, how different
industries influence their performance, and what spatial tendencies characterise the period
from 1980 to 2014. The bibliometric analysis is based upon an assumption that implies there is a close
connection between the number of scientific articles published by a given firm and the volume of
its R&D activity. Results show that firms headquartered in Tokyo, New York, London, and Paris published
the largest combined number of scientific articles in the period from 1980 to 2014, but that the growth
rate of the annual output of scientific articles was much greater in Boston, San Jose, Beijing, and
Seoul, as well as some Taiwanese cities. Furthermore, it can also be seen that those cities that have
the largest number of articles; i.e., that can be considered as the most significant sites of corporate
R&D in which firms operate in fast-growing industries, are primarily in the pharmaceutical and
information technology industries. For these reasons, some mid-sized cities that are home to globally
significant pharmaceutical or information technology firms are also top corporate R&D hubs.
