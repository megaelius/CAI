We consider the {\em matroid median} problem \cite{KrishnaswamyKNSS11}, wherein we are given
a set of facilities with opening costs and a matroid on the facility-set, and clients with demands
and connection costs, and we seek to open an independent set of facilities and assign clients to open
facilities so as to minimize the sum of the facility-opening and client-connection costs. We give
a simple 8-approximation algorithm for this problem based on LP-rounding, which improves upon
the 16-approximation in \cite{KrishnaswamyKNSS11}. Our techniques illustrate that much of the
work involved in the rounding algorithm of in \cite{KrishnaswamyKNSS11} can be avoided by first
converting the LP solution to a half-integral solution, which can then be rounded to an integer solution
using a simple uncapacitated-facility-location (UFL) style clustering step. We illustrate the
power of these ideas by deriving: (a) a 24-approximation algorithm for matroid median with penalties,
which is a vast improvement over the 360-approximation obtained in \cite{KrishnaswamyKNSS11};
and (b) an 8-approximation for the {\em two-matroid median} problem, a generalization of matroid
median that we introduce involving two matroids. We show that a variety of seemingly disparate facility-location
problems considered in the literature---data placement problem, mobile facility location, $k$-median
forest, metric uniform minimum-latency UFL---in fact reduce to the matroid median or two-matroid
median problems, and thus obtain improved approximation guarantees for all these problems. Our
techniques also yield an improvement for the knapsack median problem.
