Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is a vision which offers safe, secure and smart travel
experience to drivers. This futuristic plan aims to enable vehicles, roadside transportation
infrastructures, pedestrian smart-phones and other devices to communicate with one another to
provide safety and convenience services. Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure
(V2I) communication in ITS offers ability to exchange speed, heading angle, position and other
environment related conditions amongst vehicles and with surrounding smart infrastructures.
In this intelligent setup, vehicles and users communicate and exchange data with random untrusted
entities (like vehicles, smart traffic lights or pedestrians) whom they don't know or have met before.
The concerns of location privacy and secure communication further deter the adoption of this smarter
and safe transportation. In this paper, we present a secure and trusted V2V and V2I communication
approach using edge infrastructures where instead of direct peer to peer communication, we introduce
trusted cloudlets to authorize, check and verify the authenticity, integrity and ensure anonymity
of messages exchanged in the system. Moving vehicles or road side infrastructure are dynamically
connected to nearby cloudlets, where security policies can be implemented to sanitize or stop fake
messages and prevent rogue vehicles to exchange messages with other vehicles. We also present a
formal attribute-based model for V2V and V2I communication, called AB-ITS, along with proof of
concept implementation of the proposed solution in AWS IoT platform. This cloudlet supported architecture
complements direct V2V or V2I communication, and serves important use cases such as accident or
ice-threat warning and other safety applications. Performance metrics of our proposed architecture
are also discussed and compared with existing ITS technologies.
