Despite the great successes of deep learning, the effectiveness of deep neural networks has not
been understood at any theoretical depth. This work is motivated by the thrust of developing a deeper
understanding of recurrent neural networks, particularly LSTM/GRU-like networks. As the highly
complex structure of the recurrent unit in LSTM and GRU networks makes them difficult to analyze,
our methodology in this research theme is to construct an alternative recurrent unit that is as simple
as possible and yet also captures the key components of LSTM/GRU recurrent units. Such a unit can
then be used for the study of recurrent networks and its structural simplicity may allow easier analysis.
Towards that goal, we take a system-theoretic perspective to design a new recurrent unit, which
we call the prototypical recurrent unit (PRU). Not only having minimal complexity, PRU is demonstrated
experimentally to have comparable performance to GRU and LSTM unit. This establishes PRU networks
as a prototype for future study of LSTM/GRU-like recurrent networks. This paper also studies the
memorization abilities of LSTM, GRU and PRU networks, motivated by the folk belief that such networks
possess long-term memory. For this purpose, we design a simple and controllable task, called ``memorization
problem'', where the networks are trained to memorize certain targeted information. We show that
the memorization performance of all three networks depends on the amount of targeted information,
the amount of ``interfering" information, and the state space dimension of the recurrent unit.
Experiments are also performed for another controllable task, the adding problem, and similar
conclusions are obtained.
