We study combinatorial auctions with interdependent valuations. In such settings, each agent
$i$ has a private signal $s_i$ that captures her private information, and the valuation function
of every agent depends on the entire signal profile, ${\bs}=(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$. Previous results
in economics concentrated on identifying (often stringent) assumptions under which optimal solutions
can be attained. The computer science literature provided approximation results for simple single-parameter
settings (mostly single item auctions, or matroid feasibility constraints). Both bodies of literature
considered only valuations satisfying a technical condition termed {\em single crossing} (or
variants thereof). Indeed, without imposing assumptions on the valuations, strong impossibility
results exist. We consider the class of {\em submodular over signals} (SOS) valuations (without
imposing any single-crossing type assumption), and provide the first welfare approximation guarantees
for multi-dimensional combinatorial auctions, achieved by universally ex-post IC-IR mechanisms.
Our main results are: $(i)$ 4-approximation for any single-parameter downward-closed setting
with single-dimensional signals and SOS valuations; $(ii)$ 4-approximation for any combinatorial
auction with multi-dimensional signals and {\em separable}-SOS valuations; and $(iii)$ $(k+3)$-
and $(2\log(k)+4)$-approximation for any combinatorial auction with single-dimensional signals,
with $k$-sized signal space, for SOS and strong-SOS valuations, respectively. All of our results
extend to a parameterized version of SOS, $d$-SOS, while losing a factor that depends on $d$.
