Today, many wireless device providers choose to sell devices bundled with complementary mobile
social services, which exhibit strong positive network externality. This paper aims to quantify
the benefits of selling devices and complementary services under the following three strategies:
separate pricing, bundled pricing, and hybrid pricing (both the separate and bundled options are
offered). A comprehensive comparison of the above three strategies is carried out for two popular
service models, namely physical connectivity sharing and virtual content sharing, respectively.
We first study the physical service model where the provider (e.g., FON) offers users customized
WiFi devices for indoor Internet access, and allows service subscribers to physically access all
device owners' WiFi when traveling. Observing that all device-owners contribute to the connectivity
sharing, we show, via a Stackelberg game theoretic approach, that bundled pricing outperforms
separate pricing as long as the total cost of device and service is reasonably low to stimulate network
externality. Further, hybrid pricing strictly dominates bundled pricing thanks to the pricing
flexibility to keep high marginal profit of device-selling. Next, we investigate the virtual sharing
service model where the provider (e.g., Apple) sells devices and device-supported applications.
Different from the connectivity service model, in this model service subscribers directly contribute
to the virtual content sharing, and the network externality can be fairly strong. We prove that hybrid
pricing degenerates to bundled pricing if the network externality degree is larger than the average
device valuation, which is in stark contrast with the connectivity service model in which hybrid
pricing always outperforms bundled pricing.
