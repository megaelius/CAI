In this paper, we study the stochastic submodular maximization problem with dependent items subject
to a variety of packing constraints such as matroid and knapsack constraints. The input of our problem
is a finite set of items, and each item is in a particular state from a set of possible states. After
picking an item, we are able to observe its state. We assume a monotone and submodular utility function
over items and states, and our objective is to select a group of items adaptively so as to maximize
the expected utility. Previous studies on stochastic submodular maximization often assume that
items' states are independent, however, this assumption may not hold in general. This motivates
us to study the stochastic submodular maximization problem with dependent items. We first introduce
the concept of \emph{degree of independence} to capture the degree to which one item's state is dependent
on others'. Then we propose a non-adaptive policy that approximates the optimal adaptive policy
within a factor of $\alpha(1-e^{-\frac{\kappa}{2}+\frac{\kappa}{18m^2}}-\frac{\kappa+2}{3m\kappa})$
where the value of $\alpha$ is depending on the type of constraints, e.g., $\alpha=1$ for matroid
constraint, $\kappa$ is the degree of independence, e.g., $\kappa=1$ for independent items, and
$m$ is the number of items. Since our policy is non-adaptive, $\alpha(1-e^{-\frac{\kappa}{2}+\frac{\kappa}{18m^2}}-\frac{\kappa+2}{3m\kappa})$
is a valid upper bound on the adaptivity gap, i.e., the ratio of the values of best adaptive policy
and best non-adaptive policy is bounded by $\alpha(1-e^{-\frac{\kappa}{2}+\frac{\kappa}{18m^2}}-\frac{\kappa+2}{3m\kappa})$
