Software defined networking (SDN) has been adopted to enforce the security of large-scale and complex
networks because of its programmable, abstract, centralized intelligent control and global and
real-time traffic view. However, the current SDN-based security enforcement mechanisms require
network managers to fully understand the underlying configurations of network. Facing the increasingly
complex and huge SDN networks, we urgently need a novel security policy management mechanism which
can be completely transparent to any underlying information. That is it can permit network managers
to define upper-level security policies without containing any underlying information of network,
and by means of model transformation system, these upper-level security policies can be transformed
into their corresponding lower-level policies containing underlying information automatically.
Moreover, it should ensure the generated lower-level policies can hold all of security properties
defined in upper-level policies. Based on these insights, we propose a security policy model transformation
and verification approach for SDN in this paper. We first present the formal definition of a security
policy model (SPM) which can be used to specify the security policies used in SDN. Then, we propose
a model transformation algorithm based on SDN system model and mapping rules, which can enable network
managers to automatically convert SPM models into corresponding underlying network configuration
policies, i.e., flow table models (FTM). In order to verify the generated FTM models can hold the
security properties defined in SPM models, we design a verification algorithm based on model checking.
Finally, we utilize a comprehensive case to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.
