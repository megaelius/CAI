In this paper we propose CAVE-AR, a novel virtual reality (VR) system for authoring custom augmented
reality (AR) experiences and interacting with participating users. We introduce an innovative
technique to integrate different representations of the world, mixing geographical information,
architectural features, and sensor data, allowing us to understand precisely how users are behaving
within the AR experience. By taking advantage of this technique to "mix realities", our VR application
provides the designer with tools to create and modify a AR application, even while other people are
in the midst of using it. Our VR application further lets the designer track how users are behaving,
preview what they are currently seeing, and interact with them through different channels. This
enables new possibilities which range from simple debugging and testing to more complex forms of
centralized task control, such as placing a virtual avatar in the AR experience to guide a user. In
addition to describing details of how we create effective representations of the real-world for
enhanced AR experiences and our novel interaction modalities, we introduce two use cases demonstrating
the potential of our approach. The first is an AR experience that enables users to discover historical
information during an urban tour along the Chicago Riverwalk; the second is a novel scavenger hunt
that places virtual objects within a real-world environment to facilitate solving complex multi-user
puzzles. In both cases, the ability to develop and test the AR experience remotely greatly enhanced
the design process and the novel interaction techniques greatly enhanced overall user experience.
