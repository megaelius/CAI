Future Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) will be equipped with a large set of sensors. The
large amount of generated sensor data is expected to be exchanged with other CAVs and the road-side
infrastructure. Both in Europe and the US, Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) systems,
based on the IEEE 802.11p Physical Layer, are key enabler for the communication among vehicles.
Given the expected market penetration of connected vehicles, the licensed band of 75 MHz, dedicated
to DSRC communications, is expected to become increasingly congested. In this paper, we investigate
the performance of a vehicular communication system, operated over the unlicensed bands 2.4 GHz
- 2.5 GHz and 5.725 GHz - 5.875 GHz. Our experimental evaluation was carried out in a testing track
in the centre of Bristol, UK and our system is a full-stack ETSI ITS-G5 implementation. Our performance
investigation compares key communication metrics (e.g., packet delivery rate, received signal
strength indicator) measured by operating our system over the licensed DSRC and the considered
unlicensed bands. In particular, when operated over the 2.4 GHz - 2.5 GHz band, our system achieves
comparable performance to the case when the DSRC band is used. On the other hand, as soon as the system,
is operated over the 5.725 GHz - 5.875 GHz band, the packet delivery rate is 30% smaller compared to
the case when the DSRC band is employed. These findings prove that operating our system over unlicensed
ISM bands is a viable option. During our experimental evaluation, we recorded all the generated
network interactions and the complete data set has been publicly available.
