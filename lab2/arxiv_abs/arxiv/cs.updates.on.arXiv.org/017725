Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a promising architecture to provide low-latency applications
for future Internet of Things (IoT)-based network systems. Together with the increasing scholarly
attention on task offloading, the problem of edge servers' resource allocation has been widely
studied. Most of previous works focus on a single edge server (ES) serving multiple terminal entities
(TEs), which restricts their access to sufficient resources. In this paper, we consider a MEC resource
transaction market with multiple ESs and multiple TEs, which are interdependent and mutually influence
each other. However, this many-to-many interaction requires resolving several problems, including
task allocation, TEs' selection on ESs and conflicting interests of both parties. Game theory can
be used as an effective tool to realize the interests of two or more conflicting individuals in the
trading market. Therefore, we propose a bilateral game framework among multiple ESs and multiple
TEs by modeling the task outsourcing problem as two noncooperative games: the supplier and customer
side games. In the first game, the supply function bidding mechanism is employed to model the ESs'
profit maximization problem. The ESs submit their bids to the scheduler, where the computing service
price is computed and sent to the TEs. While in the second game, TEs determine the optimal demand profiles
according to ESs' bids to maximize their payoff. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium
in the aforementioned games are proved. A distributed task outsourcing algorithm (DTOA) is designed
to determine the equilibrium. Simulation results have demonstrated the superior performance
of DTOA in increasing the ESs' profit and TEs' payoff, as well as flattening the peak and off-peak
load.
