The Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model is an emerging model which distills core aspects
of distributed and parallel computation. It has been developed as a tool to solve (typically graph)
problems in systems where the input is distributed over many machines with limited space. Recent
work has focused on the regime in which machines have sublinear (in $n$, the number of nodes in the
input graph) memory, with randomized algorithms presented for fundamental graph problems of Maximal
Matching and Maximal Independent Set. However, there have been no prior corresponding \emph{deterministic}
algorithms. A major challenge underlying the sublinear space setting is that the local space of
each machine might be too small to store all the edges incident to a single node. This poses a considerable
obstacle compared to the classical models in which each node is assumed to know and have easy access
to its incident edges. To overcome this barrier we introduce a new \emph{graph sparsification technique}
that \emph{deterministically} computes a low-degree subgraph with additional desired properties.
Using this framework to derandomize the well-known randomized algorithm of Luby [SICOMP'86],
we obtain $O(\log \Delta+\log\log n)$-round \emph{deterministic} MPC algorithms for solving
the fundamental problems of \emph{Maximal Matching} and \emph{Maximal Independent Set} with
$O(n^{\epsilon})$ space on each machine for any constant $\epsilon > 0$. Based on the recent work
of Ghaffari et al. [FOCS'18], this additive $O(\log\log n)$ factor is \emph{conditionally} essential.
These algorithms can also be shown to run in $O(\log \Delta)$ rounds in the closely related model
of \congc, improving upon the state-of-the-art bound of $O(\log^2 \Delta)$ rounds by Censor-Hillel
et al. [DISC'17].
