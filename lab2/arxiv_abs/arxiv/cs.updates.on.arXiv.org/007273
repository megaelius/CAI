Control of blood glucose is essential for diabetes management. Current digital therapeutic approaches
for subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) such as the artificial pancreas and insulin bolus
calculators leverage machine learning techniques for predicting subcutaneous glucose for improved
control. Deep learning has recently been applied in healthcare and medical research to achieve
state-of-the-art results in a range of tasks including disease diagnosis, and patient state prediction
among others. In this work, we present a deep learning model that is capable of forecasting glucose
levels with leading accuracy for simulated patient cases (RMSE = 9.38$\pm$0.71 [mg/dL] over a 30-minute
horizon, RMSE = 18.87$\pm$2.25 [mg/dL] over a 60-minute horizon) and real patient cases (RMSE =
21.07$\pm$2.35 [mg/dL] for 30-minute, RMSE = 33.27$\pm$4.79\% for 60-minute). In addition, the
model provides competitive performance in providing effective prediction horizon ($PH_{eff}$)
with minimal time lag both in a simulated patient dataset ($PH_{eff}$ = 29.0$\pm$0.7 for 30-min
and $PH_{eff}$ = 49.8$\pm$2.9 for 60-min) and in a real patient dataset ($PH_{eff}$ = 19.3$\pm$3.1
for 30-min and $PH_{eff}$ = 29.3$\pm$9.4 for 60-min). This approach is evaluated on a dataset of
10 simulated cases generated from the UVa/Padova simulator and a clinical dataset of 10 real cases
each containing glucose readings, insulin bolus, and meal (carbohydrate) data. Performance of
the recurrent convolutional neural network is benchmarked against four algorithms. The proposed
algorithm is implemented on an Android mobile phone, with an execution time of $6$ms on a phone compared
to an execution time of $780$ms on a laptop.
