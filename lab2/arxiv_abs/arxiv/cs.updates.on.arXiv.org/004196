The problem of excessive pilot overhead required for uplink massive MIMO channel estimation is
well known, let alone when it is considered along with wideband (OFDM) transmissions. Towards channel
estimators that are both efficient and require low-training overhead, compressive sensing (CS)
approaches have been increasingly popular, exploiting the sparse nature of the physical channel.
However, no analytical insights regarding the overhead required for reliable channel estimation
in wideband massive MIMO are available. By observing that the wideband massive MIMO channel can
be represented by a vector that is not simply sparse but has well defined structural properties,
referred to as hierarchical sparsity, we propose low complexity channel estimators for the multiuser
scenario that take this property into account. By employing the framework of the hierarchical restricted
isometry property, rigorous performance guarantees for these algorithms are provided suggesting
concrete design goals for the user pilot sequences. For a specific design, we analytically characterize
the scaling of the required pi- lot overhead with increasing number of antennas and bandwidth, revealing
that, as long as the number of antennas is sufficiently large, it is independent of the per user channel
sparsity level as well as the number of active users. Hence, surprisingly, in contrast to the classical
setting, pilot overhead can be shifted into spatial dimensions not affecting crucial bandwidth
constraints thereby increasing the overall system capacity. These analytical insights are verified
by simulation results demonstrating also the superiority of the proposed algorithm over conventional
CS algorithms that ignore the hierarchical sparsity property.
