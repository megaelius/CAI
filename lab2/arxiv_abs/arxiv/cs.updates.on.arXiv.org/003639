As an emerging decentralized secure data management platform, blockchain has gained much popularity
recently. To maintain a canonical state of blockchain data record, proof-of-work based consensus
protocols provide the nodes, referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming
new block of transactions through a process of "block mining" by solving a cryptographic puzzle.
Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g., mobile devices, it is natural
for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to offload computational tasks for proof of work to
the cloud/fog computing servers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing
service provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for efficient computing
resource allocation. In particular, we consider a proof-of-work based blockchain network. Due
to the competition among miners in the blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly
taken into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider two bidding
schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a fixed quantity of resources, and
the multi-demand scheme where the miners can submit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand
bidding scheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare. In the multi-demand
bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate
algorithm which guarantees the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency.
Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the two bidding
schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the blockchain network and provide effective
strategies for the cloud/fog computing service provider.
