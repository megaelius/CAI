Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) model checking has been applied to many fields. However, the state explosion
problem and the exponentially computational complexity restrict the further applications of
LTL model checking. A lot of approaches have been presented to address these problems. And they work
well. However, the essential issue has not been resolved due to the limitation of inherent complexity
of the problem. As a result, the running time of LTL model checking algorithms will be inacceptable
if a LTL formula is too long. To this end, this study tries to seek an acceptable approximate solution
for LTL model checking by introducing the Machine Learning (ML) technique, and a method for predicting
results of LTL model checking via the Boosted Tree (BT) algorithm is proposed in this paper. First,
for a number of Kripke structures and LTL formulas, a data set A containing model checking results
is obtained, using the existing LTL model checking algorithm. Second, the LTL model checking problem
can be induced to a binary classification problem of machine learning. In other words, some records
in A form a training set for the BT algorithm. On the basis of it, a ML model M is obtained to predict the
results of LTL model checking. As a result, an approximate LTL model checking technique occurs.
The experiments show that the new method has the average accuracy of 95.6%, and its average efficiency
is 2.67 million times higher than that of the representative model checking method, if the length
of each of LTL formulas equals to 500.These results indicate that the new method can quickly and accurately
determine results of LTL model checkingfor a given Kripke structure and a given long LTL formula
since the new method avoid the famous state explosion problem.
