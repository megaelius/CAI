In recent years, the security of automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is facing urgent threats
due to the widespread use of legacy in-vehicle communication systems. As a representative legacy
bus system, the Controller Area Network (CAN) hosts Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that are crucial
vehicle functioning. In this scenario, malicious actors can exploit CAN vulnerabilities, such
as the lack of built-in authentication and encryption schemes, to launch CAN bus attacks with life-threatening
consequences (e.g., disabling brakes). In this paper, we present TACAN (Transmitter Authentication
in CAN), which provides secure authentication of ECUs on the legacy CAN bus by exploiting the covert
channels, without introducing CAN protocol modifications or traffic overheads. TACAN turns upside-down
the originally malicious concept of covert channels and exploits it to build an effective defensive
technique that facilitates transmitter authentication via a centralized, trusted Monitor Node.
TACAN consists of three different covert channels for ECU authentication: 1) the Inter-Arrival
Time (IAT)-based; 2) the Least Significant Bit (LSB)-based; and 3) a hybrid covert channel, exploiting
the combination of the first two. In order to validate TACAN, we implement the covert channels on
the University of Washington (UW) EcoCAR (Chevrolet Camaro 2016) testbed. We further evaluate
the bit error, throughput, and detection performance of TACAN through extensive experiments using
the EcoCAR testbed and a publicly available dataset collected from Toyota Camry 2010. We demonstrate
the feasibility of TACAN and the effectiveness of detecting CAN bus attacks, highlighting no traffic
overheads and attesting the regular functionality of ECUs.
