The polynomial-time computability of the permanent over fields of characteristic 3 for k-semi-unitary
matrices (i.e. square matrices such that the differences of their Gram matrices and the corresponding
identity matrices are of rank k) in the case k = 0 or k = 1 and its #3P-completeness for any k > 1 (Ref. 9)
is a result that essentially widens our understanding of the computational complexity boundaries
for the permanent modulo 3. Now we extend this result to study more closely the case k > 1 regarding
the (n-k)x(n-k)-sub-permanents (or permanent-minors) of a unitary nxn-matrix and their possible
relations, because an (n-k)x(n-k)-submatrix of a unitary nxn-matrix is generically a k-semi-unitary
(n-k)x(n-k)-matrix. The following paper offers a way to receive a variety of such equations of different
sorts, in the meantime extending this direction of research to reviewing all the set of polynomial-time
permanent-preserving reductions and equations for the sub-permanents of a generic matrix they
might yield, including a number of generalizations and formulae (valid in an arbitrary prime characteristic)
analogical to the classical identities relating the minors of a matrix and its inverse. Moreover,
the second chapter also deals with the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial in characteristic 2 that surprisingly
possesses quite a number of properties very similar to the corresponding ones of the permanent in
characteristic 3, while in the field GF(2) it obtains even more amazing features. Besides, the third
chapter is devoted to the computational complexity issues of the permanent and some related functions
on a variety of Cauchy matrices and their certain generalizations, including constructing a polynomial-time
algorithm (based on them) for the permanent of an arbitrary matrix in characteristic 5 and conjecturing
the existence of a similar scheme in characteristic 3.
