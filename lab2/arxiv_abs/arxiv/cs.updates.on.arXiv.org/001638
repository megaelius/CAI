Double slit interference experiment is at the heart of quantum mechanics by clearly presenting
wave-particle duality and quantum nature for particles as emphasized by Richard Feynman. Previous
quantum computing (QC) architectures utilizing wave nature with simple set-ups in combination
with quantum superposition interference result in QC speed-up with the cost of exponential increase
in resources such as time, space or energy. In this article, wave-particle duality of propagating
electrons is exploited in a simple interference set-up to present a novel computing architecture
denoted by quantum path computing (QPC) targeting a low complexity QC architecture. It is composed
of multiple planes and Gaussian slits combining trajectories of the particle nature with constructive
and destructive interference measurements of the wave nature. QPC does not explicitly require
exponential complexity of resources by utilizing entangled path history inherently existing
in set-up with a unique formulation of Feynman's path integral which naturally includes path histories.
Hidden subgroup problem (HSP) is solved with QPC in complete analogy with period finding algorithms
utilizing quantum gate circuits and entanglement resources as a fundamental QC tool. QPC promises
solutions of particular instances of simultaneous Diophantine approximation problem as a practical
application while determining the computational complexity of the problem solving capability
is an open issue. Previous models of interference set-ups analyzing exotic paths in single plane
systems are extended to multi-plane set-up while simulations consider non-negligible effects
of multiple exotic paths. The challenges are discussed for modeling computational complexity
of efficiently solvable problems, designing optimum set-up and experimental aspects including
source energy and detection sensitivity depending on problem complexity.
