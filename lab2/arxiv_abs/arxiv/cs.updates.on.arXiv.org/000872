Background: With the ever increasing use of computational models in the biosciences, the need to
share models and reproduce the results of published studies efficiently and easily is becoming
more important. To this end, various standards have been proposed that can be used to describe models,
simulations, data or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute various
separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific result. Results: We describe
the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Together with the use of other standard formats from the
Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive,
a single file that supports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and simulation
experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes a manifest file, listing the
content of the archive, an optional metadata file adding information about the archive and its content,
and the files describing the model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in
COMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined by an Internet Media
Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are available, either as independent libraries
or embedded in modeling software. Conclusions: The COMBINE Archive facilitates the reproduction
of modeling and simulation experiments in biology by embedding all the relevant information in
one file. Having all the information stored and exchanged at once also helps in building activity
logs and audit trails. We anticipate that the COMBINE Archive will become a significant help for
modellers, as the domain moves to larger, more complex experiments such as multi-scale models of
organs, digital organisms, and bioengineering.
