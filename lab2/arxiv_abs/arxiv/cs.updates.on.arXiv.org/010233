Due to its hereditary nature, genomic data is not only linked to its owner but to that of close relatives
as well. As a result, its sensitivity does not really degrade over time; in fact, the relevance of
a genomic sequence is likely to be longer than the security provided by encryption. This prompts
the need for specialized techniques providing long-term security for genomic data, yet the only
available tool for this purpose is GenoGuard (Huang et al., 2015). By relying on Honey Encryption,
GenoGuard is secure against an adversary that can brute force all possible keys; i.e., whenever
an attacker tries to decrypt using an incorrect password, she will obtain an incorrect but plausible
looking decoy sequence. In this paper, we set to analyze the real-world security guarantees provided
by GenoGuard; specifically, assess how much more information does access to a ciphertext encrypted
using GenoGuard yield, compared to one that was not. Overall, we find that, if the adversary has access
to side information in the form of partial information from the target sequence, the use of GenoGuard
does appreciably increase her power in determining the rest of the sequence. We show that, in the
case of a sequence encrypted using an easily guessable (low-entropy) password, the adversary is
able to rule out most decoy sequences, and obtain the target sequence with just 2.5\% of it available
as side information. In the case of a harder-to-guess (high-entropy) password, we show that the
adversary still obtains, on average, better accuracy in guessing the rest of the target sequences
than using state-of-the-art genomic sequence inference methods, obtaining up to 15% improvement
in accuracy.
