In this paper, the problem of joint caching and resource allocation is investigated for a network
of cache-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that service wireless ground users over the LTE
licensed and unlicensed (LTE-U) bands. The considered model focuses on users that can access both
licensed and unlicensed bands while receiving contents from either the cache units at the UAVs directly
or via content server-UAV-user links. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem which
jointly incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and content caching. To solve this
problem, a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of liquid state machine
(LSM) is proposed. Using the proposed LSM algorithm, the cloud can predict the users' content request
distribution while having only limited information on the network's and users' states. The proposed
algorithm also enables the UAVs to autonomously choose the optimal resource allocation strategies
that maximize the number of users with stable queues depending on the network states. Based on the
users' association and content request distributions, the optimal contents that need to be cached
at UAVs as well as the optimal resource allocation are derived. Simulation results using real datasets
show that the proposed approach yields up to 33.3% and 50.3% gains, respectively, in terms of the
number of users that have stable queues compared to two baseline algorithms: Q-learning with cache
and Q-learning without cache. The results also show that LSM significantly improves the convergence
time of up to 33.3% compared to conventional learning algorithms such as Q-learning.
