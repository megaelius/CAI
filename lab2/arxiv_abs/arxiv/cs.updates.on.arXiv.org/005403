In Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) networks, smart meters should send fine-grained power
consumption readings to electric utilities to perform real-time monitoring and energy management.
However, these readings can leak sensitive information about consumers' activities. Various
privacy-preserving schemes for collecting fine-grained readings have been proposed for AMI networks.
These schemes aggregate individual readings and send an aggregated reading to the utility, but
they extensively use asymmetric-key cryptography which involves large computation/communication
overhead. Furthermore, they do not address End-to-End (E2E) data integrity, authenticity, and
computing electricity bills based on dynamic prices. In this paper, we propose EPIC, an efficient
and privacy-preserving data collection scheme with E2E data integrity verification for AMI networks.
Using efficient cryptographic operations, each meter should send a masked reading to the utility
such that all the masks are canceled after aggregating all meters' masked readings, and thus the
utility can only obtain an aggregated reading to preserve consumers' privacy. The utility can verify
the aggregated reading integrity without accessing the individual readings to preserve privacy.
It can also identify the attackers and compute electricity bills efficiently by using the fine-grained
readings without violating privacy. Furthermore, EPIC can resist collusion attacks in which the
utility colludes with a relay node to extract the meters' readings. A formal proof, probabilistic
analysis are used to evaluate the security of EPIC, and ns-3 is used to implement EPIC and evaluate
the network performance. In addition, we compare EPIC to existing data collection schemes in terms
of overhead and security/privacy features.
