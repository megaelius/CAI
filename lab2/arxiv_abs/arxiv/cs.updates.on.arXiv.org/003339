We investigate the influence of fake and traditional, fact-based, news outlets on Twitter during
the 2016 US presidential election. Using a comprehensive dataset of 171 million tweets covering
the five months preceding election day, we identify 30 million tweets, sent by 2.2 million users,
which are classified as spreading fake and extremely biased news, based on a list of news outlets
curated from independent fact-checking organizations, and traditional news from right to left.
We find that 29% of these tweets disseminate fake or extremely biased news. We fully characterize
the networks of users spreading fake and traditional news and find the most influential users. Contrary
to traditional news, where influencers are mainly journalists or news outlets with verified Twitter
accounts, e.g. @FoxNews and @CNN, the majority of fake news influencers have unverified or deleted
accounts. In particular, accounts with seemingly deceiving profiles are found among the top fake
and extremely biased influencers. We find that the three top influencers spreading (i.e. re-tweeting)
fake news websites are @PrisonPlanet, @RealAlexJones and @zerohedge and re-tweeting extremely
bias news websites are @realDonaldTrump, @DailyCaller and @BreitbartNews. To understand how
fake news influenced Twitter opinion during the presidential election, we perform a Granger-causality
test between the time series of activity of influencers and the supporters of each presidential
candidate: Trump and Clinton. Two different news spreading mechanisms are revealed: (i) The influencers
spreading traditional center and left leaning news largely determine (Granger-cause) the opinion
of the Clinton supporters. (ii) Remarkably, this causality is reversed for the fake news: the opinion
of Trump supporters largely Granger-causes the dynamics of influencers spreading fake and extremely
biased news.
