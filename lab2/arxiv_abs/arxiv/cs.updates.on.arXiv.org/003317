The workforce remains the most basic element of social production, even in modern societies. Its
migration, especially for developing economies such as China, plays a strong role in the reallocation
of productive resources and offers a promising proxy for understanding socio-economic issues.
Nevertheless, due to long cycle, expensive cost and coarse granularity, conventional surveys
face challenges in comprehensively profiling it. With the permeation of smart and mobile devices
in recent decades, booming social media has essentially broken spatio-temporal constraints and
enabled the continuous sensing of the real-time mobility of massive numbers of individuals. In
this study, we demonstrate that similar to a natural shock, the Spring Festival culturally drives
workforce travel between workplaces and hometowns, and the trajectory footprints from social
media therefore open a window with unparalleled richness and fine granularity to explore laws in
national-level workforce migration. To understand the core driving forces of workforce migration
flux between cities in China, various indicators reflecting the benefits and costs of migration
are introduced into our prediction model. We find that urban GDP (gross domestic product) and travel
time are two excellent indicators to help make predictions. Diverse migration patterns are then
revealed by clustering the trajectories, which give important clues to help understand the different
roles of Chinese cities in their own development and in regional economic development. These patterns
are further explained as a joint effect of the subjective will to seek personal benefits and the capacity
requirements of local labour markets. Our study implies that the non-negligible entanglement
between social media and macroeconomic behaviours can be insightful for policymaking in social-economic
issues.
