We study the complexity of Maximum Clique in intersection graphs of convex objects in the plane.
On the algorithmic side, we extend the polynomial-time algorithm for unit disks [Clark '90, Raghavan
and Spinrad '03] to translates of any fixed convex set. We also generalize the efficient polynomial-time
approximation scheme (EPTAS) and subexponential algorithm for disks [Bonnet et al. '18, Bonamy
et al. '18] to homothets of a fixed centrally symmetric convex set. The main open question on that
topic is the complexity of Maximum Clique in disk graphs. It is not known whether this problem is NP-hard.
We observe that, so far, all the hardness proofs for Maximum Clique in intersection graph classes
$\mathcal I$ follow the same road. They show that, for every graph $G$ of a large-enough class $\mathcal
C$, the complement of an even subdivision of $G$ belongs to the intersection class $\mathcal I$.
Then they conclude invoking the hardness of Maximum Independent Set on the class $\mathcal C$, and
the fact that the even subdivision preserves that hardness. However there is a strong evidence that
this approach cannot work for disk graphs [Bonnet et al. '18]. We suggest a new approach, based on
a problem that we dub Max Interval Permutation Avoidance, which we prove unlikely to have a subexponential-time
approximation scheme. We transfer that hardness to Maximum Clique in intersection graphs of objects
which can be either half-planes (or unit disks) or axis-parallel rectangles. That problem is not
amenable to the previous approach. We hope that a scaled down (merely NP-hard) variant of Max Interval
Permutation Avoidance could help making progress on the disk case, for instance by showing the NP-hardness
for (convex) pseudo-disks.
