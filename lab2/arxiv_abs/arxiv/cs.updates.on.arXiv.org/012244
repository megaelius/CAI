The Age-of-Information (AoI) has recently been proposed as an important metric for investigating
the timeliness performance in information-update systems. In this paper, we introduce a new Pull
model and study the AoI optimization problem under replication schemes. Interestingly, we find
that under this new Pull model, replication schemes capture a novel tradeoff between different
levels of information freshness and different response times across the servers, which can be exploited
to minimize the expected AoI at the user's side. Specifically, assuming Poisson updating process
for the servers and exponentially distributed response time, we derive a closed-form formula for
computing the expected AoI and obtain the optimal number of responses to wait for to minimize the
expected AoI. Then, we extend our analysis to the setting where the user aims to maximize the AoI-based
utility, which represents the user's satisfaction level with respect to freshness of the received
information. Furthermore, we consider a more realistic scenario where the user has no knowledge
of the system. In this case, we reformulate the utility maximization problem as a stochastic Multi-Armed
Bandit problem with side observations and leverage the unique structure of the problem to design
learning algorithms with improved performance guarantees. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations
to elucidate our theoretical results and compare the performance of different algorithms. Our
findings reveal that under the Pull model, waiting for more than one response can significantly
reduce the AoI and improve the AoI-based utility in most scenarios.
