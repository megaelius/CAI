Classification is a well-studied machine learning task which concerns the assignment of instances
to a set of outcomes. Classification models support the optimization of managerial decision-making
across a variety of operational business processes. For instance, customer churn prediction models
are adopted to increase the efficiency of retention campaigns by optimizing the selection of customers
that are to be targeted. Cost-sensitive and causal classification methods have independently
been proposed to improve the performance of classification models. The former considers the benefits
and costs of correct and incorrect classifications, such as the benefit of a retained customer,
whereas the latter estimates the causal effect of an action, such as a retention campaign, on the
outcome of interest. This study integrates cost-sensitive and causal classification by elaborating
a unifying evaluation framework. The framework encompasses a range of existing and novel performance
measures for evaluating both causal and conventional classification models in a cost-sensitive
as well as a cost-insensitive manner. We proof that conventional classification is a specific case
of causal classification in terms of a range of performance measures when the number of actions is
equal to one. The framework is shown to instantiate to application-specific cost-sensitive performance
measures that have been recently proposed for evaluating customer retention and response uplift
models, and allows to maximize profitability when adopting a causal classification model for optimizing
decision-making. The proposed framework paves the way toward the development of cost-sensitive
causal learning methods and opens a range of opportunities for improving data-driven business
decision-making.
