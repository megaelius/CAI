A recent trend in parameterized algorithms is the application of polytope tools (specifically,
LP-branching) to FPT algorithms (e.g., Cygan et al., 2011; Narayanaswamy et al., 2012). However,
although interesting results have been achieved, the methods require the underlying polytope
to have very restrictive properties (half-integrality and persistence), which are known only
for few problems (essentially Vertex Cover (Nemhauser and Trotter, 1975) and Node Multiway Cut
(Garg et al., 1994)). Taking a slightly different approach, we view half-integrality as a \emph{discrete}
relaxation of a problem, e.g., a relaxation of the search space from $\{0,1\}^V$ to $\{0,1/2,1\}^V$
such that the new problem admits a polynomial-time exact solution. Using tools from CSP (in particular
Thapper and \v{Z}ivn\'y, 2012) to study the existence of such relaxations, we provide a much broader
class of half-integral polytopes with the required properties, unifying and extending previously
known cases. In addition to the insight into problems with half-integral relaxations, our results
yield a range of new and improved FPT algorithms, including an $O^*(|\Sigma|^{2k})$-time algorithm
for node-deletion Unique Label Cover with label set $\Sigma$ and an $O^*(4^k)$-time algorithm
for Group Feedback Vertex Set, including the setting where the group is only given by oracle access.
All these significantly improve on previous results. The latter result also implies the first single-exponential
time FPT algorithm for Subset Feedback Vertex Set, answering an open question of Cygan et al. (2012).
Additionally, we propose a network flow-based approach to solve some cases of the relaxation problem.
This gives the first linear-time FPT algorithm to edge-deletion Unique Label Cover.
