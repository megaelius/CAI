This paper explores the use of ambient radio frequency (RF) signals for human presence detection
through deep learning. Using WiFi signal as an example, we demonstrate that the channel state information
(CSI) obtained at the receiver contains rich information about the propagation environment. Through
judicious pre-processing of the estimated CSI followed by deep learning, reliable presence detection
can be achieved. Several challenges in passive RF sensing are addressed. With presence detection,
how to collect training data with human presence can have a significant impact on the performance.
This is in contrast to activity detection when a specific motion pattern is of interest. A second
challenge is that RF signals are complex-valued. Handling complex-valued input in deep learning
requires careful data representation and network architecture design. Finally, human presence
affects CSI variation along multiple dimensions; such variation, however, is often masked by system
impediments such as timing or frequency offset. Addressing these challenges, the proposed learning
system uses pre-processing to preserve human motion induced channel variation while insulating
against other impairments. A convolutional neural network (CNN) properly trained with both magnitude
and phase information is then designed to achieve reliable presence detection. Extensive experiments
are conducted. Using off-the-shelf WiFi devices, the proposed deep learning based RF sensing achieves
near perfect presence detection during multiple extended periods of test and exhibits superior
performance compared with leading edge passive infrared sensors. The learning based passive RF
sensing thus provides a viable and promising alternative for presence or occupancy detection.
