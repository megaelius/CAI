In 2008, Maday and R{\o}nquist introduce{d} an interesting new approach for the direct parallel-in-time
(PinT) solution of time-dependent PDEs. The idea is to diagonalize the time stepping matrix, keeping
the matrices for the space discretization unchanged, and then to solve all time steps in parallel.
Since then, several variants appeared, and we call these closely related algorithms {\em ParaDIAG}
algorithms. ParaDIAG algorithms in the literature can be classified into two groups: \begin{itemize}
\item ParaDIAG-I: direct standalone solvers, \item ParaDIAG-II: iterative solvers, \end{itemize}
We will explain the basic features of each group in this note. To have concrete examples, we will introduce
ParaDIAG-I and ParaDIAG-II for the advection-diffusion equation. We will also introduce ParaDIAG-II
for the wave equation and an optimal control problem for the wave equation. We show the main known
theoretical results in each case, and also provide Matlab codes for testing. The goal of the Matlab
codes (this http URL) is to help the interested reader understand the key features of the ParaDIAG
algorithms, without intention to be highly tuned for efficiency and/or low memory use. We also provide
speedup measurements of ParaDIAG algorithms for a 2D linear advection-diffusion equation. These
results are obtained on the Tianhe-1 supercomputer in China, which is a multi-array, configurable
and cooperative parallel system, and we compare these results to the performance of parareal and
MGRiT, two widely used PinT algorithms. In a forthcoming update of this note, we will provide more
material on ParaDIAG algorithms, in particular further Matlab codes and parallel computing results,also
for more realistic applications.
