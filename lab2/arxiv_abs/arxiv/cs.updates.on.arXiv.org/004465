The core concept of IoT is to equip real world objects with computing, processing and communicating
capabilities to enable socializing between them. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an adherent of IoT
that has realized significant advancements using communication technologies. Vehicles connected
through Internet are capable of sharing information that can substantially enhance the quality
of traffic on roads. Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is an instance of IoT that deals specifically
in socialization of connected objects. SIoT enables the notion of Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV)
where vehicles are the key entities for sharing information between themselves and the infrastructure
(commonly known as Road Side Units (RSUs)). Vehicles in SIoV socialize by exchanging data such as
traffic congestions, weather conditions, infotainment, vacant parking slots, alternate routes
and discount coupons for restaurants etc. In SIoV, vehicles can communicate with other vehicles
and infrastructure through traditional communication technologies like Wi-Fi, Cellular networks
or through Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) etc. SIoV will be confronted with ethical
dilemmas and expected to function in an ethically responsible manner. This paper highlights the
ethical implications of SIoV systems. Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I)
involves autonomous decision making that requires setting ethical and moral rules before taking
verdict. The article discusses the lack of ethical guidelines in designing and deploying of SIoV
systems that are of utmost importance. Finally, an addition to SIoV architecture is proposed to
incorporate the ethical and moral principles for scheming the SIoV systems.
