Database normalization is the one of main principles for designing relational databases. The benefits
of normalization can be observed through improving data quality and performance, among the other
qualities. We explore a new context of technical debt manifestation, which is linked to ill-normalized
databases. This debt can have long-term impact causing systematic degradation of database qualities.
Such degradation can be liken to accumulated interest on a debt. We claim that debts are likely to
materialize for tables below the fourth normal form. Practically, achieving fourth normal form
for all the tables in the database is a costly and idealistic exercise. Therefore, we propose a pragmatic
approach to prioritize tables that should be normalized to the fourth normal form based on the metaphoric
debt and interest of the ill-normalized tables, observed on data quality and performance. For data
quality, tables are prioritized using the risk of data inconsistency metric. Unlike data quality,
a suitable metric to estimate the impact of weakly or un-normalized tables on performance is not
available. We estimate performance degradation and its costs using Input\Output (I\O) cost of
the operations performed on the tables and we propose a model to estimate this cost for each table.
We make use of Modern Portfolio Theory to prioritize tables that should be normalized based on the
estimated I\O cost and the likely risk of cost accumulation in the future. To evaluate our methods,
we use a case study from Microsoft, AdventureWorks. The results show that our methods can be effective
in reducing normalization debt and improving the quality of the database.
