The purpose of this paper is to update the review of Bornmann and Daniel (2008) presenting a narrative
review of studies on citations in scientific documents. The current review covers 41 studies published
between 2006 and 2018. Bornmann and Daniel (2008) focused on earlier years. The current review describes
the (new) studies on citation content and context analyses as well as the studies that explore the
citation motivation of scholars through surveys or interviews. One focus in this paper is on the
technical developments in the last decade, such as the richer meta-data available and machine-readable
formats of scientific papers. These developments have resulted in citation context analyses of
large datasets in comprehensive studies (which was not possible previously). Many studies in recent
years have used computational and machine learning techniques to determine citation functions
and polarities, some of which have attempted to overcome the methodological weaknesses of previous
studies. The automated recognition of citation functions seems to have the potential to greatly
enhance citation indices and information retrieval capabilities. Our review of the empirical
studies demonstrates that a paper may be cited for very different scientific and non-scientific
reasons. This result accords with the finding by Bornmann and Daniel (2008). The current review
also shows that to better understand the relationship between citing and cited documents, a variety
of features should be analyzed, primarily the citation context, the semantics and linguistic patterns
in citations, citation locations within the citing document, and citation polarity (negative,
neutral, positive).
