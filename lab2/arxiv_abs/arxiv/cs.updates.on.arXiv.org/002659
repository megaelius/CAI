We consider the problem of matrix column subset selection, which selects a subset of columns from
an input matrix such that the input can be well approximated by the span of the selected columns. Column
subset selection has been applied to numerous real-world data applications such as population
genetics summarization, electronic circuits testing and recommendation systems. In many applications
the complete data matrix is unavailable and one needs to select representative columns by inspecting
only a small portion of the input matrix. In this paper we propose the first provably correct column
subset selection algorithms for partially observed data matrices. Our proposed algorithms exhibit
different merits and limitations in terms of statistical accuracy, computational efficiency,
sample complexity and sampling schemes, which provides a nice exploration of the tradeoff between
these desired properties for column subset selection. The proposed methods employ the idea of feedback
driven sampling and are inspired by several sampling schemes previously introduced for low-rank
matrix approximation tasks (Drineas et al., 2008; Frieze et al., 2004; Deshpande and Vempala, 2006;
Krishnamurthy and Singh, 2014). Our analysis shows that, under the assumption that the input data
matrix has incoherent rows but possibly coherent columns, all algorithms provably converge to
the best low-rank approximation of the original data as number of selected columns increases. Furthermore,
two of the proposed algorithms enjoy a relative error bound, which is preferred for column subset
selection and matrix approximation purposes. We also demonstrate through both theoretical and
empirical analysis the power of feedback driven sampling compared to uniform random sampling on
input matrices with highly correlated columns.
