Twitter has increasingly become a popular platform to share news and user opinion. A tweet is considered
to be important if it receives high number of affirmative reactions from other Twitter users via
Retweets. Retweet count is thus considered as a surrogate measure for positive crowd-sourced reactions
- high number of retweets of a tweet aid in making its topic trending. This in turn bolsters the social
reputation of the author of the tweet. Since social reputation/impact of users/tweets influences
many decisions (such as promoting brands, advertisement etc.), several blackmarket syndicates
have actively been engaged in producing fake retweets in a collusive manner. Users who want to boost
the impact of their tweets approach the blackmarket services, and gain retweets for their own tweets
by either paying money (Premium Services) or by retweeting other customers' tweets. Thus they become
customers of blackmarket syndicates and engage in fake activities. Interestingly, these customers
are neither bots, nor even fake users - they are usually normal human beings; they express a mix of
organic and inorganic retweeting activities, and there is no synchronicity across their behaviors.
In this paper, we make a first attempt to investigate such blackmarket customers engaged in producing
fake retweets. We collected and annotated a novel dataset comprising of customers of many blackmarket
services and show how their social behavior differs from genuine users. We then use state-of-the-art
supervised models to detect three types of customers (bots, promotional, normal) and genuine users.
We achieve a Macro F1-score of 0.87 with SVM, outperforming four other baselines significantly.
We further design a browser extension, SCoRe which, given the link of a tweet, spots its fake retweeters
in real-time. We also collected users' feedback on the performance of SCoRe and obtained 85% accuracy.
