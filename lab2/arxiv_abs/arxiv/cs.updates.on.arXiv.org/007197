While the history of machine learning so far largely encompasses a series of problems posed by researchers
and algorithms that learn their solutions, an important question is whether the problems themselves
can be generated by the algorithm at the same time as they are being solved. Such a process would in
effect build its own diverse and expanding curricula, and the solutions to problems at various stages
would become stepping stones towards solving even more challenging problems later in the process.
The Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm introduced in this paper does just that: it
pairs the generation of environmental challenges and the optimization of agents to solve those
challenges. It simultaneously explores many different paths through the space of possible problems
and solutions and, critically, allows these stepping-stone solutions to transfer between problems
if better, catalyzing innovation. The term open-ended signifies the intriguing potential for
algorithms like POET to continue to create novel and increasingly complex capabilities without
bound. Our results show that POET produces a diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve
a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved by direct optimization
alone, or even through a direct-path curriculum-building control algorithm introduced to highlight
the critical role of open-endedness in solving ambitious challenges. The ability to transfer solutions
from one environment to another proves essential to unlocking the full potential of the system as
a whole, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of fortuitous stepping stones. We hope that POET
will inspire a new push towards open-ended discovery across many domains, where algorithms like
POET can blaze a trail through their interesting possible manifestations and solutions.
