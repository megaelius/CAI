Recent developments in the realm of state estimation of stochastic dynamic systems in the presence
of non-Gaussian noise have induced a new methodology called the maximum correntropy filtering.
The filters designed under the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) utilize a similarity measure
(or correntropy) between two random variables as a cost function. They are shown to improve the estimators'
robustness against outliers or impulsive noises. In this paper we explore the numerical stability
of linear filtering technique proposed recently under the MCC approach. The resulted estimator
is called the maximum correntropy criterion Kalman filter (MCC-KF). The purpose of this study is
two-fold. First, the previously derived MCC-KF equations are revise and the related Kalman-like
equality conditions are proved. Based on this theoretical finding, we improve the MCC-KF technique
in the sense that the new method possesses a better estimation quality with the reduced computational
cost compared with the previously proposed MCC-KF variant. Second, we devise some square-root
implementations for the newly-designed improved estimator. The square-root algorithms are well
known to be inherently more stable than the conventional Kalman-like implementations, which process
the full error covariance matrix in each iteration step of the filter. Additionally, following
the latest achievements in the KF community, all square-root algorithms are formulated here in
the so-called array form. All the MCC-KF variants developed in this paper are demonstrated to outperform
the previously proposed MCC-KF version in two numerical examples.
