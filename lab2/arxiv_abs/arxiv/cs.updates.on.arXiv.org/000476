Online genealogy datasets contain extensive information about millions of people and their past
and present family connections. This vast amount of data can assist in identifying various patterns
in human population. In this study, we present methods and algorithms which can assist in identifying
variations in lifespan distributions of human population in the past centuries, in detecting social
and genetic features which correlate with human lifespan, and in constructing predictive models
of human lifespan based on various features which can easily be extracted from genealogy datasets.
We have evaluated the presented methods and algorithms on a large online genealogy dataset with
over a million profiles and over 9 million connections, all of which were collected from the WikiTree
website. Our findings indicate that significant but small positive correlations exist between
the parents' lifespan and their children's lifespan. Additionally, we found slightly higher and
significant correlations between the lifespans of spouses. We also discovered a very small positive
and significant correlation between longevity and reproductive success in males, and a small and
significant negative correlation between longevity and reproductive success in females. Moreover,
our machine learning algorithms presented better than random classification results in predicting
which people who outlive the age of 50 will also outlive the age of 80. We believe that this study will
be the first of many studies which utilize the wealth of data on human populations, existing in online
genealogy datasets, to better understand factors which influence human lifespan. Understanding
these factors can assist scientists in providing solutions for successful aging.
