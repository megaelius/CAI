Realistic simulations of detailed, biophysics-based, multi-scale models require very high resolution
and, thus, large-scale compute facilities. Existing simulation environments, especially for
biomedical applications, are designed to allow for a high flexibility and generality in model development.
Flexibility and model development, however, are often a limiting factor for large-scale simulations.
Therefore, new models are typically tested and run on small-scale compute facilities. By using
a detailed biophysics-based, chemo-electromechanical skeletal muscle model and the international
open-source software library OpenCMISS as an example, we present an approach to upgrade an existing
muscle simulation framework from a moderately parallel version towards a massively parallel one
that scales both in terms of problem size and in terms of the number of parallel processes. For this
purpose, we investigate different modeling, algorithmic and implementational aspects. We present
improvements addressing both numerical and parallel scalability. In addition, our approach includes
a novel visualization environment, which is based on the MegaMol environment capable of handling
large amounts of simulated data. It offers a platform for fast visualization prototyping, distributed
rendering, and advanced visualization techniques. We present results of a variety of scaling studies
at the Tier-1 supercomputer HazelHen at the High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS).
We improve the overall runtime by a factor of up to 2.6 and achieved good scalability on up to 768 cores,
where the previous implementation used only 4 cores.
