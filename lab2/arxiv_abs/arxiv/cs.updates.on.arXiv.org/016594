In this paper, we consider the parameterized complexity of the following scheduling problem. We
must schedule a number of jobs on $m$ machines, where each job has unit length, and the graph of precedence
constraints consists of a set of chains. Each precedence constraint is labelled with an integer
that denotes the exact (or minimum) delay between the jobs. We study different cases; delays can
be given in unary and in binary, and the case that we have a single machine is discussed separately.
We consider the complexity of this problem parameterized by the number of chains, and by the thickness
of the instance, which is the maximum number of chains whose intervals between release date and deadline
overlap. We show that this scheduling problem with exact delays in unary is $W[t]$-hard for all $t$,
when parameterized by the thickness, even when we have a single machine ($m = 1$). When parameterized
by the number of chains, this problem is $W[1]$-complete when we have a single or a constant number
of machines, and $W[2]$-complete when the number of machines is a variable. The problem with minimum
delays, given in unary, parameterized by the number of chains (and as a simple corollary, also when
parameterized by the thickness) is $W[1]$-hard for a single or a constant number of machines, and
$W[2]$-hard when the number of machines is variable. With a dynamic programming algorithm, one
can show membership in XP for exact and minimum delays in unary, for any number of machines, when parameterized
by thickness or number of chains. For a single machine, with exact delays in binary, parameterized
by the number of chains, membership in XP can be shown with branching and solving a system of difference
constraints. For all other cases for delays in binary, membership in XP is open.
