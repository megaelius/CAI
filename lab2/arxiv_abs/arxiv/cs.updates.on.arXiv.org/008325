While computer vision has received increasing attention in computer science over the last decade,
there are few efforts in applying this to leverage engineering design research. Existing datasets
and technologies allow researchers to capture and access more observations and video files, hence
analysis is becoming a limiting factor. Therefore, this paper is investigating the application
of machine learning, namely object detection methods to aid in the analysis of physical porotypes.
With access to a large dataset of digitally captured physical prototypes from early-stage development
projects (5950 images from 850 prototypes), the authors investigate applications that can be used
for analysing this dataset. The authors retrained two pre-trained object detection models from
two known frameworks, the TensorFlow Object Detection API and Darknet, using custom image sets
of images of physical prototypes. As a result, a proof-of-concept of four trained models are presented;
two models for detecting samples of wood-based sheet materials and two models for detecting samples
containing microcontrollers. All models are evaluated using standard metrics for object detection
model performance and the applicability of using object detection models in engineering design
research is discussed. Results indicate that the models can successfully classify the type of material
and type of pre-made component, respectively. However, more work is needed to fully integrate object
detection models in the engineering design analysis workflow. The authors also extrapolate that
the use of object detection for analysing images of physical prototypes will substantially reduce
the effort required for analysing large datasets in engineering design research.
