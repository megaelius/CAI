Blockchain is maintained as a global log between a network of nodes and uses cryptographic distributed
protocols to synchronize the updates. As adopted by Bitcoin and Ethereum these update operations
to the ledger are serialized, and executed in batches. To safeguard the system against the generation
of conflicting sets of updates and maintain the consistency of the ledger, the frequency of the updates
is controlled, which severely affects the performance of the system. This paper presents Converging
Directed Acyclic Graph (CDAG), as a substitute for the chain and DAG structures used in other blockchain
protocols. CDAG allows multiple parallel updates to the ledger and converges them at the next step
providing finality to the blocks. It partitions the updates into non-intersecting buckets of transactions
to prevent the generation of conflicting blocks and divide the time into slots to provide enough
time for them to propagate in the network. Multiple simultaneous updates improve the throughput
of CDAG, and the converging step helps to finalize them faster, even in the presence of conflicts.
Moreover, CDAG provides a total order among the blocks of the ledger to support smart contracts,
unlike some of the other blockDAG protocols. We evaluate the performance of CDAG on Google Cloud
Platform using Google Kubernetes Engine, simulating a real-time network. Experimental results
show that CDAG achieves a throughput of more than 2000 transactions per second and confirms them
well in under 2 minutes. Also, the protocol scales well in comparison to other permissioned protocols,
and the capacity of the network only limits the performance.
