Semi-supervised clustering seeks to augment traditional clustering methods by incorporating
side information provided via human expertise in order to increase the semantic meaningfulness
of the resulting clusters. However, most current methods are \emph{passive} in the sense that the
side information is provided beforehand and selected randomly. This may require a large number
of constraints, some of which could be redundant, unnecessary, or even detrimental to the clustering
results. Thus in order to scale such semi-supervised algorithms to larger problems it is desirable
to pursue an \emph{active} clustering method---i.e. an algorithm that maximizes the effectiveness
of the available human labor by only requesting human input where it will have the greatest impact.
Here, we propose a novel online framework for active semi-supervised spectral clustering that
selects pairwise constraints as clustering proceeds, based on the principle of uncertainty reduction.
Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we decompose the expected uncertainty reduction problem
into a gradient and a step-scale, computed via an application of matrix perturbation theory and
cluster-assignment entropy, respectively. The resulting model is used to estimate the uncertainty
reduction potential of each sample in the dataset. We then present the human user with pairwise queries
with respect to only the best candidate sample. We evaluate our method using three different image
datasets (faces, leaves and dogs), a set of common UCI machine learning datasets and a gene dataset.
The results validate our decomposition formulation and show that our method is consistently superior
to existing state-of-the-art techniques, as well as being robust to noise and to unknown numbers
of clusters.
