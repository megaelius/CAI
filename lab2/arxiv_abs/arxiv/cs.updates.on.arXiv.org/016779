The realization that selfish interests need to be accounted for in the design of algorithms has produced
many contributions in computer science under the umbrella of algorithmic mechanism design. Novel
algorithmic properties and paradigms have been identified and studied. Our work stems from the
observation that selfishness is different from rationality; agents will attempt to strategize
whenever they perceive it to be convenient according to their imperfect rationality. Recent work
has focused on a particular notion of imperfect rationality, namely absence of contingent reasoning
skills, and defined obvious strategyproofness (OSP) as a way to deal with the selfishness of these
agents. Essentially, this definition states that to care for the incentives of these agents, we
need not only pay attention about the relationship between input and output, but also about the way
the algorithm is run. However, it is not clear what algorithmic approaches must be used for OSP. In
this paper, we show that, for binary allocation problems, OSP is fully captured by a combination
of two well-known algorithmic techniques: forward and reverse greedy. We call two-way greedy this
algorithmic design paradigm. Our main technical contribution establishes the connection between
OSP and two-way greedy. We build upon the recently introduced cycle monotonicity technique for
OSP. By means of novel structural properties of cycles and queries of OSP mechanisms, we fully characterize
these mechanisms in terms of extremal implementations. These are protocols that ask each agent
to consistently separate one extreme of their domain at the current history from the rest. Through
the connection with the greedy paradigm, we are able to import a host of approximation bounds to OSP
and strengthen the strategic properties of this family of algorithms. Finally, we begin exploring
the power of two-way greedy for set systems.
