Reasoning about the pose, i.e. position and orientation of objects is one of the cornerstones of
robotic manipulation under uncertainty. In a number of joint research projects our group is developing
a robotic perception system that perceives and models an unprepared kitchen scenario with many
objects. Since no single sensor or measurement provides sufficient information, a technique is
needed to fuse a number of uncertain estimates of the pose, i.e. estimates with a widely stretched
probability density function ($pdf$). The most frequently used approaches to describe the $pdfs$
are sample based description and multivariate normal (Gaussian) distributions. Sample based
descriptions in 6D can describe basically any type of $pdfs$, but they require a large number of samples
and there are no analytic formulae to fuse several $pdfs$. For Gaussian distributions these formulae
exist, but the Gaussian distributions are unimodal and don't model widely spread distributions
well. In this paper we present a framework for probabilistic modeling of 6D poses that combines the
expressive power of the sample based description with the conciseness and algorithmic power of
the Gaussian models. As parameterization of the 6D poses we select the dual quaternions, i.e. any
pose is represented by two quaternions. The orientation part of a pose is described by a unit quaternion.
The translation part is described by a purely imaginary quaternion. A basic probability density
function over the poses is constructed by selecting a tangent point on the 3D sphere representing
unit quaternions and taking the Cartesian set product of the tangent space with the 3D space of translations.
In this 6D Euclidean space a 6D Gaussian distribution is defined. Projecting this Gaussian back
to the unit sphere and renormalizing induces a distribution over 6D poses, called a Projected Gaussian.
