Comprehensive case studies on malicious code mostly focus on botnets and worms (recently revived
with IoT devices), prominent pieces of malware or Advanced Persistent Threats, exploit kits, and
ransomware. However, adware seldom receives such attention. Previous studies on "unwanted" Windows
applications, including adware, favored breadth of analysis, uncovering ties between different
actors and distribution methods. In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities, privacy and security
risks, and prevalence of a particularly successful and active adware business: Wajam, by tracking
its evolution over nearly six years. We first study its multi-layer antivirus evasion capabilities,
a combination of known and newly adapted techniques, that ensure low detection rates of its daily
variants, along with prominent features, e.g., traffic interception and browser process injection.
Then, we look at the privacy and security implications for infected users, including plaintext
leaks of browser histories and keyword searches on highly popular websites, along with arbitrary
content injection on HTTPS webpages and remote code execution vulnerabilities. Finally, we study
Wajam's prevalence through the popularity of its domains. Once considered as seriously as spyware,
adware is now merely called "not-a-virus", "optional" or "unwanted" although its negative impact
is growing. We emphasize that the adware problem has been overlooked for too long, which can reach
(or even surplus) the complexity and impact of regular malware, and pose both privacy and security
risks to users, more so than many well-known and thoroughly-analyzed malware families.
