Emotion shapes all aspects of our interpersonal and intellectual experiences. Its automatic analysis
has there-fore many applications, e.g., human-machine interface. In this paper, we propose an
emotional tonal speech dataset, namely Mandarin Chinese Emotional Speech Dataset - Portrayed
(MES-P), with both distal and proximal labels. In contrast with state of the art emotional speech
datasets which are only focused on perceived emotions, the proposed MES-P dataset includes not
only perceived emotions with their proximal labels but also intended emotions with distal labels,
thereby making it possible to study human emotional intelligence, i.e. people emotion expression
ability and their skill of understanding emotions, thus explicitly accounting for perception
differences between intended and perceived emotions in speech signals and enabling studies of
emotional misunderstandings which often occur in real life. Furthermore, the proposed MES-P dataset
also captures a main feature of tonal languages, i.e., tonal variations, and provides recorded
emotional speech samples whose tonal variations match the tonal distribution in real life Mandarin
Chinese. Besides, the proposed MES-P dataset features emotion intensity variations as well, and
includes both moderate and intense versions of recordings for joy, anger, and sadness in addition
to neutral speech. Ratings of the collected speech samples are made in valence-arousal space through
continuous coordinate locations, resulting in an emotional distribution pattern in 2D VA space.
The consistency between the speakers' emotional intentions and the listeners' perceptions is
also studied using Cohen's Kappa coefficients. Finally, we also carry out extensive experiments
using a baseline on MES-P for automatic emotion recognition and compare the results with human emotion
intelligence.
