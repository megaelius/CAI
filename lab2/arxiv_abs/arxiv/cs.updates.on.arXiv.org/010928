Meta-learning has been proposed as a framework to address the challenging few-shot learning setting.
The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a
base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks
(DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, typical meta-learning models use shallow neural
networks, thus limiting its effectiveness. In order to achieve top performance, some recent works
tried to use the DNNs pre-trained on large-scale datasets but mostly in straight-forward manners,
e.g., (1) taking their weights as a warm start of meta-training, and (2) freezing their convolutional
layers as the feature extractor of base-learners. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called
meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to transfer the weights of a deep NN for few-shot learning
tasks. Specifically, meta refers to training multiple tasks, and transfer is achieved by learning
scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we introduce the hard task
(HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum that further boosts the learning efficiency
of MTL. We conduct few-shot learning experiments and report top performance for five-class few-shot
recognition tasks on three challenging benchmarks: miniImageNet, tieredImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100
(FC100). Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our MTL approach trained with the
proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both
components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy.
