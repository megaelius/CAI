Since ancient Greece, handshaking has been commonly practiced between two people as a friendly
gesture to express trust and respect, or form a mutual agreement. In this paper, we show that such
physical contact can be used to bootstrap secure cyber contact between the smart devices worn by
users. The key observation is that during handshaking, although belonged to two different users,
the two hands involved in the shaking events are often rigidly connected, and therefore exhibit
very similar motion patterns. We propose a novel Shake-n-Shack system, which harvests motion data
during user handshaking from the wrist worn smart devices such as smartwatches or fitness bands,
and exploits the matching motion patterns to generate symmetric keys on both parties. The generated
keys can be then used to establish a secure communication channel for exchanging data between devices.
This provides a much more natural and user-friendly alternative for many applications, e.g. exchanging/sharing
contact details, friending on social networks, or even making payments, since it doesn't involve
extra bespoke hardware, nor require the users to perform pre-defined gestures. We implement the
proposed Shake-n-Shack system on off-the-shelf smartwatches, and extensive evaluation shows
that it can reliably generate 128-bit symmetric keys just after around 1s of handshaking (with success
rate >99%), and is resilient to real-time mimicking attacks: in our experiments the Equal Error
Rate (EER) is only 1.6% on average. We also show that the proposed Shake-n-Shack system can be extremely
lightweight, and is able to run in-situ on the resource-constrained smartwatches without incurring
excessive resource consumption.
