A novel framework is proposed for the deployment and passive beamforming design of a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) with the aid of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology. The
problem of joint deployment, phase shift design, as well as power allocation is formulated for maximizing
the energy efficiency with considering users' particular data requirements. To tackle this pertinent
problem, machine learning approaches are adopted in two steps. Firstly, a novel long short-term
memory (LSTM) based echo state network (ESN) algorithm is proposed to predict users' tele-traffic
demand by leveraging a real dataset. Secondly, a decaying double deep Q-network (D3QN) based position-acquisition
and phase-control algorithm is proposed to solve the joint problem of deployment and design of the
RIS. In the proposed algorithm, the base station, which controls the RIS by a controller, acts as
an agent. The agent periodically observes the state of the RIS-enhanced system for attaining the
optimal deployment and design policies of the RIS by learning from its mistakes and the feedback
of users. Additionally, it is proved that the proposed D3QN based deployment and design algorithm
is capable of converging within mild conditions. Simulation results are provided for illustrating
that the proposed LSTM-based ESN algorithm is capable of striking a tradeoff between the prediction
accuracy and computational complexity. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed D3QN based
algorithm outperforms the benchmarks, while the NOMA-enhanced RIS system is capable of achieving
higher energy efficiency than orthogonal multiple access (OMA) enabled RIS system.
