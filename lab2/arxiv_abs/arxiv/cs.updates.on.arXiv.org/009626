A low-cost 1-DOF hand exoskeleton for neuromuscular rehabilitation has been designed and assembled.
It consists of a base equipped with a servo motor, an index finger part, and a thumb part, connected
through three gears. The index part has a tri-axial load cell and an attached ring to measure the finger
force. An admittance control scheme was designed to provide intuitive control and positive force
amplification to assist the user's finger movement. To evaluate the effects of different control
parameters on neuromuscular re-sponse of the fingers, we created an integrated exoskeleton-hand
musculo-skeletal model to virtually simulate and optimize the control loop. The exo-skeleton
is controlled by a proportional derivative controller that computes the motor torque to follow
a desired joint angle of the index part, which is obtained from inverse kinematics of a virtual end-effector
mass driven by the finger force. We conducted parametric simulations of the exoskeleton in action,
driven by the user's closing and opening finger motion, with different proportional gains, end-effector
masses, and other coefficients. We com-pared the interaction forces between the index finger and
the ring in both passive and active modes. The best performing assistive controller can re-duce
the force from around 1.45N (in passive mode) to only around 0.52N, more than 64% of reduction. As
a result, the muscle activations of the flex-ors and extensors were reduced significantly. We also
noted the admittance control scheme is versatile and can also provide resistance (e.g. for strength
training) by simply increasing the virtual end-effect mass.
