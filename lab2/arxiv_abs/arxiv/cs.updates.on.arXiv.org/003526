This chapter discusses the interplay between structure and dynamics in complex networks. Given
a particular network with an endowed dynamics, our goal is to find partitions aligned with the dynamical
process acting on top of the network. We thus aim to gain a reduced description of the system that takes
into account both its structure and dynamics. In the first part, we introduce the general mathematical
setup for the types of dynamics we consider throughout the chapter. We provide two guiding examples,
namely consensus dynamics and diffusion processes (random walks), motivating their connection
to social network analysis, and provide a brief discussion on the general dynamical framework and
its possible extensions. In the second part, we focus on the influence of graph structure on the dynamics
taking place on the network, focusing on three concepts that allow us to gain insight into this notion.
First, we describe how time scale separation can appear in the dynamics on a network as a consequence
of graph structure. Second, we discuss how the presence of particular symmetries in the network
give rise to invariant dynamical subspaces that can be precisely described by graph partitions.
Third, we show how this dynamical viewpoint can be extended to study dynamics on networks with signed
edges, which allow us to discuss connections to concepts in social network analysis, such as structural
balance. In the third part, we discuss how to use dynamical processes unfolding on the network to
detect meaningful network substructures. We then show how such dynamical measures can be related
to seemingly different algorithm for community detection and coarse-graining proposed in the
literature. We conclude with a brief summary and highlight interesting open future directions.
