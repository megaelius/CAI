Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at retrieving a person of interest across multiple non-overlapping
cameras. With the advancement of deep neural networks and increasing demand of intelligent video
surveillance, it has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community.
By dissecting the involved components in developing a person Re-ID system, we categorize it into
the closed-world and open-world settings. The widely studied closed-world setting is usually
applied under various research-oriented assumptions, and has achieved inspiring success using
deep learning techniques on a number of datasets. We first conduct a comprehensive overview with
in-depth analysis for closed-world person Re-ID from three different perspectives, including
deep feature representation learning, deep metric learning and ranking optimization. With the
performance saturation under closed-world setting, the research focus for person Re-ID has recently
shifted to the open-world setting, facing more challenging issues. This setting is closer to practical
applications under specific scenarios. We summarize the open-world Re-ID in terms of five different
aspects. By analyzing the advantages of existing methods, we design a powerful AGW baseline, achieving
state-of-the-art or at least comparable performance on both single- and cross-modality Re-ID
tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a new evaluation metric (mINP) for person Re-ID, indicating the
cost for finding all the correct matches, which provides an additional criteria to evaluate the
Re-ID system for real applications. Finally, some important yet under-investigated open issues
are discussed.
