Complex Event Processing (CEP) has emerged as the unifying field for technologies that require
processing and correlating heterogeneous distributed data sources in real-time. CEP finds applications
in diverse domains, which has resulted in a large number of proposals for expressing and processing
complex events. However, existing CEP frameworks are based on ad-hoc solutions that do not rely
on solid theoretical ground, making them hard to understand, extend or generalize. Moreover, they
are usually presented as application programming interfaces documented by examples, and using
each of them requires learning a different set of skills. In this paper we embark on the task of giving
a rigorous framework to CEP. As a starting point, we propose a formal language for specifying complex
events, called CEPL, that contains the common features used in the literature and has a simple and
denotational semantics. We also formalize the so-called selection strategies, which are the cornerstone
of CEP and had only been presented as by-design extensions to existing frameworks. With a well-defined
semantics at hand, we study how to efficiently evaluate CEPL for processing complex events. We provide
optimization results based on rewriting formulas to a normal form that simplifies the evaluation
of filters. Furthermore, we introduce a formal computational model for CEP based on transducers
and symbolic automata, called match automata, that captures the regular core of CEPL, i.e. formulas
with unary predicates. By using rewriting techniques and automata-based translations, we show
that formulas in the regular core of CEPL can be evaluated using constant time per event followed
by constant-delay enumeration of the output (under data complexity). By gathering these results
together, we propose a framework for efficiently evaluating CEPL, establishing solid foundations
for future CEP systems.
