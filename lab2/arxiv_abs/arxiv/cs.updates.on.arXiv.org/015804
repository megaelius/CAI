With the advent of agriculture 3.0 and 4.0, researchers are increasingly focusing on the development
of innovative smart farming and precision agriculture technologies by introducing automation
and robotics into the agricultural processes. Autonomous agricultural field machines have been
gaining significant attention from farmers and industries to reduce costs, human workload, and
required resources. Nevertheless, achieving sufficient autonomous navigation capabilities
requires the simultaneous cooperation of different processes; localization, mapping, and path
planning are just some of the steps that aim at providing to the machine the right set of skills to operate
in semi-structured and unstructured environments. In this context, this study presents a low-cost
local motion planner for autonomous navigation in vineyards based only on an RGB-D camera, low range
hardware, and a dual layer control algorithm. The first algorithm exploits the disparity map and
its depth representation to generate a proportional control for the robotic platform. Concurrently,
a second back-up algorithm, based on representations learning and resilient to illumination variations,
can take control of the machine in case of a momentaneous failure of the first block. Moreover, due
to the double nature of the system, after initial training of the deep learning model with an initial
dataset, the strict synergy between the two algorithms opens the possibility of exploiting new
automatically labeled data, coming from the field, to extend the existing model knowledge. The
machine learning algorithm has been trained and tested, using transfer learning, with acquired
images during different field surveys in the North region of Italy and then optimized for on-device
inference with model pruning and quantization. Finally, the overall system has been validated
with a customized robot platform in the relevant environment.
