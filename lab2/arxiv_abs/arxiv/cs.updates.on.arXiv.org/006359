5G networks mainly rely on infrastructure-centric cellular solutions to address data traffic
and service demands. Continuously scaling infrastructure-centric cellular networks is not exempt
of challenges, and beyond 5G networks should consider the active coexistence and coordination
of infrastructure-centric and device-centric wireless networks. Device-centric wireless networks
will build from D2D and MCNs. Device-centric wireless networks can push the limits of edge computing
and networking to smart devices (including smartphones, vehicles, machines and robots), and exploit
their mobile computing, storage and connectivity capabilities. These capabilities can be more
efficiently utilized using demand-driven opportunistic networking that establishes the connections
between devices and nodes based on their capacity to support the requested demand and services.
This paper presents results from experimental field tests that demonstrate the cellular spectral
efficiency gains that can be achieved from the combined use of device-centric wireless communications
and demand-driven opportunistic networking. The field trials demonstrate that these technologies
can improve the cellular spectral efficiency of conventional cellular communications by up to
a factor of 4.7 and 12 in outdoor pedestrian and vehicular scenarios, respectively. These gains
have been obtained using 4G and IEEE 802.11 technologies. However, the potential of device-centric
wireless networks is not constrained to any particular radio interface. The results presented
in this paper provide empirical evidences that further motivate progressing towards a new paradigm
where edge networking capabilities are moved to smart mobile devices that become part of the network
fabric, and can opportunistically and locally integrate network management functions to ensure
that sufficient resources are placed where the demand arises.
