CNN-based steganalysis has recently achieved very good performance in detecting content-adaptive
steganography. At the same time, recent works have shown that, by adopting an approach similar to
that used to build adversarial examples, a steganographer can adopt an adversarial embedding strategy
to effectively counter a target CNN steganalyzer. In turn, the good performance of the steganalyzer
can be restored by retraining the CNN with adversarial stego images. A problem with this model is
that, arguably, at training time the steganalizer is not aware of the exact parameters used by the
steganograher for adversarial embedding and, vice versa, the steganographer does not know how
the images that will be used to train the steganalyzer are generated. In order to exit this apparent
deadlock, we introduce a game theoretic framework wherein the problem of setting the parameters
of the steganalyzer and the steganographer is solved in a strategic way. More specifically, a non-zero
sum game is first formulated to model the problem, and then instantiated by considering a specific
adversarial embedding scheme setting its operating parameters in a game-theoretic fashion. Our
analysis shows that the equilibrium solution of the non zero-sum game can be conveniently found
by solving an associated zero-sum game, thus reducing greatly the complexity of the problem. Then
we run several experiments to derive the optimum strategies for the steganographer and the staganalyst
in a game-theoretic sense, and to evaluate the performance of the game at the equilibrium, characterizing
the loss with respect to the conventional non-adversarial case. Eventually, by leveraging on the
analysis of the equilibrium point of the game, we introduce a new strategy to improve the reliability
of the steganalysis, which shows the benefits of addressing the security issue in a game-theoretic
perspective.
