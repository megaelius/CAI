The introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into public administrations
has been radically changing the way organizations cooperate and, more generally, the way to think
about business processes over organizational boundaries. In this paper we describe our approach
to combining business processes with business rules in order to integrate effectively single units
in an inter- or intra-organizational cooperation. Business rules represent the knowledge that
an administration has about its business; with regard to this, they can express strategies, contracts
and can influence not only staff relations, but, finally, citizen relations, as well. In other words,
business rules are the core of an administration and affect either the business processes or the
behaviours of the system participants. They are typically expressed implicitly in business contracts
and they are embedded within the source code of many application modules. So a concise and declarative
statement of business behaviour is converted into a set of programming instructions, which are
spread widely throughout the whole information system. In this way, business rules are difficult
to change and keep consistent over the time. For this reason, it is necessary to reengineer the system
in order to logically and perhaps physically externalize rules from the application code. In our
proposed approach, we describe a cooperation as a collection of tasks combined in certain ways according
to the organization logic specified by business rules. Our rule-driven methodology has the goal
to make the business process design more adaptable to the changes of internal or external environment.
