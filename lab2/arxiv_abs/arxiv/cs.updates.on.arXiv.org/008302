In a recent work (ECCC, TR18-171, 2018), we introduced models of testing graph properties in which,
in addition to answers to the usual graph-queries, the tester obtains {\em random vertices drawn
according to an arbitrary distribution $D$}. Such a tester is required to distinguish between graphs
that have the property and graphs that are far from having the property, {\em where the distance between
graphs is defined based on the unknown vertex distribution $D$}. These ("vertex-distribution
free" (VDF)) models generalize the standard models in which $D$ is postulated to be uniform on the
vertex-set, and they were studies both in the dense graph model and in the bounded-degree graph model.
The focus of the aforementioned work was on testers, called {\sf strong}, whose query complexity
depends only on the proximity parameter $\epsilon$. Unfortunately, in the standard bounded-degree
graph model, some natural properties such as Bipartiteness do not have strong testers, and others
(like cycle-freeness) do not have strong testers of one-sided error (whereas one-sided error was
shown inherent to the VDF model). Hence, it was suggested to study general (i.e., non-strong) testers
of "sub-linear" complexity. In this work, we pursue the foregoing suggestion, but do so in a model
that augments the model presented in the aforementioned work. Specifically, we provide the tester
with an evaluation oracle to the unknown distribution $D$, in addition to samples of $D$ and oracle
access to the tested graph. Our main results are testers for Bipartitness and cycle-freeness, in
this augmented model, having complexity that is almost-linear in the square root of the "effective
support size" of $D$.
