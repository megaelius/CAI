The large integration of variable energy resources is expected to shift a large part of the energy
exchanges closer to real-time, where more accurate forecasts are available. In this context, the
short-term electricity markets and in particular the intraday market are considered a suitable
trading floor for these exchanges to occur. A key component for the successful renewable energy
sources integration is the usage of energy storage. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling framework
for the strategic participation of energy storage in the European continuous intraday market where
exchanges occur through a centralized order book. The goal of the storage device operator is the
maximization of the profits received over the entire trading horizon, while taking into account
the operational constraints of the unit. The sequential decision-making problem of trading in
the intraday market is modelled as a Markov Decision Process. An asynchronous distributed version
of the fitted Q iteration algorithm is chosen for solving this problem due to its sample efficiency.
The large and variable number of the existing orders in the order book motivates the use of high-level
actions and an alternative state representation. Historical data are used for the generation of
a large number of artificial trajectories in order to address exploration issues during the learning
process. The resulting policy is back-tested and compared against a benchmark strategy that is
the current industrial standard. Results indicate that the agent converges to a policy that achieves
in average higher total revenues than the benchmark strategy.
