Secure signal authentication is arguably one of the most challenging problems in the Internet of
Things (IoT) environment, due to the large-scale nature of the system and its susceptibility to
man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks. In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed
for dynamic authentication of IoT signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning framework,
based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT devices (IoTDs) to extract a
set of stochastic features from their generated signal and dynamically watermark these features
into the signal. This method enables the cloud, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively
authenticate the reliability of the signals. Moreover, in massive IoT scenarios, since the cloud
cannot authenticate all the IoTDs simultaneously due to computational limitations, a game-theoretic
framework is proposed to improve the cloud's decision making process by predicting vulnerable
IoTDs. The mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) for this game is derived and the uniqueness of
the expected utility at the equilibrium is proven. In the massive IoT system, due to a large set of
available actions for the cloud, it is shown that analytically deriving the MSNE is challenging
and, thus, a learning algorithm proposed that converges to the MSNE. Moreover, in order to cope with
the incomplete information case in which the cloud cannot access the state of the unauthenticated
IoTDs, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to dynamically predict the state of
unauthenticated IoTDs and allow the cloud to decide on which IoTDs to authenticate. Simulation
results show that, with an attack detection delay of under 1 second the messages can be transmitted
from IoT devices with an almost 100% reliability.
