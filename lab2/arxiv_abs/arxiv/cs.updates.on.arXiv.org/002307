The well-known Sensitivity Conjecture states that for any Boolean function $f$, block sensitivity
of $f$ is at most polynomial in sensitivity of $f$ (denoted by $\s(f)$). The XOR Log-Rank Conjecture
states that for any $n$ bit Boolean function, $f$ the communication complexity of a related function
$f^{\oplus}$ on $2n$ bits, (defined as $f^{\oplus}(x,y)=f(x\oplus y)$) is at most polynomial
in logarithm of the sparsity of $f$ (denoted by $\sp(f)$). A recent result of Lin and Zhang (2017)
implies that to confirm the above conjectures it suffices to upper bound alternation of $f$ (denoted
$\al(f)$) for all Boolean functions $f$ by polynomial in $\s(f)$ and logarithm of $\sp(f)$, respectively.
In this context, we show the following : * There exists a family of Boolean functions for which $\al(f)$
is at least exponential in $\s(f)$ and $\al(f)$ is at least exponential in $\log \sp(f)$. En route
to the proof, we also show an exponential gap between $\al(f)$ and the decision tree complexity of
$f$, which might be of independent interest. * As our main result, we show that, despite the above
gap between $\al(f)$ and $\log \sp(f)$, the XOR Log-Rank Conjecture is true for functions with the
alternation upper bounded by $poly(\log n)$. It is easy to observe that the Sensitivity Conjecture
is also true for this class of functions. * The starting point for the above result is the observation
(derived from Lin and Zhang (2017)) that for any Boolean function $f$ and $m \ge 2$, $deg(f)\le \al(f)deg_2(f)deg_m(f)$
where $deg(f)$, $deg_2(f)$ and $deg_m(f)$ are the degrees of $f$ over $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{F}_2$
and $\mathbb{Z}_m$ respectively. We also show three further applications of this observation.
