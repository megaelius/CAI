To select the best algorithm for a new problem is an expensive and difficult task. However, there
are automatic solutions to address this problem: using Metalearning, which takes advantage of
problem characteristics (i.e. metafeatures), one is able to predict the relative performance
of algorithms. In the Collaborative Filtering scope, recent works have proposed diverse metafeatures
describing several dimensions of this problem. Despite interesting and effective findings, it
is still unknown whether these are the most effective metafeatures. Hence, this work proposes a
new set of graph metafeatures, which approach the Collaborative Filtering problem from a Graph
Theory perspective. Furthermore, in order to understand whether metafeatures from multiple dimensions
are a better fit, we investigate the effects of comprehensive metafeatures. These metafeatures
are a selection of the best metafeatures from all existing Collaborative Filtering metafeatures.
The impact of the most representative metafeatures is investigated in a controlled experimental
setup. Another contribution we present is the use of a Pareto-Efficient ranking procedure to create
multicriteria metatargets. These new rankings of algorithms, which take into account multiple
evaluation measures, allow to explore the algorithm selection problem in a fairer and more detailed
way. According to the experimental results, the graph metafeatures are a good alternative to related
work metafeatures. However, the results have shown that the feature selection procedure used to
create the comprehensive metafeatures is is not effective, since there is no gain in predictive
performance. Finally, an extensive metaknowledge analysis was conducted to identify the most
influential metafeatures.
