This paper investigates the capacity scaling of multicell massive MIMO systems in the presence
of spatially correlated fading. In particular, we focus on the strong spatial correlation regimes
where the covariance matrix of each user channel vector has a rank that scales sublinearly with the
number of base station antennas, as the latter grows to infinity. We also consider the case where
the covariance eigenvectors corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalues span randomly selected
subspaces. For this channel model, referred to as the "random sparse angular support" model, we
characterize the asymptotic capacity scaling law in the limit of large number of antennas. To achieve
the asymptotic capacity results, statistical spatial despreading based on the second-order channel
statistics plays a pivotal role in terms of pilot decontamination and interference suppression.
A remarkable result is that even when the number of users scales linearly with base station antennas,
a linear growth of the capacity with respect to the number of antennas is achievable under the sparse
angular support model. We note that the achievable rate lower bound based on massive MIMO "channel
hardening", widely used in the massive MIMO literature, yields rather loose results in the strong
spatial correlation regimes and may significantly underestimate the achievable rate of massive
MIMO. This work therefore considers an alternative bounding technique which is better suited to
the strong correlation regimes. In fading channels with sparse angular support, it is further shown
that spatial despreading (spreading) in uplink (downlink) has a more prominent impact on the performance
of massive MIMO than channel hardening.
