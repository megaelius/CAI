Statistical body shape models are widely used in 3D pose estimation due to their low-dimensional
parameters representation. However, it is difficult to avoid self-intersection between body
parts accurately. Motivated by this fact, we proposed a novel self-intersection penalty term for
statistical body shape models applied in 3D pose estimation. To avoid the trouble of computing self-intersection
for complex surfaces like the body meshes, the gradient of our proposed self-intersection penalty
term is manually derived from the perspective of geometry. First, the self-intersection penalty
term is defined as the volume of the self-intersection region. To calculate the partial derivatives
with respect to the coordinates of the vertices, we employed detection rays to divide vertices of
statistical body shape models into different groups depending on whether the vertex is in the region
of self-intersection. Second, the partial derivatives could be easily derived by the normal vectors
of neighboring triangles of the vertices. Finally, this penalty term could be applied in gradient-based
optimization algorithms to remove the self-intersection of triangular meshes without using any
approximation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness
and generality of our proposed method compared with previous approaches. The experimental results
show that our proposed penalty term can avoid self-intersection to exclude unreasonable predictions
and improves the accuracy of 3D pose estimation indirectly. Further more, the proposed method could
be employed universally in triangular mesh based 3D reconstruction.
