In line with recent advances in neural drug design and sensitivity prediction, we propose a novel
architecture for interpretable prediction of anticancer compound sensitivity using a multimodal
attention-based convolutional encoder. Our model is based on the three key pillars of drug sensitivity:
compounds' structure in the form of a SMILES sequence, gene expression profiles of tumors and prior
knowledge on intracellular interactions from protein-protein interaction networks. We demonstrate
that our multiscale convolutional attention-based (MCA) encoder significantly outperforms
a baseline model trained on Morgan fingerprints, a selection of encoders based on SMILES as well
as previously reported state of the art for multimodal drug sensitivity prediction (R2 = 0.86 and
RMSE = 0.89). Moreover, the explainability of our approach is demonstrated by a thorough analysis
of the attention weights. We show that the attended genes significantly enrich apoptotic processes
and that the drug attention is strongly correlated with a standard chemical structure similarity
index. Finally, we report a case study of two receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors acting on
a leukemia cell line, showcasing the ability of the model to focus on informative genes and submolecular
regions of the two compounds. The demonstrated generalizability and the interpretability of our
model testify its potential for in-silico prediction of anticancer compound efficacy on unseen
cancer cells, positioning it as a valid solution for the development of personalized therapies
as well as for the evaluation of candidate compounds in de novo drug design.
