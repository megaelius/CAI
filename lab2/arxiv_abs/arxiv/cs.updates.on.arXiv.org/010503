The human lung is a complex respiratory organ, consisting of five distinct anatomic compartments
called lobes. Accurate and automatic segmentation of these pulmonary lobes from computed tomography
(CT) images is of clinical importance for lung disease assessment and treatment planning. However,
this task is challenging due to ambiguous lobar boundaries, anatomical variations and pathological
deformations. In this paper, we propose a high-resolution and efficient 3D fully convolutional
network to automatically segment the lobes. We refer to the network as Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation
Network (PLS-Net), which is designed to efficiently exploit 3D spatial and contextual information
from high-resolution volumetric CT images for effective volume-to-volume learning and inference.
The PLS-Net is based on an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with three novel components:
(i) 3D depthwise separable convolutions to improve the network efficiency by factorising each
regular 3D convolution into two simpler operations; (ii) dilated residual dense blocks to efficiently
expand the receptive field of the network and aggregate multi-scale contextual information for
segmentation; and (iii) input reinforcement at each downsampled resolution to compensate for
the loss of spatial information due to convolutional and downsampling operations. We evaluated
the proposed PLS-Net on a multi-institutional dataset that consists of 210 CT images acquired from
patients with a wide range of lung abnormalities. Experimental results show that our PLS-Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance with better computational efficiency. Further experiments confirm
the effectiveness of each novel component of the PLS-Net.
