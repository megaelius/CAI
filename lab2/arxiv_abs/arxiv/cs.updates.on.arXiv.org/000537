In this paper, we consider networks consisting of a finite number of non-overlapping communities.
To extract these communities, the interaction between pairs of nodes may be sampled from a large
available data set, which allows a given node pair to be sampled several times. When a node pair is
sampled, the observed outcome is a binary random variable, equal to 1 if nodes interact and to 0 otherwise.
The outcome is more likely to be positive if nodes belong to the same communities. For a given budget
of node pair samples or observations, we wish to jointly design a sampling strategy (the sequence
of sampled node pairs) and a clustering algorithm that recover the hidden communities with the highest
possible accuracy. We consider both non-adaptive and adaptive sampling strategies, and for both
classes of strategies, we derive fundamental performance limits satisfied by any sampling and
clustering algorithm. In particular, we provide necessary conditions for the existence of algorithms
recovering the communities accurately as the network size grows large. We also devise simple algorithms
that accurately reconstruct the communities when this is at all possible, hence proving that the
proposed necessary conditions for accurate community detection are also sufficient. The classical
problem of community detection in the stochastic block model can be seen as a particular instance
of the problems consider here. But our framework covers more general scenarios where the sequence
of sampled node pairs can be designed in an adaptive manner. The paper provides new results for the
stochastic block model, and extends the analysis to the case of adaptive sampling.
