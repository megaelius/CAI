Multi-human multi-robot (MH-MR) systems have the ability to combine the potential advantages
of robotic systems with those of having humans in the loop. Robotic systems contribute precision
performance and long operation on repetitive tasks without tiring, while humans in the loop improve
situational awareness and enhance decision-making abilities. A system's ability to adapt allocated
workload to changing conditions and the performance of each individual (human and robot) during
the mission is vital to maintaining overall system performance. Previous works from literature
including market-based and optimization approaches have attempted to address the task/workload
allocation problem with focus on maximizing the system output without regarding individual agent
conditions, lacking in real-time processing and have mostly focused exclusively on multi-robot
systems. Given the variety of possible combination of teams (autonomous robots and human-operated
robots: any number of human operators operating any number of robots at a time) and the operational
scale of MH-MR systems, development of a generalized framework of workload allocation has been
a particularly challenging task. In this paper, we present such a framework for independent homogeneous
missions, capable of adaptively allocating the system workload in relation to health conditions
and work performances of human-operated and autonomous robots in real-time. The framework consists
of removable modular function blocks ensuring its applicability to different MH-MR scenarios.
A new workload transition function block ensures smooth transition without the workload change
having adverse effects on individual agents. The effectiveness and scalability of the system's
workload adaptability is validated by experiments applying the proposed framework in a MH-MR patrolling
scenario with changing human and robot condition, and failing robots.
