Traffic forecasting approaches are critical to developing adaptive strategies for mobility.
Traffic patterns have complex spatial and temporal dependencies that make accurate forecasting
on large highway networks a challenging task. Recently, diffusion convolutional recurrent neural
networks (DCRNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in traffic forecasting by capturing
the spatiotemporal dynamics of the traffic. Despite the promising results, however, applying
DCRNNs for large highway networks still remains elusive because of computational and memory bottlenecks.
We present an approach for implementing a DCRNN for a large highway network that overcomes these
limitations. Our approach uses a graph-partitioning method to decompose a large highway network
into smaller networks and trains them independently. We demonstrate the efficacy of the graph-partitioning-based
DCRNN approach to model the traffic on a large California highway network with 11,160 sensor locations.
We develop an overlapping nodes approach for the graph-partitioning-based DCRNN to include sensor
locations from partitions that are geographically close to a given partition. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the DCRNN model can be used to forecast the speed and flow simultaneously and that
the forecasted values preserve fundamental traffic flow dynamics. Our approach to developing
DCRNN models that represent large highway networks can be a potential core capability in advanced
highway traffic monitoring systems, where a trained DCRNN model forecasting traffic at all sensor
locations can be used to adjust traffic management strategies proactively based on anticipated
future conditions.
