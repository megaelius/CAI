Ultrasound localization microscopy has enabled super-resolution vascular imaging in laboratory
environments through precise localization of individual ultrasound contrast agents across numerous
imaging frames. However, analysis of high-density regions with significant overlaps among the
agents' point spread responses yields high localization errors, constraining the technique to
low-concentration conditions. As such, long acquisition times are required to sufficiently cover
the vascular bed. In this work, we present a fast and precise method for obtaining super-resolution
vascular images from high-density contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging data. This method, which
we term Deep Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (Deep-ULM), exploits modern deep learning strategies
and employs a convolutional neural network to perform localization microscopy in dense scenarios.
This end-to-end fully convolutional neural network architecture is trained effectively using
on-line synthesized data, enabling robust inference in-vivo under a wide variety of imaging conditions.
We show that deep learning attains super-resolution with challenging contrast-agent concentrations
(microbubble densities), both in-silico as well as in-vivo, as we go from ultrasound scans of a rodent
spinal cord in an experimental setting to standard clinically-acquired recordings in a human prostate.
Deep-ULM achieves high quality sub-diffraction recovery, and is suitable for real-time applications,
resolving about 135 high-resolution 64x64-patches per second on a standard PC. Exploiting GPU
computation, this number increases to 2500 patches per second.
