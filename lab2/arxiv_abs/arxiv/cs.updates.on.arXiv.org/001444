Research on interference has provided evidence that the formation of dependencies between non-adjacent
words relies on a cue-based retrieval mechanism. Two different models can account for one of the
main predictions of interference, i.e., a slowdown at a retrieval site, when several items share
a feature associated with a retrieval cue: Lewis and Vasishth's (2005) activation-based model
and McElree's (2000) direct access model. Even though these two models have been used almost interchangeably,
they are based on different assumptions and predict differences in the relationship between reading
times and response accuracy. The activation-based model follows the assumptions of ACT-R, and
its retrieval process behaves as a lognormal race between accumulators of evidence with a single
variance. Under this model, accuracy of the retrieval is determined by the winner of the race and
retrieval time by its rate of accumulation. In contrast, the direct access model assumes a model
of memory where only the probability of retrieval varies between items; in this model, differences
in latencies are a by-product of the possibility and repairing incorrect retrievals. We implemented
both models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework in order to evaluate them and compare them. We show
that some aspects of the data are better fit under the direct access model than under the activation-based
model. We suggest that this finding does not rule out the possibility that retrieval may be behaving
as a race model with assumptions that follow less closely the ones from the ACT-R framework. We show
that by introducing a modification of the activation model, i.e, by assuming that the accumulation
of evidence for retrieval of incorrect items is not only slower but noisier (i.e., different variances
for the correct and incorrect items), the model can provide a fit as good as the one of the direct access
model.
