Influenza-like illness (ILI) places a heavy social and economic burden on our society. Traditionally,
ILI surveillance data is updated weekly and provided at a spatially coarse resolution. Producing
timely and reliable high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts for ILI is crucial for local preparedness
and optimal interventions. We present TDEFSI (Theory Guided Deep Learning Based Epidemic Forecasting
with Synthetic Information), an epidemic forecasting framework that integrates the strengths
of deep neural networks and high-resolution simulations of epidemic processes over networks.
TDEFSI yields accurate high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts using low-resolution time
series data. During the training phase, TDEFSI uses high-resolution simulations of epidemics
that explicitly model spatial and social heterogeneity inherent in urban regions as one component
of training data. We train a two-branch recurrent neural network model to take both within-season
and between-season low-resolution observations as features, and output high-resolution detailed
forecasts. The resulting forecasts are not just driven by observed data but also capture the intricate
social, demographic and geographic attributes of specific urban regions and mathematical theories
of disease propagation over networks. We focus on forecasting the incidence of ILI and evaluate
TDEFSI's performance using synthetic and real-world testing datasets at the state and county levels
in the USA. The results show that, at the state level, our method achieves comparable/better performance
than several state-of-the-art methods. At the county level, TDEFSI outperforms the other methods.
The proposed method can be applied to other infectious diseases as well.
