Existing methods that aim to automatically cluster data into physically meaningful subsets typically
require assumptions regarding the number, size, or shape of the coherent subgroups. We present
a new method, simultaneous Coherent Structure Coloring (sCSC), which accomplishes the task of
unsupervised clustering without a priori guidance regarding the underlying structure of the data.
To illustrate the versatility of the method, we apply it to frontier physics problems at vastly different
temporal and spatial scales: in a theoretical model of geophysical fluid dynamics, in laboratory
measurements of vortex ring formation and entrainment, and in atomistic simulation of the Protein
G system. The theoretical flow involves sparse sampling of non-equilibrium dynamics, where this
new technique can find and characterize the structures that govern fluid transport using two orders
of magnitude less data than required by existing methods. Application of the method to empirical
measurements of vortex formation leads to the discovery of a well defined region in which vortex
ring entrainment occurs, with potential implications ranging from flow control to cardiovascular
diagnostics. Finally, the protein folding example demonstrates a data-rich application governed
by equilibrium dynamics, where the technique in this manuscript automatically discovers the hierarchy
of distinct processes that govern protein folding and clusters protein configurations accordingly.
We anticipate straightforward translation to many other fields where existing analysis tools,
such as k-means and traditional hierarchical clustering, require ad hoc assumptions on the data
structure or lack the interpretability of the present method. The method is also potentially generalizable
to fields where the underlying processes are less accessible, such as genomics and neuroscience.
