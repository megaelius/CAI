In the past few decades, constitution-making processes have shifted from closed elite writing
to incorporating democratic mechanisms. Yet, little is known about democratic participation
in deliberative constitution-making processes. Here, we study a deliberative constituent process
held by the Chilean government between 2015 and 2016. The Chilean process had the highest level of
citizen participation in the world ($204,402$ people, i.e., $1.3\%$ of the population) for such
a process and covered $98\%$ of the national territory. In its participatory phase, people gathered
in self-convoked groups of 10 to 30 members, and they collectively selected, deliberated, and wrote
down an argument on why the new constitution should include those social rights. To understand the
citizen participation drivers in this volunteer process, we first identify the determinants at
the municipality level. We find the educational level, engagement in politics, support for the
(left-wing) government, and Internet access increased participation. In contrast, population
density and the share of evangelical Christians decreased participation. Moreover, we do not find
evidence of political manipulation on citizen participation. In light of those determinants,
we analyze the collective selection of social rights, and the content produced during the deliberative
phase. The findings suggest that the knowledge embedded in cities, proxied using education levels
and main economic activity, facilitates deliberation about themes, concepts, and ideas. These
results can inform the organization of new deliberative processes that involve voluntary citizen
participation, from citizen consultations to constitution-making processes.
