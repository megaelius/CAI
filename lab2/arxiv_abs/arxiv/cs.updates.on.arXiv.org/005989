Contact-based decision and planning methods are becoming increasingly important to endow higher
levels of autonomy for legged robots. Formal synthesis methods derived from symbolic systems have
great potential for reasoning about high-level locomotion decisions and achieving complex maneuvering
behaviors with correctness guarantees. This study takes a first step toward formally devising
an architecture composed of task planning and control of whole-body dynamic locomotion behaviors
in constrained and dynamically changing environments. At the high level, we formulate a two-player
temporal logic game between the multi-limb locomotion planner and its dynamic environment to synthesize
a winning strategy that delivers symbolic locomotion actions. These locomotion actions satisfy
the desired high-level task specifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic. Those actions
are sent to a robust finite transition system that synthesizes a locomotion controller that fulfills
state reachability constraints. This controller is further executed via a low-level motion planner
that generates feasible locomotion trajectories. We construct a set of dynamic locomotion models
for legged robots to serve as a template library for handling diverse environmental events. We devise
a replanning strategy that takes into consideration sudden environmental changes or large state
disturbances to increase the robustness of the resulting locomotion behaviors. We formally prove
the correctness of the layered locomotion framework guaranteeing a robust implementation by the
motion planning layer. Simulations of reactive locomotion behaviors in diverse environments
indicate that our framework has the potential to serve as a theoretical foundation for intelligent
locomotion behaviors.
