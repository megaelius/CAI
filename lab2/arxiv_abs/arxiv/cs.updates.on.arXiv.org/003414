This paper presents a comprehensive study of post-mortem human iris recognition carried out for
1,200 near-infrared and 1,787 visible-light samples collected from 37 deceased individuals kept
in the mortuary conditions. We used four independent iris recognition methods (three commercial
and one academic) to analyze genuine and impostor comparison scores and check the dynamics of iris
quality decay over a period of up to 814 hours after death. This study shows that post-mortem iris
recognition may be close-to-perfect approximately 5 to 7 hours after death and occasionally is
still viable even 21 days after death. These conclusions contradict the statements present in past
literature that the iris is unusable as a biometrics shortly after death, and show that the dynamics
of post-mortem changes to the iris that are important for biometric identification are more moderate
than previously hypothesized. The paper contains a thorough medical commentary that helps to understand
which post-mortem metamorphoses of the eye may impact the performance of automatic iris recognition.
We also show that post-mortem iris recognition works equally well for images taken in near-infrared
and when the red channel of visible-light sample is used. However, cross-wavelength matching presents
significantly worse performance. This paper conforms to reproducible research and the database
used in this study is made publicly available to facilitate research of post-mortem iris recognition.
To our knowledge, this paper offers the most comprehensive evaluation of post-mortem iris recognition
and the largest database of post-mortem iris images.
