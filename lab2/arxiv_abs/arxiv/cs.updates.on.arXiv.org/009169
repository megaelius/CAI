Driven by the emergence of new compute-intensive applications and the vision of IoT, the 5G network
will face an unprecedented increase in traffic volume and computation demands. However, end users
mostly have limited storage capacities and finite processing capabilities, thus how to run compute-intensive
applications on resource-constrained users has become a natural concern. Mobile edge computing
(MEC) can optimize mobile resources by hosting compute-intensive applications, process large
data before sending to the cloud, provide the cloud-computing capabilities within the radio access
network in close proximity to mobile users, and offer context-aware services. Hence, MEC enables
a wide variety of applications, where the real-time response is strictly required, e.g., driverless
vehicles, augmented reality, and immerse media. 5G is broadly characterized by three service types:
extremely high data rate, massive connectivity, and low latency and ultra-high reliability. Indeed,
the paradigm shift from 4G to 5G could become a reality with the advent of new technologies. The successful
realization of MEC in 5G is still in its infancy and demands for constant efforts from both academic
and industry communities. In this survey, we first provide a holistic overview of MEC, and potential
use cases and applications. The main part of this paper surveys up-to-date researches on the integration
of MEC with 5G and beyond technologies including non-orthogonal multiple access, wireless power
transfer and energy harvesting, unmanned aerial vehicle, IoT, network densification, and machine
learning. Moreover, we summarize the existing literature that integrates MEC with other 5G technologies
and that focus on developing testbeds and experimental evaluations. We further summarize lessons
learned from state-of-the-art researches as well as discuss challenges and potential future directions
for MEC research.
