Elder people consequence a variety of problems while living Activities of Daily Living (ADL) for
the reason of age, sense, loneliness and cognitive changes. These cause the risk to ADL which leads
to several falls. Getting real life fall data is a difficult process and are not available whereas
simulated falls become ubiquitous to evaluate the proposed methodologies. From the literature
review, it is investigated that most of the researchers used raw and energy features (time domain
features) of the signal data as those are most discriminating. However, in real life situations
fall signal may be noisy than the current simulated data. Hence the result using raw feature may dramatically
changes when using in a real life scenario. This research is using frequency domain Fourier coefficient
features to differentiate various human activities of daily life. The feature vector constructed
using those Fast Fourier Transform are robust to noise and rotation invariant. Two different supervised
classifiers kNN and SVM are used for evaluating the method. Two standard publicly available datasets
are used for benchmark analysis. In this research, more discriminating results are obtained applying
kNN classifier than the SVM classifier. Various standard measure including Standard Accuracy
(SA), Macro Average Accuracy (MAA), Sensitivity (SE) and Specificity (SP) has been accounted.
In all cases, the proposed method outperforms energy features whereas competitive results are
shown with raw features. It is also noticed that the proposed method performs better than the recently
risen deep learning approach in which data augmentation method were not used.
