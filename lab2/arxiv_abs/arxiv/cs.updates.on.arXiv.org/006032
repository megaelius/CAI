We introduce a set-valued generalization of Nash equilibrium, called M equilibrium, which is based
on ordinal monotonicity - players' choice probabilities are ranked the same as the expected payoffs
based on their beliefs - and ordinal consistency - players' beliefs yield the same ranking of expected
payoffs as their choices. Using results from semi-algebraic geometry, we prove there exist a finite
number of M equilibria, each consisting of a finite number of connected components. Generically,
M-equilibria can be "color coded" by their ranks in the sense that choices and beliefs belonging
to the same M equilibrium have the same color. We show that colorable M equilibria are behaviorally
stable, a concept that strengthens strategic stability. Furthermore, set-valued and parameter-free
M equilibrium envelopes various parametric models based on fixed-points, including QRE as well
as a new and computationally simpler class of models called {\mu} Equilibrium. We report the results
of several experiments designed to contrast M equilibrium predictions with those of existing behavioral
game-theory models. A first experiment considers five variations of an asymmetric-matching pennies
game that leave the predictions of Nash, various versions of QRE, and level-k unaltered. However,
observed choice frequencies differ substantially and significantly across games as do players'
beliefs. Moreover, beliefs and choices are heterogeneous and beliefs do not match choices in any
of the games. These findings contradict existing behavioral game-theory models but accord well
with the unique M equilibrium. Follow up experiments employ 3 by 3 games with a unique pure-strategy
Nash equilibrium and multiple M equilibria. The belief and choice data exhibit coordination problems
that could not be anticipated through the lens of existing behavioral game-theory models.
