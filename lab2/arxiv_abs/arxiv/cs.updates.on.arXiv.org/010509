In this paper, the problem of optimizing the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped
with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities is studied. In the studied model, the UAVs
can simultaneously provide communications and illumination to service ground users. Ambient
illumination increases the interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold
of the UAVs. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the illumination distribution of the target
area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose
goal is to minimize the total transmit power while meeting the illumination and communication requirements
of users. To solve this problem, an algorithm based on the machine learning framework of gated recurrent
units (GRUs) is proposed. Using GRUs, the UAVs can model the long-term historical illumination
distribution and predict the future illumination distribution. In order to reduce the complexity
of the prediction algorithm while accurately predicting the illumination distribution, a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) is used to fit the illumination distribution of the target area at each time slot.
Based on the predicted illumination distribution, the optimization problem is proved to be a convex
optimization problem that can be solved by using duality. Simulations using real data from the Earth
observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the proposed approach can achieve up to 22.1% reduction
in transmit power compared to a conventional optimal UAV deployment that does not consider the illumination
distribution. The results also show that UAVs must hover at areas having strong illumination, thus
providing useful guidelines on the deployment of VLC-enabled UAVs.
