Smart homes, enterprises, and cities are increasingly being equipped with a plethora of Internet
of Things (IoT), ranging from smart-lights to security cameras. While IoT networks have the potential
to benefit our lives, they create privacy and security challenges not seen with traditional IT networks.
Due to the lack of visibility, operators of such smart environments are not often aware of their IoT
assets, let alone whether each IoT device is functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This
thesis is the culmination of our efforts to develop techniques to profile the network behavioral
pattern of IoTs, automate IoT classification, deduce their operating context, and detect anomalous
behavior indicative of cyber-attacks. We begin this thesis by surveying IoT ecosystem, while reviewing
current approaches to vulnerability assessments, intrusion detection, and behavioral monitoring.
For our first contribution, we collect traffic traces and characterize the network behavior of
IoT devices via attributes from traffic patterns. We develop a robust machine learning-based inference
engine trained with these attributes and demonstrate real-time classification of 28 IoT devices
with over 99% accuracy. Our second contribution enhances the classification by reducing the cost
of attribute extraction while also identifying IoT device states. Prototype implementation and
evaluation demonstrate the ability of our supervised machine learning method to detect behavioral
changes for five IoT devices. Our third and final contribution develops a modularized unsupervised
inference engine that dynamically accommodates the addition of new IoT devices and/or updates
to existing ones, without requiring system-wide retraining of the model. We demonstrate via experiments
that our model can automatically detect attacks and firmware changes in ten IoT devices with over
94% accuracy.
