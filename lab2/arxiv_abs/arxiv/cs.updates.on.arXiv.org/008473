Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is based on theory and development of computer systems
able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. In this context, deep learning
is a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a
large set of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior. Application of these methods to medical
imaging can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype, gene mutations and/or metastases
for applying appropriate therapies. The purpose of this study is to show the emerging application
of AI in medical imaging to detect lung and breast cancer. Moreover, this study shows the comparative
evolutionary pathways of this emerging technology for three critical cancers: lung, breast and
thyroid. A main finding of this study is the recognition that, since the late 1990, the sharp increase
of technological trajectories of AI technology applied in cancer imaging seems to be driven by high
rates of mortality of some types of cancer (e.g., lung and breast) in order to find new techniques
for a more accurate detection, characterization and monitoring as well as to apply efficiently
anticancer therapies that increase the progression-free survival of patients: the so-called
mortality-driven AI technological trajectories. Results also suggest that this new technology
can generate a technological paradigm shift for diagnostic assessment of any cancer type. However,
application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation to
assist pathologists to increase the efficiency of their workflow in both routine tasks and critical
cases of diagnostics.
