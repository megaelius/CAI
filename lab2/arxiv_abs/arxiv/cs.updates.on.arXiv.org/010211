In this work, we examine cognitive radio networks, where secondary users may act as relays for messages
sent by the primary user, hence offering performance improvement of primary transmissions, while
at the same time obtaining more transmission opportunities for their own data. In particular, assuming
the broadcast packet erasure model with feedback, we investigate the capacity of the fundamental
cooperative cognitive radio network which consists of one primary and one secondary transmitter-receiver
pairs. The primary transmitter is the owner of the channel and as such, we intend to keep its operations
simple and to avoid increasing its storage requirements. Specifically, the primary transmitter
does not receive data sent by the secondary transmitter and does not perform any coding operations.
On the other hand, the secondary transmitter can overhear primary transmissions and is allowed
to perform any coding operations. We develop an outer bound to the capacity of the fundamental cooperative
cognitive radio network under consideration. Then, we propose a coding-scheduling algorithm
suitable for this type of networks, which involves only XOR network coding operations. The complexity
of the scheduling decisions of the proposed algorithm depends on the channel statistical parameters
and three cases, depending on the relations between channel erasure probabilities, are distinguished.
For the first two cases the rate region of the proposed algorithm coincides with the developed capacity
outer bound, hence the algorithm is capacity achieving. For the third case, the rate region of the
proposed algorithm is not identical to the outer bound; however, numerical results show that it
is fairly close to the derived outer bound for a wide range of the statistical parameters of the system.
