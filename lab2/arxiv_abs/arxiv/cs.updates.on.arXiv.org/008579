Given enough multi-view image corresponding points (also called tie points) and ground control
points (GCP), bundle adjustment for high-resolution satellite images is used to refine the orientations
or most often used geometric parameters Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPC) of each satellite
image in a unified geodetic framework, which is very critical in many photogrammetry and computer
vision applications. However, the growing number of high resolution spaceborne optical sensors
has brought two challenges to the bundle adjustment: 1) images come from different satellite cameras
may have different imaging dates, viewing angles, resolutions, etc., thus resulting in geometric
and radiometric distortions in the bundle adjustment; 2) The large-scale mapping area always corresponds
to vast number of bundle adjustment corrections (including RPC bias and object space point coordinates).
Due to the limitation of computer memory, it is hard to refine all corrections at the same time. Hence,
how to efficiently realize the bundle adjustment in large-scale regions is very important. This
paper particularly addresses the multi-view large-scale bundle adjustment problem by two steps:
1) to get robust tie points among different satellite images, we design a multi-view, multi-source
tie point matching algorithm based on plane rectification and epipolar constraints, which is able
to compensate geometric and local nonlinear radiometric distortions among satellite datasets,
and 2) to solve dozens of thousands or even millions of variables bundle adjustment corrections
in the large scale bundle adjustment, we use an efficient solution with only a little computer memory.
Experiments on in-track and off-track satellite datasets show that the proposed method is capable
of computing sub-pixel accuracy bundle adjustment results.
