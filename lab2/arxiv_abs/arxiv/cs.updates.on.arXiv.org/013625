In this manuscript we present a novel bulk-surface virtual element method (BSVEM) for the numerical
approximation of coupled systems of elliptic and parabolic bulk-surface partial differential
equations (BSPDEs) in two dimensions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed method
is the first application of the virtual element method [Beirao da Veiga et al., M3AS (2013)] to BSPDEs.
The BSVEM is based on the discretisation of the bulk domain into polygonal elements with arbitrarily
many edges, rather than just triangles. The polygonal approximation of the bulk induces a piecewise
linear approximation of the one-dimensional surface (a curve). The bulk-surface finite element
method on triangular meshes [Elliott, Ranner, IMAJNA (2013)] is a special case of the proposed method.
The present work contains several contributions. First, we show that the proposed method has optimal
second-order convergence in space, provided the exact solution is $H^{2+1/4}$ in the bulk and $H^2$
on the surface, where the additional $\frac{1}{4}$ is required by the combined effect of surface
curvature and polygonal elements. Our analysis shows, as a by-product, that first-degree virtual
elements for bulk-only PDEs retain optimal convergence in the presence of surface curvature. In
carrying out the analysis we provide novel theoretical tools for the analysis of curved boundaries
and non-constant boundary conditions, such as the Sobolev extension and a special inverse trace
operator. We show that general polygons can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity
of the matrix assembly. Moreover, we present an optimised matrix implementation that can also be
exploited in the pre-existing special case of bulk-surface finite elements on triangular meshes
[Elliott, Ranner, IMAJNA (2013)]. Numerical examples illustrate our findings and experimentally
show the optimal convergence rates in space and time.
