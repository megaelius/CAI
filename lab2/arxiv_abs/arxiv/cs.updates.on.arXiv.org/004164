Active Learning (AL) requires learners to retrain the classifier with the minimum human supervisions
or labeling in the unlabeled data pool when the current training set is not enough. However, general
AL sampling strategies with a few label support inevitably suffer from performance decrease. To
identify which samples determine the performance of the classification hyperplane, Core Vector
Machine (CVM) and Ball Vector Machine (BVM) use the geometry boundary points of each Minimum Enclosing
Ball (MEB) to train the classification hypothesis. Their theoretical analysis and experimental
results show that the improved classifiers not only converge faster but also obtain higher accuracies
compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM). Inspired by this, we formulate the cluster boundary
point detection issue as the MEB boundary problem after presenting a convincing proof of this observation.
Because the enclosing ball boundary may have a high fitting ratio when it can not enclose the class
tightly, we split the global ball problem into two kinds of small Local Minimum Enclosing Ball (LMEB):
Boundary ball (B-ball) and Core ball (C-ball) to tackle its over-fitting problem. Through calculating
the update of radius and center when extending the local ball space, we adopt the minimum update ball
to obtain the geometric update optimization scheme of B-ball and C-ball. After proving their update
relationship, we design the LEB (Local Enclosing Ball) algorithm using centers of B-ball of each
class to detect the enclosing ball boundary points for AL sampling. Experimental and theoretical
studies have shown that the classification accuracy, time, and space performance of our proposed
method significantly are superior than the state-of-the-art algorithms.
