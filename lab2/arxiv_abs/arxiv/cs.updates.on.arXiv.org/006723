Here we present DIVE: Data-driven Inference of Vertexwise Evolution. DIVE is an image-based disease
progression model with single-vertex resolution, designed to reconstruct long-term patterns
of brain pathology from short-term longitudinal data sets. DIVE clusters vertex-wise biomarker
measurements on the cortical surface that have similar temporal dynamics across a patient population,
and concurrently estimates an average trajectory of vertex measurements in each cluster. DIVE
uniquely outputs a parcellation of the cortex into areas with common progression patterns, leading
to a new signature for individual diseases. DIVE further estimates the disease stage and progression
speed for every visit of every subject, potentially enhancing stratification for clinical trials
or management. On simulated data, DIVE can recover ground truth clusters and their underlying trajectory,
provided the average trajectories are sufficiently different between clusters. We demonstrate
DIVE on data from two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Dementia
Research Centre (DRC), UK, containing patients with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) as well as
typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD). DIVE finds similar spatial patterns of atrophy for tAD subjects
in the two independent datasets (ADNI and DRC), and further reveals distinct patterns of pathology
in different diseases (tAD vs PCA) and for distinct types of biomarker data: cortical thickness
from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs amyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET).
Finally, DIVE can be used to estimate a fine-grained spatial distribution of pathology in the brain
using any kind of voxelwise or vertexwise measures including Jacobian compression maps, fractional
anisotropy (FA) maps from diffusion imaging or other PET measures. DIVE source code is available
