Full nodes, which synchronize the entire blockchain history and independently validate all the
blocks, form the backbone of any blockchain network by playing a vital role in ensuring security
properties. On the other hand, a user running a full node needs to pay a heavy price in terms of storage
costs. E.g., the Bitcoin blockchain size has grown over 215GB, in spite of its low throughput. The
ledger size for a high throughput blockchain Ripple has already reached 9TB, and it is growing at
an astonishing rate of 12GB per day! In this paper, we propose an architecture based on 'fountain
codes', a class of erasure codes, that enables any full node to 'encode' validated blocks into a small
number of 'coded blocks', thereby reducing its storage costs by orders of magnitude. In particular,
our proposed "Secure Fountain (SeF)" architecture can achieve a near-optimal trade-off between
the storage savings per node and the 'bootstrap cost' in terms of the number of (honest) storage-constrained
nodes a new node needs to contact to recover the blockchain. A key technical innovation in SeF codes
is to make fountain codes secure against adversarial nodes that can provide maliciously formed
coded blocks. Our idea is to use the header-chain as a 'side-information' to check whether a coded
block is maliciously formed while it is getting decoded. Further, the 'rateless property' of fountain
codes helps in achieving high decentralization and scalability. Our experiments demonstrate
that SeF codes tuned to achieve 1000x storage savings enable full nodes to encode the 191GB Bitcoin
blockchain into 195MB on average. A new node can recover the blockchain from an arbitrary set of storage-constrained
nodes as long as the set contains ~1100 honest nodes on average. Note that for a 1000x storage savings,
the fundamental bound on the number of honest nodes to contact is 1000: we need about 10% more in practice.
