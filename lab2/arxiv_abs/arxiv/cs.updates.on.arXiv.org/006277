Existing work in human activity detection classifies physical activities using a single fixed-length
subset of a sensor signal. However, temporally consecutive subsets of a sensor signal are not utilized.
This is not optimal for classifying physical activities (composite activities) that are composed
of a temporal series of simpler activities (atomic activities). A sport consists of physical activities
combined in a fashion unique to that sport. The constituent physical activities and the sport are
not fundamentally different. We propose a computational graph architecture for human activity
detection based on the readings of a triaxial accelerometer. The resulting model learns 1) a representation
of the atomic activities of a sport and 2) to classify physical activities as compositions of the
atomic activities. The proposed model, alongside with a set of baseline models, was tested for a
simultaneous classification of eight physical activities (walking, nordic walking, running,
soccer, rowing, bicycling, exercise bicycling and lying down). The proposed model obtained an
overall mean accuracy of 77.91% (population) and 95.28% (personalized). The corresponding accuracies
of the best baseline model were 73.52% and 90.03%. However, without combining consecutive atomic
activities, the corresponding accuracies of the proposed model were 71.52% and 91.22%. The results
show that our proposed model is accurate, outperforms the baseline models and learns to combine
simple activities into complex activities. Composite activities can be classified as combinations
of atomic activities. Our proposed architecture is a basis for accurate models in human activity
detection.
