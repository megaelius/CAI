A common assumption in semi-supervised learning with graph models is that the class label function
varies smoothly on the data graph, resulting in the rather strict prior that the label function has
low-frequency content. Meanwhile, in many classification problems, the label function may vary
abruptly in certain graph regions, resulting in high-frequency components. Although the semi-supervised
estimation of class labels is an ill-posed problem in general, in several applications it is possible
to find a source graph on which the label function has similar frequency content to that on the target
graph where the actual classification problem is defined. In this paper, we propose a method for
domain adaptation on graphs motivated by these observations. Our algorithm is based on learning
the spectrum of the label function in a source graph with many labeled nodes, and transferring the
information of the spectrum to the target graph with fewer labeled nodes. While the frequency content
of the class label function can be identified through the graph Fourier transform, it is not easy
to transfer the Fourier coefficients directly between the two graphs, since no one-to-one match
exists between the Fourier basis vectors of independently constructed graphs in the domain adaptation
setting. We solve this problem by learning a transformation between the Fourier bases of the two
graphs that flexibly ``aligns'' them. The unknown class label function on the target graph is then
reconstructed such that its spectrum matches that on the source graph while also ensuring the consistency
with the available labels. The proposed method is tested in the classification of image, online
product review, and social network data sets. Comparative experiments suggest that the proposed
algorithm performs better than recent domain adaptation methods in the literature in most settings.
