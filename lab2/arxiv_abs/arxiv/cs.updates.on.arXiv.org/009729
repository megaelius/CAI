We present an efficient algorithm for a problem in the interface between clustering and graph embeddings.
An embedding $\varphi:G\rightarrow M$ of a graph $G$ into a 2-manifold $M$ maps the vertices in $V(G)$
to distinct points and the edges in $E(G)$ to interior-disjoint Jordan arcs between the corresponding
vertices. In applications in clustering, cartography, and visualization, nearby vertices and
edges are often bundled to the same point or overlapping arcs, due to data compression or low resolution.
This raises the computational problem of deciding whether a given map $\varphi:G\rightarrow M$
comes from an embedding. A map $\varphi:G\rightarrow M$ is a \textbf{weak embedding} if it can be
perturbed into an embedding $\psi_\varepsilon:G\rightarrow M$ with $\|\varphi-\psi_\varepsilon\|<\varepsilon$
for every $\varepsilon>0$, where $\|.\|$ is the unform norm. A polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing
weak embeddings has recently been found by Fulek and Kyn\v{c}l. It reduces the problem to solving
a system of linear equations over $\mathbb{Z}_2$. It runs in $O(n^{2\omega})\leq O(n^{4.75})$
time, where $\omega\in [2,2.373)$ is the matrix multiplication exponent and $n$ is the number of
vertices and edges of $G$. We improve the running time to $O(n\log n)$. Our algorithm is also conceptually
simpler: We perform a sequence of \emph{local operations} that gradually "untangles" the image
$\varphi(G)$ into an embedding $\psi(G)$, or reports that $\varphi$ is not a weak embedding. It
combines local constraints on the orientation of subgraphs directly, thereby eliminating the
need for solving large systems of linear equations.
