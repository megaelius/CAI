Obtaining accurate information about future traffic flows of all links in a traffic network is of
great importance for traffic management and control applications. This research studies two particular
problems in traffic forecasting: (1) capture the dynamic and non-local spatial correlation between
traffic links and (2) model the dynamics of temporal dependency for accurate multiple steps ahead
predictions. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning framework named Spatial-Temporal
Sequence to Sequence model (STSeq2Seq). This model builds on sequence to sequence (seq2seq) architecture
to capture temporal feature and relies on graph convolution for aggregating spatial information.
Moreover, STSeq2Seq defines and constructs pattern-aware adjacency matrices (PAMs) based on
pair-wise similarity of the recent traffic patterns on traffic links and integrate it into graph
convolution operation. It also deploys a novel seq2sesq architecture which couples a convolutional
encoder and a recurrent decoder with attention mechanism for dynamic modeling of long-range dependence
between different time steps. We conduct extensive experiments using two publicly-available
large-scale traffic datasets and compare STSeq2Seq with other baseline models. The numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance
in terms of various error measures. The ablation study verifies the effectiveness of PAMs in capturing
dynamic non-local spatial correlation and the superiority of proposed seq2seq architecture in
modeling non-stationary temporal dependency for multiple steps ahead prediction. Furthermore,
qualitative analysis is conducted on PAMs as well as the attention weights for model interpretation.
