The objective of this article is to propose and statistically validate a more general additive non-Gaussian
noise distribution, which we term McLeish distribution, whose random nature can model different
impulsive noise environments commonly encountered in practice and provides a robust alternative
to Gaussian noise distribution. In particular, for the first time in the literature, we establish
the laws of McLeish distribution and therefrom derive the laws of the sum of McLeish distributions
by obtaining closed-form expressions for their PDF, CDF, complementary CDF (C$^2$DF), MGF and
higher-order moments. Further, for certain problems related to the envelope of complex random
signals, we extend McLeish distribution to complex McLeish distribution and thereby propose circularly/elliptically
symmetric (CS/ES) complex McLeish distributions with closed-form PDF, CDF, MGF and higher-order
moments. For generalization of one-dimensional distribution to multi-dimensional distribution,
we develop and propose both multivariate McLeish distribution and multivariate complex CS/ES
(CCS/CES) McLeish distribution with analytically tractable and closed-form PDF, CDF, C$^2$DF
and MGF. In addition to the proposed McLeish distribution framework and for its practical illustration,
we theoretically investigate and prove the existence of McLeish distribution as additive noise
in communication systems. Accordingly, we introduce additive white McLeish noise (AWMN) channels.
For coherent/non-coherent signaling over AWMN channels, we propose novel expressions for MAP
and ML symbol decisions and thereby obtain closed-form expressions for both BER of binary modulation
schemes and SER of various M-ary modulation schemes. Further, we verify the validity and accuracy
of our novel BER/SER expressions with some selected numerical examples and some computer-based
simulations.
