We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based
models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
(Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer
to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting
the concept. Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected
layers, (2) CNNs used for structured outputs, (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs or reinforcement
learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with fine-grained
visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it
to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models,
including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations
(a) lend insights into their failure modes, (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform
previous methods on localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve
generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, we show that even non-attention
based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM
and combine it with neuron names to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally,
we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM helps users establish appropriate trust
in predictions from models and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a
'stronger' nodel from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions. Our code is available
