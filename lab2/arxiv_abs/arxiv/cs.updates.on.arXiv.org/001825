We consider the relationship between economic activity and intervention, including monetary
and fiscal policy, using a universal dynamic framework. Central bank policies are designed for
growth without excess inflation. However, unemployment, investment, consumption, and inflation
are interlinked. Understanding dynamics is crucial to assessing the effects of policy, especially
in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Here we lay out a program of research into monetary and economic
dynamics and preliminary steps toward its execution. We use principles of response theory to derive
implications for policy. We find that the current approach, which considers the overall money supply,
is insufficient to regulate economic growth. While it can achieve some degree of control, optimizing
growth also requires a fiscal policy balancing monetary injection between two dominant loop flows,
the consumption and wages loop, and investment and returns loop. The balance arises from a composite
of government tax, entitlement, subsidy policies, corporate policies, as well as monetary policy.
We show empirically that a transition occurred in 1980 between two regimes--an oversupply to the
consumption and wages loop, to an oversupply of the investment and returns loop. The imbalance is
manifest in savings and borrowing by consumers and investors, and in inflation. The latter increased
until 1980, and decreased subsequently, resulting in a zero rate largely unrelated to the financial
crisis. Three recessions and the financial crisis are part of this dynamic. Optimizing growth now
requires shifting the balance. Our analysis supports advocates of greater income and / or government
support for the poor who use a larger fraction of income for consumption. This promotes investment
due to growth in demand. Otherwise, investment opportunities are limited, capital remains uninvested,
and does not contribute to growth.
