Multi-objective recommender systems address the difficult task of recommending items that are
relevant to multiple, possibly conflicting, criteria. However these systems are most often designed
to address the objective of one single stakeholder, typically, in online commerce, the consumers
whose input and purchasing decisions ultimately determine the success of the recommendation systems.
In this work, we address the multi-objective, multi-stakeholder, recommendation problem involving
one or more objective(s) per stakeholder. In addition to the consumer stakeholder, we also consider
two other stakeholders; the suppliers who provide the goods and services for sale %and set the prices
of those goods and the intermediary who is responsible for helping connect consumers to suppliers
via its recommendation algorithms. % and who takes a commission from the supplier and/or consumer
in exchange for this service. We analyze the multi-objective, multi-stakeholder, problem from
the point of view of the online marketplace intermediary whose objective is to maximize its commission
through its recommender system. We define a multi-objective problem relating all our three stakeholders
which we solve with a novel learning-to-re-rank approach that makes use of a novel regularization
function based on the Kendall tau correlation metric and its kernel version; given an initial ranking
of item recommendations built for the consumer, we aim to re-rank it such that the new ranking is also
optimized for the secondary objectives while staying close to the initial ranking. We evaluate
our approach on a real-world dataset of hotel recommendations provided by Expedia where we show
the effectiveness of our approach against a business-rules oriented baseline model.
