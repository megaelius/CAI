To implement a blockchain, we need a blockchain protocol for all the nodes to follow. To design a blockchain
protocol, we need a block publisher selection mechanism and a chain selection rule. In Proof-of-Stake
(PoS) based blockchain protocols, block publisher selection mechanism selects the node to publish
the next block based on the relative stake held by the node. However, PoS protocols may face vulnerability
to fully adaptive corruptions. In literature, researchers address this issue at the cost of performance.
In this paper, we propose a novel PoS-based blockchain protocol, QuickSync, to achieve security
against fully adaptive corruptions without compromising on performance. We propose a metric called
block power, a value defined for each block, derived from the output of the verifiable random function
based on the digital signature of the block publisher. With this metric, we compute chain power,
the sum of block powers of all the blocks comprising the chain, for all the valid chains. These metrics
are a function of the block publisher's stake to enable the PoS aspect of the protocol. The chain selection
rule selects the chain with the highest chain power as the one to extend. This chain selection rule
hence determines the selected block publisher of the previous block. When we use metrics to define
the chain selection rule, it may lead to vulnerabilities against Sybil attacks. QuickSync uses
a Sybil attack resistant function implemented using histogram matching. We prove that QuickSync
satisfies common prefix, chain growth, and chain quality properties and hence it is secure. We also
show that it is resilient to different types of adversarial attack strategies. Our analysis demonstrates
that QuickSync performs better than Bitcoin by an order of magnitude on both transactions per second
and time to finality, and better than Ouroboros v1 by a factor of three on time to finality.
