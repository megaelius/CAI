In this paper, we design new sublinear-time algorithms for solving the gap edit distance problem
and for embedding edit distance to Hamming distance. For the gap edit distance problem, we give a
greedy algorithm that distinguishes in time $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{k}+k^2)$ between length-$n$
input strings with edit distance at most $k$ and those with edit distance more than $4k^2$. This is
an improvement and a simplification upon the main result of [Goldenberg, Krauthgamer, Saha, FOCS
2019], where the $k$ vs $\Theta(k^2)$ gap edit distance problem is solved in $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{k}+k^3)$
time. We further generalize our result to solve the $k$ vs $\alpha k$ gap edit distance problem in
time $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{\alpha}+k^2+ \frac{k}{\alpha}\sqrt{nk})$, strictly improving
upon the previously known bound $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{\alpha}+k^3)$. Finally, we show that if
the input strings do not have long highly periodic substrings, then the gap edit distance problem
can be solved in sublinear time within any factor $\alpha>1$. We further give the first sublinear-time
algorithm for the probabilistic embedding of edit distance to Hamming distance. Our $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{p})$-time
procedure yields an embedding with distortion $k^2p$, where $k$ is the edit distance of the original
strings. Specifically, the Hamming distance of the resultant strings is between $\frac{k}{p}$
and $k^2$ with good probability. This generalizes the linear-time embedding of [Chakraborty,
Goldenberg, Koucky, STOC 2016], where the resultant Hamming distance is between $k$ and $k^2$.
Our algorithm is based on a random walk over samples, which we believe will find other applications
in sublinear-time algorithms.
