Awareness plays a major role in human cognition and adaptive behaviour, though mechanisms involved
remain unknown. Awareness is not an objectively established fact, therefore, despite extensive
research, scientists have not been able to fully interpret its contribution in multisensory integration
and precise neural firing, hence, questions remain: (1) How the biological neuron integrates the
incoming multisensory signals with respect to different situations? (2) How are the roles of incoming
multisensory signals defined (selective amplification/attenuation) that help neuron(s) to
originate a precise neural firing complying with the anticipated behavioural-constraint of the
environment? (3) How are the external environment and anticipated behaviour integrated? Recently,
scientists have exploited deep learning to integrate multimodal cues and capture context-dependent
meanings. Yet, these methods suffer from imprecise behavioural representation. In this research,
we introduce a new theory on the role of awareness and universal context that can help answering the
aforementioned crucial neuroscience questions. Specifically, we propose a class of spiking conscious
neuron in which the output depends on three functionally distinctive integrated input variables:
receptive field (RF), local contextual field (LCF), and universal contextual field (UCF). The
RF defines the incoming ambiguous sensory signal, LCF defines the modulatory signal coming from
other parts of the brain, and UCF defines the awareness. It is believed that the conscious neuron
inherently contains enough knowledge about the situation in which the problem is to be solved based
on past learning and reasoning and it defines the precise role of incoming multisensory signals
to originate a precise neural firing (exhibiting switch-like behaviour). It is shown that the conscious
neuron helps modelling a more precise human behaviour.
