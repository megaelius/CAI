The idea of having the geolocation database monitor the secondary use of TV white space (TVWS) spectrum
and assist in coordinating the secondary usage is gaining ground. Considering the home networking
use case, we leverage the geolocation database for interference-aware coordinated TVWS sharing
among secondary users (home networks) using {\em short-term auctions}, thereby realize a dynamic
secondary market. To enable this auctioning based coordinated TVWS sharing framework, we propose
an enhanced {\em market-driven TVWS spectrum access model}. For the short-term auctions, we propose
an online multi-unit, iterative truthful mechanism called VERUM that takes into consideration
spatially heterogeneous spectrum availability, an inherent characteristic in the TVWS context.
We prove that VERUM is truthful (i.e., the best strategy for every bidder is to bid based on its true
valuation) and is also efficient in that it allocates spectrum to users who value it the most. Evaluation
results from scenarios with real home distributions in urban and dense-urban environments and
using realistic TVWS spectrum availability maps show that VERUM performs close to optimal allocation
in terms of revenue for the coordinating spectrum manager. Comparison with two existing efficient
and truthful multi-unit spectrum auction schemes, VERITAS and SATYA, shows that VERUM fares better
in terms of revenue, spectrum utilisation and percentage of winning bidders in diverse conditions.
Taking all of the above together, VERUM can be seen to offer incentives to subscribed users encouraging
them to use TVWS spectrum through greater spectrum availability (as measured by percentage of winning
bidders) as well as to the coordinating spectrum manager through revenue generation.
