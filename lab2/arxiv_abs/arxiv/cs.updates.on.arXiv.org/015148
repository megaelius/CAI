Data-space inversion (DSI) and related procedures represent a family of methods applicable for
data assimilation in subsurface flow settings. These methods differ from model-based techniques
in that they provide only posterior predictions for quantities (time series) of interest, not posterior
models with calibrated parameters. DSI methods require a large number of flow simulations to first
be performed on prior geological realizations. Given observed data, posterior predictions can
then be generated directly. DSI operates in a Bayesian setting and provides posterior samples of
the data vector. In this work we develop and evaluate a new approach for data parameterization in
DSI. Parameterization reduces the number of variables to determine in the inversion, and it maintains
the physical character of the data variables. The new parameterization uses a recurrent autoencoder
(RAE) for dimension reduction, and a long-short-term memory (LSTM) network to represent flow-rate
time series. The RAE-based parameterization is combined with an ensemble smoother with multiple
data assimilation (ESMDA) for posterior generation. Results are presented for two- and three-phase
flow in a 2D channelized system and a 3D multi-Gaussian model. The RAE procedure, along with existing
DSI treatments, are assessed through comparison to reference rejection sampling (RS) results.
The new DSI methodology is shown to consistently outperform existing approaches, in terms of statistical
agreement with RS results. The method is also shown to accurately capture derived quantities, which
are computed from variables considered directly in DSI. This requires correlation and covariance
between variables to be properly captured, and accuracy in these relationships is demonstrated.
The RAE-based parameterization developed here is clearly useful in DSI, and it may also find application
in other subsurface flow problems.
