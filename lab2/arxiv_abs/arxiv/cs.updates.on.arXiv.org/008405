Garbage and waste disposal is one of the biggest challenges currently faced by mankind. Proper waste
disposal and recycling is a must in any sustainable community, and in many coastal areas there is
significant water pollution in the form of floating or submerged garbage. This is called marine
debris. Submerged marine debris threatens marine life, and for shallow coastal areas, it can also
threaten fishing vessels [I\~niguez et al. 2016, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]. Submerged
marine debris typically stays in the environment for a long time (20+ years), and consists of materials
that can be recycled, such as metals, plastics, glass, etc. Many of these items should not be disposed
in water bodies as this has a negative effect in the environment and human health. This thesis performs
a comprehensive evaluation on the use of DNNs for the problem of marine debris detection in FLS images,
as well as related problems such as image classification, matching, and detection proposals. We
do this in a dataset of 2069 FLS images that we captured with an ARIS Explorer 3000 sensor on marine
debris objects lying in the floor of a small water tank. The objects we used to produce this dataset
contain typical household marine debris and distractor marine objects (tires, hooks, valves,
etc), divided in 10 classes plus a background class. Our results show that for the evaluated tasks,
DNNs are a superior technique than the corresponding state of the art. There are large gains particularly
for the matching and detection proposal tasks. We also study the effect of sample complexity and
object size in many tasks, which is valuable information for practitioners. We expect that our results
will advance the objective of using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles to automatically survey, detect
and collect marine debris from underwater environments.
