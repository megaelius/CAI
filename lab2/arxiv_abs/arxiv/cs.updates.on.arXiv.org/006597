Device-to-device (D2D) communications is expected to play a significant role in increasing the
system capacity of the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. To accomplish this, efficient
power and resource allocation algorithms need to be devised for the D2D users. Since the D2D users
are treated as secondary users, their interference to the cellular users (CUs) should not hamper
the CU communications. Most of the prior works on D2D resource allocation assume full channel state
information (CSI) at the base station (BS). However, the required channel gains for the D2D pairs
may not be known. To acquire these in a fast fading channel requires extra power and control overhead.
In this paper, we assume partial CSI and formulate the D2D power and resource allocation problem
as a multi-armed bandit problem. We propose a power allocation scheme for the D2D users in which the
BS allocates power to the D2D users if a certain signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
is maintained for the CUs. In a single player environment a D2D user selects a CU in every time slot
by employing UCB1 algorithm. Since this resource allocation problem can also be considered as an
adversarial bandit problem we have applied the exponential-weight algorithm for exploration
and exploitation (Exp3) to solve it. In a multiple player environment, we extend UCB1 and Exp3 to
multiple D2D users. We also propose two algorithms that are based on distributed learning algorithm
with fairness (DLF) and kth-UCB1 algorithms in which the D2D users are ranked. Our simulation results
show that our proposed algorithms are fair and achieve good performance.
