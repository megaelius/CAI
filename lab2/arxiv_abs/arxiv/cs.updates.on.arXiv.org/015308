With the rapidly worldwide spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is of great importance
to conduct early diagnosis of COVID-19 and predict the time that patients might convert to the severe
stage, for designing effective treatment plan and reducing the clinicians' workloads. In this
study, we propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the patient
would develop severe symptoms in the later time, and if yes, predict the possible conversion time
that the patient would spend to convert to the severe stage. To do this, the proposed method takes
into account 1) the weight for each sample to reduce the outliers' influence and explore the problem
of imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for each feature via a sparsity regularization term
to remove the redundant features of high-dimensional data and learn the shared information across
the classification task and the regression task. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to
predict the disease progression and the conversion time, which could help clinicians to deal with
the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients' lives. Experimental analysis was conducted
on a real data set from two hospitals with 422 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, where 52 cases
were converted to severe on average 5.64 days and 34 cases were severe at admission. Results show
that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 85.91% of accuracy) and regression (e.g.,
0.462 of the correlation coefficient) performance, compared to all comparison methods. Moreover,
our proposed method yields 76.97% of accuracy for predicting the severe cases, 0.524 of the correlation
coefficient, and 0.55 days difference for the converted time.
