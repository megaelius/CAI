Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and ambient backscatter communication have been envisioned
as two promising technologies for the Internet-of-things due to their high spectral efficiency
and energy efficiency. Motivated by this fact, we consider an ambient backscatter NOMA system in
the presence of a malicious eavesdropper. Under some realistic assumptions of residual hardware
impairments (RHIs), channel estimation errors (CEEs) and imperfect successive interference
cancellation (ipSIC), we investigate the physical layer security (PLS) of the ambient backscatter
NOMA systems focusing on reliability and security. In order to further improve the security of the
considered system, an artificial noise scheme is proposed where the radio frequency (RF) source
acts as a jammer that transmits interference signal to the legitimate receivers and eavesdropper.
On this basis, the analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and the intercept probability
(IP) are derived. To gain more insights, the asymptotic analysis and diversity orders for the OP
in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are carried out, and the asymptotic behaviors of
the IP in the high main-to-eavesdropper ratio (MER) region are explored as well. Numerical results
show that: 1) RHIs, CEEs and ipSIC have negative effects on the OP but positive effects on the IP; 2)
Compared with CEEs, RHIs have a more serious impact on the reliability and security of the considered
system; 3) There exists a trade-off between reliability and security, and this trade-off can be
optimized by reducing the power coefficient of the artificial noise or increasing the interfering
factor of readers; 4) There are error floors for the OP due to the CEEs and the reflection coefficient;
5) As MER grows large, the security for Rnand Rf is improved, while the security for T is reduced.
