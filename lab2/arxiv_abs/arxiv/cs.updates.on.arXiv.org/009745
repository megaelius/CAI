In this work, we study constrained clustering, where constraints are utilized to guide the clustering
process. In existing works, two categories of constraints have been widely explored, namely pairwise
and cardinality constraints. Pairwise constraints enforce the cluster labels of two instances
to be the same (must-link constraints) or different (cannot-link constraints). Cardinality constraints
encourage cluster sizes to satisfy a user-specified distribution. However, most existing constrained
clustering models can only utilize one category of constraints at a time. In this paper, we enforce
the above two categories into a unified clustering model starting with the integer program formulation
of the standard K-means. As these two categories provide useful information at different levels,
utilizing both of them is expected to allow for better clustering performance. However, the optimization
is difficult due to the binary and quadratic constraints in the proposed unified formulation. To
alleviate this difficulty, we utilize two techniques: equivalently replacing the binary constraints
by the intersection of two continuous constraints; the other is transforming the quadratic constraints
into bi-linear constraints by introducing extra variables. Then we derive an equivalent continuous
reformulation with simple constraints, which can be efficiently solved by Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data
demonstrate: (1) when utilizing a single category of constraint, the proposed model is superior
to or competitive with state-of-the-art constrained clustering models, and (2) when utilizing
both categories of constraints jointly, the proposed model shows better performance than the case
of the single category.
