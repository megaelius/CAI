The monograph represents analysis of the possibility for time-optimal control of a prototype of
an aircraft-mounted scanning-imaging system of a Light Detection and Ranging based wake vortex
detection system. The study is a part of the research project "Demonstration of Light Detection
and Ranging based wake vortex detection system incorporating an atmospheric hazard map" or GREEN-WAKE
(Project ID 213254) of the European Union Seventh Framework Program for Research and Technological
Development. The scanning system comprises two light mirror actuators. The study is decomposed
into several group of problems. The first and second groups consider the mathematical models of
the scanning system and the mirror actuators. The third group of problems deals with the design of
closed loop tracking control systems of both the large and small mirror actuators. The control of
each one system is synthesized as a near time-optimal control of the precise linear model of the mirror
actuator. The control algorithms realize the state of the art method for synthesis of time-optimal
control of any order for a class of linear time-optimal control problems developed in the author's
dissertation. The last discovers and theoretically proves new properties of a class of linear time-optimal
control problems. From the point of view of the control synthesis algorithms the main advantage
is that the time-optimal control is produced by a multistage procedure within the class of problems
but without the need of describing the hyper-surfaces of switching over. The fourth group of problems
considers modeling the real scan picture but with inclusion also of the Coulomb's friction model.
The fifth group of problems investigates the ways of improvement of the real scan picture. As a result
an excellent repetition and clearness of the scanning alongside with symmetry and matching the
scan pattern are seen.
