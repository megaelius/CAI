Social network analysis provides meaningful information about behavior of network members that
can be used for diverse applications such as classification, link prediction. However, network
analysis is computationally expensive because of feature learning for different applications.
In recent years, many researches have focused on feature learning methods in social networks. Network
embedding represents the network in a lower dimensional representation space with the same properties
which presents a compressed representation of the network. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm
named "CARE" for network embedding that can be used for different types of networks including weighted,
directed and complex. Current methods try to preserve local neighborhood information of nodes,
whereas the proposed method utilizes local neighborhood and community information of network
nodes to cover both local and global structure of social networks. CARE builds customized paths,
which are consisted of local and global structure of network nodes, as a basis for network embedding
and uses the Skip-gram model to learn representation vector of nodes. Subsequently, stochastic
gradient descent is applied to optimize our objective function and learn the final representation
of nodes. Our method can be scalable when new nodes are appended to network without information loss.
Parallelize generation of customized random walks is also used for speeding up CARE. We evaluate
the performance of CARE on multi label classification and link prediction tasks. Experimental
results on various networks indicate that the proposed method outperforms others in both Micro
and Macro-f1 measures for different size of training data.
