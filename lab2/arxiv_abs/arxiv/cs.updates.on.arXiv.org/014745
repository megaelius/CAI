Radiographic images offer an alternative method for the rapid screening and monitoring of Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. This approach is limited by the shortage of radiology experts
who can provide a timely interpretation of these images. Motivated by this challenge, our paper
proposes a novel learning architecture, called Detail-Oriented Capsule Networks (DECAPS), for
the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Our network combines
the strength of Capsule Networks with several architecture improvements meant to boost classification
accuracies. First, DECAPS uses an Inverted Dynamic Routing mechanism which increases model stability
by preventing the passage of information from non-descriptive regions. Second, DECAPS employs
a Peekaboo training procedure which uses a two-stage patch crop and drop strategy to encourage the
network to generate activation maps for every target concept. The network then uses the activation
maps to focus on regions of interest and combines both coarse and fine-grained representations
of the data. Finally, we use a data augmentation method based on conditional generative adversarial
networks to deal with the issue of data scarcity. Our model achieves 84.3% precision, 91.5% recall,
and 96.1% area under the ROC curve, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We
compare the performance of the DECAPS model with three experienced, well-trained thoracic radiologists
and show that the architecture significantly outperforms them. While further studies on larger
datasets are required to confirm this finding, our results imply that architectures like DECAPS
can be used to assist radiologists in the CT scan mediated diagnosis of COVID-19.
