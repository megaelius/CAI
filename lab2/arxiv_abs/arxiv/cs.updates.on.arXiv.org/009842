Purpose: We propose and evaluate a new structured low-rank method for EPI ghost correction called
Robust Autocalibrated LORAKS (RAC-LORAKS). The method can be used to suppress EPI ghosts arising
from the differences between different readout gradient polarities and/or the differences between
different shots. It does not require conventional EPI navigator signals, and is robust to imperfect
autocalibration data. Methods: Autocalibrated LORAKS is a previous structured low-rank method
for EPI ghost correction that uses GRAPPA-type autocalibration data to enable high-quality ghost
correction. This method works well when the autocalibration data is pristine, but performance
degrades substantially when the autocalibration information is imperfect. RAC-LORAKS generalizes
Autocalibrated LORAKS in two ways. First, it does not completely trust the information from autocalibration
data, and instead considers the autocalibration and EPI data simultaneously when estimating low-rank
matrix structure. And second, it uses complementary information from the autocalibration data
to improve EPI reconstruction in a multi-contrast joint reconstruction framework. RAC-LORAKS
is evaluated using simulations and in vivo data, and compared to state-of-the-art methods. Results:
RAC-LORAKS is demonstrated to have good ghost elimination performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods in several complicated acquisition scenarios (including gradient-echo brain imaging,
diffusion-encoded brain imaging, and cardiac imaging). Conclusion: RAC-LORAKS provides effective
suppression of EPI ghosts and is robust to imperfect autocalibration data.
