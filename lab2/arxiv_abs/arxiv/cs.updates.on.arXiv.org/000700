Buildings across the world contribute significantly to the over-all energy consumption and are
thus stakeholders in grid operations. Towards the development of a smart grid, utilities and governments
across the world are encouraging smart meter deployments. High resolution (often at every 15 min-utes)
data from these smart meters can be used to understand and optimize energy consumptions in buildings.
In addition to smart meters, buildings are also increasingly managed with Building Management
Systems (BMS) which control different sub-systems such as lighting and heating, ventila-tion,
and air conditioning (HVAC). With the advent of these smart meters, increased usage of BMS and easy
availability and widespread installation of ambient sensors, there is a deluge of building energy
data. This data has been lever-aged for a variety of applications such as demand response, appliance
fault detection and optimizing HVAC schedules. Beyond the traditional use of such data sets, they
can be put to effective use towards making buildings smarter and hence driving every possible bit
of energy efficiency. Effective use of this data entails several critical areas from sensing to
de-cision making and participatory involvement of occupants. Picking from wide literature in
building energy efficiency, we identify five crust areas (also referred to as 5 Is) for realizing
data driven energy efficiency in buildings : i) instrument optimally; ii) interconnect sub-systems;
iii) inferred decision making; iv) involve occupants and v) intelligent operations. We classify
prior work as per these 5 Is and dis-cuss challenges, opportunities and applications across them.
Building upon these 5 Is we discuss a well studied problem in building energy efficiency -non-intrusive
load monitoring (NILM) and how research in this area spans across the 5 Is.
