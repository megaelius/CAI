2D echocardiography is the most common imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. The portability
and relatively low-cost nature of Ultrasound (US) enable the US devices needed for performing echocardiography
to be made widely available. However, acquiring and interpreting cardiac US images is operator
dependent, limiting its use to only places where experts are present. Recently, Deep Learning (DL)
has been used in 2D echocardiography for automated view classification, and structure and function
assessment. Although these recent works show promise in developing computer-guided acquisition
and automated interpretation of echocardiograms, most of these methods do not model and estimate
uncertainty which can be important when testing on data coming from a distribution further away
from that of the training data. Uncertainty estimates can be beneficial both during the image acquisition
phase (by providing real-time feedback to the operator on acquired image's quality), and during
automated measurement and interpretation. The performance of uncertainty models and quantification
metric may depend on the prediction task and the models being compared. Hence, to gain insight of
uncertainty modelling for left ventricular segmentation from US images, we compare three ensembling
based uncertainty models quantified using four different metrics (one newly proposed) on state-of-the-art
baseline networks using two publicly available echocardiogram datasets. We further demonstrate
how uncertainty estimation can be used to automatically reject poor quality images and improve
state-of-the-art segmentation results.
