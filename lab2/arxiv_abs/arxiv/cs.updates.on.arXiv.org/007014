This paper describes a practical system for Multi Touch Attribution (MTA) for use by a publisher
of digital ads. We developed this system for JD.com, an eCommerce company, which is also a publisher
of digital ads in China. The approach has two steps. The first step ("response modeling") fits a user-level
model for purchase of a product as a function of the user\textquoteright s exposure to ads. The second
("credit allocation") uses the fitted model to allocate the incremental part of the observed purchase
due to advertising, to the ads the user is exposed to over the previous T days. To implement step one,
we train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on user-level conversion and exposure data. The RNN has
the advantage of flexibly handling the sequential dependence in the data in a semi-parametric way.
The specific RNN formulation we implement captures the impact of advertising intensity, timing,
competition, and user-heterogeneity, which are known to be relevant to ad-response. To implement
step two, we compute Shapley Values, which have the advantage of having axiomatic foundations and
satisfying fairness considerations. The specific formulation of the Shapley Value we implement
respects incrementality by allocating the overall incremental improvement in conversion to the
exposed ads, while handling the sequence-dependence of exposures on the observed outcomes. The
system is under production at JD.com, and scales to handle the high dimensionality of the problem
on the platform (attribution of the orders of about 300M users, for roughly 160K brands, across 200+
ad-types, served about 80B ad-impressions over a typical 15-day period).
