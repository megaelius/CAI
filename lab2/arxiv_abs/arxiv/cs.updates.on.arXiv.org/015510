Low-light image enhancement is a promising solution to tackle the problem of insufficient sensitivity
of human vision system (HVS) to perceive information in low light environments. Previous Retinex-based
works always accomplish enhancement task by estimating light intensity. Unfortunately, single
light intensity modelling is hard to accurately simulate visual perception information, leading
to the problems of imbalanced visual photosensitivity and weak adaptivity. To solve these problems,
we explore the precise relationship between light source and visual perception and then propose
the visual perception (VP) model to acquire a precise mathematical description of visual perception.
The core of VP model is to decompose the light source into light intensity and light spatial distribution
to describe the perception process of HVS, offering refinement estimation of illumination and
reflectance. To reduce complexity of the estimation process, we introduce the rapid and adaptive
$\mathbf{\beta}$ and $\mathbf{\gamma}$ functions to build an illumination and reflectance estimation
scheme. Finally, we present a optimal determination strategy, consisting of a \emph{cycle operation}
and a \emph{comparator}. Specifically, the \emph{comparator} is responsible for determining
the optimal enhancement results from multiple enhanced results through implementing the \emph{cycle
operation}. By coordinating the proposed VP model, illumination and reflectance estimation scheme,
and the optimal determination strategy, we propose a rapid and adaptive framework for low-light
image enhancement. Extensive experiment results demenstrate that the proposed method achieves
better performance in terms of visual comparison, quantitative assessment, and computational
efficiency, compared with the currently state-of-the-arts.
