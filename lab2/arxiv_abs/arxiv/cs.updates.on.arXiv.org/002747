Heavy smokers undergoing screening with low-dose chest CT are affected by cardiovascular disease
as much as by lung cancer. Low-dose chest CT scans acquired in screening enable quantification of
atherosclerotic calcifications and thus enable identification of subjects at increased cardiovascular
risk. This paper presents a method for automatic detection of coronary artery, thoracic aorta and
cardiac valve calcifications in low-dose chest CT using two consecutive convolutional neural
networks. The first network identifies and labels potential calcifications according to their
anatomical location and the second network identifies true calcifications among the detected
candidates. This method was trained and evaluated on a set of 1744 CT scans from the National Lung
Screening Trial. To determine whether any reconstruction or only images reconstructed with soft
tissue filters can be used for calcification detection, we evaluated the method on soft and medium/sharp
filter reconstructions separately. On soft filter reconstructions, the method achieved F1 scores
of 0.89, 0.89, 0.67, and 0.55 for coronary artery, thoracic aorta, aortic valve and mitral valve
calcifications, respectively. On sharp filter reconstructions, the F1 scores were 0.84, 0.81,
0.64, and 0.66, respectively. Linearly weighted kappa coefficients for risk category assignment
based on per subject coronary artery calcium were 0.91 and 0.90 for soft and sharp filter reconstructions,
respectively. These results demonstrate that the presented method enables reliable automatic
cardiovascular risk assessment in all low-dose chest CT scans acquired for lung cancer screening.
