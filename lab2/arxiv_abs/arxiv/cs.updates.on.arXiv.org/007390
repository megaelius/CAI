To solve more complex things, computer systems becomes more and more complex. It becomes harder
to be handled manually for various conditions and unknown new conditions in advance. This situation
urgently requires the development of computer technology of automatic judgement and decision
according to various conditions. Current ANN (Artificial Neural Network) models are good at perceptual
intelligence while they are not good at cognitive intelligence such as logical representation,
making them not deal with the above situation well. Therefore, researchers have tried to design
novel models so as to represent and store logical relations into the neural network structures,
the type of which is called KBNN (Knowledge-Based Neural Network). In this type models, the neurons
and links are designed specific for logical relation representation, and the neural network structures
are constructed according to logical relations, allowing us to construct automatically the rule
libraries of expert systems. In this paper, the further improvement is made based on KBNN by redesigning
the neurons and links. This improvement can make neurons solely for representing things while making
links solely for representing logical relations between things, and thus no extra logical neurons
are needed. Moreover, the related construction and adjustment methods of the neural network structure
are also designed based on the redesigned neurons and links, making the neural network structure
dynamically constructed and adjusted according to the logical relations. The probabilistic mechanism
for the weight adjustment can make the neural network model further represent logical relations
in the uncertainty.
