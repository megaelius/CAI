Automated verification techniques for stochastic games allow formal reasoning about systems
that feature competitive or collaborative behaviour among rational agents in uncertain or probabilistic
settings. Existing tools and techniques focus on turn-based games, where each state of the game
is controlled by a single player, and on zero-sum properties, where two players or coalitions have
directly opposing objectives. In this paper, we present automated verification techniques for
concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), which provide a more natural model of concurrent decision
making and interaction. We also consider (social welfare) Nash equilibria, to formally identify
scenarios where two players or coalitions with distinct goals can collaborate to optimise their
joint performance. We propose an extension of the temporal logic rPATL for specifying quantitative
properties in this setting and present corresponding algorithms for verification and strategy
synthesis for a variant of stopping games. For finite-horizon properties the computation is exact,
while for infinite-horizon it is approximate using value iteration. For zero-sum properties it
requires solving matrix games via linear programming, and for equilibria-based properties we
find social welfare or social cost Nash equilibria of bimatrix games via the method of labelled polytopes
through an SMT encoding. We implement this approach in PRISM-games, which required extending the
tool's modelling language for CSGs, and apply it to case studies from domains including robotics,
computer security and computer networks, explicitly demonstrating the benefits of both CSGs and
equilibria-based properties.
