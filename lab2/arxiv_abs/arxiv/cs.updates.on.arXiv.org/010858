In this work we extend previously known decidability results for $2\times 2$ matrices over $\mathbb{Q}$.
Namely, we introduce a notion of flat rational sets: if $M$ is a monoid and $N\leq M$ is its submonoid,
then flat rational sets of $M$ relative to $N$ are finite unions of the form $L_0g_1L_1 \cdots g_t
L_t$ where all $L_i$s are rational subsets of $N$ and $g_i\in M$. We give quite general sufficient
conditions under which flat rational sets form an effective relative Boolean algebra. As a corollary,
we obtain that the emptiness problem for Boolean combinations of flat rational subsets of $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Q})$
over $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is decidable. We also show a dichotomy for nontrivial group
extension of $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ in $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Q})$: if $G$ is a f.g. group
such that $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) < G \leq \mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Q})$, then either $G\cong
\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\times \mathbb{Z}^k$, for some $k\geq 1$, or $G$ contains an extension
of the Baumslag-Solitar group $\mathrm{BS}(1,q)$, with $q\geq2$, of infinite index. It turns
out that in the first case the membership problem for $G$ is decidable but the equality problem for
rational subsets of $G$ is undecidable. In the second case, the membership problem for $G$ is an open
problem as it is open for $\mathrm{BS}(1,q)$. In the last section we prove new decidability results
for flat rational sets that contain singular matrices. In particular, we show that the membership
problem is decidable for flat rational subsets of $M(2,\mathbb{Q})$ relative to the submonoid
that is generated by the matrices from $M(2,\mathbb{Z})$ with determinants $0,\pm1$ and the central
rational matrices.
