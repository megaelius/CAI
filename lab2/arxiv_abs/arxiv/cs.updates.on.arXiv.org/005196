The secrecy rate region of wiretap interference channels with a multi-antenna passive eavesdropper
is studied under receiver energy harvesting constraints. To stay operational in the network, the
legitimate receivers demand energy alongside information, which is fulfilled by power transmission
and exploiting a power splitting (PS) receiver. By simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT), the amount of leakage to the eavesdropper increases, which in turn reduces the
secrecy rates. For this setup, lower-bounds for secure communication rate are derived without
imposing any limitation at the eavesdropper processing. These lower-bounds are then compared
with the rates achieved by assuming the worst-case linear eavesdropper processing. We show that
in certain special cases the worst-case eavesdropper does not enlarge the achievable secure rate
region in comparison to the unconstrained eavesdropper case. It turns out that in order to achieve
the Pareto boundary of the secrecy rate region, smart tuning of the transmit power and receiver PS
coefficient is required. Hence, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize these parameters
jointly in polynomial-time. The secrecy rate region characterization is formulated as a weighted
max-min optimization problem. This problem turns out to be a non-convex problem due to the non-convex
constrained set. This set is replaced by a convex subset that in consequence leads to an achievable
suboptimal solution which is improved iteratively. By solving the problem efficiently, we obtain
the amount of rate loss for providing secrecy, meanwhile satisfying the energy demands.
