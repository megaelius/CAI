With the popularity and development of the wearable devices such as smartphones, human activity
recognition (HAR) based on sensors has become as a key research area in human computer interaction
and ubiquitous computing. The emergence of deep learning leads to a recent shift in the research
of HAR, which requires massive strictly labeled data. In comparison with video data, activity data
recorded from an accelerometer or gyroscope is often more difficult to interpret and segment. Recently,
several attention mechanisms are proposed to handle the weakly labeled human activity data, which
do not require accurate data annotation. However, these attention-based models can only handle
the weakly labeled dataset whose segment includes one labeled activity, as a result it limits efficiency
and practicality. In the paper, we proposed a recurrent attention network to handle sequential
activity recognition and location tasks. The model can repeatedly perform steps of attention on
multiple activities of one segment and each step is corresponding to the current focused activity
according to its previous observations. The effectiveness of the recurrent attention model is
validated by comparing with a baseline CNN, on the UniMiB-SHAR dataset and a collected sequential
weakly labeled multi-activity dataset. The experiment results show that our recurrent attention
model not only can perform single activity recognition tasks, but also can recognize and locate
sequential weakly labeled multi-activity data. Besides, the recurrent attention can greatly
facilitate the process of sensor data accumulation by automatically segmenting the regions of
interest.
