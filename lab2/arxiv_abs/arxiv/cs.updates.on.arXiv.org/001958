A robust and fast automatic moving object detection and tracking system is essential to characterize
target object and extract spatial and temporal information for different functionalities including
video surveillance systems, urban traffic monitoring and navigation, robotic. In this dissertation,
I present a collaborative Spatial Pyramid Context-aware moving object detection and Tracking
system. The proposed visual tracker is composed of one master tracker that usually relies on visual
object features and two auxiliary trackers based on object temporal motion information that will
be called dynamically to assist master tracker. SPCT utilizes image spatial context at different
level to make the video tracking system resistant to occlusion, background noise and improve target
localization accuracy and robustness. We chose a pre-selected seven-channel complementary features
including RGB color, intensity and spatial pyramid of HoG to encode object color, shape and spatial
layout information. We exploit integral histogram as building block to meet the demands of real-time
performance. A novel fast algorithm is presented to accurately evaluate spatially weighted local
histograms in constant time complexity using an extension of the integral histogram method. Different
techniques are explored to efficiently compute integral histogram on GPU architecture and applied
for fast spatio-temporal median computations and 3D face reconstruction texturing. We proposed
a multi-component framework based on semantic fusion of motion information with projected building
footprint map to significantly reduce the false alarm rate in urban scenes with many tall structures.
The experiments on extensive VOTC2016 benchmark dataset and aerial video confirm that combining
complementary tracking cues in an intelligent fusion framework enables persistent tracking for
Full Motion Video and Wide Aerial Motion Imagery.
