With the development of the Internet, social media has become an essential channel for posting disaster-related
information. Analyzing attitudes hidden in these texts, known as sentiment analysis, is crucial
for the government or relief agencies to improve disaster response efficiency, but it has not received
sufficient attention. This paper aims to fill this gap by focusing on investigating public attitudes
towards disaster response and analyzing targeted relief supplies during disaster relief. The
research comprises four steps. First, this paper implements Python in grasping Twitter data, and
then, we assess public perceptron quantitatively by these opinioned texts, which contain information
like the demand for targeted relief supplies, satisfactions of disaster response and fear of the
public. A natural disaster dataset with sentiment labels is created, which contains 49,816 Twitter
data about natural disasters in the United States. Second, this paper proposes eight machine learning
models for sentiment prediction, which are the most popular models used in classification problems.
Third, the comparison of these models is conducted via various metrics, and this paper also discusses
the optimization method of these models from the perspective of model parameters and input data
structures. Finally, a set of real-world instances are studied from the perspective of analyzing
changes of public opinion during different natural disasters and understanding the relationship
between the same hazard and time series. Results in this paper demonstrate the feasibility and validation
of the proposed research approach and provide relief agencies with insights into better disaster
response.
