With the rapid development of COVID-19 into a global pandemic, there is an ever more urgent need for
cheap, fast and reliable tools that can assist physicians in diagnosing COVID-19. Medical imaging
such as CT can take a key role in complementing conventional diagnostic tools from molecular biology,
and, using deep learning techniques, several automatic systems were demonstrated promising performances
using CT or X-ray data. Here, we advocate a more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging
to guide COVID-19 detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive and ubiquitous in medical facilities
around the globe. Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung ultrasound (POCUS) dataset
consisting of (currently) 1103 images (654 COVID-19, 277 bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls),
sampled from 64 videos. While this dataset was assembled from various online sources and is by no
means exhaustive, it was processed specifically to feed deep learning models and is intended to
serve as a starting point for an open-access initiative. Second, we train a deep convolutional neural
network (POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an accuracy of 89% and, by a majority vote,
a video accuracy of 92% . For detecting COVID-19 in particular, the model performs with a sensitivity
of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation. Third, we provide
an open-access web service (POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https://pocovidscreen.org.
The website deploys the predictive model, allowing to perform predictions on ultrasound lung images.
In addition, it grants medical staff the option to (bulk) upload their own screenings in order to
contribute to the growing public database of pathological lung ultrasound images. Dataset and
