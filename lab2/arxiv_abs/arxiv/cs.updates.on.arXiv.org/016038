Collaborative consensus-finding is an integral element of many Web services and greatly determines
the quality of information, content, and products that are available through the Web. That also
means that the dynamics of democratic consensus-finding strengthen collective resilience against
potential threats that attempt to degrade information, content, and products and affect Web data,
users, behaviors, and even beyond as well as offline life. Even on Web platforms that are open to all,
the influence of some first mover authors may shape future discussion and collaboration, which
is comparable to academic citation networks for instance. In a social coding network such as GitHub,
activities of a set of users can have influence on other users who can get interested in further actions,
possibly contributing to a new project together with influential users. In this paper, we analyze
the effect of contribution activities on gaining influence in this and comparable networks that
provide users the functionality and aims for reaching collaborative goals on the Web.For this purpose,
we present an empirical approach to identify the top influential users by using network features
and contribution characteristics, which we find in existing and newly collected data set. We find
that early adopter dynamics exist in the GitHub community, where early adopters have more followers
in the end as expected. However, we also see counterexamples that arise due to the social networking
behavior of late adopters, and due to the aging effect of older repositories and users. We publicly
share the source code and the data sets for reproducing our paper.
