In this study, a fast and stable machine-learned hybrid algorithm implemented in TensorFlow for
the integration of stiff chemical kinetics is introduced. Numerical solutions to differential
equations are at the core of computational fluid dynamics calculations. As the size and complexity
of the simulations grow, so does the need for computational power and time. Many efforts have been
made to implement stiff chemistry solvers on GPUs but have not been highly successful because of
the logical divergence in traditional stiff solver algorithms. Because of these constrains, a
novel Explicit Stabilized Variable-load (STEV) solver has been developed. Overstepping due to
the relatively large time steps is prevented by introducing limits to the maximum changes of chemical
species per time step. To prevent oscillations, a discrete Fourier transform is introduced to dampen
ringing. In contrast to conventional explicit approaches, a variable-load approach is used where
each cell in the computational domain is advanced with its unique time step. This approach allows
cells to be integrated simultaneously while maintaining warp convergence but finish at different
iterations and be removed from the workload. To improve the computational performance of the introduced
solver, specific thermodynamic quantities of interest were estimated using shallow neural networks
in place of polynomial fits, leading to an additional 10% savings in clock time with minimal training
and implementation requirements. However ML specific hardware could increase the time savings
to as much as 28%. While the complexity of these particular machine learning models is not high by
modern standards, the impact on computational efficiency should not be ignored. The results show
a dramatic decrease in total chemistry solution time (over 200 times) while maintaining a similar
degree of accuracy.
