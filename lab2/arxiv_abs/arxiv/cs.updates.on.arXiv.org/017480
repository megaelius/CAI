We consider a biphasic continuum model for avascular tumour growth in two spatial dimensions, in
which a cell phase and a fluid phase follow conservation of mass and momentum. A limiting nutrient
that follows a diffusion process controls the birth and death rate of the tumour cells. The cell volume
fraction, cell velocity--fluid pressure system, and nutrient concentration are the model variables.
A coupled system of a hyperbolic conservation law, \cred{a viscous fluid model}, and a parabolic
diffusion equation governs the dynamics of the model variables. The tumour boundary moves with
the normal velocity of the outermost layer of cells, and this time--dependence is a challenge in
designing and implementing a stable and fast numerical scheme. We recast the model into a form where
the hyperbolic equation is defined on a fixed extended domain and retrieve the tumour boundary as
the interface at which the cell volume fraction decreases below a threshold value. This procedure
eliminates the need to track the tumour boundary explicitly and the computationally expensive
re--meshing of the time--dependent domains. A numerical scheme based on finite volume methods
for the hyperbolic conservation law, Lagrange $\mathbb{P}_2 - \mathbb{P}_1$ Taylor--Hood finite
element method for the \cred{viscous} system, and mass--lumped finite element method for the parabolic
equations is implemented in two spatial dimensions, and several cases are studied. We demonstrate
the versatility of the numerical scheme in catering for irregular and asymmetric initial tumour
geometries. We present numerical simulations for both cases and the results are consistent with
theoretical and heuristic expectations such as early linear growth rate and preservation of radial
symmetry when the boundary conditions are symmetric.
