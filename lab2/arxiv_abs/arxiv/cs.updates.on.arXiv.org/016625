Applications of neuroimaging methods have substantially contributed to the scientific understanding
of human factors during driving by providing a deeper insight into the neuro-cognitive aspects
of driver brain. This has been achieved by conducting simulated (and occasionally, field) driving
experiments while collecting driver brain signals of certain types. Here, this sector of studies
is comprehensively reviewed at both macro and micro scales. Different themes of neuroimaging driving
behaviour research are identified and the findings within each theme are synthesised. The surveyed
literature has reported on applications of four major brain imaging methods. These include Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), Functional Near-Infrared
Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG), with the first two being the most common
methods in this domain. While collecting driver fMRI signal has been particularly instrumental
in studying neural correlates of intoxicated driving (e.g. alcohol or cannabis) or distracted
driving, the EEG method has been predominantly utilised in relation to the efforts aiming at development
of automatic fatigue/drowsiness detection systems, a topic to which the literature on neuro-ergonomics
of driving particularly has shown a spike of interest within the last few years. The survey also reveals
that topics such as driver brain activity in semi-automated settings or the brain activity of drivers
with brain injuries or chronic neurological conditions have by contrast been investigated to a
very limited extent. Further, potential topics in relation to driving behaviour are identified
that could benefit from the adoption of neuroimaging methods in future studies.
