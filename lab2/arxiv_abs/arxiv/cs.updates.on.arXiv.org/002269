Clinical trial registries can be used to monitor the production of trial evidence and signal when
systematic reviews become out of date. However, this use has been limited to date due to the extensive
manual review required to search for and screen relevant trial registrations. Our aim was to evaluate
a new method that could partially automate the identification of trial registrations that may be
relevant for systematic review updates. We identified 179 systematic reviews of drug interventions
for type 2 diabetes, which included 537 clinical trials that had registrations in ClinicalTrials.gov.
We tested a matrix factorisation approach that uses a shared latent space to learn how to rank relevant
trial registrations for each systematic review, comparing the performance to document similarity
to rank relevant trial registrations. The two approaches were tested on a holdout set of the newest
trials from the set of type 2 diabetes systematic reviews and an unseen set of 141 clinical trial registrations
from 17 updated systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The
matrix factorisation approach outperformed the document similarity approach with a median rank
of 59 and recall@100 of 60.9%, compared to a median rank of 138 and recall@100 of 42.8% in the document
similarity baseline. In the second set of systematic reviews and their updates, the highest performing
approach used document similarity and gave a median rank of 67 (recall@100 of 62.9%). The proposed
method was useful for ranking trial registrations to reduce the manual workload associated with
finding relevant trials for systematic review updates. The results suggest that the approach could
be used as part of a semi-automated pipeline for monitoring potentially new evidence for inclusion
in a review update.
