We consider a cache-aided interference network which consists of a library of $N$ files, $K_T$ transmitters
and $K_R$ receivers (users), each equipped with a local cache of size $M_T$ and $M_R$ files respectively,
and connected via a discrete-time additive white Gaussian noise channel. Each receiver requests
an arbitrary file from the library. The objective is to design a cache placement without knowing
the receivers' requests and a communication scheme such that the sum Degrees of Freedom (sum-DoF)
of the delivery is maximized. This network model has been investigated by Naderializadeh {\em et
al.}, who proposed a prefetching and a delivery schemes that achieves a sum-DoF of $\min\{\frac{{M_TK_T+K_RM_R}}{{N}},
K_R\}$. One of biggest limitations of this scheme is the requirement of high subpacketization level.
This paper is the first attempt in the literature (according to our knowledge) to reduce the file
subpacketization in such a network. In particular, we propose a new approach for both prefetching
and linear delivery schemes based on a combinatorial design called {\em hypercube}. We show that
required number of packets per file can be exponentially reduced compared to the state of the art
scheme proposed by Naderializadeh {\em et al.}, or the NMA scheme. When $M_TK_T+K_RM_R \geq K_R$,
the achievable one-shot sum-DoF using this approach is $\frac{{M_TK_T+K_RM_R}}{{N}}$ , which
shows that 1) the one-shot sum-DoF scales linearly with the aggregate cache size in the network and
2) it is within a factor of $2$ to the information-theoretic optimum. Surprisingly, the identical
and near optimal sum-DoF performance can be achieved using the hypercube approach with a much less
file subpacketization.
