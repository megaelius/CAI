Semiring provenance is a successful approach to provide detailed information on the combinations
of atomic facts that are responsible for the result of a query. In particular, interpretations in
general provenance semirings of polynomials or formal power series give precise descriptions
of the successful evaluation strategies for the query. While provenance analysis in databases
has, for a long time, been largely confined to negation-free query languages, a recent approach
extends this to model checking problems for logics with full negation. Algebraically this relies
on new quotient semirings of dual-indeterminate polynomials or power series. So far, this approach
has been developed mainly for first-order logic and for the positive fragment of least fixed-point
logic. What has remained open is an adequate treatment for fixed-point calculi that admit arbitrary
interleavings of least and greatest fixed points. We show that an adequate framework for the provenance
analysis of full fixed-point logics is provided by semirings that are (1) fully continuous, (2)
absorptive, and (3) chain-positive. Full continuity guarantees that provenance values of least
and greatest fixed-points are well-defined. Absorptive semirings provide a symmetry between
least and greatest fixed-point computations and make sure that provenance values of greatest fixed
points are informative. Finally, chain-positivity is responsible for having truth-preserving
interpretations, which give non-zero values to all true formulae. We further identify semirings
of generalized absorptive polynomials and prove universal properties that make them the most general
appropriate semirings for LFP. We illustrate the power of provenance interpretations in these
semirings by relating them to provenance values of plays and strategies in the associated model-checking
games.
