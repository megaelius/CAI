Background: Three-dimensional, whole heart, balanced steady state free precession (WH-bSSFP)
sequences provide delineation of intra-cardiac and vascular anatomy. However, they have long
acquisition times. Here, we propose significant speed ups using a deep learning single volume super
resolution reconstruction, to recover high resolution features from rapidly acquired low resolution
WH-bSSFP images. Methods: A 3D residual U-Net was trained using synthetic data, created from a library
of high-resolution WH-bSSFP images by simulating 0.5 slice resolution and 0.5 phase resolution.
The trained network was validated with synthetic test data, as well as prospective low-resolution
data. Results: Synthetic low-resolution data had significantly better image quality after super-resolution
reconstruction. Qualitative image scores showed super-resolved images had better edge sharpness,
fewer residual artefacts and less image distortion than low-resolution images, with similar scores
to high-resolution data. Quantitative image scores showed super-resolved images had significantly
better edge sharpness than low-resolution or high-resolution images, with significantly better
signal-to-noise ratio than high-resolution data. Vessel diameters measurements showed over-estimation
in the low-resolution measurements, compared to the high-resolution data. No significant differences
and no bias was found in the super-resolution measurements. Conclusion: This paper demonstrates
the potential of using a residual U-Net for super-resolution reconstruction of rapidly acquired
low-resolution whole heart bSSFP data within a clinical setting. The resulting network can be applied
very quickly, making these techniques particularly appealing within busy clinical workflow.
Thus, we believe that this technique may help speed up whole heart CMR in clinical practice.
