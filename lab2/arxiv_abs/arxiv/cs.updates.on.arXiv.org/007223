Prognostic tumor growth modeling via medical imaging observations is a challenging yet important
problem in precision and predictive medicine. Traditionally, this problem is tackled through
mathematical modeling and evaluated using relatively small patient datasets. Recent advances
of convolutional networks (ConvNets) have demonstrated their higher accuracy than mathematical
models in predicting future tumor volumes. This indicates that deep learning may have great potentials
on addressing such problem. The state-of-the-art work models the cell invasion and mass-effect
of tumor growth by training separate ConvNets on 2D image patches. Nevertheless such a 2D modeling
approach cannot make full use of the spatial-temporal imaging context of the tumor's longitudinal
4D (3D + time) patient data. Moreover, previous methods are incapable to predict clinically-relevant
tumor properties, other than the tumor volumes. In this paper, we exploit to formulate the tumor
growth process through convolutional LSTMs (ConvLSTM) that extract tumor's static imaging appearances
and simultaneously capture its temporal dynamic changes within a single network. We extend ConvLSTM
into the spatial-temporal domain (ST-ConvLSTM) by jointly learning the inter-slice 3D contexts
and the longitudinal dynamics. Our approach can incorporate other non-imaging patient information
in an end-to-end trainable manner. Experiments are conducted on the largest 4D longitudinal tumor
dataset of 33 patients to date. Results validate that the proposed ST-ConvLSTM model produces a
Dice score of 83.2%+-5.1% and a RVD of 11.2%+-10.8%, both statistically significantly outperforming
(p<0.05) other compared methods of traditional linear model, ConvLSTM, and generative adversarial
network (GAN) under the metric of predicting future tumor volumes. Last, our new method enables
the prediction of both cell density and CT intensity numbers.
