We consider a decentralized linear quadratic system with a major agent and a collection of minor
agents. The agents are coupled in their dynamics as well as a quadratic cost. In particular, the dynamics
are linear; the state and control action of the major agent affect the state evolution of all the minor
agents but the state and the control action of the minor agents do not affect the state evolution of
the major or other minor agents. The system has partial output feedback with partially nested information
structure. In particular, the major agent perfectly observes its own state while each minor agent
perfectly observes the state of the major agent and partially observes its own state. It is not assumed
that the noise process has a Gaussian distribution. For this model, we characterize the structure
of the optimal and the best linear strategies. We show that the optimal control of the major agent
is a linear function of the major agent's MMSE (minimum mean squared error) estimate of the system
state and the optimal control of a minor agent is a linear function of the major agent's MMSE estimate
of the system state and a "correction term" which depends on the difference of the minor agent's MMSE
estimate of its local state and the major agent's MMSE estimate of the minor agent's local state.
The major agent's MMSE estimate is a linear function of its observations while the minor agent's
MMSE estimate is a non-linear function of its observations which is updated according to the non-linear
Bayesian filter. We show that if we replace the minor agent's MMSE estimate by its LLMS (linear least
mean square) estimate, then the resultant strategy is the best linear control strategy. We prove
the result using a direct proof which is based on conditional independence, splitting of the state
and control actions, simplifying the per-step cost, orthogonality principle, and completion
of squares.
