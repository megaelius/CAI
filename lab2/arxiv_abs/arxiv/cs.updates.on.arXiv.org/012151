Gait of a person refers to his/her walking pattern, and according to medical studies gait of every
individual is unique. Over the past decade, several computer vision-based gait recognition approaches
have been proposed in which walking information corresponding to a complete gait cycle has been
used to construct gait features for person identification. These methods compute gait features
with the inherent assumption that a complete gait cycle is always available. However, in most public
places occlusion is an inevitable occurrence, and due to this, only a fraction of a gait cycle gets
captured by the monitoring camera. Unavailability of complete gait cycle information drastically
affects the accuracy of the extracted features, and till date, only a few occlusion handling strategies
to gait recognition have been proposed. But none of these performs reliably and robustly in the presence
of a single cycle with incomplete information, and because of this practical application of gait
recognition is quite limited. In this work, we develop deep learning-based algorithm to accurately
identify the affected frames as well as predict the missing frames to reconstruct a complete gait
cycle. While occlusion detection has been carried out by employing a VGG-16 model, the model for
frame reconstruction is based on Long-Short Term Memory network that has been trained to optimize
a multi-objective function based on dice coefficient and cross-entropy loss. The effectiveness
of the proposed occlusion reconstruction algorithm is evaluated by computing the accuracy of the
popular Gait Energy Feature on the reconstructed sequence. Experimental evaluation on public
data sets and comparative analysis with other occlusion handling methods verify the effectiveness
of our approach.
