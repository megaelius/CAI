There is an asymptotic relationship between the multiplicative relations among multinomial coefficients
and the (additive) recurrence property of Shannon entropy known as the chain rule. We show that both
types of identities are manifestations of a unique algebraic construction: a $1$-cocycle condition
in \emph{information cohomology}, an algebraic invariant of phesheaves of modules on \emph{information
structures} (categories of observables). Baudot and Bennequin introduced this cohomology and
proved that Shannon entropy represents the only nontrivial cohomology class in degree $1$ when
the coefficients are a natural presheaf of probabilistic functionals. The author obtained later
a $1$-parameter family of deformations of that presheaf, in such a way that each Tsallis $\alpha$-entropy
appears as the unique $1$-cocycle associated to the parameter $\alpha$. In this article, we introduce
a new presheaf of \emph{combinatorial functionals}, which are measurable functions of finite
arrays of integers; these arrays represent \emph{histograms} associated to random experiments.
In this case, the only cohomology class in degree $0$ is generated by the exponential function and
$1$-cocycles are Fonten\'e-Ward generalized multinomial coefficients. As a byproduct, we get
a simple combinatorial analogue of the fundamental equation of information theory that characterizes
the generalized binomial coefficients. The asymptotic relationship mentioned above is extended
to a correspondence between certain generalized multinomial coefficients and any $\alpha$-entropy,
that sheds new light on the meaning of the chain rule and its deformations.
