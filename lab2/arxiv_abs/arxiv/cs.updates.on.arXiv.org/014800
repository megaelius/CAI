Recovery after stroke is often incomplete, but rehabilitation training may potentiate recovery
by engaging endogenous neuroplasticity. In preclinical models of stroke, high doses of rehabilitation
training are required to restore functional movement to the affected limbs of animals. In humans,
however, the necessary dose of training to potentiate recovery is not known. This ignorance stems
from the lack of objective, pragmatic approaches for measuring training doses in rehabilitation
activities. Here, to develop a measurement approach, we took the critical first step of automatically
identifying functional primitives, the basic building block of activities. Forty-eight individuals
with chronic stroke performed a variety of rehabilitation activities while wearing inertial measurement
units (IMUs) to capture upper body motion. Primitives were identified by human labelers, who labeled
and segmented the associated IMU data. We performed automatic classification of these primitives
using machine learning. We designed a convolutional neural network model that outperformed existing
methods. The model includes an initial module to compute separate embeddings of different physical
quantities in the sensor data. In addition, it replaces batch normalization (which performs normalization
based on statistics computed from the training data) with instance normalization (which uses statistics
computed from the test data). This increases robustness to possible distributional shifts when
applying the method to new patients. With this approach, we attained an average classification
accuracy of 70%. Thus, using a combination of IMU-based motion capture and deep learning, we were
able to identify primitives automatically. This approach builds towards objectively-measured
rehabilitation training, enabling the identification and counting of functional primitives
that accrues to a training dose.
