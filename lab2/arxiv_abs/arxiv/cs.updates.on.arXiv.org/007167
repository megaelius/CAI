In this work we consider three well-studied broadcast protocols: Push, Pull and Push&Pull. A key
property of all these models, which is also an important reason for their popularity, is that they
are presumed to be very robust, since they are simple, randomized, and, crucially, do not utilize
explicitly the global structure of the underlying graph. While sporadic results exist, there has
been no systematic theoretical treatment quantifying the robustness of these models. Here we investigate
this question with respect to two orthogonal aspects: (adversarial) modifications of the underlying
graph and message transmission failures. We explore in particular the following notion of Local
Resilience: beginning with a graph, we investigate up to which fraction of the edges an adversary
has to be allowed to delete at each vertex, so that the protocols need significantly more rounds to
broadcast the information. Our main findings establish a separation among the three models. It
turns out that Pull is robust with respect to all parameters that we consider. On the other hand, Push
may slow down significantly, even if the adversary is allowed to modify the degrees of the vertices
by an arbitrarily small positive fraction only. Finally, Push&Pull is robust when no message transmission
failures are considered, otherwise it may be slowed down. On the technical side, we develop two novel
methods for the analysis of randomized rumour spreading protocols. First, we exploit the notion
of self-bounding functions to facilitate significantly the round-based analysis: we show that
for any graph the variance of the growth of informed vertices is bounded by its expectation, so that
concentration results follow immediately. Second, in order to control adversarial modifications
of the graph we make use of a powerful tool from extremal graph theory, namely Szemer\`edi's Regularity
Lemma.
