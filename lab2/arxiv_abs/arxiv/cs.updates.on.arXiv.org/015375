Modern computing systems are embracing hybrid memory comprising of DRAM and non-volatile memory
(NVM) to combine the best properties of both memory technologies, achieving low latency, high reliability,
and high density. A prominent characteristic of DRAM-NVM hybrid memory is that it has NVM access
latency much higher than DRAM access latency. We call this inter-memory asymmetry. We observe that
parasitic components on a long bitline are a major source of high latency in both DRAM and NVM, and
a significant factor contributing to high-voltage operations in NVM, which impact their reliability.
We propose an architectural change, where each long bitline in DRAM and NVM is split into two segments
by an isolation transistor. One segment can be accessed with lower latency and operating voltage
than the other. By introducing tiers, we enable non-uniform accesses within each memory type (which
we call intra-memory asymmetry), leading to performance and reliability trade-offs in DRAM-NVM
hybrid memory. We extend existing NVM-DRAM OS in three ways. First, we exploit both inter- and intra-memory
asymmetries to allocate and migrate memory pages between the tiers in DRAM and NVM. Second, we improve
the OS's page allocation decisions by predicting the access intensity of a newly-referenced memory
page in a program and placing it to a matching tier during its initial allocation. This minimizes
page migrations during program execution, lowering the performance overhead. Third, we propose
a solution to migrate pages between the tiers of the same memory without transferring data over the
memory channel, minimizing channel occupancy and improving performance. Our overall approach,
which we call MNEME, to enable and exploit asymmetries in DRAM-NVM hybrid tiered memory improves
both performance and reliability for both single-core and multi-programmed workloads.
