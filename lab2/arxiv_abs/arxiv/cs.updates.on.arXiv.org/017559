The issue in solving social problems is how to respect minority opinions, which are often ignored
in general majority rules. To build consensus on pluralistic values and make social choices in consideration
of minority opinions, we propose aggregation methods that give weighting to the minority's positionality
on cardinal cumulative voting. Based on quadratic and linear voting, we formulated three weighted
aggregation methods that differ in the ratio of votes to cumulative points and the weighting of the
minority to all members, and calculated the frequency distributions of the aggregation results,
assuming that the distributions of votes follow normal distributions. From these calculation
results, we found that minority opinions are likely to be reflected as weighting increases proportionally
in two of the above three methods. This means that Sen and Gotoh's idea of considering the social position
of unfortunate people on ordinal ranking, that welfare economics considers under an axiomatic
approach, was shown by weighting the minority's positionality on cardinal voting. In addition,
we can know the contents such as the number and positionality of the minority from the analysis of
the aggregation results. It will be useful for promoting mutual understanding between the majority
and minority by visualizing the contents of the proposed aggregation methods interactively in
the consensus-building process. With the further development of information technology, the
consensus building on cardinal choices based on big data will be necessary. We would like to use the
proposed aggregation methods for making social choices for pluralistic values such as social,
environmental, and economic.
