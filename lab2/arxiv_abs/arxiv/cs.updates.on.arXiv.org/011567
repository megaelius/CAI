Quantitative, volumetric analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a fundamental way researchers
study the brain in a host of neurological conditions including normal maturation and aging. Despite
the availability of open-source brain segmentation software, widespread clinical adoption of
volumetric analysis has been hindered due to processing times and reliance on manual corrections.
Here, we extend the use of deep learning models from proof-of-concept, as previously reported,
to present a comprehensive segmentation of cortical and deep gray matter brain structures matching
the standard regions of aseg+aparc included in the commonly used open-source tool, Freesurfer.
The work presented here provides a real-life, rapid deep learning-based brain segmentation tool
to enable clinical translation as well as research application of quantitative brain segmentation.
The advantages of the presented tool include short (~1 minute) processing time and improved segmentation
quality. This is the first study to perform quick and accurate segmentation of 102 brain regions
based on the surface-based protocol (DMK protocol), widely used by experts in the field. This is
also the first work to include an expert reader study to assess the quality of the segmentation obtained
using a deep-learning-based model. We show the superior performance of our deep-learning-based
models over the traditional segmentation tool, Freesurfer. We refer to the proposed deep learning-based
tool as DARTS (DenseUnet-based Automatic Rapid Tool for brain Segmentation). Our tool and trained
models are available at https://github.com/NYUMedML/DARTS
