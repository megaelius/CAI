In advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), smart meters (SMs) are installed at the consumer side
to send fine-grained power consumption readings periodically to the system operator (SO) for load
monitoring, energy management, billing, etc. However, fraudulent consumers launch electricity
theft cyber-attacks by reporting false readings to reduce their bills illegally. These attacks
do not only cause financial losses but may also degrade the grid performance because the readings
are used for grid management. To identify these attackers, the existing schemes employ machine-learning
models using the consumers' fine-grained readings, which violates the consumers' privacy by revealing
their lifestyle. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme that enables the SO to detect electricity
theft, compute bills, and monitor load while preserving the consumers' privacy. The idea is that
SMs encrypt their readings using functional encryption, and the SO uses the ciphertexts to (i) compute
the bills following dynamic pricing approach, (ii) monitor the grid load, and (iii) evaluate a machine-learning
model to detect fraudulent consumers, without being able to learn the individual readings to preserve
consumers' privacy. We adapted a functional encryption scheme so that the encrypted readings are
aggregated for billing and load monitoring and only the aggregated value is revealed to the SO. Also,
we exploited the inner-product operations on encrypted readings to evaluate a machine-learning
model to detect fraudulent consumers. Real dataset is used to evaluate our scheme, and our evaluations
indicate that our scheme is secure and can detect fraudulent consumers accurately with low communication
and computation overhead.
