Weather is an important factor affecting transportation and road safety. In this paper, we leverage
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in labelling images taken by street and highway
cameras located across across North America. Road camera snapshots were used in experiments with
multiple deep learning frameworks to classify images by road condition. The training data for these
experiments used images labelled as dry, wet, snow/ice, poor, and offline. The experiments tested
different configurations of six convolutional neural networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, Xception,
InceptionResNetV2, EfficientNet-B0 and EfficientNet-B4) to assess their suitability to this
problem. The precision, accuracy, and recall were measured for each framework configuration.
In addition, the training sets were varied both in overall size and by size of individual classes.
The final training set included 47,000 images labelled using the five aforementioned classes.
The EfficientNet-B4 framework was found to be most suitable to this problem, achieving validation
accuracy of 90.6%, although EfficientNet-B0 achieved an accuracy of 90.3% with half the execution
time. It was observed that VGG-16 with transfer learning proved to be very useful for data acquisition
and pseudo-labelling with limited hardware resources, throughout this project. The EfficientNet-B4
framework was then placed into a real-time production environment, where images could be classified
in real-time on an ongoing basis. The classified images were then used to construct a map showing
real-time road conditions at various camera locations across North America. The choice of these
frameworks and our analysis take into account unique requirements of real-time map building functions.
A detailed analysis of the process of semi-automated dataset labelling using these frameworks
is also presented in this paper.
