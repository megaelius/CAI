The aggregated unfitted finite element method (AgFEM) is a methodology recently introduced in
order to address conditioning and stability problems associated with embedded, unfitted, or extended
finite element methods. The method is based on removal of basis functions associated with badly
cut cells by introducing carefully designed constraints, which results in well-posed systems
of linear algebraic equations, while preserving the optimal approximation order of the underlying
finite element spaces. The specific goal of this work is to present the implementation and performance
of the method on distributed-memory platforms aiming at the efficient solution of large-scale
problems. In particular, we show that, by considering AgFEM, the resulting systems of linear algebraic
equations can be effectively solved using standard algebraic multigrid preconditioners. This
is in contrast with previous works that consider highly customized preconditioners in order to
allow one the usage of iterative solvers in combination with unfitted techniques. Another novelty
with respect to the methods available in the literature is the problem sizes that can be handled with
the proposed approach. While most of previous references discussing linear solvers for unfitted
methods are based on serial non-scalable algorithms, we propose a parallel distributed-memory
method able to efficiently solve problems at large scales. This is demonstrated by means of a weak
scaling test defined on complex 3D domains up to 300M degrees of freedom and one billion cells on 16K
CPU cores in the Marenostrum-IV platform. The parallel implementation of the AgFEM method is available
in the large-scale finite element package FEMPAR.
