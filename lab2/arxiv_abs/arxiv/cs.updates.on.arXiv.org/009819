Machine learning techniques for Recommendation System (RS) and Classification has become a prime
focus of research to tackle the problem of information overload. RS are software tools that aim at
making informed decisions about the services that a user may like. On the other hand, classification
technique deals with the categorization of a data object into one of the several predefined classes.
In the multi-label classification problem, unlike the traditional multi-class classification
setting, each instance can be simultaneously associated with a subset of labels. The focus of thesis
is on the development of novel techniques for collaborative filtering and multi-label classification.
We propose a novel method of constructing a hierarchical bi-level maximum margin matrix factorization
to handle matrix completion of ordinal rating matrix. Taking the cue from the alternative formulation
of support vector machines, a novel loss function is derived by considering proximity as an alternative
criterion instead of margin maximization criterion for matrix factorization framework. We extended
the concept of matrix factorization for yet another important problem of machine learning namely
multi-label classification which deals with the classification of data with multiple labels.
We propose a novel piecewise-linear embedding method with a low-rank constraint on parametrization
to capture nonlinear intrinsic relationships that exist in the original feature and label space.
We also study the embedding of labels together with the group information with an objective to build
an efficient multi-label classifier. We assume the existence of a low-dimensional space onto which
the feature vectors and label vectors can be embedded. We ensure that labels belonging to the same
group share the same sparsity pattern in their low-rank representations.
