Grounding of kinesthetic feedback against a user's hand can increase the portability and wearability
of a haptic device. However, the effects of different hand-grounding locations on haptic perception
of a user are unknown. In this letter, we investigate the effects of three different hand-grounding
locations-back of the hand, proximal phalanx of the index finger, and middle phalanx of the index
finger-on haptic perception using a newly designed wearable haptic device. The novel device can
provide kinesthetic feedback to the user's index finger in two directions: along the finger-axis
and in the finger's flexion-extension movement direction. We measure users' haptic perception
for each grounding location through a psychophysical experiment for each of the two feedback directions.
Results show that among the studied locations, grounding at proximal phalanx has a smaller average
just noticeable difference for both feedback directions, indicating a more sensitive haptic perception.
The realism of the haptic feedback, based on user ratings, was the highest with grounding at the middle
phalanx for feedback along the finger axis, and at the proximal phalanx for feedback in the flexion-extension
direction. Users identified the haptic feedback as most comfortable with grounding at the back
of the hand for feedback along the finger axis and at the proximal phalanx for feedback in the flexion-extension
direction. These findings show that the choice of grounding location has a significant impact on
the user's haptic perception and qualitative experience. The results provide insights for designing
next-generation wearable hand-grounded kinesthetic devices to achieve better haptic performance
and user experience in virtual reality and teleoperated robotic applications.
