In this paper, we consider the energy-bandwidth allocation for a network with multiple broadcast
channels, where the transmitters access the network orthogonally on the assigned frequency band
and each transmitter communicates with multiple receivers orthogonally or non-orthogonally.
We assume that the energy harvesting state and channel gain of each transmitter can be predicted
for $K$ slots {\em a priori}. To maximize the weighted throughput, we formulate an optimization
problem with $O(MK)$ constraints, where $M$ is the number of the receivers, and decompose it into
the energy and bandwidth allocation subproblems. In order to use the iterative algorithm proposed
in [1] to solve the problem, we propose efficient algorithms to solve the two subproblems, so that
the optimal energy-bandwidth allocation can be obtained with an overall complexity of ${\cal O}(MK^2)$,
even though the problem is non-convex when the broadcast channel is non-orthogonal. For the orthogonal
broadcast channel, we further formulate a proportionally-fair (PF) throughput maximization
problem and derive the equivalence conditions such that the optimal solution can be obtained by
solving a weighted throughput maximization problem. Further, the algorithm to obtain the proper
weights is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can make efficient use
of the harvested energy and the available bandwidth, and achieve significantly better performance
than some heuristic policies for energy and bandwidth allocation. Moreover, it is seen that with
energy-harvesting transmitters, non-orthogonal broadcast offers limited gain over orthogonal
broadcast.
