We study the Maximum Independent Set problem for geometric objects given in the data stream model.
A set of geometric objects is said to be independent if the objects are pairwise disjoint. We consider
geometric objects in one and two dimensions, i.e., intervals and disks. Let $\alpha$ be the cardinality
of the largest independent set. Our goal is to estimate $\alpha$ in a small amount of space, given
that the input is received as a one-pass stream. We also consider a generalization of this problem
by assigning weights to each object and estimating $\beta$, the largest value of a weighted independent
set. We initialize the study of this problem in the turnstile streaming model (insertions and deletions)
and provide the first algorithms for estimating $\alpha$ and $\beta$. For unit-length intervals,
we obtain a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in poly$(\frac{\log(n)}{\epsilon})$
space. We also show a matching lower bound. Combined with the $3/2$-approximation for insertion-only
streams by Cabello and Perez-Lanterno [CP15], our result implies a separation between the insertion-only
and turnstile model. For unit-radius disks, we obtain a $\left(\frac{8\sqrt{3}}{\pi}\right)$-approximation
to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in poly$(\log(n), \epsilon^{-1})$ space, which is closely related to the
hexagonal circle packing constant. We provide algorithms for estimating $\alpha$ for arbitrary-length
intervals under a bounded intersection assumption and study the parameterized space complexity
of estimating $\alpha$ and $\beta$, where the parameter is the ratio of maximum to minimum interval
length.
