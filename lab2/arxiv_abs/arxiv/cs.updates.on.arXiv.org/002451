This paper discusses the conceptual design and proof-of-concept flight demonstration of a novel
variable pitch quadrotor biplane Unmanned Aerial Vehicle concept for payload delivery. The proposed
design combines vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), precise hover capabilities of a quadrotor
helicopter and high range, endurance and high forward cruise speed characteristics of a fixed wing
aircraft. The proposed UAV is designed for a mission requirement of carrying and delivering 6 kg
payload to a destination at 16 km from the point of origin. First, the design of proprotors is carried
out using a physics based modified Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) analysis, which is validated
using experimental data generated for the purpose. Proprotors have conflicting requirement for
optimal hover and forward flight performance. Next, the biplane wings are designed using simple
lifting line theory. The airframe design is followed by power plant selection and transmission
design. Finally, weight estimation is carried out to complete the design process. The proprotor
design with 24 deg preset angle and -24 deg twist is designed based on 70% weightage to forward flight
and 30% weightage to hovering flight conditions. The operating RPM of the proprotors is reduced
from 3200 during hover to 2000 during forward flight to ensure optimal performance during cruise
flight. The estimated power consumption during forward flight mode is 64% less than that required
for hover, establishing the benefit of this hybrid concept. A proof-of-concept scaled prototype
is fabricated using commercial-off-the-shelf parts. A PID controller is developed and implemented
on the PixHawk board to enable stable hovering flight and attitude tracking.
