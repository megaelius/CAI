Connected vehicles (CVs) have situational awareness that can be exploited for control and optimization
of the powertrain system. While extensive studies have been carried out for energy efficiency improvement
of CVs via eco-driving and planning, the implication of such technologies on the thermal responses
of CVs has not been fully investigated. One of the key challenges in leveraging connectivity for
optimization-based thermal management of CVs is the relatively slow thermal dynamics, which necessitate
the use of a long prediction horizon to achieve the best performance. Long-term prediction of the
CV speed, unlike the V2V/V2I-based short-range prediction, is difficult and error-prone. The
multiple timescales inherent to power and thermal systems call for a variable timescale optimization
framework with access to short- and long-term vehicle speed preview. To this end, a model predictive
controller (MPC) with a multi-range speed preview for integrated power and thermal management
(iPTM) of connected hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is presented in this paper. The MPC is formulated
to manage the power-split between the engine and the battery while enforcing the power and thermal
(engine coolant and catalytic converter temperatures) constraints. The MPC exploits prediction
and optimization over a shorter receding horizon and longer shrinking horizon. Over the longer
shrinking horizon, the vehicle speed estimation is based on the data collected from the connected
vehicles traveling on the same route as the ego-vehicle. Simulation results of applying the MPC
over real-world urban driving cycles in Ann Arbor, MI are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness
and fuel-saving potentials of the proposed iPTM strategy under the uncertainty associated with
long-term predictions of the CV's speed.
