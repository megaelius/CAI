We give the first linear kernels for Dominating Set and Connected Dominating Set problems on graphs
excluding a fixed graph H as a topological minor. In other words, we give polynomial time algorithms
that, for a given H-topological-minor-free graph G and a positive integer k, output an H-topological-minor-free
graph G' on O(k) vertices such that G has a (connected) dominating set of size k if and only if G' has.
Our results extend the known classes of graphs on which Dominating Set and Connected Dominating
Set problems admit linear kernels. Prior to our work, it was known that these prob- lems admit linear
kernels on graphs excluding a fixed apex graph H as a minor. Moreover, for Dominating Set, a kernel
of size k^c(H), where c(H) is a constant depending on the size of H, follows from a more general result
on the kernelization of Dominating Set on graphs of bounded degeneracy. Alon and Gutner asked explicitly,
whether one can obtain a linear kernel for Dominating Set on H-minor-free graphs. We answer this
question in affirmative and in fact prove a more general result. For Connected Dominating Set no
polynomial kernel even on H-minor-free graphs was known prior to our work. On the negative side,
it is known that Connected Dominating Set on 2-degenerated graphs does not admit a polynomial kernel
unless coNP \subseteq NP/poly. Our kernelization algorithm is based on a non-trivial combination
of the following ingredients The structural theorem of Grohe and Marx [STOC 2012] for graphs excluding
a fixed graph H as a topological subgraph; Our results are based on a generic reduction rule producing
an equivalent instance (in case the input graph is H-minor-free) of the problem with treewidth O(sqrt{k}).
