Like termination, confluence is a central property of rewrite systems. Unlike for termination,
however, there exists no known complexity hierarchy for confluence. In this paper we investigate
whether the decreasing diagrams technique can be used to obtain such a hierarchy. The decreasing
diagrams technique is one of the strongest and most versatile methods for proving confluence of
abstract rewrite systems. It is complete for countable systems, and it has many well-known confluence
criteria as corollaries. So what makes decreasing diagrams so powerful? In contrast to other confluence
techniques, decreasing diagrams employ a labelling of the steps with labels from a well-founded
order in order to conclude confluence of the underlying unlabelled relation. Hence it is natural
to ask how the size of the label set influences the strength of the technique. In particular, what
class of abstract rewrite systems can be proven confluent using decreasing diagrams restricted
to 1 label, 2 labels, 3 labels, and so on? Surprisingly, we find that two labels suffice for proving
confluence for every abstract rewrite system having the cofinality property, thus in particular
for every confluent, countable system. Secondly, we show that this result stands in sharp contrast
to the situation for commutation of rewrite relations, where the hierarchy does not collapse. Thirdly,
investigating the possibility of a confluence hierarchy, we determine the first-order (non-)definability
of the notion of confluence and related properties, using techniques from finite model theory.
We find that in particular Hanf's theorem is fruitful for elegant proofs of undefinability of properties
of abstract rewrite systems.
