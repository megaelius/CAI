Graphic Design encompasses a wide range of activities from the design of traditional print media
(e.g., books and posters) to site-specific (e.g., signage systems) and electronic media (e.g.,
interfaces). Its practice always explores the new possibilities of information and communication
technologies. Therefore, interactivity and participation have become key features in the design
process. Even in traditional print media, graphic designers are trying to enhance user experience
and exploring new interaction models. Moving posters are an example of this. This type of posters
combine the specific features of motion and print worlds in order to produce attractive forms of
communication that explore and exploit the potential of digital screens. In our opinion, the next
step towards the integration of moving posters with the surroundings, where they operate, is incorporating
data from the environment, which also enables the seamless participation of the audience. As such,
the adoption of computer vision techniques for moving poster design becomes a natural approach.
Following this line of thought, we present a system wherein computer vision techniques are used
to shape a moving poster. Although it is still a work in progress, the system is already able to sense
the surrounding physical environment and translate the collected data into graphical information.
The data is gathered from the environment in two ways: (1) directly using motion tracking; and (2)
indirectly via contextual ambient data. In this sense, each user interaction with the system results
in a different experience and in a unique poster design.
