Understanding correlation judgement is important to designing effective visualizations of bivariate
data. Prior work on correlation perception has not considered how factors including prior beliefs
and uncertainty representation impact such judgements. The present work focuses on the impact
of uncertainty communication when judging bivariate visualizations. Specifically, we model
how users update their beliefs about variable relationships after seeing a scatterplot with and
without uncertainty representation. To model and evaluate the belief updating, we present three
studies. Study 1 focuses on a proposed ''Line + Cone'' visual elicitation method for capturing users'
beliefs in an accurate and intuitive fashion. The findings reveal that our proposed method of belief
solicitation reduces complexity and accurately captures the users' uncertainty about a range
of bivariate relationships. Study 2 leverages the ``Line + Cone'' elicitation method to measure
belief updating on the relationship between different sets of variables when seeing correlation
visualization with and without uncertainty representation. We compare changes in users beliefs
to the predictions of Bayesian cognitive models which provide normative benchmarks for how users
should update their prior beliefs about a relationship in light of observed data. The findings from
Study 2 revealed that one of the visualization conditions with uncertainty communication led to
users being slightly more confident about their judgement compared to visualization without uncertainty
information. Study 3 builds on findings from Study 2 and explores differences in belief update when
the bivariate visualization is congruent or incongruent with users' prior belief. Our results
highlight the effects of incorporating uncertainty representation, and the potential of measuring
belief updating on correlation judgement with Bayesian cognitive models.
