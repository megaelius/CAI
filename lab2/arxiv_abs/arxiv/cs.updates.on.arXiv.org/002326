Although deep convolutional neural network has been proved to efficiently eliminate the coding
artifacts caused by the coarse quantization of traditional codec, it's difficult to train any neural
network in front of the encoder for gradient's back-propagation. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
image compression framework based on convolutional neural network to resolve the problem of non-differentiability
of the quantization function in the standard codec. First, the feature description neural network
is used to get a valid description in the low-dimension space with respect to the ground-truth image
so that the amount of image data is greatly reduced for storage or transmission. After image's valid
description, standard image codec such as JPEG is leveraged to further compress image, which leads
to image's great distortion and compression artifacts, especially blocking artifacts, detail
missing, blurring, and ringing artifacts. Then, we use a post-processing neural network to remove
these artifacts. Due to the challenge of directly learning a non-linear function for a standard
codec based on convolutional neural network, we propose to learn a virtual codec neural network
to approximate the projection from valid description image to the post-processed compressed image,
so that the gradient could be efficiently back-propagated from the post-processing neural networks
to the feature description neural network during training. Meanwhile, an advanced learning algorithm
is proposed to train our deep neural networks for compression. Obviously, the priority of the proposed
method is compatible with standard existing codecs and our learning strategy can be easily extended
into these codecs based on convolutional neural network. Experimental results have demonstrated
the advances of the proposed method as compared to several state-of-the-art approaches, especially
at very low bit-rate.
