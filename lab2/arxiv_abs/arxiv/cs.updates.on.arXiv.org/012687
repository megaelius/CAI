Wireless networks are vulnerable to adversarial jamming due to the open nature of the communication
medium. To thwart such malicious behavior, researchers have proposed resource competitive analysis.
In this framework, sending, listening, or jamming on one channel for one time slot costs one unit
of energy. The adversary can employ arbitrary jamming strategy to disrupt communication, but has
a limited energy budget $T$. The honest nodes, on the other hand, aim to accomplish the distributed
computing task in concern with a spending of $o(T)$. In this paper, we focus on solving the broadcast
problem, in which a single source node wants to disseminate a message to all other $n-1$ nodes. Previous
work have shown, in single-hop single-channel scenario, each node can receive the message in $\tilde{O}(T+n)$
time, while spending only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T/n}+1)$ energy. If $C$ channels are available, then
the time complexity can be reduced by a factor of $C$, without increasing nodes' cost. However, these
multi-channel algorithms only work for certain values of $n$ and $C$, and can only tolerate an oblivious
adversary. We develop two new resource competitive algorithms for the broadcast problem. They
work for arbitrary $n,C$ values, require minimal prior knowledge, and can tolerate a powerful adaptive
adversary. In both algorithms, each node's runtime is dominated by the term $O(T/C)$, and each node's
energy cost is dominated by the term $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T/n})$. The time complexity is asymptotically
optimal, while the energy complexity is near optimal in some cases. We use "epidemic broadcast"
to achieve time efficiency and resource competitiveness, and employ the coupling technique in
the analysis to handle the adaptivity of the adversary. These tools might be of independent interest,
and can potentially be applied in the design and analysis of other resource competitive algorithms.
