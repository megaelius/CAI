New technologies are adapted to made progress in healthcare especially for independent livings.
Medication at distance is leading to integrate technologies with medical. Machine learning methods
in collaboration with wearable sensor network technology are used to find hidden patterns in data,
detect patient movements, observe habits of patient, analyze clinical data of patient, find intention
of patients and make decision on the bases of gathered data. This research performs comparative
study on non-clinical systems in healthcare for independent livings. In this study, these systems
are sub-divided w.r.t their working into two types: single purpose systems and multi-purpose systems.
Systems that are built for single specific purpose (e.g. detect fall, detect emergent state of chronic
disease patient) and cannot support healthcare generically are known as single purpose systems,
where multi-purpose systems are built to serve for multiple problems (e.g. heart attack etc.) by
using single system. This study analyzes usages of machine learning techniques in healthcare systems
for independent livings. Answer Set Programming (ASP), Artificial Neural Networks, Classification,
Sampling and Rule Based Reasoning etc. are some state of art techniques used to determine emergent
situations and observe changes in patient data. Among all methods, ASP logic is used most widely,
it is due to its feature to deal with incomplete data. It is also observed that system using ANN shows
better accuracy than other systems. It is observed that most of the systems created are for single
purpose. In this work, 10 single purpose systems and 5 multi-purpose systems are studied. There
is need to create more generic systems that can be used for patients with multiple diseases. Also
most of the systems created are prototypical. There is need to create systems that can serve healthcare
services in real world.
