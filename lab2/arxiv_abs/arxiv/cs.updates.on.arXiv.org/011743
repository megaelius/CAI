The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2011), a benchmark for commonsense
reasoning, is a set of 273 expert-crafted pronoun resolution problems originally designed to be
unsolvable for statistical models that rely on selectional preferences or word associations.
However, recent advances in neural language models have already reached around 90% accuracy on
variants of WSC. This raises an important question whether these models have truly acquired robust
commonsense capabilities or whether they rely on spurious biases in the datasets that lead to an
overestimation of the true capabilities of machine commonsense. To investigate this question,
we introduce WinoGrande, a large-scale dataset of 44k problems, inspired by the original WSC design,
but adjusted to improve both the scale and the hardness of the dataset. The key steps of the dataset
construction consist of (1) a carefully designed crowdsourcing procedure, followed by (2) systematic
bias reduction using a novel AfLite algorithm that generalizes human-detectable word associations
to machine-detectable embedding associations. The best state-of-the-art methods on WinoGrande
achieve 59.4-79.1%, which are 15-35% below human performance of 94.0%, depending on the amount
of the training data allowed. Furthermore, we establish new state-of-the-art results on five related
benchmarks - WSC (90.1%), DPR (93.1%), COPA (90.6%), KnowRef (85.6%), and Winogender (97.1%).
These results have dual implications: on one hand, they demonstrate the effectiveness of WinoGrande
when used as a resource for transfer learning. On the other hand, they raise a concern that we are likely
to be overestimating the true capabilities of machine commonsense across all these benchmarks.
We emphasize the importance of algorithmic bias reduction in existing and future benchmarks to
mitigate such overestimation.
