Payment channel networks (PCN) are used in cryptocurrencies to enhance the performance and scalability
of off-chain transactions. Except for opening and closing of a payment channel, no other transaction
requests accepted by a PCN are recorded in the Blockchain. Only the parties which have opened the
channel will know the exact amount of fund left at a given instant. In real scenarios, there might
not exist a single path which can enable transfer of high value payments. For such cases, splitting
up the transaction value across multiple paths is a better approach. While there exists several
approaches which route transactions via several paths, such techniques are quite inefficient,
as the decision on the number of splits must be taken at the initial phase of the routing algorithm
(e.g., SpeedyMurmur [42]). Algorithms which do not consider the residual capacity of each channel
in the network are susceptible to failure. Other approaches leak sensitive information, and are
quite computationally expensive [28]. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme HushRelay
is an efficient privacy preserving routing algorithm, taking into account the funds left in each
channel, while splitting the transaction value across several paths. Comparing the performance
of our algorithm with existing routing schemes on real instances (e.g., Ripple Network), we observed
that HushRelay attains a success ratio of 1, with an execution time of 2.4 sec. However, SpeedyMurmur
[42] attains a success ratio of 0.98 and takes 4.74 sec when the number of landmarks is 6. On testing
our proposed routing algorithm on the Lightning Network, a success ratio of 0.99 is observed, having
an execution time of 0.15 sec, which is 12 times smaller than the time taken by SpeedyMurmur.
