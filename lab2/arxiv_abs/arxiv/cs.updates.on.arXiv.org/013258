The FEAST library package represents an unified framework for solving various family of eigenvalue
problems and achieving accuracy, robustness, high-performance and scalability on parallel architectures.
Its originality lies with a new transformative numerical approach to the traditional eigenvalue
algorithm design - the FEAST algorithm. The algorithm gathers key elements from complex analysis,
numerical linear algebra and approximation theory, to construct an optimal subspace iteration
technique using approximate spectral projectors. FEAST can be used for solving both standard and
generalized forms of the Hermitian or non-Hermitian problems (linear or non-linear), and it belongs
to the family of contour integration eigensolvers. FEAST's main computational task consists of
a numerical quadrature computation that involves solving independent linear systems along a complex
contour, each with multiple right hand sides. In v4.0, FEAST has been reimplemented using an inverse
residual iteration algorithm which enables the linear systems to be solved with very low accuracy
(in single precision) with no impact on the FEAST double precision convergence rate. As a result,
v4.0 is on average 3-4 times faster than v2.1 and v3.0 using new default optimization parameters
(v2.1 has been featured as Intel-MKL's principal HPC eigensolver since 2013). v4.0 also implements
new important features such as IFEAST (using Inexact Iterative solver), Non-linear polynomial
FEAST, and PFEAST with its 3-MPI levels of parallelism. FEAST is both a comprehensive library package,
and an easy to use software. It includes flexible reverse communication interfaces and ready to
use driver interfaces for dense, banded and sparse systems.
