A central problem in ranking is to design a ranking measure for evaluation of ranking functions.
In this paper we study, from a theoretical perspective, the widely used Normalized Discounted Cumulative
Gain (NDCG)-type ranking measures. Although there are extensive empirical studies of NDCG, little
is known about its theoretical properties. We first show that, whatever the ranking function is,
the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic discount, converges to 1 as the number of items to rank
goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result is very surprising. It seems to imply that NDCG cannot
differentiate good and bad ranking functions, contradicting to the empirical success of NDCG in
many applications. In order to have a deeper understanding of ranking measures in general, we propose
a notion referred to as consistent distinguishability. This notion captures the intuition that
a ranking measure should have such a property: For every pair of substantially different ranking
functions, the ranking measure can decide which one is better in a consistent manner on almost all
datasets. We show that NDCG with logarithmic discount has consistent distinguishability although
it converges to the same limit for all ranking functions. We next characterize the set of all feasible
discount functions for NDCG according to the concept of consistent distinguishability. Specifically
we show that whether NDCG has consistent distinguishability depends on how fast the discount decays,
and 1/r is a critical point. We then turn to the cut-off version of NDCG, i.e., NDCG@k. We analyze the
distinguishability of NDCG@k for various choices of k and the discount functions. Experimental
results on real Web search datasets agree well with the theory.
