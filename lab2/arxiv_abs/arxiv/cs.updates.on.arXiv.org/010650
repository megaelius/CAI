For evolving datasets with continual reports, the composition rule for differential privacy (DP)
dictates that the scale of DP noise must grow linearly with the number of the queries, or that the privacy
budget must be split equally between all the queries, so that the privacy budget across all the queries
remains bounded and consistent with the privacy guarantees. To avoid this drawback of DP, we consider
datasets containing almost periodic time series, composed of periodic components and noisy variations
on top that are independent across periods. Our interest in these datasets is motivated by that,
for reporting on private periodic time series, we do not need to divide the privacy budget across
the entire, possibly infinite, horizon. Instead, for periodic time series, we generate DP reports
for the first period and report the same DP reports periodically. In practice, however, exactly
periodic time series do not exist as the data always contains small variations due to random or uncertain
events. For instance, the energy consumption of a household may repeat the same daily pattern with
slight variations due to minor changes to the habits of the individuals. The underlying periodic
pattern is a function of the private information of the households. It might be desired to protect
the privacy of households by not leaking information about the recurring patterns while the individual
daily variations are almost noise-like with little to no privacy concerns (depending on the situation).
Motivated by this, we define DP for almost periodic datasets and develop a Laplace mechanism for
responding to linear queries. We provide statistical tools for testing the validity of almost periodicity
assumption. We use multiple energy datasets containing smart-meter measurements of households
to validate almost periodicity assumption. We generate DP aggregate reports and investigate their
utility.
