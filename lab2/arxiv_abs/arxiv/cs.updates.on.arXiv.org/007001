We consider a class of sequential network interdiction problem settings where the interdictor
has incomplete initial information about the network while the evader has complete knowledge of
the network including its structure and arc costs. In each decision epoch, the interdictor can block
for the duration of the epoch at most $k$ arcs known to him. By observing the evader's actions, the
interdictor learns about the network structure and costs and thus, can adjust his actions in subsequent
{decision epochs}. It is known from the literature that if the evader is greedy (i.e., she uses the
shortest available path in each decision epoch), then under some assumptions %on the the feedback
generated from the evader's actions, the greedy interdiction policies that block $k$-most vital
arcs in each epoch are efficient and have a finite regret. In this paper, we consider the evader's
perspective and explore strategic evasion policies under the assumption that the interdictor
is greedy. {We first study the theoretical computational complexity of the evader's problem. Then
we derive basic constructive properties of optimal evasion policies for two decision epochs when
the interdictor has no initial information about the network structure. These properties are then
exploited for the design of a heuristic algorithm for a strategic evader in a general setting with
an arbitrary time horizon and any initial information available to the interdictor. Our computational
experiments demonstrate that the proposed heuristic consistently outperforms the greedy evasion
policy on several classes of synthetic network instances under perfect and noisy information feedbacks.
Finally, some interesting insights from our theoretical and computational results conclude the
paper.
