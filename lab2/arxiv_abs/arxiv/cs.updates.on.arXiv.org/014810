Panicle density of cereal crops such as wheat and sorghum is one of the main components for plant breeders
and agronomists in understanding the yield of their crops. To phenotype the panicle density effectively,
researchers agree there is a significant need for computer vision-based object detection techniques.
Especially in recent times, research in deep learning-based object detection shows promising
results in various agricultural studies. However, training such systems usually requires a lot
of bounding-box labeled data. Since crops vary by both environmental and genetic conditions, acquisition
of huge amount of labeled image datasets for each crop is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, to
catalyze the widespread usage of automatic object detection for crop phenotyping, a cost-effective
method to develop such automated systems is essential. We propose a point supervision based active
learning approach for panicle detection in cereal crops. In our approach, the model constantly
interacts with a human annotator by iteratively querying the labels for only the most informative
images, as opposed to all images in a dataset. Our query method is specifically designed for cereal
crops which usually tend to have panicles with low variance in appearance. Our method reduces labeling
costs by intelligently leveraging low-cost weak labels (object centers) for picking the most informative
images for which strong labels (bounding boxes) are required. We show promising results on two publicly
available cereal crop datasets - Sorghum and Wheat. On Sorghum, 6 variants of our proposed method
outperform the best baseline method with more than 55% savings in labeling time. Similarly, on Wheat,
3 variants of our proposed methods outperform the best baseline method with more than 50% of savings
in labeling time.
