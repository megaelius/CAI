Researchers have demonstrated various techniques for fingerprinting and identifying devices.
Previous approaches have identified devices from their network traffic or transmitted signals
while relying on software or operating system specific artifacts (e.g., predictability of protocol
header fields) or characteristics of the underlying protocol (e.g.,frequency offset). As these
constraints can be a hindrance in real-world settings, we introduce a practical, generalizable
approach that offers significant operational value for a variety of scenarios, including as an
additional factor of authentication for preventing impersonation attacks. Our goal is to identify
artifacts in transmitted signals that are caused by a device's unique hardware "imperfections"
without any knowledge about the nature of the signal. We develop RF-DCN, a novel Deep Complex-valued
Neural Network (DCN) that operates on raw RF signals and is completely agnostic of the underlying
applications and protocols. We present two DCN variations: (i) Convolutional DCN (CDCN) for modeling
full signals, and (ii) Recurrent DCN (RDCN) for modeling time series. Our system handles raw I/Q
data from open air captures within a given spectrum window, without knowledge of the modulation
scheme or even the carrier frequencies. While our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our system, especially under challenging conditions where other neural network architectures
break down, we identify additional challenges in signal-based fingerprinting and provide guidelines
for future explorations. Our work lays the foundation for more research within this vast and challenging
space by establishing fundamental directions for using raw RF I/Q data in novel complex-valued
networks.
