We initiate the study of property testing in arbitrary planar graphs. We prove that bipartiteness
can be tested in constant time: for every planar graph $G$ and $\varepsilon>0$, we can distinguish
in constant time between the case that $G$ is bipartite and the case that $G$ is $\varepsilon$-far
from bipartite. The previous bound for this class of graphs was $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$
is the number of vertices, and the constant-time testability was only known for planar graphs with
bounded degree. Our approach extends to arbitrary minor-free graphs. Our algorithm is based on
random walks. The challenge here is to analyze random walks for graphs that have good separators,
i.e., bad expansion. Standard techniques that use a fast convergence of random walks to a uniform
distribution do not work in this case. Informally, our approach is to self-reduce the problem of
finding an odd-length cycle in a multigraph $G$ induced by a collection of cycles to the same problem
on another multigraph $G'$ induced by a set of shorter odd-length cycles, in such a way that when a
random walk finds a cycle in $G'$ with probability $p > 0$, then it does so in $G$ with probability
$\lambda(p)>0$. This reduction is applied until the cycles collapse to self-loops, in which
case they can be easily detected. While the analysis presented in this paper applies only to testing
bipartiteness, we believe that the techniques developed will find applications to testing other
properties in arbitrary planar (or minor-free) graphs, in a similar way as in the past the advances
in testing bipartiteness led to the development of testing algorithms for more complex graph properties.
