Yield estimation and forecasting are of special interest in the field of grapevine breeding and
viticulture. The number of harvested berries per plant is strongly correlated with the resulting
quality. Therefore, early yield forecasting can enable a focused thinning of berries to ensure
a high quality end product. Traditionally yield estimation is done by extrapolating from a small
sample size and by utilizing historic data. Moreover, it needs to be carried out by skilled experts
with much experience in this field. Berry detection in images offers a cheap, fast and non-invasive
alternative to the otherwise time-consuming and subjective on-site analysis by experts. We apply
fully convolutional neural networks on images acquired with the Phenoliner, a field phenotyping
platform. We count single berries in images to avoid the error-prone detection of grapevine clusters.
Clusters are often overlapping and can vary a lot in the size which makes the reliable detection of
them difficult. We address especially the detection of white grapes directly in the vineyard. The
detection of single berries is formulated as a classification task with three classes, namely 'berry',
'edge' and 'background'. A connected component algorithm is applied to determine the number of
berries in one image. We compare the automatically counted number of berries with the manually detected
berries in 60 images showing Riesling plants in vertical shoot positioned trellis (VSP) and semi
minimal pruned hedges (SMPH). We are able to detect berries correctly within the VSP system with
an accuracy of 94.0 \% and for the SMPH system with 85.6 \%.
