The aim of this thesis is to present an extension to the string graphs of Dixon, Duncan and Kissinger
that allows the finite representation of certain infinite families of graphs and graph rewrite
rules, and to demonstrate that a logic can be built on this to allow the formalisation of inductive
proofs in the string diagrams of compact closed and traced symmetric monoidal categories. String
diagrams provide an intuitive method for reasoning about monoidal categories. However, this does
not negate the ability for those using them to make mistakes in proofs. To this end, there is a project
(Quantomatic) to build a proof assistant for string diagrams, at least for those based on categories
with a notion of trace. The development of string graphs has provided a combinatorial formalisation
of string diagrams, laying the foundations for this project. The prevalence of commutative Frobenius
algebras (CFAs) in quantum information theory, a major application area of these diagrams, has
led to the use of variable-arity nodes as a shorthand for normalised networks of Frobenius algebra
morphisms, so-called "spider notation". This notation greatly eases reasoning with CFAs, but
string graphs are inadequate to properly encode this reasoning. This dissertation extends string
graphs to allow for variable-arity nodes to be represented at all, and then introduces !-box notation
(and structures to encode it) to represent string graph equations containing repeated subgraphs,
where the number of repetitions is abitrary. It then demonstrates how we can reason directly about
!-graphs, viewed as (typically infinite) families of string graphs. Of particular note is the presentation
of a form of graph-based induction, allowing the formal encoding of proofs that previously could
only be represented as a mix of string diagrams and explanatory text.
