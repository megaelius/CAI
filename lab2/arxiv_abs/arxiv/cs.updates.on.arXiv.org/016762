We aimed to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform RADAR-base
as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19.
We analysed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices and managed by the RADAR-base from
1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the UK, and the Netherlands. We derived nine
features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, maximum
number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, average
heart rate, sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We performed
Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post-hoc Dunns tests to assess differences in these features
among baseline, pre-, and during-lockdown periods. We also studied behavioural differences by
age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and educational background. We were able to quantify expected
changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices
between pre- and during-lockdown periods. We saw reduced sociality as measured through mobility
features, and increased virtual sociality through phone usage. People were more active on their
phones, spending more time using social media apps, particularly around major news events. Furthermore,
participants had lower heart rate, went to bed later, and slept more. We also found that young people
had longer homestay than older people during lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was
no significant difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low BMI group
walked more. RADAR-base can be used to rapidly quantify and provide a holistic view of behavioural
changes in response to public health interventions as a result of infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19.
