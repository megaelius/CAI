Almost asymptotically tight lower bounds are derived for the I/O complexity $IO\left(n,M\right)$
of a general class of hybrid algorithms computing the product of two integers, each represented
with $n$ digits in a given base $s$, in a two-level storage hierarchy with $M$ words of fast memory,
with different digits stored in different memory words. The considered hybrid algorithm combine
the Toom-Cook-$k$ (or Toom-$k$) fast integer multiplication approach with computational complexity
$\Theta\left(c_kn^{\log_k \left(2k-1\right)}\right)$, and "standard" integer multiplication
algorithms which compute $\Omega\left(n^2\right)$ digit multiplications. We present an $\Omega\left(\left(n/\max\{M,n_0\}\right)^{\log_k
\left(2k-1\right)}\left(\max\{1,n_0/M\}\right)^2M\right)$ lower bound for the I/O complexity
a class of "uniform, non-stationary" hybrid algorithms when executed in a two-level storage hierarchy
with $M$ words of fast memory, where $n_0$ denotes the threshold size of sub-problems which are computed
using standard algorithms with algebraic complexity $\Omega\left(n^2\right)$. The lower bound
is derived for the more general class of "non-uniform, non-stationary" hybrid algorithms which
allow recursive calls to have a different structure, even when they refer to the multiplication
of integers of the same size and in the same recursive level including those where the value of $k$
is allowed to vary with the level of recursion. As some hybrid algorithms from this class execute
a number of I/O operations that is within a $O\left(k^2\right)$ multiplicative term of the corresponding
lower bounds, the proposed lower bounds are almost asymptotically tight and indeed tight for constant
values of $k$. Extensions of the lower bounds for a parallel model with $P$ processors are also discussed.
