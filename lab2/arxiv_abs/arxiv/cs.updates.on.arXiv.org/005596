Advances in supervised learning have enabled accurate prediction in biological systems governed
by complex interactions among biomolecules. However, state-of-the-art predictive algorithms
are typically black-boxes, learning statistical interactions that are difficult to translate
into testable hypotheses. The iterative Random Forest algorithm took a step towards bridging this
gap by providing a computationally tractable procedure to identify the stable, high-order feature
interactions that drive the predictive accuracy of Random Forests (RF). Here we refine the interactions
identified by iRF to explicitly map responses as a function of interacting features. Our method,
signed iRF, describes subsets of rules that frequently occur on RF decision paths. We refer to these
rule subsets as signed interactions. Signed interactions share not only the same set of interacting
features but also exhibit similar thresholding behavior, and thus describe a consistent functional
relationship between interacting features and responses. We describe stable and predictive importance
metrics to rank signed interactions. For each SPIM, we define null importance metrics that characterize
its expected behavior under known structure. We evaluate our proposed approach in biologically
inspired simulations and two case studies: predicting enhancer activity and spatial gene expression
patterns. In the case of enhancer activity, s-iRF recovers one of the few experimentally validated
high-order interactions and suggests novel enhancer elements where this interaction may be active.
In the case of spatial gene expression patterns, s-iRF recovers all 11 reported links in the gap gene
network. By refining the process of interaction recovery, our approach has the potential to guide
mechanistic inquiry into systems whose scale and complexity is beyond human comprehension.
