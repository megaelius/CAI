It remains unknown whether personalized recommendations increase or decrease the diversity of
content people consume. We present results from a randomized field experiment on Spotify testing
the effect of personalized recommendations on consumption diversity. In the experiment, both
control and treatment users were given podcast recommendations, with the sole aim of increasing
podcast consumption. Treatment users' recommendations were personalized based on their music
listening history, whereas control users were recommended popular podcasts among users in their
demographic group. We find that, on average, the treatment increased podcast streams by 28.90%.
However, the treatment also decreased the average individual-level diversity of podcast streams
by 11.51%, and increased the aggregate diversity of podcast streams by 5.96%, indicating that personalized
recommendations have the potential to create patterns of consumption that are homogenous within
and diverse across users, a pattern reflecting Balkanization. Our results provide evidence of
an "engagement-diversity trade-off" when recommendations are optimized solely to drive consumption:
while personalized recommendations increase user engagement, they also affect the diversity
of consumed content. This shift in consumption diversity can affect user retention and lifetime
value, and impact the optimal strategy for content producers. We also observe evidence that our
treatment affected streams from sections of Spotify's app not directly affected by the experiment,
suggesting that exposure to personalized recommendations can affect the content that users consume
organically. We believe these findings highlight the need for academics and practitioners to continue
investing in personalization methods that explicitly take into account the diversity of content
recommended.
