Visual object tracking is an important function in many real-time video surveillance applications,
such as localization and spatio-temporal recognition of persons. In real-world applications,
an object detector and tracker must interact on a periodic basis to discover new objects, and thereby
to initiate tracks. Periodic interactions with the detector can also allow the tracker to validate
and/or update its object template with new bounding boxes. However, bounding boxes provided by
a state-of-the-art detector are noisy, due to changes in appearance, background and occlusion,
which can cause the tracker to drift. Moreover, CNN-based detectors can provide a high level of accuracy
at the expense of computational complexity, so interactions should be minimized for real-time
applications. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to manage detector-tracker interactions
for trackers from the Siamese-FC family. By integrating a change detection mechanism into a deep
Siamese-FC tracker, its template can be adapted in response to changes in a target's appearance
that lead to drifts during tracking. An abrupt change detection triggers an update of tracker template
using the bounding box produced by the detector, while in the case of a gradual change, the detector
is used to update an evolving set of templates for robust matching. Experiments were performed using
state-of-the-art Siamese-FC trackers and the YOLOv3 detector on a subset of videos from the OTB-100
dataset that mimic video surveillance scenarios. Results highlight the importance for reliable
VOT of using accurate detectors. They also indicate that our adaptive Siamese trackers are robust
to noisy object detections, and can significantly improve the performance of Siamese-FC tracking.
