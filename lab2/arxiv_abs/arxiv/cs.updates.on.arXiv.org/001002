Analyzing a large data set of publications drawn from the most competitive journals in the natural
and social sciences we show that research careers exhibit the broad distributions of individual
achievement characteristic of systems in which cumulative advantage plays a key role. While most
researchers are personally aware of the competition implicit in the publication process, little
is known about the levels of inequality at the level of individual researchers. We analyzed both
productivity and impact measures for a large set of researchers publishing in high-impact journals.
For each researcher cohort we calculated Gini inequality coefficients, with average Gini values
around 0.48 for total publications and 0.73 for total citations. For perspective, these observed
values are well in excess of the inequality levels observed for personal income in developing countries.
Investigating possible sources of this inequality, we identify two potential mechanisms that
act at the level of the individual that may play defining roles in the emergence of the broad productivity
and impact distributions found in science. First, we show that the average time interval between
a researcher's successive publications in top journals decreases with each subsequent publication.
Second, after controlling for the time dependent features of citation distributions, we compare
the citation impact of subsequent publications within a researcher's publication record. We find
that as researchers continue to publish in top journals, there is more likely to be a decreasing trend
in the relative citation impact with each subsequent publication. This pattern highlights the
difficulty of repeatedly publishing high-impact research and the intriguing possibility that
confirmation bias plays a role in the evaluation of scientific careers.
