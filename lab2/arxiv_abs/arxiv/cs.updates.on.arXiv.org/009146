The purpose of the automatic dependent surveillance broadcast (ADS-B) technology is to serve as
a replacement for the current radar-based, air traffic control systems. Despite the considerable
time and resources devoted to designing and developing the system, the ADS-B is well known for its
lack of security mechanisms. Attempts to address these security vulnerabilities have been made
in previous studies by modifying the protocol's current architecture or by using additional hardware
components. These solutions, however, are considered impractical because of 1) the complex regulatory
process involving avionic systems, 2) the high costs of using hardware components, and 3) the fact
that the ADS-B system itself is already deployed in most aircraft and ground stations around the
world. In this paper, we propose VizADS-B, an alternative software-based security solution for
detecting anomalous ADS-B messages, which does not require any alteration of the current ADS-B
architecture or the addition of sensors. According to the proposed method, the information obtained
from all aircraft within a specific geographical area is aggregated and represented as a stream
of images. Then, a convolutional LSTM encoder-decoder model is used for analyzing and detecting
anomalies in the sequences of images. In addition, we propose an explainability technique, designed
specifically for convolutional LSTM encoder-decoder models, which is used for providing operative
information to the pilot as a visual indicator of a detected anomaly, thus allowing the pilot to make
relevant decisions. We evaluated our proposed method on five datasets by injecting and subsequently
identifying five different attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that most of the attacks can be
detected based on spatio-temporal anomaly detection approach.
