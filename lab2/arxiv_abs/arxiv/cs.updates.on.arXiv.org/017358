Accurate local fiber orientation distribution (FOD) modeling based on diffusion magnetic resonance
imaging (dMRI) capable of resolving complex fiber configurations benefit from specific acquisition
protocols that impose a high number of gradient directions (b-vecs), a high maximum b-value (b-vals)
and multiple b-values (multi-shell). However, acquisition time is limited in a clinical setting
and commercial scanners may not provide robust state-of-the-art dMRI sequences. Therefore, dMRI
is often acquired as single-shell (SS) (single b-value). Here, we learn improved FODs for commercially
acquired dMRI. We evaluate the use of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to regress multi-shell
FOS representations from single-shell representations, using the spherical harmonics basis
obtained from constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) to model FODs. We use U-Net and HighResNet
3D CNN architectures and data from the publicly available Human Connectome Dataset and a dataset
acquired at National Hospital For Neurology and Neurosurgery Queen Square. We evaluate how well
the CNN models can resolve local fiber orientation 1) when training and testing on datasets with
same dMRI acquisition protocol; 2) when testing on dataset with a different dMRI acquisition protocol
than used training the CNN models; and 3) when testing on datasets with a fewer number dMRI gradient
directions than used training the CNN models. Our approach may enable robust CSD model estimation
on dMRI acquisition protocols which are single shell and with a few gradient directions, reducing
acquisition times, and thus, facilitating translation to time-limited clinical environments.
