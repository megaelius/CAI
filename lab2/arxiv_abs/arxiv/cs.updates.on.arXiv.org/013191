The primary characteristic of robust speaker representations is that they are invariant to factors
of variability not related to speaker identity. Disentanglement of speaker representations is
one of the techniques used to improve robustness of speaker representations to both intrinsic factors
that are acquired during speech production (e.g., emotion, lexical content) and extrinsic factors
that are acquired during signal capture (e.g., channel, noise). Disentanglement in neural speaker
representations can be achieved either in a supervised fashion with annotations of the nuisance
factors (factors not related to speaker identity) or in an unsupervised fashion without labels
of the factors to be removed. In either case it is important to understand the extent to which the various
factors of variability are entangled in the representations. In this work, we examine speaker representations
with and without unsupervised disentanglement for the amount of information they capture related
to a suite of factors. Using classification experiments we provide empirical evidence that disentanglement
reduces the information with respect to nuisance factors from speaker representations, while
retaining speaker information. This is further validated by speaker verification experiments
on the VOiCES corpus in several challenging acoustic conditions. We also show improved robustness
in speaker verification tasks using data augmentation during training of disentangled speaker
embeddings. Finally, based on our findings, we provide insights into the factors that can be effectively
separated using the unsupervised disentanglement technique and discuss potential future directions.
