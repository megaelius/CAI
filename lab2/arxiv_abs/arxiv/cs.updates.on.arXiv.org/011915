Navigation applications relying on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are limited
in indoor environments and GNSS-denied outdoor terrains such as dense urban or forests. In this
paper, we present a novel accurate, robust and low-cost GNSS-independent navigation system, which
is composed of a monocular camera and Ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers. Visual techniques have
gained excellent results when computing the incremental motion of the sensor, and UWB methods have
proved to provide promising localization accuracy due to the high time resolution of the UWB ranging
signals. However, the monocular visual techniques with scale ambiguity are not suitable for applications
requiring metric results, and UWB methods assume that the positions of the UWB transceiver anchor
are pre-calibrated and known, thus precluding their application in unknown and challenging environments.
To this end, we advocate leveraging the monocular camera and UWB to create a map of visual features
and UWB anchors. We propose a visual-UWB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm
which tightly combines visual and UWB measurements to form a joint non-linear optimization problem
on Lie-Manifold. The 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) state of the vehicles and the map are estimated by
minimizing the UWB ranging errors and landmark reprojection errors. Our navigation system starts
with an exploratory task which performs the real-time visual-UWB SLAM to obtain the global map,
then the navigation task by reusing this global map. The tasks can be performed by different vehicles
in terms of equipped sensors and payload capability in a heterogeneous team. We validate our system
on the public datasets, achieving typical centimeter accuracy and 0.1% scale error.
