Autonomous agents must be able to safely interact with other vehicles to integrate into urban environments.
The safety of these agents is dependent on their ability to predict collisions with other vehicles'
future trajectories for replanning and collision avoidance. The information needed to predict
collisions can be learned from previously observed vehicle trajectories in a specific environment,
generating a traffic model. The learned traffic model can then be incorporated as prior knowledge
into any trajectory estimation method being used in this environment. This work presents a Gaussian
process based probabilistic traffic model that is used to quantify vehicle behaviors in an intersection.
The Gaussian process model provides estimates for the average vehicle trajectory, while also capturing
the variance between the different paths a vehicle may take in the intersection. The method is demonstrated
on a set of time-series position trajectories. These trajectories are reconstructed by removing
object recognition errors and missed frames that may occur due to data source processing. To create
the intersection traffic model, the reconstructed trajectories are clustered based on their source
and destination lanes. For each cluster, a Gaussian process model is created to capture the average
behavior and the variance of the cluster. To show the applicability of the Gaussian model, the test
trajectories are classified with only partial observations. Performance is quantified by the
number of observations required to correctly classify the vehicle trajectory. Both the intersection
traffic modeling computations and the classification procedure are timed. These times are presented
as results and demonstrate that the model can be constructed in a reasonable amount of time and the
classification procedure can be used for online applications.
