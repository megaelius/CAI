The reliability of a Boolean Conjunctive Query (CQ) over a tuple-independent probabilistic database
is the probability that the CQ is satisfied when the tuples of the database are sampled one by one,
independently, with their associated probability. For queries without self-joins (repeated
relation symbols), the data complexity of this problem is fully characterized in a known dichotomy:
reliability can be computed in polynomial time for hierarchical queries, and is #P-hard for non-hierarchical
queries. Hierarchical queries also characterize the tractability of queries for other tasks:
having read-once lineage formulas, supporting insertion/deletion updates to the database in
constant time, and having a tractable computation of tuples' Shapley and Banzhaf values. In this
work, we investigate a fundamental counting problem for CQs without self-joins: how many sets of
facts from the input database satisfy the query? This is a simpler, uniform variant of the query reliability
problem, where the probability of every tuple is required to be 1/2. Of course, for hierarchical
queries, uniform reliability is in polynomial time, like the reliability problem. However, it
is an open question whether being hierarchical is necessary for the uniform reliability problem
to be in polynomial time. In fact, the complexity of the problem has been unknown even for the simplest
non-hierarchical CQs without self-joins. We solve this open question by showing that uniform reliability
is #P-complete for every non-hierarchical CQ without self-joins. Hence, we establish that being
hierarchical also characterizes the tractability of unweighted counting of the satisfying tuple
subsets. We also consider the generalization to query reliability where all tuples of the same relation
have the same probability, and give preliminary results on the complexity of this problem.
