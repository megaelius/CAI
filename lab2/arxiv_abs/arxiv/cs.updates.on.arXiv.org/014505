With the recent trend of "network softwarisation", enabled by emerging technologies such as Software-Defined
Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), system administrators of data centres
and enterprise networks have started replacing dedicated hardware-based middleboxes with virtualised
network functions running on servers and end hosts. This radical change has facilitated the provisioning
of advanced and flexible network services, ultimately helping system administrators and network
operators to cope with the rapid changes in service requirements and networking workloads. This
thesis investigates the challenges of provisioning network security services in "softwarised"
networks, where the security of residential and business users can be provided by means of sets of
software-based network functions running on high performance servers or on commodity compute
devices. The study is approached from the perspective of the telecom operator, whose goal is to protect
the customers from network threats and, at the same time, maximize the number of provisioned services,
and thereby revenue. Specifically, the overall aim of the research presented in this thesis is proposing
novel techniques for optimising the resource usage of software-based security services, hence
for increasing the chances for the operator to accommodate more service requests while respecting
the desired level of network security of its customers. In this direction, the contributions of
this thesis are the following: (i) a solution for the dynamic provisioning of security services
that minimises the utilisation of computing and network resources, and (ii) novel methods based
on Deep Learning and Linux kernel technologies for reducing the CPU usage of software-based security
network functions, with specific focus on the defence against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attacks.
