Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is endemic in people who inject drugs (PWID), with prevalence
estimates above 60 percent for PWID in the United States. Previous modeling studies suggest that
direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment can lower overall prevalence in this population, but treatment
is often delayed until the onset of advanced liver disease (fibrosis stage 3 or later) due to cost.
Lower cost interventions featuring syringe access (SA) and medically assisted treatment (MAT)
for addiction are known to be less costly, but have shown mixed results in lowering HCV rates below
current levels. Little is known about the potential synergistic effects of combining DAA and MAT
treatment, and large-scale tests of combined interventions are rare. While simulation experiments
can reveal likely long-term effects, most prior simulations have been performed on closed populations
of model agents--a scenario quite different from the open, mobile populations known to most health
agencies. This paper uses data from the Centers for Disease Control's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance
project, IDU round 3, collected in New York City in 2012 by the New York City Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene to parameterize simulations of open populations. Our results show that, in an open
population, SA/MAT by itself has only small effects on HCV prevalence, while DAA treatment by itself
can significantly lower both HCV and HCV-related advanced liver disease prevalence. More importantly,
the simulation experiments suggest that cost effective synergistic combinations of the two strategies
can dramatically reduce HCV incidence. We conclude that adopting SA/MAT implementations alongside
DAA interventions can play a critical role in reducing the long-term consequences of ongoing infection.
