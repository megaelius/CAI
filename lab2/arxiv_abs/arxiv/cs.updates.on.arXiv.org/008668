Software development as done using modern methodologies and source control management systems,
has been often established as an example of self-organization, with code growing and evolving organically,
through activities that do not stem from entralized power, leader or directives. The main challenge
in proving these claims is that self organization cannot be detected through direct observation,
but through measurements on the system, looking for hints such as the existence of power laws over
some features, such as the size of changes over time. The problem we intend to tackle in this paper
is to establish a methodology for checking, for a chosen set of repositories we had already measured
in the past, if the claims about power laws actually hold from a precise mathematical point of view,
since, although shown as pervasive in the software engineering literature (and others), power
laws are more elusive than they might seem at first sight. For that reason, in this paper we present
a statistically accurate set of tests that will help us decide, from the way repositories are changing,
if they are really distributed by a power law, which could indicate us the existence of a state reached
via self-organization, or actually, how accurately a power law fits the observed distribution
of the size of changes of commits in git repositories of 16 open source repositories. We revisit one
of the most representative papers of these observations to reevaluate its results and compare them
with the current status of the repositories analyzed in it, trying to elucidate if there has been
any change in the possible presence, or not, of a power law.
