Image foreground extraction is a classical problem in image processing and vision, with a large
range of applications. In this dissertation, we focus on the extraction of text and graphics in mixed-content
images, and design novel approaches for various aspects of this problem. We first propose a sparse
decomposition framework, which models the background by a subspace containing smooth basis vectors,
and foreground as a sparse and connected component. We then formulate an optimization framework
to solve this problem, by adding suitable regularizations to the cost function to promote the desired
characteristics of each component. We present two techniques to solve the proposed optimization
problem, one based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and the other one based
on robust regression. Promising results are obtained for screen content image segmentation using
the proposed algorithm. We then propose a robust subspace learning algorithm for the representation
of the background component using training images that could contain both background and foreground
components, as well as noise. With the learnt subspace for the background, we can further improve
the segmentation results, compared to using a fixed subspace. Lastly, we investigate a different
class of signal/image decomposition problem, where only one signal component is active at each
signal element. In this case, besides estimating each component, we need to find their supports,
which can be specified by a binary mask. We propose a mixed-integer programming problem, that jointly
estimates the two components and their supports through an alternating optimization scheme. We
show the application of this algorithm on various problems, including image segmentation, video
motion segmentation, and also separation of text from textured images.
