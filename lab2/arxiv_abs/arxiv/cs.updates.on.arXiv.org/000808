Highly dynamic networks rarely offer end-to-end connectivity at a given time. Yet, connectivity
in these networks can be established over time and space, based on temporal analogues of multi-hop
paths (also called {\em journeys}). Attempting to optimize the selection of the journeys in these
networks naturally leads to the study of three cases: shortest (minimum hop), fastest (minimum
duration), and foremost (earliest arrival) journeys. Efficient centralized algorithms exists
to compute all cases, when the full knowledge of the network evolution is given. In this paper, we
study the {\em distributed} counterparts of these problems, i.e. shortest, fastest, and foremost
broadcast with termination detection (TDB), with minimal knowledge on the topology. We show that
the feasibility of each of these problems requires distinct features on the evolution, through
identifying three classes of dynamic graphs wherein the problems become gradually feasible: graphs
in which the re-appearance of edges is {\em recurrent} (class R), {\em bounded-recurrent} (B),
or {\em periodic} (P), together with specific knowledge that are respectively $n$ (the number of
nodes), $\Delta$ (a bound on the recurrence time), and $p$ (the period). In these classes it is not
required that all pairs of nodes get in contact -- only that the overall {\em footprint} of the graph
is connected over time. Our results, together with the strict inclusion between $P$, $B$, and $R$,
implies a feasibility order among the three variants of the problem, i.e. TDB[foremost] requires
weaker assumptions on the topology dynamics than TDB[shortest], which itself requires less than
TDB[fastest]. Reversely, these differences in feasibility imply that the computational powers
of $R_n$, $B_\Delta$, and $P_p$ also form a strict hierarchy.
