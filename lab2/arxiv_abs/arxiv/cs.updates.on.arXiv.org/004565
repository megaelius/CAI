Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely applied in various real-world
applications. It can learn the model adaptively and be better fit for special requirements of different
tasks. Many factors can affect the performance of the machine learning process, among which diversity
of the machine learning is an important one. Generally, a good machine learning system is composed
of plentiful training data, a good model training process, and an accurate inference. The diversity
could help each procedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training
data ensures the data contain enough discriminative information, diversity of the learned model
(diversity in parameters of each model or diversity in models) makes each parameter/model capture
unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can provide multiple choices each
of which corresponds to a plausible result. However, there is no systematical analysis of the diversification
in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically summarize the methods to make data
diversification, model diversification, and inference diversification in machine learning
process, respectively. In addition, the typical applications where the diversity technology
improved the machine learning performances have been surveyed, including the remote sensing imaging
tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation, object detection, topic
modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some challenges of diversity technology in machine learning
and point out some directions in future work. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the
diversity technology in machine learning tasks, and hence can help design and learn more effective
models for specific tasks.
