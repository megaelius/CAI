Capturing the dynamical properties of time series concisely as interpretable feature vectors
can enable efficient clustering and classification for time-series applications across science
and industry. Selecting an appropriate feature-based representation of time series for a given
application can be achieved through systematic comparison across a comprehensive time-series
feature library, such as those in the hctsa toolbox. However, this approach is computationally
expensive and involves evaluating many similar features, limiting the widespread adoption of
feature-based representations of time series for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce
a method to infer small sets of time-series features that (i) exhibit strong classification performance
across a given collection of time-series problems, and (ii) are minimally redundant. Applying
our method to a set of 93 time-series classification datasets (containing over 147000 time series)
and using a filtered version of the hctsa feature library (4791 features), we introduce a generically
useful set of 22 CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics, catch22. This dimensionality reduction,
from 4791 to 22, is associated with an approximately 1000-fold reduction in computation time and
near linear scaling with time-series length, despite an average reduction in classification accuracy
of just 7%. catch22 captures a diverse and interpretable signature of time series in terms of their
properties, including linear and non-linear autocorrelation, successive differences, value
distributions and outliers, and fluctuation scaling properties. We provide an efficient implementation
of catch22, accessible from many programming environments, that facilitates feature-based time-series
analysis for scientific, industrial, financial and medical applications using a common language
of interpretable time-series properties.
