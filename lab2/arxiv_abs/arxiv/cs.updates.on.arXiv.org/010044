This paper investigates ground-aerial uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) cellular
networks. A rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) user and multiple ground users (GUEs) are
served by ground base stations (GBSs) by utilizing uplink NOMA protocol. The UAV is dispatched to
upload specific information bits to each target GBSs. Specifically, our goal is to minimize the
UAV mission completion time by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and UAV-GBS association order
while taking into account the UAV's interference to non-associated GBSs. The formulated problem
is a mixed integer non-convex problem and involves infinite variables. To tackle this problem,
we efficiently check the feasibility of the formulated problem by utilizing graph theory and topology
theory. Next, we prove that the optimal UAV trajectory needs to satisfy the \emph{fly-hover-fly}
structure. With this insight, we first design an efficient solution with predefined hovering locations
by leveraging graph theory techniques. Furthermore, we propose an iterative UAV trajectory design
by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, which is guaranteed to coverage
to a locally optimal solution. We demonstrate that the two proposed designs exhibit polynomial
time complexity. Finally, numerical results show that: 1) the SCA based design outperforms the
fly-hover-fly based design; 2) the UAV mission completion time is significantly minimized with
proposed NOMA schemes compared with the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme; 3) the increase
of GUEs' quality of service (QoS) requirements will increase the UAV mission completion time.
