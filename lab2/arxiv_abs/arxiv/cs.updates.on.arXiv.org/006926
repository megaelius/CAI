Recent transportation network studies on uncertainty and reliability call for modeling the probabilistic
O-D demand and probabilistic network flow. Making the best use of day-to-day traffic data collected
over many years, this paper develops a novel theoretical framework for estimating the mean and variance/covariance
matrix of O-D demand considering the day-to-day variation induced by travelers' independent route
choices. It also estimates the probability distributions of link/path flow and their travel cost
where the variance stems from three sources, O-D demand, route choice and unknown errors. The framework
estimates O-D demand mean and variance/covariance matrix iteratively, also known as iterative
generalized least squares (IGLS) in statistics. Lasso regularization is employed to obtain sparse
covariance matrix for better interpretation and computational efficiency. Though the probabilistic
O-D estimation (ODE) works with a much larger solution space than the deterministic ODE, we show
that its estimator for O-D demand mean is no worse than the best possible estimator by an error that
reduces with the increase in sample size. The probabilistic ODE is examined on two small networks
and two real-world large-scale networks. The solution converges quickly under the IGLS framework.
In all those experiments, the results of the probabilistic ODE are compelling, satisfactory and
computationally plausible. Lasso regularization on the covariance matrix estimation leans to
underestimate most of variance/covariance entries. A proper Lasso penalty ensures a good trade-off
between bias and variance of the estimation.
