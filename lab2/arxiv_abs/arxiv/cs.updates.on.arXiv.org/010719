We propose a strong physical unclonable function (PUF) that is provably secure against machine
learning (ML) attacks with both classical and quantum computers. The security is derived from cryptographic
hardness of learning decryption functions of semantically secure public-key cryptosystems within
the probably approximately correct framework. The proposed lattice PUF compactly realizes the
decryption function of the learning-with-errors (LWE) public-key cryptosystem as the core block.
The lattice PUF is lightweight and fully digital. It is constructed using a weak PUF, as a physically
obfuscated key (POK), an LWE decryption function block, a pseudo-random number generator in the
form of a linear-feedback shift register, a self-incrementing counter, and a control block. The
POK provides the secret key of the LWE decryption function. A fuzzy extractor is utilized to ensure
stability of the POK. The proposed lattice PUF significantly improves upon a direct implementation
of LWE decryption function in terms of challenge transfer cost by exploiting distributional relaxations
allowed by recent work in space-efficient LWEs. To prevent an active attack in which arbitrary challenges
can be submitted, the value of a self-incrementing counter is embedded into the challenge seed.
We construct a lattice PUF that realizes a challenge-response pair space of size 2^136, requires
1160 POK bits, and guarantees 128-bit ML resistance. Assuming a bit error rate of 5% for SRAM-based
POK, 6.5K SRAM cells are needed. The PUF shows excellent uniformity, uniqueness, and reliability.
We implement the PUF on a Spartan 6 FPGA. It requires only 4545 slices for the lattice PUF proper, and
233 slices for the fuzzy extractor.
