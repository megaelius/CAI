The sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) is a new population-based meta-heuristic algorithm. In addition
to exploiting sine and cosine functions to perform local and global searches (hence the name sine-cosine),
the SCA introduces several random and adaptive parameters to facilitate the search process. Although
it shows promising results, the search process of the SCA is vulnerable to local minima/maxima due
to the adoption of a fixed switch probability and the bounded magnitude of the sine and cosine functions
(from -1 to 1). In this paper, we propose a new hybrid Q-learning sine-cosine- based strategy, called
the Q-learning sine-cosine algorithm (QLSCA). Within the QLSCA, we eliminate the switching probability.
Instead, we rely on the Q-learning algorithm (based on the penalty and reward mechanism) to dynamically
identify the best operation during runtime. Additionally, we integrate two new operations (L\'evy
flight motion and crossover) into the QLSCA to facilitate jumping out of local minima/maxima and
enhance the solution diversity. To assess its performance, we adopt the QLSCA for the combinatorial
test suite minimization problem. Experimental results reveal that the QLSCA is statistically
superior with regard to test suite size reduction compared to recent state-of-the-art strategies,
including the original SCA, the particle swarm test generator (PSTG), adaptive particle swarm
optimization (APSO) and the cuckoo search strategy (CS) at the 95% confidence level. However, concerning
the comparison with discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO), there is no significant difference
in performance at the 95% confidence level. On a positive note, the QLSCA statistically outperforms
the DPSO in certain configurations at the 90% confidence level.
