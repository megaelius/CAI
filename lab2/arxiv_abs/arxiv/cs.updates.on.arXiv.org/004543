Surrogate strategies are used widely for uncertainty quantification of groundwater models in
order to improve computational efficiency. However, their application to dynamic multiphase
flow problems is hindered by the curse of dimensionality, the saturation discontinuity due to capillarity
effects, and the time-dependence of the multi-output responses. In this paper, we propose a deep
convolutional encoder-decoder neural network methodology to tackle these issues. The surrogate
modeling task is transformed to an image-to-image regression strategy. This approach extracts
high-level coarse features from the high-dimensional input permeability images using an encoder,
and then refines the coarse features to provide the output pressure/saturation images through
a decoder. A training strategy combining a regression loss and a segmentation loss is proposed in
order to better approximate the discontinuous saturation field. To characterize the high-dimensional
time-dependent outputs of the dynamic system, time is treated as an additional input to the network
that is trained using pairs of input realizations and of the corresponding system outputs at a limited
number of time instances. The proposed method is evaluated using a geological carbon storage process-based
multiphase flow model with a 2500-dimensional stochastic permeability field. With a relatively
small number of training data, the surrogate model is capable of accurately characterizing the
spatio-temporal evolution of the pressure and discontinuous CO2 saturation fields and can be used
efficiently to compute the statistics of the system responses.
