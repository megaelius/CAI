With the spiraling pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has becoming inherently
important to disseminate accurate and timely information about the disease. Due to the ubiquity
of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing
paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens,
a vision of social sensing based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data
to infer COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed
about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas. The CovidSens concept is motivated by
three observations: 1) people actively share their experience of COVID-19 via online social media,
2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting on social
media, and 3) online users are frequently equipped with powerful mobile devices that can perform
data processing and analytics. We envision unprecedented opportunities to leverage posts generated
by ordinary people to build real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating
COVID-19 propagation data. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions:
How to distill reliable information on COVID-19 with prevailing rumors and misinformation? How
to inform the general public about the state of the spread timely and effectively? How to leverage
the computational power on edge devices to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing
platforms? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify potential challenges
in developing reliable social sensing based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating
from multiple disciplines can be effective in addressing the challenges. Finally, we outline a
few research directions for future work in CovidSens.
