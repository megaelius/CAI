The potential for machine learning to disrupt the medical profession is the subject of ongoing debate
within biomedical informatics. This study aimed to explore psychiatrists' opinions about the
potential impact of innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric
practice. In Spring 2019, we conducted a web-based survey of 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries
worldwide. The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace
physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive
analysis of written response to three open-ended questions in the survey. Comments were classified
into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on patient-psychiatric
interactions, the quality of patient medical care, the profession of psychiatry, and health systems.
Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could fully replace human empathy.
Many predicted that 'man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical
decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants
were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs.
Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. This study presents timely
information of psychiatrists' view about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning
on psychiatric practice. Psychiatrists expressed divergent views about the value and impact of
future technology with worrying omissions about practice guidelines, and ethical and regulatory
issues.
