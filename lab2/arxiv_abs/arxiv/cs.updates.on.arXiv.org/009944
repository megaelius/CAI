In machine learning applications for online product offerings and marketing strategies, there
are often hundreds or thousands of features available to build such models. Feature selection is
one essential method in such applications for multiple objectives: improving the prediction accuracy
by eliminating irrelevant features, accelerating the model training and prediction speed, reducing
the monitoring and maintenance workload for feature data pipeline, and providing better model
interpretation and diagnosis capability. However, selecting an optimal feature subset from a
large feature space is considered as an NP-complete problem. The mRMR (Minimum Redundancy and Maximum
Relevance) feature selection framework solves this problem by selecting the relevant features
while controlling for the redundancy within the selected features. This paper describes the approach
to extend, evaluate, and implement the mRMR feature selection methods for classification problem
in a marketing machine learning platform at Uber that automates creation and deployment of targeting
and personalization models at scale. This study first extends the existing mRMR methods by introducing
a non-linear feature redundancy measure and a model-based feature relevance measure. Then an extensive
empirical evaluation is performed for eight different feature selection methods, using one synthetic
dataset and three real-world marketing datasets at Uber to cover different use cases. Based on the
empirical results, the selected mRMR method is implemented in production for the marketing machine
learning platform. A description of the production implementation is provided and an online experiment
deployed through the platform is discussed.
