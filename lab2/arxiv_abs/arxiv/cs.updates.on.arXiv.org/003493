Different types of atherosclerotic plaque and varying grades of stenosis lead to different management
of patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the
presence and classify the type of coronary artery plaque, as well as to determine the presence and
the degree of a stenosis. The study includes consecutively acquired coronary CT angiography (CCTA)
scans of 131 patients. In these, presence and plaque type in the coronary arteries (no plaque, non-calcified,
mixed, calcified) as well as presence and anatomical significance of coronary stenosis (no stenosis,
non-significant, significant) were manually annotated by identifying the start and end points
of the fragment of the artery affected by the plaque. To perform automatic analysis, a multi-task
recurrent convolutional neural network is utilized. The network uses CCTA and coronary artery
centerline as its inputs, and extracts features from the region defined along the coronary artery
centerline using a 3D convolutional neural network. Subsequently, the extracted features are
used by a recurrent neural network that performs two simultaneous multi-label classification
tasks. In the first task, the network detects and characterizes the type of the coronary artery plaque.
In the second task, the network detects and determines the anatomical significance of the coronary
artery stenosis. The results demonstrate that automatic characterization of coronary artery
plaque and stenosis with high accuracy and reliability is feasible. This may enable automated triage
of patients to those without coronary plaque, and those with coronary plaque and stenosis in need
for further cardiovascular workup.
