Generalizability is an important problem in deep neural networks, especially in the context of
the variability of data acquisition in clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, the
Spatially Localized Atlas Network Tiles (SLANT) approach has been shown to effectively segment
whole brain non-contrast T1w MRI with 132 volumetric labels. Enhancing generalizability of SLANT
would enable broader application of volumetric assessment in multi-site studies. Transfer learning
(TL) is commonly used to update the neural network weights for local factors; yet, it is commonly
recognized to risk degradation of performance on the original validation/test cohorts. Here,
we explore TL by data augmentation to address these concerns in the context of adapting SLANT to anatomical
variation and scanning protocol. We consider two datasets: First, we optimize for age with 30 T1w
MRI of young children with manually corrected volumetric labels, and accuracy of automated segmentation
defined relative to the manually provided truth. Second, we optimize for acquisition with 36 paired
datasets of pre- and post-contrast clinically acquired T1w MRI, and accuracy of the post-contrast
segmentations assessed relative to the pre-contrast automated assessment. For both studies,
we augment the original TL step of SLANT with either only the new data or with both original and new
data. Over baseline SLANT, both approaches yielded significantly improved performance (signed
rank tests; pediatric: 0.89 vs. 0.82 DSC, p<0.001; contrast: 0.80 vs 0.76, p<0.001). The performance
on the original test set decreased with the new-data only transfer learning approach, so data augmentation
was superior to strict transfer learning.
