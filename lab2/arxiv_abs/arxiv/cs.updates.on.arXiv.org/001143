Clustering problems are well-studied in a variety of fields such as data science, operations research,
and computer science. Such problems include variants of centre location problems, $k$-median,
and $k$-means to name a few. In some cases, not all data points need to be clustered; some may be discarded
for various reasons. We study clustering problems with outliers. More specifically, we look at
Uncapacitated Facility Location (UFL), $k$-Median, and $k$-Means. In UFL with outliers, we have
to open some centres, discard up to $z$ points of $\cal X$ and assign every other point to the nearest
open centre, minimizing the total assignment cost plus centre opening costs. In $k$-Median and
$k$-Means, we have to open up to $k$ centres but there are no opening costs. In $k$-Means, the cost
of assigning $j$ to $i$ is $\delta^2(j,i)$. We present several results. Our main focus is on cases
where $\delta$ is a doubling metric or is the shortest path metrics of graphs from a minor-closed
family of graphs. For uniform-cost UFL with outliers on such metrics we show that a multiswap simple
local search heuristic yields a PTAS. With a bit more work, we extend this to bicriteria approximations
for the $k$-Median and $k$-Means problems in the same metrics where, for any constant $\epsilon
> 0$, we can find a solution using $(1+\epsilon)k$ centres whose cost is at most a $(1+\epsilon)$-factor
of the optimum and uses at most $z$ outliers. We also show that natural local search heuristics that
do not violate the number of clusters and outliers for $k$-Median (or $k$-Means) will have unbounded
gap even in Euclidean metrics. Furthermore, we show how our analysis can be extended to general metrics
for $k$-Means with outliers to obtain a $(25+\epsilon,1+\epsilon)$ bicriteria.
