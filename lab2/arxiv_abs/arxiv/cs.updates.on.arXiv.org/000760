Urban water distribution systems hold a critical and strategic position in preserving public health
and industrial growth. Despite the ubiquity of these urban systems, aging infrastructure, and
increased risk of terrorism, decision support models for a timely and adaptive contamination emergency
response still remain at an undeveloped stage. Emergency response is characterized as a progressive,
interactive, and adaptive process that involves parallel activities of processing streaming
information and executing response actions. This study develops a dynamic decision support model
that adaptively simulates the time-varying emergency environment and tracks changing best health
protection response measures at every stage of an emergency in real-time. Feedback mechanisms
between the contaminated network, emergency managers, and consumers are incorporated in a dynamic
simulation model to capture time-varying characteristics of an emergency environment. An evolutionary-computation-based
dynamic optimization model is developed to adaptively identify time-dependant optimal health
protection measures during an emergency. This dynamic simulation-optimization model treats
perceived contaminant source attributes as time-varying parameters to account for perceived
contamination source updates as more data stream in over time. Performance of the developed dynamic
decision support model is analyzed and demonstrated using a mid-size virtual city that resembles
the dynamics and complexity of real-world urban systems. This adaptive emergency response optimization
model is intended to be a major component of an all-inclusive cyberinfrastructure for efficient
contamination threat management, which is currently under development.
