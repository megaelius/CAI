The evolution of drone technology in the past nine years since the first commercial drone was introduced
at CES 2010 has caused many individuals and businesses to adopt drones for various purposes. We are
currently living in an era in which drones are being used for pizza delivery, the shipment of goods,
and filming, and they are likely to provide an alternative for transportation in the near future.
However, drones also pose a significant challenge in terms of security and privacy within society
(for both individuals and organizations), and many drone related incidents are reported on a daily
basis. These incidents have called attention to the need to detect and disable drones used for malicious
purposes and opened up a new area of research and development for academia and industry, with a market
that is expected to reach $1.85 billion by 2024. While some of the knowledge used to detect UAVs has
been adopted for drone detection, new methods have been suggested by industry and academia alike
to deal with the challenges associated with detecting the very small and fast flying objects. In
this paper, we describe new societal threats to security and privacy created by drones, and present
academic and industrial methods used to detect and disable drones. We review methods targeted at
areas that restrict drone flights and analyze their effectiveness with regard to various factors
(e.g., weather, birds, ambient light, etc.). We present the challenges arising in areas that allow
drone flights, introduce the methods that exist for dealing with these challenges, and discuss
the scientific gaps that exist in this area. Finally, we review methods used to disable drones, analyze
their effectiveness, and present their expected results. Finally, we suggest future research
directions.
