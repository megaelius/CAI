We establish the existence of wave-like solutions to spatially coupled graphical models which,
in the large size limit, can be characterized by a one-dimensional real-valued state. This is extended
to a proof of the threshold saturation phenomenon for all such models, which includes spatially
coupled irregular LDPC codes over the BEC, but also addresses hard-decision decoding for transmission
over general channels, the CDMA multiple-access problem, compressed sensing, and some statistical
physics models. For traditional uncoupled iterative coding systems with two components and transmission
over the BEC, the asymptotic convergence behavior is completely characterized by the EXIT curves
of the components. More precisely, the system converges to the desired fixed point, which is the
one corresponding to perfect decoding, if and only if the two EXIT functions describing the components
do not cross. For spatially coupled systems whose state is one-dimensional a closely related graphical
criterion applies. Now the curves are allowed to cross, but not by too much. More precisely, we show
that the threshold saturation phenomenon is related to the positivity of the (signed) area enclosed
by two EXIT-like functions associated to the component systems, a very intuitive and easy-to-use
graphical characterization. In the spirit of EXIT functions and Gaussian approximations, we also
show how to apply the technique to higher dimensional and even infinite-dimensional cases. In these
scenarios the method is no longer rigorous, but it typically gives accurate predictions. To demonstrate
this application, we discuss transmission over general channels using both the belief-propagation
as well as the min-sum decoder.
