Model-based approaches for image reconstruction, analysis and interpretation have made significant
progress over the last decades. Many of these approaches are based on either mathematical, physical
or biological models. A challenge for these approaches is the modelling of the underlying processes
(e.g. the physics of image acquisition or the patho-physiology of a disease) with appropriate levels
of detail and realism. With the availability of large amounts of imaging data and machine learning
(in particular deep learning) techniques, data-driven approaches have become more widespread
for use in different tasks in reconstruction, analysis and interpretation. These approaches learn
statistical models directly from labelled or unlabeled image data and have been shown to be very
powerful for extracting clinically useful information from medical imaging. While these data-driven
approaches often outperform traditional model-based approaches, their clinical deployment
often poses challenges in terms of robustness, generalization ability and interpretability.
In this article, we discuss what developments have motivated the shift from model-based approaches
towards data-driven strategies and what potential problems are associated with the move towards
purely data-driven approaches, in particular deep learning. We also discuss some of the open challenges
for data-driven approaches, e.g. generalization to new unseen data (e.g. transfer learning),
robustness to adversarial attacks and interpretability. Finally, we conclude with a discussion
on how these approaches may lead to the development of more closely coupled imaging pipelines that
are optimized in an end-to-end fashion.
