Motivation: The question of what combination of attributes drives the adoption of a particular
software technology is critical to developers. It determines both those technologies that receive
wide support from the community and those which may be abandoned, thus rendering developers' investments
worthless. Aim and Context: We model software technology adoption by developers and provide insights
on specific technology attributes that are associated with better visibility among alternative
technologies. Approach: We leverage social contagion theory and statistical modeling to identify,
define, and test empirically measures that are likely to affect software adoption. More specifically,
we leverage a large collection of open source version control repositories to construct a software
dependency chain for a specific set of R language source-code files. We formulate logistic regression
models, to investigate the combination of technological attributes that drive adoption among
competing data frame implementations in the R language: tidy and data.table. We quantify key project
attributes that might affect adoption and also characteristics of developers making the selection.
Results: We find that a quick response to raised issues, a larger number of overall deployments,
and a larger number of high-quality StackExchange questions are associated with higher adoption.
Decision makers tend to adopt the technology that is closer to them in the technical dependency network
and in author collaborations networks while meeting their performance needs. Future work: We hope
that our methodology encompassing social contagion that captures both rational and irrational
preferences and the elucidation of key measures from large collections of version control data
provides a general path toward increasing visibility, driving better informed decisions, and
producing more sustainable and widely adopted software
