Motivated by certain applications from physics, biochemistry, economics, and computer science,
in which the objects under investigation are not accessible because of various limitations, we
propose a trial-and-error model to examine algorithmic issues in such situations. Given a search
problem with a hidden input, we are asked to find a valid solution, to find which we can propose candidate
solutions (trials), and use observed violations (errors), to prepare future proposals. In accordance
with our motivating applications, we consider the fairly broad class of constraint satisfaction
problems, and assume that errors are signaled by a verification oracle in the format of the index
of a violated constraint (with the content of the constraint still hidden). Our discoveries are
summarized as follows. On one hand, despite the seemingly very little information provided by the
verification oracle, efficient algorithms do exist for a number of important problems. For the
Nash, Core, Stable Matching, and SAT problems, the unknown-input versions are as hard as the corresponding
known-input versions, up to a factor of polynomial. We further give almost tight bounds on the latter
two problems' trial complexities. On the other hand, there are problems whose complexities are
substantially increased in the unknown-input model. In particular, no time-efficient algorithms
exist (under standard hardness assumptions) for Graph Isomorphism and Group Isomorphism problems.
The tools used to achieve these results include order theory, strong ellipsoid method, and some
non-standard reductions. Our model investigates the value of information, and our results demonstrate
that the lack of input information can introduce various levels of extra difficulty. The model exhibits
intimate connections with (and we hope can also serve as a useful supplement to) certain existing
learning and complexity theories.
