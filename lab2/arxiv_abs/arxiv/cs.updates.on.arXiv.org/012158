For several years, scholars have studied cooperative learning and its outcomes in the educational
context. Yet, little is known on how different instructional strategies impact the relationship
between cooperation and learning. Here we studied how different instructional strategies lead
to different social configurations and their differences in academic performance. We set three
different experimental conditions for 82 first-year students, where we varied teaching and instructional
strategies. The experiment was run in an undergraduate course of physics over two months in Chile.
We explore how students' social structures facilitate academic performance. We collected data
on students' performance on a physics test designed with well-structured and ill-structured problems.
In addition, we run an on-line peer-nomination survey for the social interactions in the solving
problems processes. Surprisingly, students who actively seek out information on multiple peers
are less likely to achieve good performance on well-structured problems, whereas, for ill-structured
problems, the effect depends on the features of the learning environment. In a highly clustered
networks (which contains highly redundant information) students perform well-structured problems
better than ill-structured problems. In contrast, students with access to network structural
holes (which enable access to more diverse information) perform ill-structured problems better
than well-structured problems. Finally, ill-structured problems can promote creative thinking,
but only if instructors guide the solving process and motivate students to engage in the appropriate
cognitive demands these problems entail. Our results suggest that teaching and instructional
strategies have a key role in cooperative learning; therefore, educators implementing cooperative
learning methods have to accompany them with a proper instructional strategy
