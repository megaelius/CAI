In 2015, 391,000 people were injured due to distracted driving in the US. One of the major reasons
behind distracted driving is the use of cell-phones, accounting for 14% of fatal crashes. Social
media applications have enabled users to stay connected, however, the use of such applications
while driving could have serious repercussions -- often leading the user to be distracted from the
road and ending up in an accident. In the context of impression management, it has been discovered
that individuals often take a risk (such as teens smoking cigarettes, indulging in narcotics, and
participating in unsafe sex) to improve their social standing. Therefore, viewing the phenomena
of posting distracted driving posts under the lens of self-presentation, it can be hypothesized
that users often indulge in risk-taking behavior on social media to improve their impression among
their peers. In this paper, we first try to understand the severity of such social-media-based distractions
by analyzing the content posted on a popular social media site where the user is driving and is also
simultaneously creating content. To this end, we build a deep learning classifier to identify publicly
posted content on social media that involves the user driving. Furthermore, a framework proposed
to understand factors behind voluntary risk-taking activity observes that younger individuals
are more willing to perform such activities, and men (as opposed to women) are more inclined to take
risks. Grounding our observations in this framework, we test these hypotheses on 173 cities across
the world. We conduct spatial and temporal analysis on a city-level and understand how distracted
driving content posting behavior changes due to varied demographics. We discover that the factors
put forth by the framework are significant in estimating the extent of such behavior.
