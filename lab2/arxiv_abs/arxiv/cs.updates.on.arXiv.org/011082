The design of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and the design of AVs-enabled mobility systems are closely
coupled. Indeed, knowledge about the intended service of AVs would impact their design and deployment
process, whilst insights about their technological development could significantly affect transportation
management decisions. This calls for tools to study such a coupling and co-design AVs and AVs-enabled
mobility systems in terms of different objectives. In this paper, we instantiate a framework to
address such co-design problems. In particular, we leverage the recently developed theory of co-design
to frame and solve the problem of designing and deploying an intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand
system, whereby AVs service travel demands jointly with public transit, in terms of fleet sizing,
vehicle autonomy, and public transit service frequency. Our framework is modular and compositional,
allowing to describe the design problem as the interconnection of its individual components and
to tackle it from a system-level perspective. Moreover, it only requires very general monotonicity
assumptions and it naturally handles multiple objectives, delivering the rational solutions
on the Pareto front and thus enabling policy makers to select a solution through political criteria.
To showcase our methodology, we present a real-world case study for Washington D.C., USA. Our work
suggests that it is possible to create user-friendly optimization tools to systematically assess
the costs and benefits of interventions, and that such analytical techniques might gain a momentous
role in policy-making in the future.
