A graph is Helly if every family of pairwise intersecting balls has a nonempty common intersection.
Motivated by previous work on dually chordal graphs and graphs of bounded distance VC-dimension
(with the former being a subclass of Helly graphs and the latter being a particular case of graphs
of bounded fractional Helly number, respectively) we prove several new results on the complexity
of computing the diameter and the radius on Helly graphs and related graph classes. * First, we present
an algorithm which given an $n$-vertex $m$-edge Helly graph $G$ as input, computes w.h.p. $rad(G)$
in time $\tilde{\cal O}(m\sqrt{n})$. Incidentally, it also gives us an additive $+1$-approximation
of $diam(G)$. * Then, we focus on $C_4$-free Helly graphs, which include, amongst other subclasses,
bridged Helly graphs and so, chordal Helly graphs and hereditary Helly graphs. For the $C_4$-free
Helly graphs, we present linear-time algorithms for computing the eccentricity of all vertices.
Doing so, we generalize previous results on strongly chordal graphs to a much larger subclass. *
Finally, we derive from our findings on chordal Helly graphs a more general one-to-many reduction
from diameter computation on chordal graphs to either diameter computation on split graphs or the
Disjoint Set problem. Therefore, split graphs are in some sense the only hard instances for diameter
computation on chordal graphs. As a byproduct of our reduction we get that on any subclass of chordal
graphs with constant VC-dimension the diameter can be computed in truly subquadratic time. These
above results are a new step toward better understanding the role of abstract geometric properties
in the fast computation of metric graph invariants.
