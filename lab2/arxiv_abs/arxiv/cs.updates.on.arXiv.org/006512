We study two basic graph parameters, the chromatic number and the orthogonal rank, in the context
of classical and quantum exact communication complexity. In particular, we consider two types
of communication problems that we call promise equality and list problems. For both of these, it
was already known that the one-round classical and one-round quantum complexities are characterized
by the chromatic number and orthogonal rank of a certain graph, respectively. In a promise equality
problem, Alice and Bob must decide if their inputs are equal or not. We prove that classical protocols
for such problems can always be reduced to one-round protocols with no extra communication. In contrast,
we give an explicit instance of a promise equality problem that exhibits an exponential gap between
the one- and two-round exact quantum communication complexities. Whereas the chromatic number
thus fully captures the complexity of promise equality problems, the hierarchy of "quantum chromatic
numbers" (starting with the orthogonal rank) giving the quantum communication complexity for
every fixed number of communication rounds turns out to enjoy a much richer structure. In a list problem,
Bob gets a subset of some finite universe, Alice gets an element from Bob's subset, and their goal
is for Bob to learn which element Alice was given. The best general lower bound (due to Orlitsky) and
upper bound (due to Naor, Orlitsky, and Shor) on the classical communication complexity of such
problems differ only by a constant factor. We exhibit an example showing that, somewhat surprisingly,
the four-round protocol used in the bound of Naor et al. can in fact be optimal. Finally, we pose a conjecture
on the orthogonality rank of a certain graph whose truth would imply an intriguing impossibility
of round elimination in quantum protocols for list problems, something that works trivially in
the classical case.
