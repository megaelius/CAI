Light emitting diode (LED) based visible light positioning (VLP) networks can provide accurate
location information in indoor environments. In this manuscript, we propose to employ cooperative
localization for visible light networks by designing a VLP system configuration that involves
multiple LED transmitters with known locations (e.g., on the ceiling) and visible light communication
(VLC) units equipped with both LEDs and photodetectors (PDs) for the purpose of cooperation. First,
we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the
localization of VLC units in the proposed cooperative scenario. To tackle the nonconvex structure
of the MLE, we adopt a set-theoretic approach by formulating the problem of cooperative localization
as a quasiconvex feasibility problem, where the aim is to find a point inside the intersection of
convex constraint sets constructed as the sublevel sets of quasiconvex functions resulting from
the Lambertian formula. Next, we devise two feasibility-seeking algorithms based on iterative
gradient projections to solve the feasibility problem. Both algorithms are amenable to distributed
implementation, thereby avoiding high-complexity centralized approaches. Capitalizing on
the concept of quasi-Fej\'er convergent sequences, we carry out a formal convergence analysis
to prove that the proposed algorithms converge to a solution of the feasibility problem in the consistent
case. Numerical examples illustrate the improvements in localization performance achieved via
cooperation among VLC units and evidence the convergence of the proposed algorithms to true VLC
unit locations in both the consistent and inconsistent cases.
