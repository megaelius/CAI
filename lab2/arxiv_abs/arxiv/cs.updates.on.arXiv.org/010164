Computer malware and biological pathogens often use similar mechanisms of infections. For this
reason, it has been suggested to model malware spread using epidemiological models developed to
characterize the spread of biological pathogens. However, most work examining the similarities
between malware and pathogens using such methods was based on theoretical analysis and simulation.
Here we extend the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model to
describe two of the most common infection methods used by malware. We fit the proposed model to malware
collected over a period of one year from a major anti-malware vendor. We show that by fitting the proposed
model it is possible to identify the method of transmission used by the malware, its rate of infection,
and the number of machines which will be infected unless blocked by anti-virus software. The Spearman
correlation between the number of actual and predicted infected machines is 0.84. Examining cases
where an anti-malware "signature" was transmitted to susceptible computers by the anti-virus
provider, we show that the time to remove the malware will be short and independent of the number of
infected computers if fewer than approximately 60% of susceptible computers have been infected.
If more computers were infected, the time to removal will be approximately 3.2 greater, and will
depend on the fraction of infected computers. Our results show that the application of epidemiological
models of infection to malware can provide anti-virus providers with information on malware spread
and its potential damage. We further propose that similarities between computer malware and biological
pathogens, the availability of data on the former and the dearth of data on the latter, make malware
an extremely useful model for testing interventions which could later be applied to improve medicine.
