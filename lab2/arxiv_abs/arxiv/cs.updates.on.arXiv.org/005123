In this paper, we propose a workflow that uses Terrestrial Laser Scanning(TLS) to semi-automatically
monitor landslide and then test it in practice. Firstly, several groups of TLS stations are set on
different time to collect the raw point cloud of the object mountain. Next, Hierarchical Merging
Based Multi-view (HMMR) registration algorithm is adapted to accomplish single-phase multi-view
registration.In order to analyze deformation between multiple periods, Iterative Global Similarity
Point (IGSP) algorithm is applied to accomplish multiple-phase registration, which outperforms
ICP in experiments. Then the cloth simulation filtering (CSF) algorithm was used together with
manual post-processing to remove vegetation on the slope. After that, the mountain slope's digital
terrain model (DTM) is generated for each period, and the distance between adjacent DTMs are calculated
as the landslide deformation mass. Furthermore, average deformation rate of the landslide surface
is calculated and analyzed.To validate the effectiveness of proposed workflow, we uses the TLS
data of five periods of the landslide in the Shanhou village of northern Changshan Island from 2013
to 2015. The results indicate that the method can obtain centimeter-level deformation monitoring
accuracy which can effectively monitor and analyze long-term landslide morphology and trend as
well as position the significant deformation area and determine the type of landslide. In addition,
the process can be automated to provide end-to-end TLS based long-term landslide monitoring applications,
providing reference for monitoring and early warning of potential landslides.
