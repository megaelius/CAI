Bone adapts in response to its mechanical environment. This evolution of bone density is one of the
most important mechanisms for developing fracture resistance. A finite element framework for
simulating bone adaptation, commonly called bone remodelling, is presented. This is followed
by a novel method to both quantify fracture resistance and to simulate fracture propagation. The
authors' previous work on the application of configurational mechanics for modelling fracture
is extended to include the influence of heterogeneous bone density distribution. The main advantage
of this approach is that configurational forces, and fracture energy release rate, are expressed
exclusively in terms of nodal quantities. This approach avoids the need for post-processing and
enables a fully implicit formulation for modelling the evolving crack front. In this paper density
fields are generated from both (a) bone adaptation analysis and (b) subject-specific geometry
and material properties obtained from CT scans. It is shown that, in order to correctly evaluate
the configurational forces at the crack front, it is necessary to have a spatially smooth density
field with higher regularity than if the field is directly approximated on the finite element mesh.
Therefore, discrete density data is approximated as a smooth density field using a Moving Weighted
Least Squares method. Performance of the framework is demonstrated using numerical simulations
for bone adaptation and subsequent crack propagation, including consideration of an equine 3rd
metacarpal bone. The degree of bone adaption is shown to influence both fracture resistance and
the resulting crack path.
