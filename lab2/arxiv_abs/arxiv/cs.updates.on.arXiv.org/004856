Remote attestation is a security technique by which a potentially untrusted device called Prover
can evidence its current state to an external trusted party called Verifier. The main goal of a remote
attestation protocol is to guarantee the reliability of the evidence, such that the Verifier can
verify remotely the trustworthiness of the Prover. In the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, which
are increasingly becoming exposed to a broad range of exploitations, the existing remote attestation
protocols aim to check the integrity of each individual IoT device by detecting the modified softwares
and physical tampering attacks. However, in an interconnected IoT system, in which IoT devices
interact autonomously among themselves, a compromised IoT service can influence the genuine operation
of other invoked service, without changing the software. In this paper, we show how a compromised
service in a distributed IoT service can induce malicious behavior on genuine services, and we highlight
the need for distributed services attestation. We propose a protocol for Remote Attestation of
Distributed IoT Services (RADIS), which provides a complete evidence about the trustworthiness
of distributed IoT services. RADIS relies on a control-flow attestation technique to detect IoT
services that perform an unexpected operation due to their interactions with a malicious remote
service. Additionally, RADIS traces the interactions between IoT distributed services, allowing
the Verifier to check whether the activities follow a legitimate interaction model. We discuss
the effectiveness of our protocol in validating the integrity status of a distributed IoT service.
