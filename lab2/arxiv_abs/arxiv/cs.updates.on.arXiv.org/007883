We consider the pattern detection problem in graphs: given a constant size pattern graph $H$ and
a host graph $G$, determine whether $G$ contains a subgraph isomorphic to $H$. Our main results are:
* We prove that if a pattern $H$ contains a $k$-clique subgraph, then detecting whether an $n$ node
host graph contains a not necessarily induced copy of $H$ requires at least the time for detecting
whether an $n$ node graph contains a $k$-clique. The previous result of this nature required that
$H$ contains a $k$-clique which is disjoint from all other $k$-cliques of $H$. * We show that if the
famous Hadwiger conjecture from graph theory is true, then detecting whether an $n$ node host graph
contains a not necessarily induced copy of a pattern with chromatic number $t$ requires at least
the time for detecting whether an $n$ node graph contains a $t$-clique. This implies that: (1) under
Hadwiger's conjecture for every $k$-node pattern $H$, finding an induced copy of $H$ requires at
least the time of $\sqrt k$-clique detection, and at least size $\omega(n^{\sqrt{k}/4})$ for any
constant depth circuit, and (2) unconditionally, detecting an induced copy of a random $G(k,p)$
pattern w.h.p. requires at least the time of $\Theta(k/\log k)$-clique detection, and hence also
at least size $n^{\Omega(k/\log k)}$ for circuits of constant depth. * Finally, we consider the
case when the pattern is a directed cycle on $k$ nodes, and we would like to detect whether a directed
$m$-edge graph $G$ contains a $k$-Cycle as a not necessarily induced subgraph. We resolve a 14 year
old conjecture of [Yuster-Zwick SODA'04] on the complexity of $k$-Cycle detection by giving a tight
analysis of their $k$-Cycle algorithm. Our analysis improves the best bounds for $k$-Cycle detection
in directed graphs, for all $k>5$.
