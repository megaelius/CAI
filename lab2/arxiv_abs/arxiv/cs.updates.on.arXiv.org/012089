Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), a set of negative events and processes that
a person might encounter during childhood and adolescence, have been proven to be linked to increased
risks of a multitude of negative health outcomes and conditions when children reach adulthood and
beyond. Objective: To better understand the relationship between ACEs and their relevant risk
factors with associated health outcomes and to eventually design and implement preventive interventions,
access to an integrated coherent dataset is needed. Therefore, we implemented a formal ontology
as a resource to allow the mental health community to facilitate data integration and knowledge
modeling and to improve ACEs surveillance and research. Methods: We use advanced knowledge representation
and Semantic Web tools and techniques to implement the ontology. The current implementation of
the ontology is expressed in the description logic ALCRIQ(D), a sublogic of Web Ontology Language
(OWL 2). Results: The ACEs Ontology has been implemented and made available to the mental health
community and the public via the BioPortal repository. Moreover, multiple use-case scenarios
have been introduced to showcase and evaluate the usability of the ontology in action. The ontology
was created to be used by major actors in the ACEs community with different applications, from the
diagnosis of individuals and predicting potential negative outcomes that they might encounter
to the prevention of ACEs in a population and designing interventions and policies. Conclusions:
The ACEs Ontology provides a uniform and reusable semantic network and an integrated knowledge
structure for mental health practitioners and researchers to improve ACEs surveillance and evaluation.
