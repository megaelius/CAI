We show that most arithmetic circuit lower bounds and relations between lower bounds naturally
fit into the representation-theoretic framework suggested by geometric complexity theory (GCT),
including: the partial derivatives technique (Nisan-Wigderson), the results of Razborov and
Smolensky on $AC^0[p]$, multilinear formula and circuit size lower bounds (Raz et al.), the degree
bound (Strassen, Baur-Strassen), the connected components technique (Ben-Or), depth 3 arithmetic
circuit lower bounds over finite fields (Grigoriev-Karpinski), lower bounds on permanent versus
determinant (Mignon-Ressayre, Landsberg-Manivel-Ressayre), lower bounds on matrix multiplication
(B\"{u}rgisser-Ikenmeyer) (these last two were already known to fit into GCT), the chasms at depth
3 and 4 (Gupta-Kayal-Kamath-Saptharishi; Agrawal-Vinay; Koiran), matrix rigidity (Valiant)
and others. That is, the original proofs, with what is often just a little extra work, already provide
representation-theoretic obstructions in the sense of GCT for their respective lower bounds.
This enables us to expose a new viewpoint on GCT, whereby it is a natural unification and broad generalization
of known results. It also shows that the framework of GCT is at least as powerful as known methods,
and gives many new proofs-of-concept that GCT can indeed provide significant asymptotic lower
bounds. This new viewpoint also opens up the possibility of fruitful two-way interactions between
previous results and the new methods of GCT; we provide several concrete suggestions of such interactions.
For example, the representation-theoretic viewpoint of GCT naturally provides new properties
to consider in the search for new lower bounds.
