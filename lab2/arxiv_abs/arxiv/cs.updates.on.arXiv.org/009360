In this paper, we propose a complete and robust motion planning system for the aggressive flight
of autonomous quadrotors. The proposed method is built upon on a classical teach-and-repeat framework,
which is widely adopted in infrastructure inspection, aerial transportation, and search-and-rescue.
For these applications, human's intention is essential to decide the topological structure of
the flight trajectory of the drone. However, poor teaching trajectories and changing environments
prevent a simple teach-and-repeat system from being applied flexibly and robustly. In this paper,
instead of commanding the drone to precisely follow a teaching trajectory, we propose a method to
automatically convert a human-piloted trajectory, which can be arbitrarily jerky, to a topologically
equivalent one. The generated trajectory is guaranteed to be smooth, safe, and kinodynamically
feasible, with a human preferable aggressiveness. Also, to avoid unmapped or dynamic obstacles
during flights, a sliding-windowed local perception and re-planning method are introduced to
our system, to generate safe local trajectories onboard. We name our system as teach-repeat-replan.
It can capture users' intention of a flight mission, convert an arbitrarily jerky teaching path
to a smooth repeating trajectory, and generate safe local re-plans to avoid unmapped or moving obstacles.
The proposed planning system is integrated into a complete autonomous quadrotor with global and
local perception and localization sub-modules. Our system is validated by performing aggressive
flights in challenging indoor/outdoor environments. We release all components in our quadrotor
system as open-source ros-packages.
