Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) allows for non-invasive imaging of the
local fiber architecture of the human brain at a millimetric scale. Multiple classical approaches
have been proposed to detect both single (e.g., tensors) and multiple (e.g., constrained spherical
deconvolution, CSD) fiber population orientations per voxel. However, existing techniques generally
exhibit low reproducibility across MRI scanners. Herein, we propose a data-driven tech-nique
using a neural network design which exploits two categories of data. First, training data were acquired
on three squirrel monkey brains using ex-vivo DW-MRI and histology of the brain. Second, repeated
scans of human subjects were acquired on two different scanners to augment the learning of the network
pro-posed. To use these data, we propose a new network architecture, the null space deep network
(NSDN), to simultaneously learn on traditional observed/truth pairs (e.g., MRI-histology voxels)
along with repeated observations without a known truth (e.g., scan-rescan MRI). The NSDN was tested
on twenty percent of the histology voxels that were kept completely blind to the network. NSDN significantly
improved absolute performance relative to histology by 3.87% over CSD and 1.42% over a recently
proposed deep neural network approach. More-over, it improved reproducibility on the paired data
by 21.19% over CSD and 10.09% over a recently proposed deep approach. Finally, NSDN improved gen-eralizability
of the model to a third in vivo human scanner (which was not used in training) by 16.08% over CSD and
10.41% over a recently proposed deep learn-ing approach. This work suggests that data-driven approaches
for local fiber re-construction are more reproducible, informative and precise and offers a novel,
practical method for determining these models.
