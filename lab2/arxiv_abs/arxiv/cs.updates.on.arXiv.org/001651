NAND flash memory is ubiquitous in everyday life today because its capacity has continuously increased
and cost has continuously decreased over decades. This positive growth is a result of two key trends:
(1) effective process technology scaling, and (2) multi-level (e.g., MLC, TLC) cell data coding.
Unfortunately, the reliability of raw data stored in flash memory has also continued to become more
difficult to ensure, because these two trends lead to (1) fewer electrons in the flash memory cell
(floating gate) to represent the data and (2) larger cell-to-cell interference and disturbance
effects. Without mitigation, worsening reliability can reduce the lifetime of NAND flash memory.
As a result, flash memory controllers in solid-state drives (SSDs) have become much more sophisticated:
they incorporate many effective techniques to ensure the correct interpretation of noisy data
stored in flash memory cells. In this article, we review recent advances in SSD error characterization,
mitigation, and data recovery techniques for reliability and lifetime improvement. We provide
rigorous experimental data from state-of-the-art MLC and TLC NAND flash devices on various types
of flash memory errors, to motivate the need for such techniques. Based on the understanding developed
by the experimental characterization, we describe several mitigation and recovery techniques,
including (1) cell-to-cell interference mitigation, (2) optimal multi-level cell sensing, (3)
error correction using state-of-the-art algorithms and methods, and (4) data recovery when error
correction fails. We quantify the reliability improvement provided by each of these techniques.
Looking forward, we briefly discuss how flash memory and these techniques could evolve into the
future.
