Mining pools, the main components of the Bitcoin network, dominate the computing resources and
play essential roles in network security and performance aspects. Although many existing measurements
of the Bitcoin network are available, little is known about the details of mining pool behaviors
(e.g., empty blocks, mining revenue and transaction collection strategies) and their effects
on the Bitcoin end users (e.g., transaction fees, transaction delay and transaction acceptance
rate). This paper aims to fill this gap with a systematic study of mining pools. We traced over 1.56
hundred thousand blocks (including about 257 million historical transactions) from February
2016 to January 2019 and collected over 120.25 million unconfirmed transactions from March 2018
to January 2019. Then we conducted a board range of measurements on the pool evolutions, labeled
transactions (blocks) as well as real-time network traffics, and discovered new interesting observations
and features. Specifically, our measurements show the following. 1) A few mining pools entities
continuously control most of the computing resources of the Bitcoin network. 2) Mining pools are
caught in a prisoner's dilemma where mining pools compete to increase their computing resources
even though the unit profit of the computing resource decreases. 3) Mining pools are stuck in a Malthusian
trap where there is a stage at which the Bitcoin incentives are inadequate for feeding the exponential
growth of the computing resources. 4) The market price and transaction fees are not sensitive to
the event of halving block rewards. 5) The block interval of empty blocks is significantly lower
than the block interval of non-empty blocks. 6) Feerate plays a dominating role in transaction collection
strategy for the top mining pools. Our measurements and analysis help to understand and improve
the Bitcoin network.
