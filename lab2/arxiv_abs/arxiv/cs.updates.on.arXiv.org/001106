We introduce the Deep Symbolic Network (DSN) model, which aims at becoming the white-box version
of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The DSN model provides a simple, universal yet powerful structure,
similar to DNN, to represent any knowledge of the world, which is transparent to humans. The conjecture
behind the DSN model is that any type of real world objects sharing enough common features are mapped
into human brains as a symbol. Those symbols are connected by links, representing the composition,
correlation, causality, or other relationships between them, forming a deep, hierarchical symbolic
network structure. Powered by such a structure, the DSN model is expected to learn like humans, because
of its unique characteristics. First, it is universal, using the same structure to store any knowledge.
Second, it can learn symbols from the world and construct the deep symbolic networks automatically,
by utilizing the fact that real world objects have been naturally separated by singularities. Third,
it is symbolic, with the capacity of performing causal deduction and generalization. Fourth, the
symbols and the links between them are transparent to us, and thus we will know what it has learned
or not - which is the key for the security of an AI system. Fifth, its transparency enables it to learn
with relatively small data. Sixth, its knowledge can be accumulated. Last but not least, it is more
friendly to unsupervised learning than DNN. We present the details of the model, the algorithm powering
its automatic learning ability, and describe its usefulness in different use cases. The purpose
of this paper is to generate broad interest to develop it within an open source project centered on
the Deep Symbolic Network (DSN) model towards the development of general AI.
