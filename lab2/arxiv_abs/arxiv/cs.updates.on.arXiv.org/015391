Many countries are currently gearing up to use smart-phone apps to perform contact tracing as part
of the effort to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent resurgences of the disease after the initial
outbreak. With the announcement of the Apple/Google partnership to introduce contact-tracing
functionality to iOS and Android, it seems likely that this will be adopted in many countries. An
important part of the functionality of the app will be to decide whether a person should be advised
to self-isolate, be tested or end isolation. However, the privacy preserving nature of the Apple/Google
contact tracing algorithm means that centralised curation of these decisions is not possible so
each phone must use its own "risk model" to inform decisions. Ideally, the risk model should use Bayesian
inference to decide the best course of action given the test results of the user and those of other
users. Here we present a decentralised algorithm that estimates the Bayesian posterior probability
of viral transmission events and evaluates when a user should be notified, tested or released from
isolation while preserving user privacy. The algorithm also allows the disease models on the phones
to learn from everyone's contact-tracing data and will allow Epidemiologists to better understand
the dynamics of the disease. The algorithm is a message passing algorithm, based on belief propagation,
so each smart-phone can be used to execute a small part of the algorithm without releasing any sensitive
information. In this way, the network of all participating smart-phones forms a distributed computation
device that performs Bayesian inference, informs each user when they should start/end isolation
or be tested and learns about the disease from user's data.
