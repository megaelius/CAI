The design and implementation of synthetic molecular communication systems at nano- and microscale
are very challenging. This is particularly true for synthetic MCSs employing biological components
as transmitters and receivers or as interfaces with natural biological MCSs. Nevertheless, since
such biological components have been optimized by nature over billions of years, using them in synthetic
MCSs is highly promising. This paper provides a survey of biological components that can potentially
serve as the main building blocks, i.e., transmitter, receiver, and signaling particles, for the
design and implementation of synthetic MCSs. Nature uses a large variety of signaling particles
of different sizes and with vastly different properties for communication among biological entities.
Here, we focus on three important classes of signaling particles: cations, neurotransmitters,
and phosphopeptides. These three classes have unique and distinct features such as their large
diffusion coefficients, their specificity, and/or their uniqueness of signaling that make them
suitable candidates for signaling particles in synthetic MCSs. For each of these candidate signaling
particles, we present several specific transmitter and receiver structures mainly built upon
proteins that are capable of performing the distinct physiological functionalities required
from the transmitters and receivers of MCSs. One of the main advantages of employing proteins for
signal emission and detection is that they can be modified with tools from synthetic biology and
be tailored to a wide range of application needs. We discuss the properties and limitations of the
resulting synthetic MCSs in detail. Furthermore, we outline the possible challenges arising in
the implementation of the proposed transmitter and receiver architectures and options for intersymbol
interference mitigation for the considered signaling particles.
