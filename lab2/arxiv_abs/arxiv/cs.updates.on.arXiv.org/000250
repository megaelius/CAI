We consider k-Facility Location games, where n strategic agents report their locations on the real
line, and a mechanism maps them to k facilities. Each agent seeks to minimize his connection cost,
given by a nonnegative increasing function of his distance to the nearest facility. Departing from
previous work, that mostly considers the identity cost function, we are interested in mechanisms
without payments that are (group) strategyproof for any given cost function, and achieve a good
approximation ratio for the social cost and/or the maximum cost of the agents. We present a randomized
mechanism, called Equal Cost, which is group strategyproof and achieves a bounded approximation
ratio for all k and n, for any given concave cost function. The approximation ratio is at most 2 for
Max Cost and at most n for Social Cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mechanism with
a bounded approximation ratio for instances with k > 2 facilities and any number of agents. Our
result implies an interesting separation between deterministic mechanisms, whose approximation
ratio for Max Cost jumps from 2 to unbounded when k increases from 2 to 3, and randomized mechanisms,
whose approximation ratio remains at most 2 for all k. On the negative side, we exclude the possibility
of a mechanism with the properties of Equal Cost for strictly convex cost functions. We also present
a randomized mechanism, called Pick the Loser, which applies to instances with k facilities and
n = k+1 agents, and for any given concave cost function, is strongly group strategyproof and achieves
an approximation ratio of 2 for Social Cost.
