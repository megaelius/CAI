The automotive and telco industries have taken an investment bet on the connected car market, pushing
for the digital transformation of the sector by exploiting recent Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) progress. As ICT developments continue, it is expected that the technology advancements
will be able to fulfill the sophisticated requirements for vehicular use cases, such as low latency
and reliable communications for safety, high computing power to process large amount of sensed
data, and increased bandwidth for on-board infotainment. The aforementioned requirements have
received significant focus during the ongoing definition of the 3GPP 5G mobile standards, where
there has been a drive to facilitate vertical industries such as automotive, in addition to providing
the core aspects of the communication infrastructure. Of the technology enablers for 5G, Multi-access
Edge Computing (MEC) can be considered essential. That is, a cloud environment located at the edge
of the network, in proximity of the end-users and coupled with the service provider's network infrastructure.
Even before 5G is rolled out, current mobile networks can already target support for these challenging
use cases using MEC technology. This is because MEC is able to fulfill low latency and high bandwidth
requirements, and, in addition, it lends itself to be deployed at the vertical industrial sector
premises such as road infrastructure, air/sea ports, smart factories, etc., thus, bringing computing
power where it is needed most. This work showcases the automotive use cases that are relevant for
MEC, providing insights into the technologies specified and investigated by the ETSI MEC Industry
Specification Group (ISG), who were the pioneer in creating a standardized computing platform
for advanced mobile networks with regards to network edge related use cases.
