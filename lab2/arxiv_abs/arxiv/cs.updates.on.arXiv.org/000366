A noise map facilitates the monitoring of environmental noise pollution in urban areas. However,
state-of-the-art techniques for rendering noise maps in urban areas are expensive and rarely updated,
as they rely on population and traffic models rather than on real data. Smart phone based urban sensing
can be leveraged to create an open and inexpensive platform for rendering up-to- date noise maps.
In this paper, we present the design, implementation and performance evaluation of an end-to-end,
context-aware, noise mapping system called Ear-Phone. Ear-Phone investigates the use of different
interpolation and regularization methods to address the fundamental problem of recovering the
noise map from incomplete and random samples obtained by crowdsourcing data collection. Ear-Phone,
implemented on Nokia N95, N97 and HP iPAQ, HTC One mobile devices, also addresses the challenge of
collecting accurate noise pollution readings at a mobile device. A major challenge of using smart
phones as sensors is that even at the same location, the sensor reading may vary depending on the phone
orientation and user context (for example, whether the user is carrying the phone in a bag or holding
it in her palm). To address this problem, Ear-Phone leverages context-aware sensing. We develop
classifiers to accurately determine the phone sensing context. Upon context discovery, Ear-Phone
automatically decides whether to sense or not. Ear-phone also implements in-situ calibration
which performs simple calibration that can be carried out without any technical skills whatsoever
required on the user's part. Extensive simulations and outdoor experiments demonstrate that Ear-Phone
is a feasible platform to assess noise pollution, incurring reasonable system resource consumption
at mobile devices and providing high reconstruction accuracy of the noise map.
