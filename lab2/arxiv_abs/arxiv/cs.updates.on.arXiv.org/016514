Concurrent multiscale finite element analysis (FE2) is a powerful approach for high-fidelity
modeling of materials for which a suitable macroscopic constitutive model is not available. However,
the extreme computational effort associated with computing a nested micromodel at every macroscopic
integration point makes FE2 prohibitive for most practical applications. Constructing surrogate
models able to efficiently compute the microscopic constitutive response is therefore a promising
approach in enabling concurrent multiscale modeling. This work presents a reduction framework
for adaptively constructing surrogate models based on statistical learning. The nested micromodels
are replaced by a machine learning surrogate model based on Gaussian Processes (GP). The need for
offline data collection is bypassed by training the GP models online based on data coming from a small
set of fully-solved anchor micromodels that undergo the same strain history as their associated
macro integration points. The Bayesian formalism inherent to GP models provides a natural tool
for uncertainty estimation through which new observations or inclusion of new anchors are triggered.
The surrogate constitutive manifold is constructed with as few micromechanical evaluations as
possible by enhancing the GP models with gradient information and the solution scheme is made robust
through a greedy data selection approach embedded within the conventional finite element solution
loop for nonlinear analysis. The sensitivity to model parameters is studied with a tapered bar example
with plasticity, while the applicability of the model to more complex cases is demonstrated with
the elastoplastic analysis of a plate with multiple cutouts and a crack growth example for mixed-mode
bending. Significant efficiency gains are obtained without resorting to offline training.
