We design the first learned index that solves the dictionary problem with time and space complexity
provably better than classic data structures for hierarchical memories, such as B-trees, and modern
learned indexes. We call our solution the Piecewise Geometric Model index (PGM-index) because
it turns the indexing of a sequence of keys into the coverage of a sequence of 2D-points via linear
models (i.e. segments) suitably learned to trade query time vs space efficiency. This idea comes
from some known heuristic results which we strengthen by showing that the minimal number of such
segments can be computed via known and optimal streaming algorithms. Our index is then obtained
by recursively applying this geometric idea that guarantees a smoothed adaptation to the "geometric
complexity" of the input data. Finally, we propose a variant of the index that adapts not only to the
distribution of the dictionary keys but also to their access frequencies, thus obtaining the first
distribution-aware learned index. The second main contribution of this paper is the proposal and
study of the concept of Multicriteria Data Structure, namely one that asks a data structure to adapt
in an automatic way to the constraints imposed by the application of use. We show that our index is
a multicriteria data structure because its significant flexibility in storage and query time can
be exploited by a properly designed optimisation algorithm that efficiently finds its best design
setting in order to match the input constraints. A thorough experimental analysis shows that our
index and its multicriteria variant improve uniformly, over both time and space, classic and learned
indexes up to several orders of magnitude.
