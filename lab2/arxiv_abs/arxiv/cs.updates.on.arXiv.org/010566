We consider the scenario where $N$ utilities strategically bid for electricity in the day-ahead
market and balance the mismatch between the committed supply and actual demand in the real-time
market. Each utility aims at minimizing its own cost of per-unit electricity by optimizing the bidding
strategy, with uncertainty in demand and local renewable generation taken into account. The per-unit
electricity cost of a utility is a function of both the day-ahead clearing price and the real-time
spot price affected by the market-level supply-demand mismatch. We model the interactions among
utilities as a non-cooperative game and study the equilibrium strategies. We show that all utilities
bidding according to (net load) prediction is a unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium with two salient
properties. First, it incurs no loss of efficiency; hence, the competition among utilities does
not increase the social cost. Second, it is robust and (0, $N-1$)-immune. Irrational fault behaviors
of any subset of the utilities only help reduce the costs of other rational utilities. We prove the
results hold for correlated prediction errors and a general class of real-time spot pricing models,
which capture the relationship between the spot price, the day-ahead clearing price, and the market-level
mismatch. Simulations based on real-world traces corroborate our theoretical results. Our study
highlights that the market operator can design real-time pricing schemes according to the sufficient
conditions derived in our paper, such that the day-ahead market admits a unique and efficient pure
strategy Nash Equilibrium and it is robust to irrational fault behaviors.
