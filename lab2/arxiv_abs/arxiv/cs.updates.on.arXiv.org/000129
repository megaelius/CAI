Given a zero-dimensional ideal I in K[x1,...,xn] of degree D, the transformation of the ordering
of its Groebner basis from DRL to LEX is a key step in polynomial system solving and turns out to be the
bottleneck of the whole solving process. Thus it is of crucial importance to design efficient algorithms
to perform the change of ordering. The main contributions of this paper are several efficient methods
for the change of ordering which take advantage of the sparsity of multiplication matrices in the
classical FGLM algorithm. Combing all these methods, we propose a deterministic top-level algorithm
that automatically detects which method to use depending on the input. As a by-product, we have a
fast implementation that is able to handle ideals of degree over 40000. Such an implementation outperforms
the Magma and Singular ones, as shown by our experiments. First for the shape position case, two methods
are designed based on the Wiedemann algorithm: the first is probabilistic and its complexity to
complete the change of ordering is O(D(N1+nlog(D))), where N1 is the number of nonzero entries of
a multiplication matrix; the other is deterministic and computes the LEX Groebner basis of the radical
of I via Chinese Remainder Theorem. Then for the general case, the designed method is characterized
by the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm from Coding Theory to handle the multi-dimensional
linearly recurring relations. Complexity analyses of all proposed methods are also provided.
Furthermore, for generic polynomial systems, we present an explicit formula for the estimation
of the sparsity of one main multiplication matrix, and prove its construction is free. With the asymptotic
analysis of such sparsity, we are able to show for generic systems the complexity above becomes $O(\sqrt{6/n
\pi} D^{2+(n-1)/n}})$.
