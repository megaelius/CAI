The contributions of this paper are two-fold. We define a new filtration called the cover filtration
built from a single cover based on a generalized Jaccard distance. We provide stability results
for the cover filtration and show how the construction is equivalent to the Cech filtration under
certain settings. We then develop a language and theory for stable paths within this filtration,
inspired by ideas of persistent homology. We demonstrate how the filtration and paths can be applied
to a variety of applications in which defining a metric is not obvious but a cover is readily available.
We demonstrate the usefulness of this construction by employing it in the context of recommendation
systems and explainable machine learning. We demonstrate a new perspective for modeling recommendation
system data sets that does not require manufacturing a bespoke metric. This extends work on graph-based
recommendation systems, allowing a topological perspective. For an explicit example, we look
at a movies data set and we find the stable paths identified in our framework represent a sequence
of movies constituting a gentle transition and ordering from one genre to another. For explainable
machine learning, we apply the Mapper for model induction, providing explanations in the form of
paths between subpopulations or observations. Our framework provides an alternative way of building
a filtration from a single mapper that is then used to explore stable paths. As a direct illustration,
we build a mapper from a supervised machine learning model trained on the FashionMNIST data set.
We show that the stable paths in the cover filtration provide improved explanations of relationships
between subpopulations of images.
