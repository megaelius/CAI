Distribution-level phasor measurement units, a.k.a, micro-PMUs, report a large volume of high
resolution phasor measurements which constitute a variety of event signatures of different phenomena
that occur all across power distribution feeders. In order to implement an event-based analysis
that has useful applications for the utility operator, one needs to extract these events from a large
volume of micro-PMU data. However, due to the infrequent, unscheduled, and unknown nature of the
events, it is often a challenge to even figure out what kind of events are out there to capture and scrutinize.
In this paper, we seek to address this open problem by developing an unsupervised approach, which
requires minimal prior human knowledge. First, we develop an unsupervised event detection method
based on the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). It works by training deep neural
networks that learn the characteristics of the normal trends in micro-PMU measurements; and accordingly
detect an event when there is any abnormality. We also propose a two-step unsupervised clustering
method, based on a novel linear mixed integer programming formulation. It helps us categorize events
based on their origin in the first step and their similarity in the second step. The active nature
of the proposed clustering method makes it capable of identifying new clusters of events on an ongoing
basis. The proposed unsupervised event detection and clustering methods are applied to real-world
micro-PMU data. Results show that they can outperform the prevalent methods in the literature.
These methods also facilitate our further analysis to identify important clusters of events that
lead to unmasking several use cases that could be of value to the utility operator.
