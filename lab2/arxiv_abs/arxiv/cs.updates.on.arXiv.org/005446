It is well-known that demand response can improve the system efficiency as well as lower consumers'
(prosumers') electricity bills. However, it is not clear how we can either qualitatively identify
the prosumer with the most impact potential or quantitatively estimate each prosumer's contribution
to the total social welfare improvement when additional resource capacity/flexibility is introduced
to the system with demand response, such as allowing net-selling behavior. In this work, we build
upon existing literature on the electricity market, which consists of price-taking prosumers
each with various appliances, an electric utility company and a social welfare optimizing distribution
system operator, to design a general sensitivity analysis approach (GSAA) that can estimate the
potential of each consumer's contribution to the social welfare when given more resource capacity.
GSAA is based on existence of an efficient competitive equilibrium, which we establish in the paper.
When prosumers' utility functions are quadratic, GSAA can give closed forms characterization
on social welfare improvement based on duality analysis. Furthermore, we extend GSAA to a general
convex settings, i.e., utility functions with strong convexity and Lipschitz continuous gradient.
Even without knowing the specific forms the utility functions, we can derive upper and lower bounds
of the social welfare improvement potential of each prosumer, when extra resource is introduced.
For both settings, several applications and numerical examples are provided: including extending
AC comfort zone, ability of EV to discharge and net selling. The estimation results show that GSAA
can be used to decide how to allocate potentially limited market resources in the most impactful
way.
