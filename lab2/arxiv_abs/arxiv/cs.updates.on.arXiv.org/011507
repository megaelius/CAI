Machine learning techniques have been widely used in attempts to forecast several solar datasets.
Most of these approaches employ supervised machine learning algorithms which are, in general,
very data hungry. This hampers the attempts to forecast some of these data series, particularly
the ones that depend on (relatively) recent space observations. Here we focus on an attempt to forecast
the solar surface longitudinally averaged radial magnetic field distribution using a form of spatial-temporal
neural networks. Given that the recording of these spatial-temporal datasets only started in 1975
and are therefore quite short, the forecasts are predictably quite modest. However, given that
there is a potential physical relationship between sunspots and the magnetic field, we employ another
machine learning technique called transfer learning which has recently received considerable
attention in the literature. Here, this approach consists in first training the source spatial-temporal
neural network on the much longer time/latitude sunspot area dataset, which starts in 1874, then
transferring the trained set of layers to a target network, and continue training the latter on the
magnetic field dataset. The employment of transfer learning in the field of computer vision is known
to obtain a generalized set of feature filters that can be reused for other datasets and tasks. Here
we obtain a similar result, whereby we first train the network on the spatial-temporal sunspot area
data, then the first few layers of the neural network are able to identify the two main features of
the solar cycle, i.e. the amplitude variation and the migration to the equator, and therefore can
be used to train on the magnetic field dataset and forecast better than a prediction based only on
the historical magnetic field data.
