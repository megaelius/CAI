It can be shown that each permutation group $G \sqsubseteq S_n$ can be embedded, in a well defined
sense, in a connected graph with $O(n+|G|)$ vertices. Some groups, however, require much fewer
vertices. For instance, $S_n$ itself can be embedded in the $n$-clique $K_n$, a connected graph
with n vertices. In this work, we show that the minimum size of a context-free grammar generating
a finite permutation group $G \sqsubseteq S_n$ can be upper bounded by three structural parameters
of connected graphs embedding $G$: the number of vertices, the treewidth, and the maximum degree.
More precisely, we show that any permutation group $G \sqsubseteq S_n$ that can be embedded into
a connected graph with $m$ vertices, treewidth k, and maximum degree $\Delta$, can also be generated
by a context-free grammar of size $2^{O(k\Delta\log\Delta)}\cdot m^{O(k)}$. By combining our
upper bound with a connection between the extension complexity of a permutation group and the grammar
complexity of a formal language, we also get that these permutation groups can be represented by
polytopes of extension complexity $2^{O(k \Delta\log \Delta)}\cdot m^{O(k)}$. The above upper
bounds can be used to provide trade-offs between the index of permutation groups, and the number
of vertices, treewidth and maximum degree of connected graphs embedding these groups. In particular,
by combining our main result with a celebrated $2^{\Omega(n)}$ lower bound on the grammar complexity
of the symmetric group $S_n$ we have that connected graphs of treewidth $o(n/\log n)$ and maximum
degree $o(n/\log n)$ embedding subgroups of $S_n$ of index $2^{cn}$ for some small constant $c$
must have $n^{\omega(1)}$ vertices. This lower bound can be improved to exponential on graphs of
treewidth $n^{\varepsilon}$ for $\varepsilon<1$ and maximum degree $o(n/\log n)$.
