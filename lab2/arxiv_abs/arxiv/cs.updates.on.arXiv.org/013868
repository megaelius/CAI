Airline scheduling poses some of the most challenging problems in the entire Operations Research
(OR) domain. In that, crew scheduling (CS) constitutes one of the most important and challenging
planning activities. Notably, the crew operating cost is the second-largest component of an airline's
total operating cost (after the fuel cost). Hence, its optimization promises enormous benefits,
and even marginal improvements may translate to annual savings worth millions of dollars for an
airline. However, CS is a combination of complex combinatorial optimization problems (with NP-hard
computational complexity), namely \textit{crew pairing} and \textit{crew assignment}, which
are solved sequentially. Here, \textit{crew pairing optimization} aims at generating a set of
flight sequences (each called a crew pairing) to cover a finite set of flight legs from an airline's
timetable at minimum cost, while satisfying several legality constraints linked to the federations'
safety rules, airline-specific regulations, labor laws, etc. Subsequently, \textit{crew assignment}
aims at assigning crew members to these optimal crew pairings. This research focuses on the critically
fundamental step of CS, in that, a crew pairing optimization problem (CPOP) is formulated, and an
optimization framework to solve the posed CPOP has been proposed. The distinctive contribution
of this research relates to \textit{its tackling of a large-scale complex flight network for an
airline (leading to more than a billion legal pairings/variables), and validation of the results
by the research consortium's Industrial partner, GE Aviation}.
