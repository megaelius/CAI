Using an order-theoretic framework, a novel achievable rate region is obtained for the general
$K$-receiver discrete memoryless broadcast channel over which two groupcast messages are to be
transmitted, with each message required by an arbitrary group of receivers. The associated achievability
scheme is an amalgamation of random coding techniques with novel features including {\em up-set}
message-splitting, message set expansion including the generation of possibly multiple auxiliary
codebooks for certain compositions of split messages using superposition coding with subset inclusion
order, partial interference decoding at all receivers in general, joint unique decoding at receivers
that desire both messages, and non-unique or indirect decoding at receivers that desire only one
of the two messages. While the generality of such a scheme implies that its rate region coincides
with all previously found capacity regions for special classes of broadcast channels with two private
or two {\em nested} groupcast messages, wherein the group of receivers desiring one message is contained
in that desiring the other, we show that, when specialized to the so-called {\em combination network},
our inner bound coincides with the capacity region for three different scenarios, namely, (a) the
two messages are intended for two distinct sets of $K{-}1$ receivers each and (b) two nested messages
in which one message is intended for one or (c) two (common) receivers and both messages are intended
for all other (private) receivers. Moreover, we show that there is a trade-off between the complexity
of the coding scheme and that of the distribution of the auxiliary random variables and the encoding
function that must be chosen to achieve the capacity region in these scenarios.
