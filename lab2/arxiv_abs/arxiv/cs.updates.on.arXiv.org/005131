This paper examines the dependence of network performance measures on network size and considers
scaling results for large networks. We connect two performance measures that are well studied,
but appear to be unrelated. The first measure is concerned with energy metrics, namely the $\Hcal_2$--norm
of a network, which arises in control theory applications. The second measure is concerned with
the notion of "tail risk" which arises in economic and financial networks. We study the question
of why such performance measures may deteriorate at a faster rate than the growth rate of the network.
We first focus on the energy metric and its well known connection to controllability Gramian of the
underlying dynamical system. We show that undirected networks exhibit the most graceful energy
growth rates as network size grows. This rate is quantified completely by the proximity of spectral
radius to unity or distance to instability. In contrast, we show that the simple characterization
of energy in terms of network spectrum does not exist for directed networks. We demonstrate that,
for any fixed distance to instability, energy of a directed network can grow at an exponentially
faster rate. We provide general methods for manipulating networks to reduce energy. In particular,
we prove that certain operations that increase the symmetry in a network cannot increase energy
(in an order sense). Secondly, we focus on tail risk in economic and financial networks. In contrast
to $\Hcal_2$--norm which arises from computing the expectation of energy in the network, tail risk
focuses on tail probability behavior of network variables. Although the two measures differ substantially
we show that they are precisely connected through the system Gramian. This surprising result explains
why topology considerations rather than specific performance measures dictate the large scale
behavior of networks.
