In this work, we investigate underlay radar-massive MIMO cellular coexistence in LoS/near-LoS
channels, where both systems are capable of 3D beamforming. The base station (BS) locations are
modeled using a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP), and a single radar is located at the center
of a circular exclusion zone (EZ) within which the BSs are prohibited from operating. We derive a
tight upper bound on the average interference power at the radar due to the massive MIMO downlink.
This is based on a novel construction in which each Poisson Voronoi (PV) cell is bounded by its circumcircle
in order to bound the effect of the random cell shapes on average interference. However, this model
is intractable for characterizing the interference distribution, due to the correlation between
the shapes/sizes of adjacent PV cells. Hence, we propose a tractable nominal interference model
where each PV cell is modeled as a circular disk with area equal to the average area of the typical cell.
We quantify the gap in the average interference power between these two models, and show that the
upper bound is tight for realistic deployment parameters. Under the nominal interference model,
we derive the equal interference contour in closed-form, and characterize the interference distribution
using the dominant interferer approximation. Finally, we use tractable expressions for the interference
distribution to characterize important radar performance metrics such as the spatial probability
of false alarm/detection in a quasi-static target tracking scenario. We validate the accuracy
of our analytical approximations using numerical results, which reveal useful trends in the average
interference as a function of the deployment parameters, and provide useful system design insights
in the form of radar receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for current and future radar-cellular
spectrum sharing scenarios.
