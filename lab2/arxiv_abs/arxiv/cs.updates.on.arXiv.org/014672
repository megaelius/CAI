Online search data is routinely used to monitor the nationwide prevalence of infectious diseases,
such as influenza. Previous work has focused on supervised learning solutions, where ground truth
information, in the form of historical syndromic surveillance reports, can be used to train machine
learning models. However, no sufficient data $-$in terms of validity, representativeness, and
time span$-$ exist to apply such approaches for monitoring the emerging COVID-19 infectious disease
pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, unsupervised, or semi-supervised
solutions should be sought. Recent outcomes have shown that it is possible to transfer an online
search based model for influenza-like illness from a source to a target country without using ground
truth data for the target location. The transferred model's accuracy depends on identifying the
correct search queries and corresponding weights via a transfer learning methodology. In this
work, we draw a parallel to previous findings and attempt to develop an unsupervised model for COVID-19
by: (i) carefully choosing search queries that refer to related symptoms as identified by a survey
from the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, and (ii) weighting them based on their reported
ratio of occurrence in people infected by COVID-19. Furthermore, understanding that online searches
can also be driven by concern rather than infections, we attempt to minimise this part of the signal
by incorporating a basic news media coverage metric. In addition, we propose a transfer learning
method for mapping supervised COVID-19 models from a country to another, in an effort to transfer
noisy knowledge from areas that are ahead in the epidemic curve. Finally, we conduct a correlation
and regression analysis to uncover potentially useful online search queries in relation to confirmed
COVID-19 cases.
