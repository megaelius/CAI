The performance of land surface models (LSMs) significantly affects the understanding of atmospheric
and related processes. Many of the LSMs' soil and vegetation parameters were unknown so that it is
crucially important to efficiently optimize them. Here I present a globally applicable and computationally
efficient method for parameter optimization and uncertainty assessment of the LSM by combining
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with machine learning. First, I performed the long-term (decadal
scales) ensemble simulation of the LSM, in which each ensemble member has different parameters'
values, and calculated the gap between simulation and observation, or the cost function, for each
ensemble member. Second, I developed the statistical machine learning based surrogate model,
which is computationally cheap but accurately mimics the relationship between parameters and
the cost function, by applying the Gaussian process regression to learn the model simulation. Third,
we applied MCMC by repeatedly driving the surrogate model to get the posterior probabilistic distribution
of parameters. Using satellite passive microwave brightness temperature observations, both
synthetic and real-data experiments in the Sahel region of west Africa were performed to optimize
unknown soil and vegetation parameters of the LSM. The primary findings are (1) the proposed method
is 50,000 times as fast as the direct application of MCMC to the full LSM; (2) the skill of the LSM to
simulate both soil moisture and vegetation dynamics can be improved; (3) I successfully quantify
the characteristics of equifinality by obtaining the full non-parametric probabilistic distribution
of parameters.
