In system development, epistemic uncertainty is an ever-present possibility when reasoning about
the causal factors during hazard analysis. Such uncertainty is common when complicated systems
interact with one another, and it is dangerous because it impairs hazard analysis and thus increases
the chance of overlooking unsafe situations. Uncertainty around causation thus needs to be managed
well. Unfortunately, existing hazard analysis techniques tend to ignore unknown uncertainties,
and system stakeholders rarely track known uncertainties well through the system lifecycle. In
this paper, we outline an approach to managing epistemic uncertainty in existing hazard analysis
techniques by focusing on known and unknown uncertainty. We have created a reference populated
with a wide range of safety-critical causal relationships to recognise unknown uncertainty, and
we have developed a model to systematically capture and track known uncertainty around such factors.
We have also defined a process for using the reference and model to assess possible causal factors
that are suspected during hazard analysis. To assess the applicability of our approach, we have
analysed the widely-used MoDAF architectural model and determined that there is potential for
our approach to identify additional causal factors that are not apparent from individual MoDAF
views. We have also reviewed an existing safety assessment example (the ARP4761 Aircraft System
analysis) and determined that our approach could indeed be incorporated into that process. We have
also integrated our approach into the STPA hazard analysis technique to demonstrate its feasibility
to incorporate into existing techniques. It is therefore plausible that our approach can increase
safety assurance provided by hazard analysis in the face of epistemic uncertainty.
