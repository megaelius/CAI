Internet of Things (IoT) devices have expanded the horizon of digital forensic investigations
by providing a rich set of new evidence sources. IoT devices includes health implants, sports wearables,
smart burglary alarms, smart thermostats, smart electrical appliances, and many more. Digital
evidence from these IoT devices is often extracted from third party sources, e.g., paired smartphone
applications or the devices' back-end cloud services. However vital digital evidence can still
reside solely on the IoT device itself. The specifics of the IoT device's hardware is a black-box
in many cases due to the lack of proven, established techniques to inspect IoT devices. This paper
presents a novel methodology to inspect the internal software activities of IoT devices through
their electromagnetic radiation emissions during live device investigation. When a running IoT
device is identified at a crime scene, forensically important software activities can be revealed
through an electromagnetic side-channel analysis (EM-SCA) attack. By using two representative
IoT hardware platforms, this work demonstrates that cryptographic algorithms running on high-end
IoT devices can be detected with over 82% accuracy, while minor software code differences in low-end
IoT devices could be detected over 90% accuracy using a neural network-based classifier. Furthermore,
it was experimentally demonstrated that malicious modification of the stock firmware of an IoT
device can be detected through machine learning-assisted EM-SCA techniques. These techniques
provide a new investigative vector for digital forensic investigators to inspect IoT devices.
