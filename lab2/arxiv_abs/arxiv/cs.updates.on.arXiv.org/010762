Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology to increase the spectral efficiency
and enable massive connectivity in 5G and future wireless networks. In contrast to orthogonal schemes,
such as OFDMA, NOMA multiplexes several users on the same frequency and time resource. Joint subcarrier
and power allocation problems (JSPA) in NOMA are NP-hard to solve in general. In this family of problems,
we consider the weighted sum-rate (WSR) objective function as it can achieve various tradeoffs
between sum-rate performance and user fairness. Because of JSPA's intractability, a common approach
in the literature is to solve separately the power control and subcarrier allocation (also known
as user selection) problems, therefore achieving sub-optimal result. In this work, we first improve
the computational complexity of existing single-carrier power control and user selection schemes.
These improved procedures are then used as basic building blocks to design new algorithms, namely
Opt-JSPA, $\varepsilon$-JSPA and Grad-JSPA. Opt-JSPA computes an optimal solution with lower
complexity than current optimal schemes in the literature. It can be used as a benchmark for optimal
WSR performance in simulations. However, its pseudo-polynomial time complexity remains impractical
for real-world systems with low latency requirements. To further reduce the complexity, we propose
a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme called $\varepsilon$-JSPA. Since, no approximation
has been studied in the literature, $\varepsilon$-JSPA stands out by allowing to control a tight
trade-off between performance guarantee and complexity. Finally, Grad-JSPA is a heuristic based
on gradient descent. Numerical results show that it achieves near-optimal WSR with much lower complexity
than existing optimal methods.
