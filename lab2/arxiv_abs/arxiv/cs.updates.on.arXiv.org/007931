The concept of `fake news' has been referenced and thrown around in news reports so much in recent
years that it has become a news topic in its own right. At its core, it poses a chilling question -- what
do we do if our worldview is fundamentally wrong? Even if internally consistent, what if it does not
match the real world? Are our beliefs justified, or could we become indoctrinated from living in
a `bubble'? If the latter is true, how could we even test the limits of said bubble from within its confines?
We propose a new method to augment the process of identifying fake news, by speeding up and automating
the more cumbersome and time-consuming tasks involved. Our application, NewsCompare takes any
list of target websites as input (news-related in our use case, but otherwise not restricted), visits
them in parallel and retrieves any text content found within. Web pages are subsequently compared
to each other, and similarities are tentatively pointed out. These results can be manually verified
in order to determine which websites tend to draw inspiration from one another. The data gathered
on every intermediate step can be queried and analyzed separately, and most notably we already use
the set of hyperlinks to and from the various websites we encounter to paint a sort of `map' of that
particular slice of the web. This map can then be cross-referenced and further strengthen the conclusion
that a particular grouping of sites with strong links to each other, and posting similar content,
are likely to share the same allegiance. We run our application on the Romanian news websites and
we draw several interesting observations.
