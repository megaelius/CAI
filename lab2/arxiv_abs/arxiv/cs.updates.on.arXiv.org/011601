Camera model identification refers to the problem of linking a picture to the camera model used to
shoot it. As this might be an enabling factor in different forensic applications to single out possible
suspects (e.g., detecting the author of child abuse or terrorist propaganda material), many accurate
camera model attribution methods have been developed in the literature. One of their main drawbacks,
however, is the typical closed-set assumption of the problem. This means that an investigated photograph
is always assigned to one camera model within a set of known ones present during investigation, i.e.,
training time, and the fact that the picture can come from a completely unrelated camera model during
actual testing is usually ignored. Under realistic conditions, it is not possible to assume that
every picture under analysis belongs to one of the available camera models. To deal with this issue,
in this paper, we present the first in-depth study on the possibility of solving the camera model
identification problem in open-set scenarios. Given a photograph, we aim at detecting whether
it comes from one of the known camera models of interest or from an unknown one. We compare different
feature extraction algorithms and classifiers specially targeting open-set recognition. We
also evaluate possible open-set training protocols that can be applied along with any open-set
classifier, observing that a simple of those alternatives obtains best results. Thorough testing
on independent datasets shows that it is possible to leverage a recently proposed convolutional
neural network as feature extractor paired with a properly trained open-set classifier aiming
at solving the open-set camera model attribution problem even to small-scale image patches, improving
over state-of-the-art available solutions.
