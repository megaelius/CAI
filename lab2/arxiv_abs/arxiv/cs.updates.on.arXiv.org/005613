It is crucial to provide compatible treatment schemes for a disease according to various symptoms
at different stages. However, most classification methods might be ineffective in accurately
classifying a disease that holds the characteristics of multiple treatment stages, various symptoms,
and multi-pathogenesis. Moreover, there are limited exchanges and cooperative actions in disease
diagnoses and treatments between different departments and hospitals. Thus, when new diseases
occur with atypical symptoms, inexperienced doctors might have difficulty in identifying them
promptly and accurately. Therefore, to maximize the utilization of the advanced medical technology
of developed hospitals and the rich medical knowledge of experienced doctors, a Disease Diagnosis
and Treatment Recommendation System (DDTRS) is proposed in this paper. First, to effectively identify
disease symptoms more accurately, a Density-Peaked Clustering Analysis (DPCA) algorithm is introduced
for disease-symptom clustering. In addition, association analyses on Disease-Diagnosis (D-D)
rules and Disease-Treatment (D-T) rules are conducted by the Apriori algorithm separately. The
appropriate diagnosis and treatment schemes are recommended for patients and inexperienced doctors,
even if they are in a limited therapeutic environment. Moreover, to reach the goals of high performance
and low latency response, we implement a parallel solution for DDTRS using the Apache Spark cloud
platform. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DDTRS realizes disease-symptom
clustering effectively and derives disease treatment recommendations intelligently and accurately.
