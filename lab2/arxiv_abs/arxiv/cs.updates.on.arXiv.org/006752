The smart vehicles construct Vehicle of Internet which can execute various intelligent services.
Although the computation capability of the vehicle is limited, multi-type of edge computing nodes
provide heterogeneous resources for vehicular services.When offloading the complicated service
to the vehicular edge computing node, the decision should consider numerous factors.The offloading
decision work mostly formulate the decision to a resource scheduling problem with single or multiple
objective function and some constraints, and explore customized heuristics algorithms. However,
offloading multiple data dependency tasks in a service is a difficult decision, as an optimal solution
must understand the resource requirement, the access network, the user mobility, and importantly
the data dependency. Inspired by recent advances in machine learning, we propose a knowledge driven
(KD) service offloading decision framework for Vehicle of Internet, which provides the optimal
policy directly from the environment. We formulate the offloading decision of multi-task in a service
as a long-term planning problem, and explores the recent deep reinforcement learning to obtain
the optimal solution. It considers the future data dependency of the following tasks when making
decision for a current task from the learned offloading knowledge. Moreover, the framework supports
the pre-training at the powerful edge computing node and continually online learning when the vehicular
service is executed, so that it can adapt the environment changes and learns policy that are sensible
in hindsight. The simulation results show that KD service offloading decision converges quickly,
adapts to different conditions, and outperforms the greedy offloading decision algorithm.
