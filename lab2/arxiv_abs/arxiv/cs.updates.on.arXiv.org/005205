News recommender systems are aimed to personalize users experiences and help them to discover relevant
articles from a large and dynamic search space. Therefore, news domain is a challenging scenario
for recommendations, due to its sparse user profiling, fast growing number of items, accelerated
item's value decay, and users preferences dynamic shift. Some promising results have been recently
achieved by the usage of Deep Learning techniques on Recommender Systems, specially for item's
feature extraction and for session-based recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks. In
this paper, it is proposed an instantiation of the CHAMELEON -- a Deep Learning Meta-Architecture
for News Recommender Systems. This architecture is composed of two modules, the first responsible
to learn news articles representations, based on their text and metadata, and the second module
aimed to provide session-based recommendations using Recurrent Neural Networks. The recommendation
task addressed in this work is next-item prediction for users sessions: "what is the next most likely
article a user might read in a session?" Users sessions context is leveraged by the architecture
to provide additional information in such extreme cold-start scenario of news recommendation.
Users' behavior and item features are both merged in an hybrid recommendation approach. A temporal
offline evaluation method is also proposed as a complementary contribution, for a more realistic
evaluation of such task, considering dynamic factors that affect global readership interests
like popularity, recency, and seasonality. Experiments with an extensive number of session-based
recommendation methods were performed and the proposed instantiation of CHAMELEON meta-architecture
obtained a significant relative improvement in top-n accuracy and ranking metrics (10% on Hit Rate
and 13% on MRR) over the best benchmark methods.
