Exponential growths of social media and micro-blogging sites not only provide platforms for empowering
freedom of expressions and individual voices but also enables people to express anti-social behaviour
like online harassment, cyberbullying, and hate speech. Numerous works have been proposed to utilize
these data for social and anti-social behaviours analysis, document characterization, and sentiment
analysis by predicting the contexts mostly for highly resourced languages such as English. However,
there are languages that are under-resources, e.g., South Asian languages like Bengali, Tamil,
Assamese, Telugu that lack of computational resources for the NLP tasks. In this paper, we provide
several classification benchmarks for Bengali, an \texttt{under-resourced language}. We prepared
three datasets of expressing hate, commonly used topics, and opinions for hate speech detection,
document classification, and sentiment analysis, respectively. We built the largest Bengali
word embedding models to date based on 250 million articles, which we call \texttt{BengFastText}.
We perform three different experiments, covering document classification, sentiment analysis,
and hate speech detection. We incorporate word embeddings into a Multichannel Convolutional-LSTM~(\texttt{MConv-LSTM})
network for predicting different types of hate speech, document classification, and sentiment
analysis. Experiments demonstrate that \texttt{BengFastText} can capture the semantics of words
from respective contexts correctly. Evaluations against several baseline embedding models,
e.g., Word2Vec and GloVe yield up to 92.30\%, 82.25\%, and 90.45\% F1-scores in case of document
classification, sentiment analysis, and hate speech detection, respectively during 5-fold cross-validation
tests.
