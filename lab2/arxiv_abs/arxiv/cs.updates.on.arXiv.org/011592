Is it feasible to create an analysis paradigm that can analyze and then accurately and quickly predict
known drugs from experimental data? PharML.Bind is a machine learning toolkit which is able to accomplish
this feat. Utilizing deep neural networks and big data, PharML.Bind correlates experimentally-derived
drug affinities and protein-ligand X-ray structures to create novel predictions. The utility
of PharML.Bind is in its application as a rapid, accurate, and robust prediction platform for discovery
and personalized medicine. This paper demonstrates that graph neural networks (GNNs) can be trained
to screen hundreds of thousands of compounds against thousands of targets in minutes, a vastly shorter
time than previous approaches. This manuscript presents results from training and testing using
the entirety of BindingDB after cleaning; this includes a test set with 19,708 X-ray structures
and 247,633 drugs, leading to 2,708,151 unique protein-ligand pairings. PharML.Bind achieves
a prodigious 98.3% accuracy on this test set in under 25 minutes. PharML.Bind is premised on the following
key principles: 1) speed and a high enrichment factor per unit compute time, provided by high-quality
training data combined with a novel GNN architecture and use of high-performance computing resources,
2) the ability to generalize to proteins and drugs outside of the training set, including those with
unknown active sites, through the use of an active-site-agnostic GNN mapping, and 3) the ability
to be easily integrated as a component of increasingly-complex prediction and analysis pipelines.
PharML.Bind represents a timely and practical approach to leverage the power of machine learning
to efficiently analyze and predict drug action on any practical scale and will provide utility in
a variety of discovery and medical applications.
