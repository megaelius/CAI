The discretization of surface intrinsic elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) pose
interesting challenges not seen in flat space. The discretization of these PDEs typically proceeds
by either parametrizing the surface, triangulating the surface, or embedding the surface in a higher
dimensional flat space. The closest point method (CPM) is an embedding method that represents surfaces
using a function that maps points in the embedding space to their closest points on the surface. In
the CPM, this mapping also serves as an extension operator that brings surface intrinsic data onto
the embedding space, allowing PDEs to be numerically approximated by standard methods in a narrow
tubular neighborhood of the surface. We focus here on numerically approximating the positive Helmholtz
equation, $\left(c-\Delta_{\mathcal{S}}\right)u=f,~c\in\mathbb{R}^+$ by the CPM. This yields
a large, sparse, and nonsymmetric system to solve. Herein, we develop restricted additive Schwarz
(RAS) and optimized restricted additive Schwarz (ORAS) solvers and preconditioners for this discrete
system. In particular, we develop a general strategy for computing overlapping partitions of the
computational domain, as well as defining the corresponding Dirichlet and Robin transmission
conditions. We demonstrate that the convergence of the ORAS solvers and preconditioners can be
improved by using a modified transmission condition where more than two overlapping subdomains
meet. Numerical experiments are provided for a variety of analytical and triangulated surfaces.
We find that ORAS solvers and preconditioners outperform their RAS counterparts, and that using
domain decomposition as a preconditioner gives faster convergence over using it as a solver. The
methods exhibit good parallel scalability over the range of process counts tested.
