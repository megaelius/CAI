Skyline computation is an increasingly popular query, with broad applicability in domains such
as healthcare, travel and finance. Given the recent trend to outsource databases and query evaluation,
and due to the proprietary and sometimes highly sensitivity nature of the data (e.g., in healthcare),
it is essential to evaluate skylines on encrypted datasets. Several research efforts acknowledged
the importance of secure skyline computation, but existing solutions suffer from at least one of
the following shortcomings: (i) they only provide ad-hoc security; (ii) they are prohibitively
expensive; or (iii) they rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as the presence of multiple non-colluding
parties in the protocol. Inspired from solutions for secure nearest-neighbors (NN) computation,
we conjecture that the most secure and efficient way to compute skylines is through result materialization.
However, this approach is significantly more challenging for skylines than for NN queries. We exhaustively
study and provide algorithms for pre-computation of skyline results, and we perform an in-depth
theoretical analysis of this process. We show that pre-computing results while minimizing storage
overhead is NP-hard, and we provide dynamic programming and greedy heuristics that solve the problem
more efficiently, while maintaining storage at reasonable levels. Our algorithms are novel and
applicable to plain-text skyline computation, but we focus on the encrypted setting where materialization
reduces the cost of skyline computation from hours to seconds. Extensive experiments show that
we clearly outperform existing work in terms of performance, and our security analysis proves that
we obtain a smaller (and quantifiable) data leakage than competitors.
