Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is an important problem in many fields. Accurate forecasting
results can effectively help decision-making. Variables in MTS have rich relations among each
other and the value of each variable in MTS depends both on its historical values and on other variables.
These rich relations can be static and predictable or dynamic and latent. Existing methods do not
incorporate these rich relational information into modeling or only model certain relation among
MTS variables. To jointly model rich relations among variables and temporal dependencies within
the time series, a novel end-to-end deep learning model, termed Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
via Heterogenous Graph Neural Networks (MTHetGNN) is proposed in this paper. To characterize rich
relations among variables, a relation embedding module is introduced in our model, where each variable
is regarded as a graph node and each type of edge represents a specific relationship among variables
or one specific dynamic update strategy to model the latent dependency among variables. In addition,
convolutional neural network (CNN) filters with different perception scales are used for time
series feature extraction, which is used to generate the feature of each node. Finally, heterogenous
graph neural networks are adopted to handle the complex structural information generated by temporal
embedding module and relation embedding module. Three benchmark datasets from the real world are
used to evaluate the proposed MTHetGNN and the comprehensive experiments show that MTHetGNN achieves
state-of-the-art results in MTS forecasting task.
