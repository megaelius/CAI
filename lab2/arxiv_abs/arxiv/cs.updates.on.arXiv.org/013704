Electronic health records (EHR) are characterized as non-stationary, heterogeneous, noisy,
and sparse data; therefore, it is challenging to learn the regularities or patterns inherent within
them. In particular, sparseness caused mostly by many missing values has attracted the attention
of researchers, who have attempted to find a better use of all available samples for determining
the solution of a primary target task through the defining a secondary imputation problem. Methodologically,
existing methods, either deterministic or stochastic, have applied different assumptions to
impute missing values. However, once the missing values are imputed, most existing methods do not
consider the fidelity or confidence of the imputed values in the modeling of downstream tasks. Undoubtedly,
an erroneous or improper imputation of missing variables can cause difficulties in modeling as
well as a degraded performance. In this study, we present a novel variational recurrent network
that (i) estimates the distribution of missing variables allowing to represent uncertainty in
the imputed values, (ii) updates hidden states by explicitly applying fidelity based on a variance
of the imputed values during a recurrence (i.e., uncertainty propagation over time), and (iii)
predicts the possibility of in-hospital mortality. It is noteworthy that our model can conduct
these procedures in a single stream and learn all network parameters jointly in an end-to-end manner.
We validated the effectiveness of our method using the public datasets of MIMIC-III and PhysioNet
challenge 2012 by comparing with and outperforming other state-of-the-art methods for mortality
prediction considered in our experiments. In addition, we identified the behavior of the model
that well represented the uncertainties for the imputed estimates, which indicated a high correlation
between the calculated MAE and the uncertainty.
