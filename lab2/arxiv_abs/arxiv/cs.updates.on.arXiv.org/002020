Phone sensors could be useful in assessing changes in gait that occur with alcohol consumption.
This study determined (1) feasibility of collecting gait-related data during drinking occasions
in the natural environment, and (2) how gait-related features measured by phone sensors relate
to estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC). Ten young adult heavy drinkers were prompted
to complete a 5-step gait task every hour from 8pm to 12am over four consecutive weekends. We collected
3-xis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data from phone sensors, and computed 24 gait-related
features using a sliding window technique. eBAC levels were calculated at each time point based
on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of alcohol use. We used an artificial neural network model
to analyze associations between sensor features and eBACs in training (70% of the data) and validation
and test (30% of the data) datasets. We analyzed 128 data points where both eBAC and gait-related
sensor data was captured, either when not drinking (n=60), while eBAC was ascending (n=55) or eBAC
was descending (n=13). 21 data points were captured at times when the eBAC was greater than the legal
limit (0.08 mg/dl). Using a Bayesian regularized neural network, gait-related phone sensor features
showed a high correlation with eBAC (Pearson's r > 0.9), and >95% of estimated eBAC would fall between
-0.012 and +0.012 of actual eBAC. It is feasible to collect gait-related data from smartphone sensors
during drinking occasions in the natural environment. Sensor-based features can be used to infer
gait changes associated with elevated blood alcohol content.
