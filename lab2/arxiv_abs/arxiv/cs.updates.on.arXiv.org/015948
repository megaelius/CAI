Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can effectively control the wavefront of the impinging signals,
and has emerged as a promising way to improve the energy and spectrum efficiency of wireless communication
systems. Most existing studies were conducted with an assumption that the hardware operations
are perfect without any impairment. However, both physical transceiver and IRS suffer from non-negligible
hardware impairments in practice, which will bring some major challenges, e.g., increasing the
difficulty and complexity of the beamforming designs, and degrading the system performance. In
this paper, by taking hardware impairments into consideration, we make the transmit and reflect
beamforming designs and evaluate the system performance. First, we utilize the linear minimum
mean square error estimator to make the channel estimations, and analyze the factors that affect
estimation accuracy. Then, we derive the optimal transmit beamforming vector, and propose a gradient
descent method-based algorithm to obtain a sub-optimal reflect beamforming solution. Next, we
analyze the asymptotic channel capacities by considering two types of asymptotics with respect
to the transmit power and the numbers of antennas and reflecting elements. Finally, we analyze the
power scaling law and the energy efficiency. By comparing the performance of our proposed algorithm
with the upper bound on the performance of global optimal reflect beamforming solution, the simulation
results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can offer an outstanding performance with low
computational complexity. The simulation results also show that there is no need to cost a lot on
expensive antennas to achieve both high spectral efficiency and energy efficiency when the communication
system is assisted by an IRS and suffer from hardware impairments.
