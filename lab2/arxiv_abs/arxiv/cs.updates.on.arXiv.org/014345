Recent results in the theoretical study of deep learning have shown that the optimization dynamics
of wide neural networks exhibit a surprisingly simple behaviour. In this work, we study the optimization
dynamics of hypernetworks, which are architectures in which a learned meta-network produces the
weights of a task-specific primary network. Hypernetworks have been demonstrated repeatedly
to obtain state of the art results. However, their theoretical understanding is still lacking.
As can be expected, the optimization process of multiplicative models is much more complicated
than optimizing standard ReLU networks. It is shown that for an infinitely wide neural network with
a gating layer the cost function cannot be accurately approximated by it first order Taylor approximation.
Specifically, for a fixed sized primary network of depth H, the first H terms of the Taylor approximation
of the cost function are non-zero, even when the meta-network is infinitely wide. However, for an
infinitely wide meta and primary networks, the learning dynamics is determined by a linear model
obtained from the first-order Taylor expansion of the network around its initial parameters and
the kernel of this process is given by the Hadamard product of the kernels induced by the meta and primary
networks. As part of our study, we partially solve an open problem suggested by Dyer & Gur-Ari (2020)
and show that the convergence rate of the r order term of the Taylor expansion of the cost function,
along the optimization trajectories of SGD is n^{1-r}, where n is the width of the learned neural
network, improving upon the n^{-1} bound suggested by the conjecture of Dyer & Gur-Ari, while matching
their empirical observations.
