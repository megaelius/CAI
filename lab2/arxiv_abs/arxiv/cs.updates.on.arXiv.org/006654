Network inference has been attracting increasing attention in several fields, notably systems
biology, control engineering and biomedicine. To develop a therapy, it is essential to understand
the connectivity of biochemical units and the internal working mechanisms of the target network.
A network is mainly characterized by its topology and internal dynamics. In particular, sparse
topology and stable system dynamics are fundamental properties of many real-world networks. In
recent years, kernel-based methods have been popular in the system identification community.
By incorporating empirical Bayes, this framework, which we call KEB, is able to promote system stability
and impose sparse network topology. Nevertheless, KEB may not be ideal for topology detection due
to local optima and numerical errors. Here, therefore, we propose an alternative, data-driven,
method that is designed to greatly improve inference accuracy, compared with KEB. The proposed
method uses dynamical structure functions to describe networks so that the information of unmeasurable
nodes is encoded in the model. A powerful numerical sampling method, namely reversible jump Markov
chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), is applied to explore full Bayesian models effectively. Monte Carlo
simulations indicate that our approach produces more accurate networks compared with KEB methods.
Furthermore, simulations of a synthetic biological network demonstrate that the performance
of the proposed method is superior to that of the state-of-the-art method, namely iCheMA. The implication
is that the proposed method can be used in a wide range of applications, such as controller design,
machinery fault diagnosis and therapy development.
