With the evolution of the cloud and customer centric culture, we inherently accumulate huge repositories
of textual reviews, feedback, and support data.This has driven enterprises to seek and research
engagement patterns, user network analysis, topic detections, etc.However, huge manual work
is still necessary to mine data to be able to mine actionable outcomes. In this paper, we proposed
and developed an innovative Semi-Supervised Learning approach by utilizing Deep Learning and
Topic Modeling to have a better understanding of the user voice.This approach combines a BERT-based
multiclassification algorithm through supervised learning combined with a novel Probabilistic
and Semantic Hybrid Topic Inference (PSHTI) Model through unsupervised learning, aiming at automating
the process of better identifying the main topics or areas as well as the sub-topics from the textual
feedback and support.There are three major break-through: 1.As the advancement of deep learning
technology, there have been tremendous innovations in the NLP field, yet the traditional topic
modeling as one of the NLP applications lag behind the tide of deep learning. In the methodology and
technical perspective, we adopt transfer learning to fine-tune a BERT-based multiclassification
system to categorize the main topics and then utilize the novel PSHTI model to infer the sub-topics
under the predicted main topics. 2.The traditional unsupervised learning-based topic models
or clustering methods suffer from the difficulty of automatically generating a meaningful topic
label, but our system enables mapping the top words to the self-help issues by utilizing domain knowledge
about the product through web-crawling. 3.This work provides a prominent showcase by leveraging
the state-of-the-art methodology in the real production to help shed light to discover user insights
and drive business investment priorities.
