The classical lemma of Ore-DeMillo-Lipton-Schwartz-Zippel [Ore22,DL78,Zip79,Sch80] states
that any nonzero polynomial $f(x_1,\ldots, x_n)$ of degree at most $s$ will evaluate to a nonzero
value at some point on a grid $S^n \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$ with $|S| > s$. Thus, there is an explicit
hitting set for all $n$-variate degree $s$, size $s$ algebraic circuits of size $(s+1)^n$. In this
paper, we prove the following results: - Let $\epsilon > 0$ be a constant. For a sufficiently large
constant $n$ and all $s > n$, if we have an explicit hitting set of size $(s+1)^{n-\epsilon}$ for the
class of $n$-variate degree $s$ polynomials that are computable by algebraic circuits of size $s$,
then for all $s$, we have an explicit hitting set of size $s^{\exp \circ \exp (O(\log^\ast s))}$ for
$s$-variate circuits of degree $s$ and size $s$. That is, if we can obtain a barely non-trivial exponent
compared to the trivial $(s+1)^{n}$ sized hitting set even for constant variate circuits, we can
get an almost complete derandomization of PIT. - The above result holds when "circuits" are replaced
by "formulas" or "algebraic branching programs". This extends a recent surprising result of Agrawal,
Ghosh and Saxena [AGS18] who proved the same conclusion for the class of algebraic circuits, if the
hypothesis provided a hitting set of size at most $(s^{n^{0.5 - \delta}})$ (where $\delta>0$ is
any constant). Hence, our work significantly weakens the hypothesis of Agrawal, Ghosh and Saxena
to only require a slightly non-trivial saving over the trivial hitting set, and also presents the
first such result for algebraic branching programs and formulas.
