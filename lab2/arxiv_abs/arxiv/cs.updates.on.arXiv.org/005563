High resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is desirable in many clinical applications due
to its contribution to more accurate subsequent analyses and early clinical diagnoses. Single
image super resolution (SISR) is an effective and cost efficient alternative technique to improve
the spatial resolution of MR images. In the past few years, SISR methods based on deep learning techniques,
especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural images. However, the information is gradually weakened and training becomes increasingly
difficult as the network deepens. The problem is more serious for medical images because lacking
high quality and effective training samples makes deep models prone to underfitting or overfitting.
Nevertheless, many current models treat the hierarchical features on different channels equivalently,
which is not helpful for the models to deal with the hierarchical features discriminatively and
targetedly. To this end, we present a novel channel splitting network (CSN) to ease the representational
burden of deep models. The proposed CSN model divides the hierarchical features into two branches,
i.e., residual branch and dense branch, with different information transmissions. The residual
branch is able to promote feature reuse, while the dense branch is beneficial to the exploration
of new features. Besides, we also adopt the merge-and-run mapping to facilitate information integration
between different branches. Extensive experiments on various MR images, including proton density
(PD), T1 and T2 images, show that the proposed CSN model achieves superior performance over other
state-of-the-art SISR methods.
