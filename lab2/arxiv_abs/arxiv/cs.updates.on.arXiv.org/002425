The rapid growth of IoT era is shaping the future of mobile services. Advanced communication technology
enables a heterogeneous connectivity where mobile devices broadcast information to everything.
Mobile applications such as robotics and vehicles connecting to cloud and surroundings transfer
the short-range on-board sensor perception system to long-range mobile-sensing perception system.
However, the mobile sensing perception brings new challenges for how to efficiently analyze and
intelligently interpret the deluge of IoT data in mission- critical services. In this article,
we model the challenges as latency, packet loss and measurement noise which severely deteriorate
the reliability and quality of IoT data. We integrate the artificial intelligence into IoT to tackle
these challenges. We propose a novel architecture that leverages recurrent neural networks (RNN)
and Kalman filtering to anticipate motions and interac- tions between objects. The basic idea is
to learn environment dynamics by recurrent networks. To improve the robustness of IoT communication,
we use the idea of Kalman filtering and deploy a prediction and correction step. In this way, the architecture
learns to develop a biased belief between prediction and measurement in the different situation.
We demonstrate our approach with synthetic and real-world datasets with noise that mimics the challenges
of IoT communications. Our method brings a new level of IoT intelligence. It is also lightweight
compared to other state-of-the-art convolutional recurrent architecture and is ideally suitable
for the resource-limited mobile applications.
