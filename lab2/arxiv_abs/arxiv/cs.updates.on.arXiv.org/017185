This paper is designed to increase knowledge and understanding of time-varying matrix problems
and Zeroing Neural Networks in the numerical analysis community of the west. Zeroing neural networks
(ZNN) were invented 20 years ago in China and almost all of their advances have been made in and still
come from its birthplace. ZNN methods have become a backbone for solving discretized sensor driven
time-varying matrix problems in real-time, in theory and in on-chip applications for robots, in
control theory and engineering in general. They have become the method of choice for many time-varying
matrix problems that benefit from or require efficient, accurate and predictive real-time computations.
The typical ZNN algorithm needs seven distinct steps for its set-up. The construction of ZNN algorithms
starts with an error equation and the stipulation that the error function decrease exponentially
fast. The error function DE is then mated with a convergent look-ahead finite difference formula
to create a derivative free computer code that predicts the future state of the system reliably from
current and earlier state data. Matlab codes for ZNN typically consist of one linear equations solve
and one short recursion of current and previous state data per time step. This makes ZNN based algorithms
highly competitive with ODE IVP path following or homotopy methods that are not designed to work
with constant sampling gap incoming sensor data but rather work adaptively. To illustrate the easy
adaptability of ZNN and further the understanding of ZNN, this paper details the seven set-up steps
for 11 separate time-varying problems and supplies the codes for six. Open problems are mentioned
as well as detailed references to recent work on each of the treated problems.
