This article summarizes key results of our work on experimental characterization and analysis
of latency variation and latency-reliability trade-offs in modern DRAM chips, which was published
in SIGMETRICS 2016, and examines the work's significance and future potential. The goal of this
work is to (i) experimentally characterize and understand the latency variation across cells within
a DRAM chip for these three fundamental DRAM operations, and (ii) develop new mechanisms that exploit
our understanding of the latency variation to reliably improve performance. To this end, we comprehensively
characterize 240 DRAM chips from three major vendors, and make six major new observations about
latency variation within DRAM. Notably, we find that (i) there is large latency variation across
the cells for each of the three operations; (ii) variation characteristics exhibit significant
spatial locality: slower cells are clustered in certain regions of a DRAM chip; and (iii) the three
fundamental operations exhibit different reliability characteristics when the latency of each
operation is reduced. Based on our observations, we propose Flexible-LatencY DRAM (FLY-DRAM),
a mechanism that exploits latency variation across DRAM cells within a DRAM chip to improve system
performance. The key idea of FLY-DRAM is to exploit the spatial locality of slower cells within DRAM,
and access the faster DRAM regions with reduced latencies for the fundamental operations. Our evaluations
show that FLY-DRAM improves the performance of a wide range of applications by 13.3%, 17.6%, and
19.5%, on average, for each of the three different vendors' real DRAM chips, in a simulated 8-core
system.
