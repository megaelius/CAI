Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common clinical syndrome characterized by the rapid loss of kidney
excretory function, which aggravates the clinical severity of other diseases in a large number
of hospitalized patients. Accurate early prediction of AKI can enable in-time interventions and
treatments. However, AKI is highly heterogeneous, thus identification of AKI sub-phenotypes
can lead to an improved understanding of the disease pathophysiology and development of more targeted
clinical interventions. This study used a memory network-based deep learning approach to discover
predictive AKI sub-phenotypes using structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR)
data of patients before AKI diagnosis. We leveraged a real world critical care EHR corpus including
37,486 ICU stays. Our approach identified three distinct sub-phenotypes: sub-phenotype I is with
an average age of 63.03$ \pm 17.25 $ years, and is characterized by mild loss of kidney excretory function
(Serum Creatinne (SCr) $1.55\pm 0.34$ mg/dL, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Test (eGFR)
$107.65\pm 54.98$ mL/min/1.73$m^2$). These patients are more likely to develop stage I AKI. Sub-phenotype
II is with average age 66.81$ \pm 10.43 $ years, and was characterized by severe loss of kidney excretory
function (SCr $1.96\pm 0.49$ mg/dL, eGFR $82.19\pm 55.92$ mL/min/1.73$m^2$). These patients
are more likely to develop stage III AKI. Sub-phenotype III is with average age 65.07$ \pm 11.32 $
years, and was characterized moderate loss of kidney excretory function and thus more likely to
develop stage II AKI (SCr $1.69\pm 0.32$ mg/dL, eGFR $93.97\pm 56.53$ mL/min/1.73$m^2$). Both
SCr and eGFR are significantly different across the three sub-phenotypes with statistical testing
plus postdoc analysis, and the conclusion still holds after age adjustment.
