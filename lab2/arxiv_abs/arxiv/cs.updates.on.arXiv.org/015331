Lip reading has received increasing attention in recent years. This paper focuses on the synergy
of multilingual lip reading. There are more than 7,000 languages in the world, which implies that
it is impractical to train separate lip reading models by collecting large-scale data per language.
Although each language has its own linguistic and pronunciation features, the lip movements of
all languages share similar patterns. Based on this idea, in this paper, we try to explore the synergized
learning of multilingual lip reading, and further propose a synchronous bidirectional learning(SBL)
framework for effective synergy of multilingual lip reading. Firstly, we introduce the phonemes
as our modeling units for the multilingual setting. Similar phoneme always leads to similar visual
patterns. The multilingual setting would increase both the quantity and the diversity of each phoneme
shared among different languages. So the learning for the multilingual target should bring improvement
to the prediction of phonemes. Then, a SBL block is proposed to infer the target unit when given its
previous and later context. The rules for each specific language which the model itself judges to
be is learned in this fill-in-the-blank manner. To make the learning process more targeted at each
particular language, we introduce an extra task of predicting the language identity in the learning
process. Finally, we perform a thorough comparison on LRW (English) and LRW-1000(Mandarin). The
results outperform the existing state of the art by a large margin, and show the promising benefits
from the synergized learning of different languages.
