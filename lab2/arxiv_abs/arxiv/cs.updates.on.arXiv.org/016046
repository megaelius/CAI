We study the problem of randomized information dissemination in networks. We compare the now standard
PUSH-PULL protocol, with agent-based alternatives where information is disseminated by a collection
of agents performing independent random walks. In the VISIT-EXCHANGE protocol, both nodes and
agents store information, and each time an agent visits a node, the two exchange all the information
they have. In the MEET-EXCHANGE protocol, only the agents store information, and exchange their
information with each agent they meet. We consider the broadcast time of a single piece of information
in an $n$-node graph for the above three protocols, assuming a linear number of agents that start
from the stationary distribution. We observe that there are graphs on which the agent-based protocols
are significantly faster than PUSH-PULL, and graphs where the converse is true. We attribute the
good performance of agent-based algorithms to their inherently fair bandwidth utilization, and
conclude that, in certain settings, agent-based information dissemination, separately or in
combination with PUSH-PULL, can significantly improve the broadcast time. The graphs considered
above are highly non-regular. Our main technical result is that on any regular graph of at least logarithmic
degree, PUSH-PULL and VISIT-EXCHANGE have the same asymptotic broadcast time. The proof uses a
novel coupling argument which relates the random choices of vertices in PUSH-PULL with the random
walks in VISIT-EXCHANGE. Further, we show that the broadcast time of MEET-EXCHANGE is asymptotically
at least as large as the other two's on all regular graphs, and strictly larger on some regular graphs.
As far as we know, this is the first systematic and thorough comparison of the running times of these
very natural information dissemination protocols.
