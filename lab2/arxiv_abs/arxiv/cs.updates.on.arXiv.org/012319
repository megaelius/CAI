The "flexible boundary condition method", introduced by Sinclair and coworkers in the 1970s, remains
among the most popular methods for simulating isolated two-dimensional crystalline defects,
embedded in an effectively infinite atomistic domain. In essence, the method can be characterized
as a domain decomposition method which iterates between a local anharmonic and a global harmonic
problem, where the latter is solved by means of the lattice Green function of the ideal crystal. This
local/global splitting gives rise to tremendously improved convergence rates over related alternating
Schwarz methods. In a previous publication (Hodapp et al., 2019, Comput. Methods in Appl. Mech.
Eng. 348), we have shown that this method also applies to large-scale three-dimensional problems,
possibly involving hundreds of thousands of atoms, using fast summation techniques exploiting
the low-rank nature of the asymptotic lattice Green function. Here, we generalize the Sinclair
method to bounded domains using a discrete boundary element method to correct the infinite solution
with respect to a prescribed far-field condition, thus preserving the advantage of the original
method of not requiring a global spatial discretization. Moreover, we present a detailed convergence
analysis and show for a one-dimensional problem that the method is unconditionally stable under
physically motivated assumptions. To further improve the convergence behavior, we develop an
acceleration technique based on a relaxation of the transmission conditions between the two subproblems.
Numerical examples for linear and nonlinear problems are presented to validate the proposed methodology.
