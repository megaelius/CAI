In today's legal environment, lawsuits and regulatory investigations require companies to embark
upon increasingly intensive data-focused engagements to identify, collect and analyze large
quantities of data. When documents are staged for review the process can require companies to dedicate
an extraordinary level of resources, both with respect to human resources, but also with respect
to the use of technology-based techniques to intelligently sift through data. For several years,
attorneys have been using a variety of tools to conduct this exercise, and most recently, they are
accepting the use of machine learning techniques like text classification to efficiently cull
massive volumes of data to identify responsive documents for use in these matters. In recent years,
a group of AI and Machine Learning researchers have been actively researching Explainable AI. In
an explainable AI system, actions or decisions are human understandable. In typical legal `document
review' scenarios, a document can be identified as responsive, as long as one or more of the text snippets
in a document are deemed responsive. In these scenarios, if predictive coding can be used to locate
these responsive snippets, then attorneys could easily evaluate the model's document classification
decision. When deployed with defined and explainable results, predictive coding can drastically
enhance the overall quality and speed of the document review process by reducing the time it takes
to review documents. The authors of this paper propose the concept of explainable predictive coding
and simple explainable predictive coding methods to locate responsive snippets within responsive
documents. We also report our preliminary experimental results using the data from an actual legal
matter that entailed this type of document review.
