The concept of ensemble learning offers a promising avenue in learning from data streams under complex
environments because it addresses the bias and variance dilemma better than its single model counterpart
and features a reconfigurable structure, which is well suited to the given context. While various
extensions of ensemble learning for mining non-stationary data streams can be found in the literature,
most of them are crafted under a static base classifier and revisits preceding samples in the sliding
window for a retraining step. This feature causes computationally prohibitive complexity and
is not flexible enough to cope with rapidly changing environments. Their complexities are often
demanding because it involves a large collection of offline classifiers due to the absence of structural
complexities reduction mechanisms and lack of an online feature selection mechanism. A novel evolving
ensemble classifier, namely Parsimonious Ensemble pENsemble, is proposed in this paper. pENsemble
differs from existing architectures in the fact that it is built upon an evolving classifier from
data streams, termed Parsimonious Classifier pClass. pENsemble is equipped by an ensemble pruning
mechanism, which estimates a localized generalization error of a base classifier. A dynamic online
feature selection scenario is integrated into the pENsemble. This method allows for dynamic selection
and deselection of input features on the fly. pENsemble adopts a dynamic ensemble structure to output
a final classification decision where it features a novel drift detection scenario to grow the ensemble
structure. The efficacy of the pENsemble has been numerically demonstrated through rigorous numerical
studies with dynamic and evolving data streams where it delivers the most encouraging performance
in attaining a tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.
