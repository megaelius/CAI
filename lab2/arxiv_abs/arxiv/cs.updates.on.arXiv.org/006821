We consider the standard broadcast setup with a single server broadcasting information to a number
of clients, each of which contains local storage (called \textit{cache}) of some size, which can
store some parts of the available files at the server. The centralized coded caching framework,
introduced in \cite{MaN}, consists of a caching phase and a delivery phase, both of which are carefully
designed in order to use the cache and the channel together optimally. Starting from \cite{MaN},
various combinatorial structures have been used to construct coded caching schemes. In this work,
we propose a binary matrix model to construct the coded caching scheme. The ones in such a \textit{caching
matrix} indicate uncached subfiles at the users. Identity submatrices of the caching matrix represent
transmissions in the delivery phase. Using this model, we then propose several novel constructions
for coded caching based on the various types of combinatorial designs. While most of the schemes
constructed in this work (based on existing designs) have a high cache requirement (uncached fraction
being $\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}})$ or $\Theta(\frac{1}{K})$, $K$ being the number of users),
they provide a rate that is either constant or decreasing ($O(\frac{1}{K})$) with increasing $K$,
and moreover require competitively small levels of subpacketization (being $O(K^i), 1\leq i\leq
3$), which is an extremely important parameter in practical applications of coded caching. We mark
this work as an another attempt to exploit the well-developed theory of combinatorial designs for
the problem of constructing caching schemes, utilizing the binary caching model we develop.
