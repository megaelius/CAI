The HEP community is approaching an era were the excellent performances of the particle accelerators
in delivering collision at high rate will force the experiments to record a large amount of information.
The growing size of the datasets could potentially become a limiting factor in the capability to
produce scientific results timely and efficiently. Recently, new technologies and new approaches
have been developed in industry to answer to the necessity to retrieve information as quickly as
possible to analyze PB and EB datasets. Providing the scientists with these modern computing tools
will lead to rethinking the principles of data analysis in HEP, making the overall scientific process
faster and smoother. In this paper, we are presenting the latest developments and the most recent
results on the usage of Apache Spark for HEP analysis. The study aims at evaluating the efficiency
of the application of the new tools both quantitatively, by measuring the performances, and qualitatively,
focusing on the user experience. The first goal is achieved by developing a data reduction facility:
working together with CERN Openlab and Intel, CMS replicates a real physics search using Spark-based
technologies, with the ambition of reducing 1 PB of public data in 5 hours, collected by the CMS experiment,
to 1 TB of data in a format suitable for physics analysis. The second goal is achieved by implementing
multiple physics use-cases in Apache Spark using as input preprocessed datasets derived from official
CMS data and simulation. By performing different end-analyses up to the publication plots on different
hardware, feasibility, usability and portability are compared to the ones of a traditional ROOT-based
workflow.
