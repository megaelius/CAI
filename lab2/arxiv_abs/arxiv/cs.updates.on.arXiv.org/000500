The present report deals with the modeling of the long-term throughput, a.k.a., send rate, of the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) under the following assumptions. (i) We consider a single
'infinite source' using a network path from sender to receiver. (ii) Each TCP packet is randomly
dropped with probability p; independently of previous drops or any other event/parameter. (iii)
The - never changing - receiver window limits the amount of outstanding data. (iv) The receiver acknowledges
every packet. (v) The TCP modeled here conforms to the publicly available standards (RFCs) as concerns
congestion control. We validate and determine the limits of the different models proposed here
using packet-level simulations. The contributions of the present work are the following: (a) We
determine three regimes, and their conditions of applicability, depending on p: Linear law regime,
square root law regime, and timeout regime. (b) As concerns the relationship between the linear
and square root regimes, we give additional insights relatively to previously published work.
(c) We give the exact equations governing the TCP send rate in any regime. (d) From the exact equation
and under the further condition that the path is not saturated, we give and discuss approximations
for the send rate of the NewReno variant of TCP. A by-product of these calculations is the distribution
of the sender window, independently of any timing or saturation consideration. (e) These approximations
give results that are accurate to a few percent when compared to simulation results. Detailed comparison
and sources of errors between theory and simulations are also discussed.
