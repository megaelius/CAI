We have replicated some experiments in 'Development and validation of a deep learning algorithm
for detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs' that was published in JAMA
2016; 316(22). We re-implemented the methods since the source code is not available. The original
study used fundus images from EyePACS and three hospitals in India for training their detection
algorithm. We used a different EyePACS data set that was made available in a Kaggle competition.
For evaluating the algorithm's performance the benchmark data set Messidor-2 was used. We used
the similar Messidor-Original data set to evaluate our algorithm's performance. In the original
study licensed ophthalmologists re-graded all their obtained images for diabetic retinopathy,
macular edema, and image gradability. Our challenge was to re-implement the methods with publicly
available data sets and one diabetic retinopathy grade per image, find the hyper-parameter settings
for training and validation that were not described in the original study, and make an assessment
on the impact of training with ungradable images. We were not able to reproduce the performance as
reported in the original study. We believe our model did not learn to recognize lesions in fundus
images, since we only had a singular grade for diabetic retinopathy per image, instead of multiple
grades per images. Furthermore, the original study missed details regarding hyper-parameter
settings for training and validation. The original study may also have used image quality grades
as input for training the network. We believe that deep learning algorithms should be easily replicated,
and that ideally source code should be published so that other researchers can confirm the results
of the experiments. Our source code and instructions for running the replication are available
