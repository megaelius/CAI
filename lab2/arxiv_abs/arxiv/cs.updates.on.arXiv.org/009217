Nearly all types of energy systems (such as power systems, natural gas supply systems, fuel supply
systems, and so forth) are going through a major transition from centralised, top-down structures
to distributed, clean energy approaches in order to address the concerns regarding climate change,
air quality, depletion of natural resources, and energy security, whilst also enabling the supply
of energy to communities in line with the goals of sustainable development. Accordingly, the establishment
of the concept of sustainable, decentralised, multi-carrier energy systems, together with the
declining costs of renewable energy technologies, has proposed changes in the energy industry
towards the development of integrated energy systems. Notwithstanding the potential benefits,
the optimal capacity planning of these systems with multiple energy carriers (such as electricity,
heat, hydrogen, and biogas) is exceedingly complex due to the concurrent goals and interrelated
constraints that must be satisfied, as well as the heavily context-dependent nature of such schemes.
This paper puts forward an innovative optimal capacity planning method for a cutting-edge, stand-alone
multiple energy carrier micro-grid (MECM) serving the electricity, hot water, and transportation
fuel demands of remote communities. The proposed MECM system is equipped with wind turbines, a hydrogen
sub-system (including an electrolyser, a hydrogen reservoir, and a fuel cell), a hybrid super-capacitor/battery
energy storage system, a hot water storage tank, a heat exchanger, an inline electric heater, a hydrogen
refuelling station, and some power converters. A numerical case study for the optimal capacity
planning of the suggested MECM configuration, to be realised on Stewart Island, New Zealand, is
presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed optimisation method.
