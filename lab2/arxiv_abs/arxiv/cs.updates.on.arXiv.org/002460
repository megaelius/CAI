We present a coding paradigm that provides a new achievable rate for the primitive relay channel
by combining compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward with a chaining construction. In the
primitive relay channel model, the source broadcasts a message to the relay and to the destination;
and the relay facilitates this communication by sending an additional message to the destination
through a separate channel. Two well-known coding approaches for this setting are decode-and-forward
and compress-and-forward: in the former, the relay decodes the message and sends some of the information
to the destination; in the latter, the relay does not attempt to decode, but it sends a compressed
description of the received sequence to the destination via Wyner-Ziv coding. In our scheme, we
transmit over pairs of blocks and we use compress-and-forward for the first block and decode-and-forward
for the second. In particular, in the first block, the relay does not attempt to decode and it sends
only a part of the compressed description of the received sequence; in the second block, the relay
decodes the message and sends this information plus the remaining part of the compressed sequence
relative to the first block. As a result, we strictly outperform both compress-and-forward and
decode-and-forward. Furthermore, this paradigm can be implemented with a low-complexity polar
coding scheme that has the typical attractive features of polar codes, i.e., quasi-linear encoding/decoding
complexity and super-polynomial decay of the error probability. Throughout the paper we consider
as a running example the special case of the erasure relay channel and we compare the rates achievable
by our proposed scheme with the existing upper and lower bounds.
