In this paper we explore the applicability of the unsupervised machine learning technique of Self
Organizing Maps (SOM) to estimate galaxy photometric redshift probability density functions
(PDFs). This technique takes a spectroscopic training set, and maps the photometric attributes,
but not the redshifts, to a two dimensional surface by using a process of competitive learning where
neurons compete to more closely resemble the training data multidimensional space. The key feature
of a SOM is that it retains the topology of the input set, revealing correlations between the attributes
that are not easily identified. We test three different 2D topological mapping: rectangular, hexagonal,
and spherical, by using data from the DEEP2 survey. We also explore different implementations and
boundary conditions on the map and also introduce the idea of a random atlas where a large number of
different maps are created and their individual predictions are aggregated to produce a more robust
photometric redshift PDF. We also introduced a new metric, the $I$-score, which efficiently incorporates
different metrics, making it easier to compare different results (from different parameters or
different photometric redshift codes). We find that by using a spherical topology mapping we obtain
a better representation of the underlying multidimensional topology, which provides more accurate
results that are comparable to other, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Our results
illustrate that unsupervised approaches have great potential for many astronomical problems,
and in particular for the computation of photometric redshifts.
