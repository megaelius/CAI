Uplink-downlink duality refers to the fact that under a sum-power constraint, the capacity regions
of a Gaussian multiple-access channel and a Gaussian broadcast channel with Hermitian transposed
channel matrices are identical. This paper generalizes this result to a cooperative cellular network,
in which remote access-points are deployed as relays in serving the users under the coordination
of a central processor (CP). In this model, the users and the relays are connected over noisy wireless
links, while the relays and the CP are connected over noiseless but rate-limited fronthaul links.
Based on a Lagrangian technique, this paper establishes a duality relationship between such a multiple-access
relay channel and broadcast relay channel, when the relays use compression-based strategies.
Specifically, we show that under the same total transmit power constraint and individual fronthaul
rate constraints, the achievable rate regions of the Gaussian multiple-access and broadcast relay
channels are identical, when either independent compression or Wyner-Ziv and multivariate compression
strategies are used. The key observations are that if the beamforming vectors at the relays are fixed,
the sum-power minimization problems under the achievable rate and fronthaul constraints in both
the uplink and the downlink can be transformed into either a linear programming or a semidefinite
programming problem depending on the compression technique, and that the uplink and downlink problems
are Lagrangian duals of each other. Moreover, the dual variables corresponding to the downlink
rate constraints become the uplink powers; the dual variables corresponding to the downlink fronthaul
constraints become the uplink quantization noises. This duality relationship enables an efficient
algorithm for optimizing the downlink transmission and relaying strategies based on the uplink.
