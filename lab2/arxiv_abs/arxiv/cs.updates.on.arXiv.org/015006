As the advancement of deep learning (DL), the Internet of Things and cloud computing techniques
for the analysis and diagnosis of biomedical and health care problems in the last decade, mobile
healthcare applications have received unprecedented attention. Since DL techniques usually
require enormous amount of computation, most of them cannot be directly deployed on the computation-constrained
and energy limited mobile and IoT devices. Hence, most of the mobile healthcare applications leverage
the cloud computing infrastructure, where the data collected on the mobile/IoT devices would be
transmitted to the cloud computing platforms for analysis. However, in contested environments,
relying on the cloud server might not be practical at all times; for instance, the satellite communication
might be denied or disrupted. In this paper, we propose SAIA, a Split Artificial Intelligence Architecture
for mobile healthcare systems. Unlike traditional approach for artificial intelligence (AI)
which solely exploits the computational power of the cloud server, SAIA not only relies on the cloud
computing infrastructure while the wireless communication is available, but also utilizes the
lightweight AI solutions that work locally at the client side (e.g., mobile and IoT devices), hence,
it can work even when the communication is impeded. In SAIA, we propose a meta-information based
decision unit, that could tune whether a sample captured by the client should be operated by embedded
AI or networked AI, under different conditions. In the experimental evaluation, extensive experiments
have been conducted on two popular healthcare datasets. Our results show that SAIA consistently
outperforms its baselines in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
