In a cognitive radio network, a secondary user learns the spectrum environment and dynamically
accesses the channel where the primary user is inactive. At the same time, a primary user emulation
(PUE) attacker can send falsified primary user signals and prevent the secondary user from utilizing
the available channel. The best attacking strategies that an attacker can apply have not been well
studied. In this paper, for the first time, we study optimal PUE attack strategies by formulating
an online learning problem where the attacker needs to dynamically decide the attacking channel
in each time slot based on its attacking experience. The challenge in our problem is that since the
PUE attack happens in the spectrum sensing phase, the attacker cannot observe the reward on the attacked
channel. To address this challenge, we utilize the attacker's observation capability. We propose
online learning-based attacking strategies based on the attacker's observation capabilities.
Through our analysis, we show that with no observation within the attacking slot, the attacker loses
on the regret order, and with the observation of at least one channel, there is a significant improvement
on the attacking performance. Observation of multiple channels does not give additional benefit
to the attacker (only a constant scaling) though it gives insight on the number of observations required
to achieve the minimum constant factor. Our proposed algorithms are optimal in the sense that their
regret upper bounds match their corresponding regret lower-bounds. We show consistency between
simulation and analytical results under various system parameters.
