Television is an ever-evolving multi billion dollar industry. The success of a television show
in an increasingly technological society is a vast multi-variable formula. The art of success is
not just something that happens, but is studied, replicated, and applied. Hollywood can be unpredictable
regarding success, as many movies and sitcoms that are hyped up and promise to be a hit end up being
box office failures and complete disappointments. In current studies, linguistic exploration
is being performed on the relationship between Television series and target community of viewers.
Having a decision support system that can display sound and predictable results would be needed
to build confidence in the investment of a new TV series. The models presented in this study use data
to study and determine what makes a sitcom successful. In this paper, we use descriptive and predictive
modeling techniques to assess the continuing success of television comedies: The Office, Big Bang
Theory, Arrested Development, Scrubs, and South Park. The factors that are tested for statistical
significance on episode ratings are character presence, director, and writer. These statistics
show that while characters are indeed crucial to the shows themselves, the creation and direction
of the shows pose implication upon the ratings and therefore the success of the shows. We use machine
learning based forecasting models to accurately predict the success of shows. The models represent
a baseline to understanding the success of a television show and how producers can increase the success
of current television shows or utilize this data in the creation of future shows. Due to the many factors
that go into a series, the empirical analysis in this work shows that there is no one-fits-all model
to forecast the rating or success of a television show.
