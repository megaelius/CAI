A powerful feature of linear sketches is that from sketches of two data vectors, one can compute the
sketch of the difference between the vectors. This allows us to answer fine-grained questions about
the difference between two data sets. In this work, we consider how to achieve this kind of property
with sketches that are differentially private. We describe how to compute linear sketches for $F_0$,
the number of distinct elements, that can efficiently be made differentially private. Specifically,
we consider a sketch that is linear over GF(2), mapping a vector $x\in \{0,1\}^u$ to $Hx\in\{0,1\}^\tau$
for a matrix $H$ sampled from a suitable distribution $\mathcal{H}$. Differential privacy is achieved
by using randomized response, flipping each bit of $Hx$ with probability $p<1/2$. That is, for a
vector $\varphi \in \{0,1\}^\tau$ where $\Pr[(\varphi)_j = 1] = p$ independently for each entry
$j$, we consider the noisy sketch $Hx + \varphi$, where the addition of noise happens over GF(2).
We show that for every choice of $0<\beta, \varepsilon < 1$ there exists $p<1/2$ and a distribution
$\mathcal{H}$ of linear sketches of size $\tau = O(\log^4(u)\varepsilon^{-2}\beta^{-2})$ such
that: 1) For random $H\sim\mathcal{H}$ and noise vector $\varphi$, given $Hx + \varphi$ we can compute
an estimate of $\Vert x\Vert_0$ that is accurate within a factor $1\pm\beta$, plus an additive error
$O(\log^3(u)\varepsilon^{-2}\beta^{-2})$, with high probability, and 2) For every $H\sim\mathcal{H}$,
$Hx + \varphi$ is $\varepsilon$-differentially private over the randomness in $\varphi$. Previously,
Mir et al.~(PODS 2011) had described a private way of sketching $F_0$, but their noise vector $\varphi$
is constructed using the exponential mechanism, and is not computationally efficient (quasipolynomial
time in the sketch size)...
