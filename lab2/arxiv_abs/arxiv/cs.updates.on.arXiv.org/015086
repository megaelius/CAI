Focusing inversion of potential field data for the recovery of sparse subsurface structures from
surface measurement data on a uniform grid is discussed. For the uniform grid the model sensitivity
matrices exhibit block Toeplitz Toeplitz block structure, by blocks for each depth layer of the
subsurface. Then, through embedding in circulant matrices, all forward operations with the sensitivity
matrix, or its transpose, are realized using the fast two dimensional Fourier transform. Simulations
demonstrate that this fast inversion algorithm can be implemented on standard desktop computers
with sufficient memory for storage of volumes up to size $n \approx 1M$. The linear systems of equations
arising in the focusing inversion algorithm are solved using either Golub Kahan bidiagonalization
or randomized singular value decomposition algorithms in which all matrix operations with the
sensitivity matrix are implemented using the fast Fourier transform. These two algorithms are
contrasted for efficiency for large-scale problems with respect to the sizes of the projected subspaces
adopted for the solutions of the linear systems. The presented results confirm earlier studies
that the randomized algorithms are to be preferred for the inversion of gravity data, and that it
is sufficient to use projected spaces of size approximately $m/8$, for data sets of size $m$. In contrast,
the Golub Kahan bidiagonalization leads to more efficient implementations for the inversion of
magnetic data sets, and it is again sufficient to use projected spaces of size approximately $m/8$.
Moreover, it is sufficient to use projected spaces of size $m/20$ when $m$ is large, $m \approx 50000$,
to reconstruct volumes with $n \approx 1M$. Simulations support the presented conclusions and
are verified on the inversion of a practical magnetic data set that is obtained over the Wuskwatim
Lake region in Manitoba, Canada.
