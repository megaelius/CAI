We study multi-hop data-dissemination in a wireless network from one source to multiple nodes where
some of the nodes of the network act as re-transmitting nodes and help the source in data dissemination.
In this network, we study two scenarios; i) the transmitting nodes do not need an incentive and ii)
they do need an incentive and are paid by their corresponding receiving nodes by virtual tokens.
We investigate two problems; P1) network power minimization for the first scenario and P2) social
cost minimization for the second scenario, defined as the total cost paid by the nodes of the network
for receiving data. In this paper, we propose centralized and decentralized approaches for each
of the problems. The proposed decentralized approach is based on a non-cooperative cost-sharing
game (CSG). In our proposed game, every receiving node chooses its respective transmitting nodes
and consequently, a cost is assigned to it according to the power imposed on its chosen transmitting
nodes. For the sake of energy efficiency, in our model, we employ maximal-ratio combining (MRC)
at the receivers so that a receiver can be served by multiple transmitters. Moreover, besides the
radio-link power, we capture the power required by the passive modules of wireless devices involved
in reception/transmission. We discuss how the network is formed in a decentralized way, find the
actions of the nodes in the game and show that the proposed game reaches a Nash equilibrium. To find
the centralized global optimum, which is a benchmark to our decentralized approach, we use a mixed-integer-liner-program
(MILP). The proposed MILP can be used for both of the problems P1 and P2 with a minor change. Simulation
results show that our proposed decentralized approach outperforms the conventional algorithms
in terms of energy efficiency and social cost while it can address the need for an incentive for collaboration.
