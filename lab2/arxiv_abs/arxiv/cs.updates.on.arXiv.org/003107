Many applications require the immutable and consistent sharing of data across organizational
boundaries. Because conventional datastores cannot provide this functionality, blockchains
have been proposed as one possible solution. Yet public blockchains are energy inefficient, hard
to scale and suffer from limited throughput and high latencies, while permissioned blockchains
depend on specially designated nodes, potentially leak meta-information, and also suffer from
scale and performance bottlenecks. This paper presents CreDB, a datastore that provides blockchain-like
guarantees of integrity using trusted execution environments. CreDB employs four novel mechanisms
to support a new class of applications. First, it creates a permanent record of every transaction,
known as a witness, that clients can then use not only to audit the database but to prove to third parties
that desired actions took place. Second, it associates with every object an inseparable and inviolable
policy, which not only performs access control but enables the datastore to implement state machines
whose behavior is amenable to analysis. Third, timeline inspection allows authorized parties
to inspect and reason about the history of changes made to the data. Finally, CreDB provides a protected
function evaluation mechanism that allows integrity-protected computation over private data.
The paper describes these mechanisms, and the applications they collectively enable, in detail.
We have fully implemented a prototype of CreDB on Intel SGX. Evaluation shows that CreDB can serve
as a drop-in replacement for other NoSQL stores, such as MongoDB while providing stronger integrity
guarantees.
