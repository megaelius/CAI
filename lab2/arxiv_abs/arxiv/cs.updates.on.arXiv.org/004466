In this paper, the cooperative caching problem in fog radio access networks (F-RAN) is investigated.
To maximize the incremental offloaded traffic, we formulate the clustering optimization problem
with the consideration of cooperative caching and local content popularity, which falls into the
scope of combinatorial programming. % and is NP-hard. We then propose an effective graph-based
approach to solve this challenging problem. Firstly, a node graph is constructed with its vertex
set representing the considered fog access points (F-APs) and its edge set reflecting the potential
cooperations among the F-APs. %whether the F-APs the distance and load difference among the F-APs.
Then, by exploiting the adjacency table of each vertex of the node graph, we propose to get the complete
subgraphs through indirect searching for the maximal complete subgraphs for the sake of a reduced
searching complexity. Furthermore, by using the complete subgraphs so obtained, a weighted graph
is constructed. By setting the weights of the vertices of the weighted graph to be the incremental
offloaded traffics of their corresponding complete subgraphs, the original clustering optimization
problem can be transformed into an equivalent 0-1 integer programming problem. The max-weight
independent subset of the vertex set of the weighted graph, which is equivalent to the objective
cluster sets, can then be readily obtained by solving the above optimization problem through the
greedy algorithm that we propose. Our proposed graph-based approach has an apparently low complexity
in comparison with the brute force approach which has an exponential complexity. Simulation results
show the remarkable improvements in terms of offloading gain by using our proposed approach.
