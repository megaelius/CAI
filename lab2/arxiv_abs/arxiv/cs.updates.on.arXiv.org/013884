Predicting the future trajectory of agents from visual observations is an important problem for
realization of safe and effective navigation of autonomous systems in dynamic environments. This
paper focuses on two important aspects of future trajectory forecast which are particularly relevant
for mobile platforms: 1) modeling uncertainty of the predictions, particularly from egocentric
views, where uncertainty in the interactive reactions and behaviors of other agents must consider
the uncertainty in the ego-motion, and 2) modeling multi-modality nature of the problem, which
are particularly prevalent at junctions in urban traffic scenes. To address these problems in a
unified approach, we propose NEMO (Noisy Ego MOtion priors for future object localization) for
future forecast of agents in the egocentric view. In the proposed approach, a predictive distribution
of future forecast is jointly modeled with the uncertainty of predictions. For this, we divide the
problem into two tasks: future ego-motion prediction and future object localization. We first
model the multi-modal distribution of future ego-motion with uncertainty estimates. The resulting
distribution of ego-behavior is used to sample multiple modes of future ego-motion. Then, each
modality is used as a prior to understand the interactions between the ego-vehicle and target agent.
We predict the multi-modal future locations of the target from individual modes of the ego-vehicle
while modeling the uncertainty of the target's behavior. To this end, we extensively evaluate the
proposed framework using the publicly available benchmark dataset (HEV-I) supplemented with
odometry data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).
