The maximum density subgraph problem, introduced in the 80s by Picard and Queyranne as well as Goldberg,
is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization with a wide range of applications. The lowest
outdegree orientation problem is known to be its dual problem. We study both the problem of finding
dense subgraphs and the problem of computing a low outdegree orientation in the distributed settings.
Suppose $G=(V,E)$ is the underlying network as well as the input graph. Let $D$ denote the density
of the maximum density subgraph of $G$. We give the following results: Given a value $\tilde{D} \leq
D$ and $0 < \epsilon < 1$, we show that a subgraph of density at least $(1-\epsilon)\tilde{D}$ can
be identified deterministically in $O((\log n) / \epsilon)$ rounds in the \textsf{LOCAL} model.
Using randomization, we show that such subgraph can be identified in $O((\log^3 n) / \epsilon^3)$
rounds in the \textsf{CONGEST} model with high probability. We also give a $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$-round
lower bound which shows that our result for the \textsf{LOCAL} model is tight up to a $O(\log n)$ factor.
Moreover, our result can be extended to solve the directed version of the problem introduced by Kannan
and Vinay \cite{KV99}. Given an integer $\tilde{D} \geq D$ and $\Omega(1/\tilde{D}) < \epsilon
< 1/4$, we give an $O(\log^2 n \cdot (\log^{2.71} \Delta) /\epsilon^2)$-round deterministic algorithm
in the \textsf{CONGEST} model that computes an orientation where the outdegree of every vertex
is upper bounded by $(1+\epsilon)\tilde{D}$. Previously, the best deterministic algorithm for
this problem is by Harris \cite{Harris19} that runs in $\tilde{O}((\log^6 n) / \epsilon^4)$ rounds
in the \local model.
