We study mechanism design for nonexcludable and excludable binary public project problems. We
aim to maximize the expected number of consumers and the expected social welfare. For the nonexcludable
public project model, we identify a sufficient condition on the prior distribution for the conservative
equal costs mechanism to be the optimal strategy-proof and individually rational mechanism. For
general distributions, we propose a dynamic program that solves for the optimal mechanism. For
the excludable public project model, we identify a similar sufficient condition for the serial
cost sharing mechanism to be optimal for $2$ and $3$ agents. We derive a numerical upper bound. Experiments
show that for several common distributions, the serial cost sharing mechanism is close to optimality.
The serial cost sharing mechanism is not optimal in general. We design better performing mechanisms
via neural networks. Our approach involves several technical innovations that can be applied to
mechanism design in general. We interpret the mechanisms as price-oriented rationing-free (PORF)
mechanisms, which enables us to move the mechanism's complex (e.g., iterative) decision making
off the network, to a separate program. We feed the prior distribution's analytical form into the
cost function to provide quality gradients for training. We use supervision to manual mechanisms
as a systematic way for initialization. Our approach of "supervision and then gradient descent"
is effective for improving manual mechanisms' performances. It is also effective for fixing constraint
violations for heuristic-based mechanisms that are infeasible.
