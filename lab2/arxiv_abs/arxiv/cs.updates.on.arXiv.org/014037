Coronaviruses are a famous family of viruses that causes illness in human or animals. The new type
of corona virus COVID-19 disease was firstly discovered in Wuhan-China. However, recently, the
virus has been widely spread in most of the world countries and is reported as a pandemic. Further,
nowadays, all the world countries are striving to control the coronavirus disease COVID-19. There
are many mechanisms to detect the coronavirus disease COVID-19 including clinical analysis of
chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed COVID-19 patient manifests as fever,
tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly, several techniques can be used to detect the initial results
of the virus such as medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost and it
takes time to install them and use. Therefore, in this paper, a new framework is proposed to detect
coronavirus disease COVID-19 using onboard smartphone sensors. The proposal provides a low-cost
solution, since most of the radiologists have already held smartphones for different daily-purposes.
People can use the framework on their smartphones for the virus detection purpose. Nowadays, smartphones
are powerful with existing computation-rich processors, memory space, and large number of sensors
including cameras, microphone, temperature sensor, inertial sensors, proximity, colour-sensor,
humidity-sensor, and wireless chipsets/sensors. The designed Artificial Intelligence (AI)
enabled framework reads the smartphone sensors signal measurements to predict the grade of severity
of the pneumonia as well as predicting the result of the disease.
