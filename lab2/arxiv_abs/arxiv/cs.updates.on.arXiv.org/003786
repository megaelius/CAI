Ranking algorithms are deployed widely to order a set of items in applications such as search engines,
news feeds, and recommendation systems. Recent studies, however, have shown that, left unchecked,
the output of ranking algorithms can result in decreased diversity in the type of content presented,
promote stereotypes, and polarize opinions. In order to address such issues, we study the following
variant of the traditional ranking problem when, in addition, there are fairness or diversity constraints.
Given a collection of items along with 1) the value of placing an item in a particular position in the
ranking, 2) the collection of sensitive attributes (such as gender, race, political opinion) of
each item and 3) a collection of constraints that, for each k, bound the number of items with each attribute
that are allowed to appear in the top k positions of the ranking, the goal is to output a ranking that
maximizes the value with respect to the original rank quality metric while respecting the constraints.
This problem encapsulates various well-studied problems related to bipartite and hypergraph
matching as special cases and turns out to be hard to approximate even with simple constraints. Our
main technical contributions are fast exact and approximation algorithms along with complementary
hardness results that, together, come close to settling the approximability of this constrained
ranking maximization problem. Unlike prior work on the constrained matching problems, our algorithm
runs in linear time, even when the number of constraints is large, its approximation ratio does not
depend on the number of constraints, and it produces solutions with small constraint violations.
Our results rely on insights about the constrained matching problem when the objective satisfies
properties that appear in common ranking metrics such as Discounted Cumulative Gain, Spearman's
rho or Bradley-Terry.
