The world astronomical image archives represent huge opportunities to time-domain astronomy
sciences and other hot topics such as space defense, and astronomical observatories should improve
this wealth and make it more accessible in the big data era. In 2010 we introduced the Mega-Archive
database and the Mega-Precovery server for data mining images containing Solar system bodies,
with focus on near Earth asteroids (NEAs). This paper presents the improvements and introduces
some new related data mining tools developed during the last five years. Currently, the Mega-Archive
has indexed 15 million images available from six major collections (CADC, ESO, ING, LCOGT, NVO and
SMOKA) and other instrument archives and surveys. This meta-data index collection is daily updated
(since 2014) by a crawler which performs automated query of five major collections. Since 2016,
these data mining tools run to the new dedicated EURONEAR server, and the database migrated to SQL
engine which supports robust and fast queries. To constrain the area to search moving or fixed objects
in images taken by large mosaic cameras, we built the graphical tools FindCCD and FindCCD for Fixed
Objects which overlay the targets across one of seven mosaic cameras (Subaru-SuprimeCam, VST-OmegaCam,
INT-WFC, VISTA-VIRCAM, CFHT-MegaCam, Blanco-DECam and Subaru-HSC), also plotting the uncertainty
ellipse for poorly observed NEAs. In 2017 we improved Mega-Precovery, which offers now two options
for calculus of the ephemerides and three options for the input (objects defined by designation,
orbit or observations). Additionally, we developed Mega-Archive for Fixed Objects (MASFO) and
Mega-Archive Search for Double Stars (MASDS). We believe that the huge potential of science imaging
archives is still insufficiently exploited.
