Context: Software has become an innovative solution nowadays for many applications and methods
in science and engineering. Ensuring the quality and correctness of software is challenging because
each program has different configurations and input domains. To ensure the quality of software,
all possible configurations and input combinations need to be evaluated against their expected
outputs. However, this exhaustive test is impractical because of time and resource constraints
due to the large domain of input and configurations. Thus, different sampling techniques have been
used to sample these input domains and configurations. Objective: Combinatorial testing can be
used to effectively detect faults in software-under-test. This technique uses combinatorial
optimization concepts to systematically minimize the number of test cases by considering the combinations
of inputs. This paper proposes a new strategy to generate combinatorial test suite by using cuckoo
search concepts. Method: Cuckoo Search is used in the design and implementation of a strategy to
construct optimized combinatorial sets. The strategy consists of different algorithms for construction.
These algorithms are combined to serve the Cuckoo Search. Results: The efficiency and performance
of the new technique were proven through different experiment sets. The effectiveness of the strategy
is assessed by applying the generated test suites on a real-world case study for the purpose of functional
testing. Conclusion: Results show that the generated test suites can detect faults effectively.
In addition, the strategy also opens a new direction for the application of Cuckoo Search in the context
of software engineering.
