We propose a strategy to compress and store large volumes of scientific data represented on unstructured
grids. Approaches utilizing tensor decompositions for data compression have already been proposed.
Here, data on a structured grid is stored as a tensor which is then subjected to appropriate decomposition
in suitable tensor formats. Such decompositions are based on generalization of singular value
decomposition to tensors and capture essential features in the data with storage cost lower by orders
of magnitude. However, tensor based data compression is limited by the fact that one can only consider
scientific data represented on structured grids. In case of data on unstructured meshes, we propose
to consider data as realizations of a function that is based on functional view of the tensor thus
avoiding such limitations. The key is to efficiently estimate the parameters of the function whose
complexity is small compared to the cardinality of the dataset (otherwise there is no compression).
Here, we introduce the set of functional sparse Tucker tensors and propose a method to construct
approximation in this set such that the resulting compact functional tensor can be rapidly evaluated
to recover the original data. The compression procedure consists of three steps. In the first step,
we consider a fraction of the original dataset for interpolation on a structured grid followed by
sequentially truncated higher order singular value decomposition to get a compressed version
of the interpolated data.We then fit singular vectors on a set of functional basis using sparse approximation
to obtain corresponding functional sparse Tucker tensor representation. Finally, we re-evaluate
the coefficients of this functional tensor using randomized least squares at a reduced computational
complexity. This strategy leads to compression ratio of orders of magnitude on combustion simulation
datasets.
