We derive rigorous bounds for well-defined community structure in complex networks for a stochastic
block model (SBM) benchmark. In particular, we analyze the effect of inter-community "noise" (inter-community
edges) on any "community detection" algorithm's ability to correctly group nodes assigned to a
planted partition, a problem which has been proven to be NP complete in a standard rendition. Our
result does not rely on the use of any one particular algorithm nor on the analysis of the limitations
of inference. Rather, we turn the problem on its head and work backwards to examine when, in the first
place, well defined structure may exist in SBMs.The method that we introduce here could potentially
be applied to other computational problems. The objective of community detection algorithms is
to partition a given network into optimally disjoint subgraphs (or communities). Similar to k-SAT
and other combinatorial optimization problems, "community detection" exhibits different phases.
Networks that lie in the "unsolvable phase" lack well-defined structure and thus have no partition
that is meaningful. Solvable systems splinter into two disparate phases: those in the "hard" phase
and those in the "easy" phase. As befits its name, within the easy phase, a partition is easy to achieve
by known algorithms. When a network lies in the hard phase, it still has an underlying structure yet
finding a meaningful partition which can be checked in polynomial time requires an exhaustive computational
effort that rapidly increases with the size of the graph. When taken together, (i) the rigorous results
that we report here on when graphs have an underlying structure and (ii) recent results concerning
the limits of rather general algorithms, suggest bounds on the hard phase.
