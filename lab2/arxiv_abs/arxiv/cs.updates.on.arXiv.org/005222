Error-correcting codes that admit local decoding and correcting algorithms have been the focus
of much recent research due to their numerous theoretical and practical applications. An important
goal is to obtain the best possible tradeoffs between the number of queries the algorithm makes to
its oracle (the locality of the task), and the amount of redundancy in the encoding (the information
rate). In Hamming's classical adversarial channel model, the current tradeoffs are dramatic,
allowing either small locality, but superpolynomial blocklength, or small blocklength, but high
locality. However, in the computationally bounded, adversarial channel model, proposed by Lipton
(STACS 1994), constructions of locally decodable codes suddenly exhibit small locality and small
blocklength, but these constructions require strong trusted setup assumptions e.g., Ostrovsky,
Pandey and Sahai (ICALP 2007) construct private locally decodable codes in the setting where the
sender and receiver already share a symmetric key. We study variants of locally decodable and locally
correctable codes in computationally bounded, adversarial channels, in a setting with no public-key
or private-key cryptographic setup. The only setup assumption we require is the selection of the
public parameters (seed) for a collision-resistant hash function. Specifically, we provide constructions
of relaxed locally correctable and relaxed locally decodable codes over the binary alphabet, with
constant information rate, and poly-logarithmic locality. Our constructions, which compare
favorably with their classical analogues in the computationally unbounded Hamming channel, crucially
employ collision-resistant hash functions and local expander graphs, extending ideas from recent
cryptographic constructions of memory-hard functions.
