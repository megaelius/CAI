Collaborative filtering based algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), tend towards
predicting a perpetuation of past observed behavior. In a recommendation context, this can lead
to an overly narrow set of suggestions lacking in serendipity and inadvertently placing the user
in what is known as a "filter bubble." In this paper, we grapple with the issue of the filter bubble
in the context of a course recommendation system in production at a public university. Most universities
in the United States encourage students to explore developing interests while simultaneously
advising them to adhere to course taking norms which progress them towards graduation. These competing
objectives, and the stakes involved for students, make this context a particularly meaningful
one for investigating real-world recommendation strategies. We introduce a novel modification
to the skip-gram model applied to nine years of historic course enrollment sequences to learn course
vector representations used to diversify recommendations based on similarity to a student's specified
favorite course. This model, which we call multifactor2vec, is intended to improve the semantics
of the primary token embedding by also learning embeddings of potentially conflated factors of
the token (e.g., instructor). Our offline testing found this model improved accuracy and recall
on our course similarity and analogy validation sets over a standard skip-gram. Incorporating
course catalog description text resulted in further improvements. We compare the performance
of these models to the system's existing RNN-based recommendations with a user study of undergraduates
(N = 70) rating six characteristics of their course recommendations. Results of the user study show
a dramatic lack of novelty in RNN recommendations and depict the characteristic trade-offs that
make serendipity difficult to achieve.
