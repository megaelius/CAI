Motivation: Human genomic datasets often contain sensitive information that limits use and sharing
of the data. In particular, simple anonymisation strategies fail to provide sufficient level of
protection for genomic data, because the data are inherently identifiable. Differentially private
machine learning can help by guaranteeing that the published results do not leak too much information
about any individual data point. Recent research has reached promising results on differentially
private drug sensitivity prediction using gene expression data. Differentially private learning
with genomic data is challenging because it is more difficult to guarantee the privacy in high dimensions.
Dimensionality reduction can help, but if the dimension reduction mapping is learned from the data,
then it needs to be differentially private too, which can carry a significant privacy cost. Furthermore,
the selection of any hyperparameters (such as the target dimensionality) needs to also avoid leaking
private information. Results: We study an approach that uses a large public dataset of similar type
to learn a compact representation for differentially private learning. We compare three representation
learning methods: variational autoencoders, PCA and random projection. We solve two machine learning
tasks on gene expression of cancer cell lines: cancer type classification, and drug sensitivity
prediction. The experiments demonstrate significant benefit from all representation learning
methods with variational autoencoders providing the most accurate predictions most often. Our
results significantly improve over previous state-of-the-art in accuracy of differentially
private drug sensitivity prediction.
