Fast data acquisition in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is vastly in demand and scan time directly
depends on the number of acquired k-space samples. The most common issues in any deep learning-based
MRI reconstruction approaches are generalizability and transferability. For different MRI scanner
configurations using these approaches, the network must be trained from scratch every time with
new training dataset, acquired under new configurations, to be able to provide good reconstruction
performance. Here, we propose a new parallel imaging method based on deep neural networks called
NLDpMRI to reduce any structured aliasing ambiguities related to the different k-space undersampling
patterns for accelerated data acquisition. Two loss functions including non-regularized and
regularized are proposed for parallel MRI reconstruction using deep network optimization and
we reconstruct MR images by optimizing the proposed loss functions over the network parameters.
Unlike any deep learning-based MRI reconstruction approaches, our method doesn't include any
training step that the network learns from a large number of training samples and it only needs the
single undersampled multi-coil k-space data for reconstruction. Also, the proposed method can
handle k-space data with different undersampling patterns, and different number of coils. Unlike
most deep learning-based MRI reconstruction methods, our method operates on real-world acquisitions
with the complex data format, not on simulated data, real-valued data, or data with added simulated-phase.
Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
GRAPPA reconstruction method.
