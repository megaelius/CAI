Currently there exists a gap between deep learning and the techniques required to quantify uncertainty.
This paper uses the weather forecast as an application background to illustrate the technique of
deep uncertainty learning (DUL). Weather forecasting has great significance throughout human
history and is traditionally approached through numerical weather prediction (NWP) in which the
atmosphere is modeled as differential equations. However, due to the instability of these differential
equations in the presence of uncertainties, weather forecasting through numerical simulations
may not be reliable. This paper explores weather forecasting as a data mining problem. We build a
deep prediction interval (DPI) model based on sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) that predicts spatio-temporal
patterns of meteorological variables in the future 37 hours, which incorporates the informative
knowledge of NWP. A big contribution and surprising finding in the training process of DPI is that
training by mean variance loss instead of mean square error loss an significantly improve the generalization
of point estimation, which has never been reported in previous research. We think this a new kind
of regularization can not only be on a par with the famous Dropout but also provide more uncertainty
information, which comes into a double-win situation and we name it MV-R (Mean Variance Regularization).
Based on single DPI, we then build a deep ensemble. We evaluate our method on 10 realistic weather
stations in Beijing of China. Experimental results shown DPI has better generalization than traditional
point estimation and deep ensemble can further improve the performance. Our deep ensemble method
achieved top-2 online score ranking in the competition of AI Challenger 2018. It can dramatically
decrease up to 56% error compared with NWP, which has important use value and practical significance.
