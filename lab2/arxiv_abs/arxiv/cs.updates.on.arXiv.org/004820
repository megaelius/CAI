Subgraph discovery in a single data graph---finding subsets of vertices and edges satisfying a
user-specified criteria---is an essential and general graph analytics operation with a wide spectrum
of applications. Depending on the criteria, subgraphs of interest may correspond to cliques of
friends in social networks, interconnected entities in RDF data, or frequent patterns in protein
interaction networks to name a few. Existing systems usually examine a large number of subgraphs
while employing many computers and often produce an enormous result set of subgraphs. How can we
enable fast discovery of only the most relevant subgraphs while minimizing the computational requirements?
We present Nuri, a general subgraph discovery system that allows users to succinctly specify subgraphs
of interest and criteria for ranking them. Given such specifications, Nuri efficiently finds the
k most relevant subgraphs using only a single computer. It prioritizes (i.e., expands earlier than
others) subgraphs that are more likely to expand into the desired subgraphs (prioritized subgraph
expansion) and proactively discards irrelevant subgraphs from which the desired subgraphs cannot
be constructed (pruning). Nuri can also efficiently store and retrieve a large number of subgraphs
on disk without being limited by the size of main memory. We demonstrate using both real and synthetic
datasets that Nuri on a single core outperforms the closest alternative distributed system consuming
40 times more computational resources by more than 2 orders of magnitude for clique discovery and
1 order of magnitude for subgraph isomorphism and pattern mining.
