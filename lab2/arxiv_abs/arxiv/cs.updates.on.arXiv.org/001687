For 5G it will be important to leverage the available millimeter wave spectrum. To achieve an approximately
omni- directional coverage with a similar effective antenna aperture compared to state of the art
cellular systems, an antenna array is required at both the mobile and basestation. Due to the large
bandwidth and inefficient amplifiers available in CMOS for mmWave, the analog front-end of the
receiver with a large number of antennas becomes especially power hungry. Two main solutions exist
to reduce the power consumption: hybrid beam forming and digital beam forming with low resolution
Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs). In this work we compare the spectral and energy efficiency
of both systems under practical system constraints. We consider the effects of channel estimation,
transmitter impairments and multiple simultaneous users. Our power consumption model considers
components reported in literature at 60 GHz. In contrast to many other works we also consider the
correlation of the quantization error, and generalize the modeling of it to non-uniform quantizers
and different quantizers at each antenna. The result shows that as the SNR gets larger the ADC resolution
achieving the optimal energy efficiency gets also larger. The energy efficiency peaks for 5 bit
resolution at high SNR, since due to other limiting factors the achievable rate almost saturates
at this resolution. We also show that in the multi-user scenario digital beamforming is in any case
more energy efficient than hybrid beamforming. In addition we show that if different ADC resolutions
are used we can achieve any desired trade-offs between power consumption and rate close to those
achieved with only one ADC resolution.
