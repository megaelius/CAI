Providing resilient network control is a critical concern for deploying Software-Defined Networking
(SDN) into Wide-Area Networks (WANs). For performance reasons, a Software-Defined WAN is divided
into multiple domains controlled by multiple controllers with a logically centralized view. Under
controller failures, we need to remap the control of offline switches from failed controllers to
other active controllers. Existing solutions could either overload active controllers to interrupt
their normal operations or degrade network performance because of increasing the controller-switch
communication overhead. In this paper, we propose RetroFlow to achieve low communication overhead
without interrupting the normal processing of active controllers during controller failures.
By intelligently configuring a set of selected offline switches working under the legacy routing
mode, RetroFlow relieves the active controllers from controlling the selected offline switches
while maintaining the flow programmability (e.g., the ability to change paths of flows) of SDN.
RetroFlow also smartly transfers the control of offline switches with the SDN routing mode to active
controllers to minimize the communication overhead from these offline switches to the active controllers.
Simulation results show that compared with the baseline algorithm, RetroFlow can reduce the communication
overhead up to 52.6% during a moderate controller failure by recovering 100% flows from offline
switches and can reduce the communication overhead up to 61.2% during a serious controller failure
by setting to recover 90% of flows from offline switches.
