One of the most frequently used models for understanding human navigation on the Web is the Markov
chain model, where Web pages are represented as states and hyperlinks as probabilities of navigating
from one page to another. Predominantly, human navigation on the Web has been thought to satisfy
the memoryless Markov property stating that the next page a user visits only depends on her current
page and not on previously visited ones. This idea has found its way in numerous applications such
as Google's PageRank algorithm and others. Recently, new studies suggested that human navigation
may better be modeled using higher order Markov chain models, i.e., the next page depends on a longer
history of past clicks. Yet, this finding is preliminary and does not account for the higher complexity
of higher order Markov chain models which is why the memoryless model is still widely used. In this
work we thoroughly present a diverse array of advanced inference methods for determining the appropriate
Markov chain order. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of each method and apply them for investigating
memory and structure of human navigation on the Web. Our experiments reveal that the complexity
of higher order models grows faster than their utility, and thus we confirm that the memoryless model
represents a quite practical model for human navigation on a page level. However, when we expand
our analysis to a topical level, where we abstract away from specific page transitions to transitions
between topics, we find that the memoryless assumption is violated and specific regularities can
be observed. We report results from experiments with two types of navigational datasets (goal-oriented
vs. free form) and observe interesting structural differences that make a strong argument for more
contextual studies of human navigation in future work.
