We study the problem of finding "fair" stable matchings in the Stable Marriage problem with Incomplete
lists (SMI). In particular, we seek stable matchings that are optimal with respect to profile, which
is a vector that indicates the number of agents who have their first-, second-, third-choice partner,
etc. In a rank maximal stable matching, the maximum number of agents have their first-choice partner,
and subject to this, the maximum number of agents have their second-choice partner, etc., whilst
in a generous stable matching $M$, the minimum number of agents have their $d$th-choice partner,
and subject to this, the minimum number of agents have their $(d-1)$th-choice partner, etc., where
$d$ is the maximum rank of an agent's partner in $M$. Irving et al. presented an $O(n^5\log n)$ algorithm
for finding a rank-maximal stable matching, which can be adapted easily to the generous stable matching
case, where $n$ is the number of men / women. An $O(n^{0.5}m^{1.5})$ algorithm for the rank-maximal
stable matching problem was later given by Feder, where $m$ is the number of possible man-woman pairs.
However these approaches involve the use of weights that are in general exponential in $n$, potentially
leading to inaccuracies or memory issues upon implementation. In this paper we present an $O(n^5\log
n)$ algorithm for finding a rank-maximal stable matching using an approach that involves weights
that are polynomially-bounded in $n$. We show how to adapt our algorithm for the generous case to
run in O$(n^2d^3 \log n)$ time. Additionally we conduct an empirical evaluation to compare various
measures over many different types of "fair" stable matchings. In particular, we observe that a
generous stable matching is typically considerably closer than a rank-maximal stable matching
in terms of the egalitarian and sex-equality optimality criteria.
