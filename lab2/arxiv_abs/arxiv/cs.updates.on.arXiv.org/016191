To improve climate modeling, we need a better understanding of multi-scale atmospheric dynamics--the
relationship between large scale environment and small-scale storm formation, morphology and
propagation--as well as superior stochastic parameterization of convective organization. We
analyze raw output from ~6 million instances of explicitly simulated convection spanning all global
geographic regimes of convection in the tropics, focusing on the vertical velocities extracted
every 15 minutes from ~4 hundred thousands separate instances of a storm-permitting moist turbulence
model embedded within a multi-scale global model of the atmosphere. Generative modeling techniques
applied on high-resolution climate data for representation learning hold the potential to drive
next-generation parameterization and breakthroughs in understanding of convection and storm
development. To that end, we design and implement a specialized Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
to perform structural replication, dimensionality reduction and clustering on these cloud-resolving
vertical velocity outputs. Our VAE reproduces the structure of disparate classes of convection,
successfully capturing both their magnitude and variances. This VAE thus provides a novel way to
perform unsupervised grouping of convective organization in multi-scale simulations of the atmosphere
in a physically sensible manner. The success of our VAE in structural emulation, learning physical
meaning in convective transitions and anomalous vertical velocity field detection may help set
the stage for developing generative models for stochastic parameterization that might one day
replace explicit convection calculations.
