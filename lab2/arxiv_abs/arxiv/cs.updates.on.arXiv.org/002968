Creation of the information systems and tools for scientific research and development support
has always been one of the central directions of the development of computer science. The main features
of the modern evolution of scientific research and development are the transdisciplinary approach
and the deep intellectualisation of all stages of the life cycle of formulation and solution of scientific
problems. The theoretical and practical aspects of the development of perspective complex knowledge-oriented
information systems and their components are considered in the paper. The analysis of existing
scientific information systems (or current research information systems, CRIS) and synthesis
of general principles of design of the research and development workstation environment of a researcher
and its components are carried out in the work. The functional components of knowledge-oriented
information system research and development workstation environment of a researcher are designed.
Designed and developed functional components of knowledge-oriented information system developing
research and development workstation environment,including functional models and software
implementation of the software subsystem for creation and use of ontological knowledge base for
research fellow publications, as part of personalized knowledge base of scientific researcher.
Research in modern conditions of e-Science paradigm requires pooling scientific community and
intensive exchange of research results that may be achieved through the use of scientific information
systems. research and development workstation environment allows to solve problems of contructivisation
and formalisation of knowledge representation, obtained during the research process and collective
accomplices interaction.
