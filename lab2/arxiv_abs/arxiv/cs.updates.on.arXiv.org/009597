Mobility on Demand (MoD) services, like Uber and Lyft, are revolutionizing the way people move in
cities around the world and are often considered a convenient alternative to public transit, since
they offer higher Quality of Service (QoS - less waiting time, door-to-door service) at a cheap price.
In the next decades, these advantages are expected to be further amplified by Automated MoD (AMoD),
in which drivers will be replaced by automated vehicles, with a big gain in terms of cost-efficiency.
MoD is usually intended as a door-to-door service. However, there has been recent interest toward
consolidating, e.g., aggregating, the travel demand by limiting the number of admitted stop locations.
This implies users have to walk from/to their intended origin/destination. The contribution of
this paper is a systematic study the impact of consolidation on the operator cost and on user QoS.
We introduce a MoD system where pick-ups and drop-offs can only occur in a limited subset of admitted
stop locations. The density of such locations is a system parameter: the less the density, the more
the user demand is consolidated. We show that, by decreasing stop density, we can increase system
capacity (number of passengers we are able to serve). On the contrary, increasing it, we can improve
QoS. The system is tested in AMoDSim, an open-source simulator. The code to reproduce the results
presented here is available on-line. This work is a first step toward flexible mobility services
that are able to autonomously re-configure themselves, favoring capacity or QoS, depending on
the amount of travel demand coming from users. In other words, the services we envisage in this work
shift their operational mode to any intermediate point in the range from a taxi-like door-to-door
service to a bus-like service, with few served stops and more passengers on-board.
