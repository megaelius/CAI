The Wolfram Model, which is a slight generalization of the model first introduced by Stephen Wolfram
in A New Kind of Science (NKS), is a discrete spacetime formalism in which space is represented by
a hypergraph whose dynamics are determined by abstract replacement operations on set systems,
and in which the conformal structure of spacetime is represented by a causal graph. The purpose of
this article is to present rigorous mathematical derivations of many key properties of such models
in the continuum limit, as first discussed in NKS, including the fact that large classes of them obey
discrete forms of both special and general relativity. First, we prove that causal invariance (namely,
the requirement that all causal graphs be isomorphic, irrespective of the choice of hypergraph
updating order) is equivalent to a discrete version of general covariance, with changes to the updating
order corresponding to discrete gauge transformations. This fact then allows one to deduce a discrete
analog of Lorentz covariance, and the resultant physical consequences of discrete Lorentz transformations.
We also introduce discrete notions of Riemann and Ricci curvature for hypergraphs, and prove that
the correction factor for the volume of a discrete spacetime cone in a causal graph corresponding
to curved spacetime of fixed dimensionality is proportional to a timelike projection of the discrete
spacetime Ricci tensor, subsequently using this fact (along with the assumption that the updating
rules preserve the dimensionality of the causal graph in limiting cases) to prove that the most general
set of constraints on the discrete spacetime Ricci tensor corresponds to a discrete form of the Einstein
field equations.
