We propose a training method for deep neural network (DNN)-based source enhancement to increase
objective sound quality assessment (OSQA) scores such as the perceptual evaluation of speech quality
(PESQ). In many conventional studies, DNNs have been used as a mapping function to estimate time-frequency
masks and trained to minimize an analytically tractable objective function such as the mean squared
error (MSE). Since OSQA scores have been used widely for sound-quality evaluation, constructing
DNNs to increase OSQA scores would be better than using the minimum-MSE to create high-quality output
signals. However, since most OSQA scores are not analytically tractable, \textit{i.e.}, they
are black boxes, the gradient of the objective function cannot be calculated by simply applying
back-propagation. To calculate the gradient of the OSQA-based objective function, we formulated
a DNN optimization scheme on the basis of \textit{black-box optimization}, which is used for training
a computer that plays a game. For a black-box-optimization scheme, we adopt the policy gradient
method for calculating the gradient on the basis of a sampling algorithm. To simulate output signals
using the sampling algorithm, DNNs are used to estimate the probability density function of the
output signals that maximize OSQA scores. The OSQA scores are calculated from the simulated output
signals, and the DNNs are trained to increase the probability of generating the simulated output
signals that achieve high OSQA scores. Through several experiments, we found that OSQA scores significantly
increased by applying the proposed method, even though the MSE was not minimized.
