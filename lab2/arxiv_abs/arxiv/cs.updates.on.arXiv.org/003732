The non-stationary nature of electroencephalography (EEG) signals makes an EEG-based brain-computer
interface (BCI) a dynamic system, thus improving its performance is a challenging task. In addition,
it is well-known that due to non-stationarity based covariate shifts, the input data distributions
of EEG-based BCI systems change during inter- and intra-session transitions, which poses great
difficulty for developments of online adaptive data-driven systems. Ensemble learning approaches
have been used previously to tackle this challenge. However, passive scheme based implementation
leads to poor efficiency while increasing high computational cost. This paper presents a novel
integration of covariate shift estimation and unsupervised adaptive ensemble learning (CSE-UAEL)
to tackle non-stationarity in motor-imagery (MI) related EEG classification. The proposed method
first employs an exponentially weighted moving average model to detect the covariate shifts in
the common spatial pattern features extracted from MI related brain responses. Then, a classifier
ensemble was created and updated over time to account for changes in streaming input data distribution
wherein new classifiers are added to the ensemble in accordance with estimated shifts. Furthermore,
using two publicly available BCI-related EEG datasets, the proposed method was extensively compared
with the state-of-the-art single-classifier based passive scheme, single-classifier based
active scheme and ensemble based passive schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed
active scheme based ensemble learning algorithm significantly enhances the BCI performance in
MI classifications.
