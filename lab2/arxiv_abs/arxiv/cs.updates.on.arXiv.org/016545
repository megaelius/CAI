In image compositing tasks, objects from different sources are put together to form a new image.
Artists often increase realism by adding object shadows to match the scene geometry and lighting.
However, creating realistic soft shadows requires skill and is time-consuming. We introduce a
Soft Shadow Network to generate convincing soft shadows for 2D object cutouts automatically. SSN
takes an object cutout mask as input and thus is agnostic to image types such as painting and vector
art. Although inferring the 3D shape of an object from its silhouette can be ambiguous, it is easy
for humans to get the 3D geometry from a 2D projection when it is in an iconic view. We follow this intuition
and train the SSN to render soft shadows for objects' iconic views. To train our model, we design an
efficient pipeline to produce diverse soft shadow training data using 3D object models. Our pipeline
first computes a set of soft shadow bases by sampling hard shadows. During training, environment
lighting maps that cover a wide spectrum of possible configurations are used to calculate the soft
shadow ground truth using the shadow bases. This enables our model to see a complex lighting pattern
and to learn the interaction between the lights and 3D geometries. In addition, we propose an inverse
shadow map representation, which makes the training focused on the shadow area and leads to much
faster convergence and better performance. We show that our model produces realistic soft shadow
details for objects of different shapes. A user study shows that SSN generated shadows are often
indistinguishable from shadows calculated by physics-based rendering. Our SSN can produce a shadow
in real-time and it allows real-time interactive shadow manipulation. We develop a simple user
interface and a second user study shows that amateur users can easily use our tool to generate soft
shadows matching a reference shadow.
