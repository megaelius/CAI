Background and objective: Stacking is an ensemble machine learning method that averages predictions
from multiple other algorithms, such as generalized linear models and regression trees. A recent
iteration of stacking, called super learning, has been developed as a general approach to black
box supervised learning and has seen frequent usage, in part due to the availability of an R package.
I develop super learning in the SAS software system using a new macro, and demonstrate its performance
relative to the R package. Methods: I follow closely previous work using the R SuperLearner package
and assess the performance of super learning in a number of domains. I compare the R package with the
new SAS macro in a small set of simulations assessing curve fitting in a prediction model, a set of
14 publicly available datasets to assess cross-validated, expected loss, and data from a randomized
trial of job seekers' training to assess the utility of super learning in causal inference using
inverse probability weighting. Results: Across the simulated data and the publicly available
data, the macro performed similarly to the R package, even with a different set of potential algorithms
available natively in R and SAS. The example with inverse probability weighting demonstrated the
ability of the SAS macro to include algorithms developed in R. Conclusions: The super learner macro
performs as well as the R package at a number of tasks. Further, by extending the macro to include the
use of R packages, the macro can leverage both the robust, enterprise oriented procedures in SAS
and the nimble, cutting edge packages in R. In the spirit of ensemble learning, this macro extends
the potential library of algorithms beyond a single software system and provides a simple avenue
into machine learning in SAS.
