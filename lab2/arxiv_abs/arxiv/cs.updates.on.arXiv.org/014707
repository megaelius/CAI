Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic utility of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for severity
staging of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Materials and Methods: This retrospective
analysis was conducted on 1243 knee MR images (1008 intact, 18 partially torn, 77 fully torn, and
140 reconstructed ACLs) from 224 patients (age 47 +/- 14 years, 54% women) acquired between 2011
and 2014. The radiologists used a modified scoring metric. To classify ACL injuries with deep learning,
two types of CNNs were used, one with three-dimensional (3D) and the other with two-dimensional
(2D) convolutional kernels. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, weighted
Cohen's kappa, and overall accuracy, followed by McNemar's test to compare the CNNs performance.
Results: The overall accuracy and weighted Cohen's kappa reported for ACL injury classification
were higher using the 2D CNN (accuracy: 92% (233/254) and kappa: 0.83) than the 3D CNN (accuracy:
89% (225/254) and kappa: 0.83) (P = .27). The 2D CNN and 3D CNN performed similarly in classifying
intact ACLs (2D CNN: 93% (188/203) sensitivity and 90% (46/51) specificity; 3D CNN: 89% (180/203)
sensitivity and 88% (45/51) specificity). Classification of full tears by both networks were also
comparable (2D CNN: 82% (14/17) sensitivity and 94% (222/237) specificity; 3D CNN: 76% (13/17)
sensitivity and 100% (236/237) specificity). The 2D CNN classified all reconstructed ACLs correctly.
Conclusion: 2D and 3D CNNs applied to ACL lesion classification had high sensitivity and specificity,
suggesting that these networks could be used to help grade ACL injuries by non-experts.
