This paper introduces a framework for how to appropriately adopt and adjust Machine Learning (ML)
techniques used to construct Electrocardiogram (ECG) based biometric authentication schemes.
The proposed framework can help investigators and developers on ECG based biometric authentication
mechanisms define the boundaries of required datasets and get training data with good quality.
To determine the boundaries of datasets, use case analysis is adopted. Based on various application
scenarios on ECG based authentication, three distinct use cases (or authentication categories)
are developed. With more qualified training data given to corresponding machine learning schemes,
the precision on ML-based ECG biometric authentication mechanisms is increased in consequence.
ECG time slicing technique with the R-peak anchoring is utilized in this framework to acquire ML
training data with good quality. In the proposed framework four new measure metrics are introduced
to evaluate the quality of ML training and testing data. In addition, a Matlab toolbox, containing
all proposed mechanisms, metrics and sample data with demonstrations using various ML techniques,
is developed and publicly available for further investigation. For developing ML-based ECG biometric
authentication, the proposed framework can guide researchers to prepare the proper ML setups and
the ML training datasets along with three identified user case scenarios. For researchers adopting
ML techniques to design new schemes in other research domains, the proposed framework is still useful
for generating ML-based training and testing datasets with good quality and utilizing new measure
metrics.
