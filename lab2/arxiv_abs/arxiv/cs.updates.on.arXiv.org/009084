Recently, clustering with deep network framework has attracted attention of several researchers
in the computer vision community. Deep framework gains extensive attention due to its efficiency
and scalability towards large-scale and high-dimensional data. In this paper, we transform supervised
CNN classifier architecture into an unsupervised clustering model, called RECAL, which jointly
learns discriminative embedding subspace and cluster labels. RECAL is made up of feature extraction
layers which are convolutional, followed by unsupervised classifier layers which is fully connected.
A multinomial logistic regression function (softmax) stacked on top of classifier layers. We train
this network using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. However, the successful implementation
of our model is revolved around the design of loss function. Our loss function uses the heuristics
that true partitioning entails lower entropy given that the class distribution is not heavily skewed.
This is a trade-off between the situations of "skewed distribution" and "low-entropy". To handle
this, we have proposed classification entropy and class entropy which are the two components of
our loss function. In this approach, size of the mini-batch should be kept high. Experimental results
indicate the consistent and competitive behavior of our model for clustering well-known digit,
multi-viewed object and face datasets. Morever, we use this model to generate unsupervised patch
segmentation for multi-spectral LISS-IV images. We observe that it is able to distinguish built-up
area, wet land, vegetation and waterbody from the underlying scene.
