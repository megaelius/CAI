Consider a set of autonomous computational entities, called \emph{robots}, operating inside
a polygonal enclosure (possibly with holes), that have to perform some collaborative tasks. The
boundary of the polygon obstructs both visibility and mobility of a robot. Since the polygon is initially
unknown to the robots, the natural approach is to first explore and construct a map of the polygon.
For this, the robots need an unlimited amount of persistent memory to store the snapshots taken from
different points inside the polygon. However, it has been shown by Di Luna et al. [DISC 2017] that
map construction can be done even by oblivious robots by employing a positional encoding strategy
where a robot carefully positions itself inside the polygon to encode information in the binary
representation of its distance from the closest polygon vertex. Of course, to execute this strategy,
it is crucial for the robots to make accurate movements. In this paper, we address the question whether
this technique can be implemented even when the movements of the robots are unpredictable in the
sense that the robot can be stopped by the adversary during its movement before reaching its destination.
However, there exists a constant $\delta > 0$, unknown to the robot, such that the robot can always
reach its destination if it has to move by no more than $\delta$ amount. This model is known in literature
as \emph{non-rigid} movement. We give a partial answer to the question in the affirmative by presenting
a map construction algorithm for robots with non-rigid movement, but having $O(1)$ bits of persistent
memory and ability to make circular moves.
