Secret sharing provides a means to distribute shares of a secret such that any authorized subset
of shares, specified by an access structure, can be pooled together to recompute the secret. The
standard secret sharing model requires public access structures, which violates privacy and facilitates
the adversary by revealing high-value targets. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by introducing
\emph{hidden access structures}, which remain secret until some authorized subset of parties
collaborate. The central piece of this work is the construction of a set-system $\mathcal{H}$ with
strictly greater than $\exp\left(c \dfrac{1.5 (\log h)^2}{\log \log h}\right)$ subsets of a set
of $h$ elements. Our set-system $\mathcal{H}$ is defined over $\mathbb{Z}_m$, where $m$ is a non-prime-power,
such that the size of each set in $\mathcal{H}$ is divisible by $m$ but the sizes of their pairwise
intersections are not divisible by $m$, unless one set is a subset of another. We derive a vector family
$\mathcal{V}$ from $\mathcal{H}$ such that superset-subset relationships in $\mathcal{H}$
are represented by inner products in $\mathcal{V}$. We use $\mathcal{V}$ to "encode" the access
structures and thereby develop the first \emph{access structure hiding} secret sharing scheme.
The information rate (secret-size/maximum-share-size) of our scheme is $1/2$. For a setting with
$\ell$ parties, our scheme supports $2^{\ell}$ out of the $2^{2^{\ell - O(\log \ell)}}$ possible
access structures. The scheme assumes semi-honest polynomial-time parties, and its security
relies on the Generalized Diffie-Hellman assumption.
