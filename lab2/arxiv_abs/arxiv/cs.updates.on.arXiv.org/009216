Trauma is the worldwide leading cause of death and disability in those younger than 45 years, and
pelvic fractures are a major source of morbidity and mortality. Automated segmentation of multiple
foci of arterial bleeding from abdominopelvic trauma CT could provide rapid objective measurements
of the total extent of active bleeding, potentially augmenting outcome prediction at the point
of care, while improving patient triage, allocation of appropriate resources, and time to definitive
intervention. In spite of the importance of active bleeding in the quick tempo of trauma care, the
task is still quite challenging due to the variable contrast, intensity, location, size, shape,
and multiplicity of bleeding foci. Existing work [4] presents a heuristic rule-based segmentation
technique which requires multiple stages and cannot be efficiently optimized end-to-end. To this
end, we present, Multi-Scale Attentional Network (MSAN), the first yet reliable end-to-end network,
for automated segmentation of active hemorrhage from contrast-enhanced trauma CT scans. MSAN
consists of the following components: 1) an encoder which fully integrates the global contextual
information from holistic 2D slices; 2) a multi-scale strategy applied both in the training stage
and the inference stage to handle the challenges induced by variation of target sizes; 3) an attentional
module to further refine the deep features, leading to better segmentation quality; and 4) a multi-view
mechanism to fully leverage the 3D information. Our MSAN reports a significant improvement of more
than 7% compared to prior arts in terms of DSC.
