Land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
many environment modeling and land use inventories. In this study, a hybrid feature optimization
algorithm along with a deep learning classifier is proposed to improve performance of LULC classification,
helping to predict wildlife habitat, deteriorating environmental quality, haphazard, etc. LULC
classification is assessed using Sat 4, Sat 6 and Eurosat datasets. After the selection of remote
sensing images, normalization and histogram equalization methods are used to improve the quality
of the images. Then, a hybrid optimization is accomplished by using the Local Gabor Binary Pattern
Histogram Sequence (LGBPHS), the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and Haralick texture features,
for the feature extraction from the selected images. The benefits of this hybrid optimization are
a high discriminative power and invariance to color and grayscale images. Next, a Human Group based
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to select the optimal features, whose benefits
are fast convergence rate and easy to implement. After selecting the optimal feature values, a Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is utilized to classify the LULC classes. Experimental results
showed that the Human Group based PSO algorithm with a LSTM classifier effectively well differentiates
the land use and land cover classes in terms of classification accuracy, recall and precision. A
minimum of 0.01% and a maximum of 2.56% improvement in accuracy is achieved compared to the existing
models GoogleNet, VGG, AlexNet, ConvNet, when the proposed method is applied.
