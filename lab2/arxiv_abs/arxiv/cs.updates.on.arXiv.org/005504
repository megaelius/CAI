Today's Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are large, complex, and affixed with networked sensors
and actuators that are targets for cyber-attacks. Conventional detection techniques are unable
to deal with the increasingly dynamic and complex nature of the CPSs. On the other hand, the networked
sensors and actuators generate large amounts of data streams that can be continuously monitored
for intrusion events. Unsupervised machine learning techniques can be used to model the system
behaviour and classify deviant behaviours as possible attacks. In this work, we proposed a novel
Generative Adversarial Networks-based Anomaly Detection (GAN-AD) method for such complex networked
CPSs. We used LSTM-RNN in our GAN to capture the distribution of the multivariate time series of the
sensors and actuators under normal working conditions of a CPS. Instead of treating each sensor's
and actuator's time series independently, we model the time series of multiple sensors and actuators
in the CPS concurrently to take into account of potential latent interactions between them. To exploit
both the generator and the discriminator of our GAN, we deployed the GAN-trained discriminator
together with the residuals between generator-reconstructed data and the actual samples to detect
possible anomalies in the complex CPS. We used our GAN-AD to distinguish abnormal attacked situations
from normal working conditions for a complex six-stage Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. Experimental
results showed that the proposed strategy is effective in identifying anomalies caused by various
attacks with high detection rate and low false positive rate as compared to existing methods.
