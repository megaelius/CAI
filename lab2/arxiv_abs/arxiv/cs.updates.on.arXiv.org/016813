In a broad range of computer vision applications, the purpose of Low-rank matrix approximation
(LRMA) models is to recover the underlying low-rank matrix from its degraded observation. The latest
LRMA methods - Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) resort to using the nuclear norm minimization
(NNM) as a convex relaxation of the non-convex rank minimization. However, NNM tends to over-shrink
the rank components and treats the different rank components equally, limiting its flexibility
in practical applications. We use a more flexible model, namely the Weighted Schatten p-Norm Minimization
(WSNM), to generalize the NNM to the Schatten p-norm minimization with weights assigned to different
singular values. The proposed WSNM not only gives a better approximation to the original low-rank
assumption but also considers the importance of different rank components. In this paper, a comparison
of the low-rank recovery performance of two LRMA algorithms- RPCA and WSNM is brought out on occluded
human facial images. The analysis is performed on facial images from the Yale database and over own
database , where different facial expressions, spectacles, varying illumination account for
the facial occlusions. The paper also discusses the prominent trends observed from the experimental
results performed through the application of these algorithms. As low-rank images sometimes might
fail to capture the details of a face adequately, we further propose a novel method to use the image-histogram
of the sparse images thus obtained to identify the individual in any given image. Extensive experimental
results show, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that WSNM surpasses RPCA in its performance
more effectively by removing facial occlusions, thus giving recovered low-rank images of higher
PSNR and SSIM.
