Numerical modeling of fluid flows based on kinetic equations provides an alternative approach
for the description of complex flows simulations, and a number of kinetic methods have been developed.
A particular challenge for kinetic methods is whether they can capture the correct hydrodynamic
behavior in the continuum limit without resolving kinetic scale. Historically, the first effort
to study the asymptotic behavior of kinetic schemes could be attributed to the pioneering work of
Larsen (Nucl. Sci. Eng. 83, 90 (1983). Currently, a variety of asymptotic preserving (AP) kinetic
methods have been constructed. However, the detailed asymptotic properties of these schemes are
indistinguishable under the AP framework. In order to distinguish different characteristics
of kinetic schemes, in this paper we will introduce the concept of unified preserving (UP) which
can be used to assess the effective governing equations solved in the asymptotic process. Unlike
the general analysis of AP property in the hydrodynamic scale, the current UP analysis is able to
indicate asmyptotic orders of kinetic schemes by employing the modified equation approach. Generally,
the UP properties of a kinetic scheme depend on the spatial/temporal accuracy and closely on the
inter-connections among the three scales (kinetic scale, numerical scale, and hydrodynamic scale),
and the concept of UP attempts to distinguish those scales with clear orders. Specifically, the
numerical resolution and specific discretization determine the numerical flow behaviors of the
scheme in different regimes, especially in the near continuum limit with a large variation of the
above three scales. The UP analysis will be used in the Discrete Unified Gas-kinetic Scheme (DUGKS)
to evaluate its underlying governing equations in the continuum limit in terms of the kinetic, numerical,
and hydrodynamic scales.
