For developing a better comprehension of the large-scale effects of a cyber attack, the paper examines
the effects of infections with self-replicating malware --- described by an SIR model --- on a distributed
system. A Lanchester model of military forces engaged in kinetic combat serves as sample system
affected by the malware. Its game-like setting illustrates the effects of malware in a concise way.
Corresponding evaluation criteria are derived. Basic knowledge about the expected circumstances
restricts the set of scenarios to be analyzed. Remaining uncertainties are taken into account by
applying Monte-Carlo simulations, whereby the scenarios to be processed are selected randomly
by information-theoretic principles. The resulting framework allows a model-based calculation
of the risk and the fraction of scenarios, in which malware attacks can assure the win for kinetically
inferior forces, depending on the specifical circumstances. For showing the value and the validity
of the method, the proposed analysis method is applied to an exemplary situation, in which sparse
knowledge causes large uncertainties about the situation. Based on the example we have derived
some key findings: (1) Malware attacks affecting availability can turn around the outcome of the
kinetic combat in a significant fraction of scenarios. (2) Cyber capabilities tend to soften out
kinetic superiority or inferiority. (3) Using the most aggressive malware is not necessarily the
best decision for an aggressor. (4) Starting countermeasures against a malware attack at the earliest
possible time is not always the best decision for a defender.
