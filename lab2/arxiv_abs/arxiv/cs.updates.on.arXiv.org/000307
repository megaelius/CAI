In wiretap channels the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) is commonly assumed to
be known at transmitter, fully or partially. However, under perfect secrecy constraint the eavesdropper
may not be motivated to feedback any correct CSI. In this paper we consider a more feasible problem
for the transmitter to have eavesdropper's CSI. That is, the fast fading multiple-antenna Gaussian
broadcast channels (FMGBC-CM) with confidential messages, where both receivers are legitimate
users such that they both are willing to feedback accurate CSI to maintain their secure transmission,
and not to be eavesdropped by the other. We assume that only the statistics of the channel state information
are known by the transmitter. We first show the necessary condition for the FMGBC-CM not to be degraded
to the common wiretap channels. Then we derive the achievable rate region for the FMGBC-CM where
the channel input covariance matrices and the inflation factor are left unknown and to be solved.
After that we provide an analytical solution to the channel input covariance matrices. We also propose
an iterative algorithm to solve the channel input covariance matrices and the inflation factor.
Due to the complicated rate region formulae in normal SNR, we resort to low SNR analysis to investigate
the characteristics of the channel. Finally, numerical examples show that under perfect secrecy
constraint both users can achieve positive rates simultaneously, which verifies our derived necessary
condition. Numerical results also elucidate the effectiveness of the analytic solution and proposed
algorithm of solving the channel input covariance matrices and the inflation factor under different
conditions.
