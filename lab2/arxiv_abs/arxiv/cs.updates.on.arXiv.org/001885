Arithmetic complexity is considered simpler to understand than Boolean complexity, namely computing
Boolean functions via logical gates. And indeed, we seem to have significantly more lower bound
techniques and results in arithmetic complexity than in Boolean complexity. Despite many successes
and rapid progress, however, challenges like proving super-polynomial lower bounds on circuit
or formula size for explicit polynomials, or super-linear lower bounds on explicit 3-dimensional
tensors, remain elusive. At the same time, we have plenty more "barrier results" for failing to prove
basic lower bounds in Boolean complexity than in arithmetic complexity. Finding barriers to arithmetic
lower bound techniques seem harder, and despite some attempts we have no excuses of similar quality
for these failures in arithmetic complexity. This paper aims to add to this study. We address rank
methods, which were long recognized as encompassing and abstracting almost all known arithmetic
lower bounds to-date, including the most recent impressive successes. Rank methods (or flattenings)
are also in wide use in algebraic geometry for proving tensor rank and symmetric tensor rank lower
bounds. Our main results are barriers to these methods. In particular, 1. Rank methods cannot prove
better than $\Omega_d (n^{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor})$ lower bound on the tensor rank of any $d$-dimensional
tensor of side $n$. (In particular, they cannot prove super-linear, indeed even $>8n$ tensor rank
lower bounds for any 3-dimensional tensors.) 2. Rank methods cannot prove $\Omega_d (n^{\lfloor
d/2 \rfloor})$ on the Waring rank of any $n$-variate polynomial of degree $d$. (In particular, they
cannot prove such lower bounds on stronger models, including depth-3 circuits.)
