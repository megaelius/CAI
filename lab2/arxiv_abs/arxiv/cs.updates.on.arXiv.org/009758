One major problem with cyberbullying research is the lack of data, since researchers are traditionally
forced to rely on survey data where victims and perpetrators self-report their impressions. In
this paper, an automatic data collection system is presented that continuously collects in-game
chat data from one of the most popular online multi-player games: World of Tanks. The data was collected
and combined with other information about the players from available online data services. It presents
a scoring scheme to enable identification of cyberbullying based on current research. Classification
of the collected data was carried out using simple feature detection with SQL database queries and
compared to classification from AI-based sentiment text analysis services that have recently
become available and further against manually classified data using a custom-built classification
client built for this paper. The simple SQL classification proved to be quite useful at identifying
some features of toxic chat such as the use of bad language or racist sentiments, however the classification
by the more sophisticated online sentiment analysis services proved to be disappointing. The results
were then examined for insights into cyberbullying within this game and it was shown that it should
be possible to reduce cyberbullying within the World of Tanks game by a significant factor by simply
freezing the player's ability to communicate through the in-game chat function for a short period
after the player is killed within a match. It was also shown that very new players are much less likely
to engage in cyberbullying, suggesting that it may be a learned behaviour from other players.
