In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for anatomy segmentation and automatic
landmark- ing. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of mandible segmentation from
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and identification of 9 anatomical landmarks of the
mandible on the geodesic space. The overall approach employs three inter-related steps. In step
1, we propose a deep neu- ral network architecture with carefully designed regularization, and
network hyper-parameters to perform image segmentation without the need for data augmentation
and complex post- processing refinement. In step 2, we formulate the landmark localization problem
directly on the geodesic space for sparsely- spaced anatomical landmarks. In step 3, we propose
to use a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to identify closely- spaced landmarks, which is rather
difficult to obtain using other standard detection networks. The proposed fully automated method
showed superior efficacy compared to the state-of-the- art mandible segmentation and landmarking
approaches in craniofacial anomalies and diseased states. We used a very challenging CBCT dataset
of 50 patients with a high-degree of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) variability that is realistic in
clinical practice. Complementary to the quantitative analysis, the qualitative visual inspection
was conducted for distinct CBCT scans from 250 patients with high anatomical variability. We have
also shown feasibility of the proposed work in an independent dataset from MICCAI Head-Neck Challenge
(2015) achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Lastly, we present an in-depth analysis of
the proposed deep networks with respect to the choice of hyper-parameters such as pooling and activation
functions.
