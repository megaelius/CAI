NVMs have promising advantages (e.g., lower idle power, higher density) over the existing predominant
main memory technology, DRAM. Yet, NVMs also have disadvantages (e.g., limited endurance). System
architects are therefore examining hybrid DRAM-NVM main memories to enable the advantages of NVMs
while avoiding the disadvantages as much as possible. Unfortunately, the hybrid memory design
space is very large and complex due to the existence of very different types of NVMs and their rapidly-changing
characteristics. Therefore, optimization of performance and lifetime of hybrid memory based
computing platforms and their experimental evaluation using traditional simulation methods
can be very time-consuming and sometimes even impractical. As such, it is necessary to develop a
fast and flexible analytical model to estimate the performance and lifetime of hybrid memories
on various workloads. This paper presents an analytical model for hybrid memories based on Markov
decision processes. The proposed model estimates the hit ratio and lifetime for various configurations
of DRAM-NVM hybrid main memories. Our model also provides accurate estimation of the effect of data
migration policies on the hybrid memory hit ratio, one of the most important factors in hybrid memory
performance and lifetime. Such an analytical model can aid designers to tune hybrid memory configurations
to improve performance and/or lifetime. We present several optimizations that make our model more
efficient while maintaining its accuracy. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed
model (a) accurately predicts the hybrid memory hit ratio with an average error of 4.61% on a commodity
server, (b) accurately estimates the NVM lifetime with an average error of 2.93%, and (c) is on average
4x faster than conventional state-of-the-art simulation platforms for hybrid memories.
