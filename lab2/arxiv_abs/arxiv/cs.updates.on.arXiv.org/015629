An exciting new development in differential privacy is the shuffled model, in which an anonymous
channel enables non-interactive, differentially private protocols with error much smaller than
what is possible in the local model, while relying on weaker trust assumptions than in the central
model. In this paper, we study basic counting problems in the shuffled model and establish separations
between the error that can be achieved in the single-message shuffled model and in the shuffled model
with multiple messages per user. For the problem of frequency estimation for $n$ users and a domain
of size $B$, we obtain: - A nearly tight lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}( \min(\sqrt[4]{n}, \sqrt{B}))$
on the error in the single-message shuffled model. This implies that the protocols obtained from
the amplification via shuffling work of Erlingsson et al. (SODA 2019) and Balle et al. (Crypto 2019)
are essentially optimal for single-message protocols. A key ingredient in the proof is a lower bound
on the error of locally-private frequency estimation in the low-privacy (aka high $\epsilon$)
regime. - Protocols in the multi-message shuffled model with $poly(\log{B}, \log{n})$ bits of
communication per user and $poly\log{B}$ error, which provide an exponential improvement on the
error compared to what is possible with single-message algorithms. For the related selection problem
on a domain of size $B$, we prove: - A nearly tight lower bound of $\Omega(B)$ on the number of users
in the single-message shuffled model. This significantly improves on the $\Omega(B^{1/17})$
lower bound obtained by Cheu et al. (Eurocrypt 2019), and when combined with their $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{B})$-error
multi-message protocol, implies the first separation between single-message and multi-message
protocols for this problem.
