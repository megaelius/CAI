As Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data sharing among multiple parties becomes increasingly
common, so does the potential for data leakage. As required by new data protection regulations and
laws, when PII leakage occurs, one must be able to reliably identify the leaking sources. Existing
solutions utilize watermark technologies or data object allocation strategies to differentiate
the data shared with different parties to identify potential leakers. However, these solutions
lose their effectiveness under several attack scenarios, e.g., a data sender may leak the data and
a receiver may deny the reception of certain shared data. Worse yet, multiple receivers might collude
and apply a set of operations such as intersection, complement, and union to their received datasets
before leaking them, making the task of leaker identification even more difficult. In this paper,
we propose AuditShare, a PII dataset sharing system with reliable leaking source identification.
Firstly, taking advantage of the intrinsic properties of PII data, AuditShare allocates data objects
to individual sharing parties by PII attributes. Secondly, AuditShare obliviously transfers
data between the sender and each receiver and uses a Merkle Tree as an immutable record of the sharing.
Thirdly, a knowledge-based identification algorithm is proposed to identify a guilty sender or
colluding/non-colluding receivers. Through our evaluation, we show that: (i) With a modest amount
of leaked data, AuditShare can accurately (accuracy>99.99%) and undeniably identify all the guilty
parties in different cases; (ii) It only takes 0.5 second to share 100,000 data objects in AuditShare,
which is practical in real-world deployment.
