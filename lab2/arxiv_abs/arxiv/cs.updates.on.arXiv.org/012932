A novel class of achievable rate regions is obtained for the K-receiver broadcast channel with two
groupcast messages. The associated achievability schemes are parameterized by an expansion of
the message set which then determines how random coding techniques are employed, which include
generalized versions of {\em up-set} message-splitting, the generation of possibly multiple
auxiliary codebooks for certain compositions of split messages using superposition coding, partial
interference decoding at all receivers, and joint unique and non-unique decoding. New capacity
results are established for certain partially ordered classes of general broadcast channels for
certain two non-nested messages. Moreover, when specialized to the combination network (CN),
some of the inner bounds are shown, via converse results, to result in the capacity region for (a)
the two messages intended for two sets of K-1 receivers each and (b) two nested messages in which one
message is intended for one or (c) two (common) receivers. In the latter two cases, we hence recover
previous results by Bidokhti et al obtained therein using network coding schemes based on rate-splitting
and linear superposition coding. Furthermore, we show the achievability of rate pairs in two examples
of CNs, with three and four common receivers each, used in the previous literature to show the sub-optimality
of rate-splitting and linear superposition coding, and to motivate a pre-encoding technique and
a block-Markov linear superposition coding for the CN, with the latter then lifted to the general
broadcast channel. Our results suggest that the proposed framework here, when specialized to the
CN, is strong enough to incorporate the enhancements afforded by those two latter techniques, thereby
suggesting among other things, that perhaps block-Markov superposition coding is not necessary
for the general broadcast channel.
