We study the Identity problem for matrix semigroups. The Identity problem is to decide whether there
exists the identity matrix in the given matrix semigroup. It has been recently shown that the Identity
problem is NP-complete for a matrix semigroup generated by matrices from the Special Linear Group
SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and it is undecidable for semigroups generated by 48 matrices from SL$(4,\mathbb{Z})$.
Many computational problems for matrix semigroups and groups are computationally hard starting
from dimension two and very often become undecidable from dimension three and four even in the case
of integer matrices. All undecidability proofs for matrix problems require injective semigroup
morphism from a pair of words over any finite alphabet into matrices. In this paper we significantly
expand the horizon of known decidability area for matrix semigroups by showing that there is no embedding
from a set of pairs of words over a semigroup alphabet to any matrix semigroup in SL$(3,\mathbb{Z})$
and consequently show that there is no embedding from a set of pairs of group words into $\mathbb{Z}^{3
\times 3}$. As the decidability status of the Identity problem in dimension three is still a long
standing open problem, we look for an important subgroup of SL$(3,\mathbb{Z})$, the Heisenberg
group H$(3,\mathbb{Z})$, for which the Identity problem could be decidable following our result
on non-existence of embedding. We show that the Identity problem for a matrix semigroup generated
by matrices from H$(3,\mathbb{Z})$ and even H$(3,\mathbb{Q})$ is decidable in polynomial time.
Furthermore, we extend the decidability result for H$(n,\mathbb{Q})$ in any dimension $n$. Moreover
we are tightening the gap between decidability and undecidability results by reducing the bound
on the size of the generator set from 48 to 9 for $4\times4$ matrix semigroups over integers.
