May 30-June 2, 2017, Scholarship for Service (SFS) scholars at the University of Maryland, Baltimore
County (UMBC) analyzed the security of a targeted aspect of the UMBC computer systems. During this
hands-on study, with complete access to source code, students identified vulnerabilities, devised
and implemented exploits, and suggested mitigations. As part of a pioneering program at UMBC to
extend SFS scholarships to community colleges, the study helped initiate six students from two
nearby community colleges, who transferred to UMBC in fall 2017 to complete their four-year degrees
in computer science and information systems. The study examined the security of a set of "NetAdmin"
custom scripts that enable UMBC faculty and staff to open the UMBC firewall to allow external access
to machines they control for research purposes. Students discovered vulnerabilities stemming
from weak architectural design, record overflow, and failure to sanitize inputs properly. For
example, they implemented a record-overflow and code-injection exploit that exfiltrated the
vital API key of the UMBC firewall. This report summarizes student activities and findings, and
reflects on lessons learned for students, educators, and system administrators. Our students
found the collaborative experience inspirational, students and educators appreciated the authentic
case study, and IT administrators gained access to future employees and received free recommendations
for improving the security of their systems. We hope that other universities can benefit from our
motivational and educational strategy of teaming educators and system administrators to engage
students in active project-based learning centering on focused questions about their university
computer systems.
