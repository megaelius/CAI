To strike a balance between energy efficiency and data quality control, this paper proposes a sensor
censoring scheme for distributed sparse signal recovery via compressive-sensing based wireless
sensor networks. In the proposed approach, each sensor node employs a sparse sensing vector with
known support for data compression, meanwhile enabling making local inference about the unknown
support of the sparse signal vector of interest. This naturally leads to a ternary censoring protocol,
whereby each sensor (i) directly transmits the real-valued compressed data if the sensing vector
support is detected to be overlapped with the signal support, (ii) sends a one-bit hard decision
if empty support overlap is inferred, (iii) keeps silent if the measurement is judged to be uninformative.
Our design then aims at minimizing the error probability that empty support overlap is decided but
otherwise is true, subject to the constraints on a tolerable false-alarm probability that non-empty
support overlap is decided but otherwise is true, and a target censoring rate. We derive a closed-form
formula of the optimal censoring rule; a low complexity implementation using bi-section search
is also developed. In addition, the average communication cost is analyzed. To aid global signal
reconstruction under the proposed censoring framework, we propose a modified l_1-minimization
based algorithm, which exploits certain sparse nature of the hard decision vector received at the
fusion center. Analytic performance guarantees, characterized in terms of the restricted isometry
property, are also derived. Computer simulations are used to illustrate the performance of the
proposed scheme.
