This paper addresses the following fundamental maximum throughput routing problem: Given an arbitrary
edge-capacitated $n$-node directed network and a set of $k$ commodities, with source-destination
pairs $(s_i,t_i)$ and demands $d_i> 0$, admit and route the largest possible number of commodities
-- i.e., the maximum {\em throughput} -- to satisfy their demands. The main contributions of this
paper are two-fold: First, we present a bi-criteria approximation algorithm for this all-or-nothing
multicommodity flow (ANF) problem. Our algorithm is the first to achieve a {\em constant approximation
of the maximum throughput} with an {\em edge capacity violation ratio that is at most logarithmic
in $n$}, with high probability. Our approach is based on a version of randomized rounding that keeps
splittable flows, rather than approximating those via a non-splittable path for each commodity:
This allows our approach to work for {\em arbitrary directed edge-capacitated graphs}, unlike
most of the prior work on the ANF problem. Our algorithm also works if we consider the weighted throughput,
where the benefit gained by fully satisfying the demand for commodity $i$ is determined by a given
weight $w_i>0$. Second, we present a derandomization of our algorithm that maintains the same approximation
bounds, using novel pessimistic estimators for Bernstein's inequality. In addition, we show how
our framework can be adapted to achieve a polylogarithmic fraction of the maximum throughput while
maintaining a constant edge capacity violation, if the network capacity is large enough. One important
aspect of our randomized and derandomized algorithms is their {\em simplicity}, which lends to
efficient implementations in practice.
