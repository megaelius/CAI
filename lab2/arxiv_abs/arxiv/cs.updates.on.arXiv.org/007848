The detection of new or enlarged white-matter lesions in multiple sclerosis is a vital task in the
monitoring of patients undergoing disease-modifying treatment for multiple sclerosis. However,
the definition of 'new or enlarged' is not fixed, and it is known that lesion-counting is highly subjective,
with high degree of inter- and intra-rater variability. Automated methods for lesion quantification
hold the potential to make the detection of new and enlarged lesions consistent and repeatable.
However, the majority of lesion segmentation algorithms are not evaluated for their ability to
separate progressive from stable patients, despite this being a pressing clinical use-case. In
this paper we show that change in volumetric measurements of lesion load alone is not a good method
for performing this separation, even for highly performing segmentation methods. Instead, we
propose a method for identifying lesion changes of high certainty, and establish on a dataset of
longitudinal multiple sclerosis cases that this method is able to separate progressive from stable
timepoints with a very high level of discrimination (AUC = 0.99), while changes in lesion volume
are much less able to perform this separation (AUC = 0.71). Validation of the method on a second external
dataset confirms that the method is able to generalize beyond the setting in which it was trained,
achieving an accuracy of 83% in separating stable and progressive timepoints. Both lesion volume
and count have previously been shown to be strong predictors of disease course across a population.
However, we demonstrate that for individual patients, changes in these measures are not an adequate
means of establishing no evidence of disease activity. Meanwhile, directly detecting tissue which
changes, with high confidence, from non-lesion to lesion is a feasible methodology for identifying
radiologically active patients.
