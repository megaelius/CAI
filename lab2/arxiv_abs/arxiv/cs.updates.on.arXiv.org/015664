One of the most challenging issues in applied mathematics is to develop and analyze algorithms which
are able to approximately compute solutions of high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs). In particular, it is very hard to develop approximation algorithms which do not
suffer under the curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of computational operations
needed by the algorithm to compute an approximation of accuracy $\epsilon > 0$ grows at most polynomially
in both the reciprocal $1/\epsilon$ of the required accuracy and the dimension $d \in \mathbb{N}$
of the PDE. Recently, a new approximation method, the so-called full history recursive multilevel
Picard (MLP) approximation method, has been introduced and, until today, this approximation scheme
is the only approximation method in the scientific literature which has been proven to overcome
the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of semilinear PDEs with general time
horizons. It is a key contribution of this article to extend the MLP approximation method to systems
of semilinear PDEs and to numerically test it on several example PDEs. More specifically, we apply
the proposed MLP approximation method in the case of Allen-Cahn PDEs, Sine-Gordon-type PDEs, systems
of coupled semilinear heat PDEs, and semilinear Black-Scholes PDEs in up to 1000 dimensions. The
presented numerical simulation results suggest in the case of each of these example PDEs that the
proposed MLP approximation method produces very accurate results in short runtimes and, in particular,
the presented numerical simulation results indicate that the proposed MLP approximation scheme
significantly outperforms certain deep learning based approximation methods for high-dimensional
semilinear PDEs.
