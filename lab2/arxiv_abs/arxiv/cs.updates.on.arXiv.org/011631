Socially assistive robots (SAR) have shown great potential to augment the social and educational
development of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). As SAR continues to substantiate
itself as an effective enhancement to human intervention, researchers have sought to study its
longitudinal impacts in real-world environments, including the home. Computational personalization
stands out as a central computational challenge as it is necessary to enable SAR systems to adapt
to each child's unique and changing needs. Toward that end, we formalized personalization as a hierarchical
human robot learning framework (hHRL) consisting of five controllers (disclosure, promise, instruction,
feedback, and inquiry) mediated by a meta-controller that utilized reinforcement learning to
personalize instruction challenge levels and robot feedback based on each user's unique learning
patterns. We instantiated and evaluated the approach in a study with 17 children with ASD, aged 3
to 7 years old, over month-long interventions in their homes. Our findings demonstrate that the
fully autonomous SAR system was able to personalize its instruction and feedback over time to each
child's proficiency. As a result, every child participant showed improvements in targeted skills
and long-term retention of intervention content. Moreover, all child users were engaged for a majority
of the intervention, and their families reported the SAR system to be useful and adaptable. In summary,
our results show that autonomous, personalized SAR interventions are both feasible and effective
in providing long-term in-home developmental support for children with diverse learning needs.
