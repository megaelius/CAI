A discounted-sum automaton (NDA) is a nondeterministic finite automaton with edge weights, valuing
a run by the discounted sum of visited edge weights. More precisely, the weight in the i-th position
of the run is divided by $\lambda^i$, where the discount factor $\lambda$ is a fixed rational number
greater than 1. The value of a word is the minimal value of the automaton runs on it. Discounted summation
is a common and useful measuring scheme, especially for infinite sequences, reflecting the assumption
that earlier weights are more important than later weights. Unfortunately, determinization of
NDAs, which is often essential in formal verification, is, in general, not possible. We provide
positive news, showing that every NDA with an integral discount factor is determinizable. We complete
the picture by proving that the integers characterize exactly the discount factors that guarantee
determinizability: for every nonintegral rational discount factor $\lambda$, there is a nondeterminizable
$\lambda$-NDA. We also prove that the class of NDAs with integral discount factors enjoys closure
under the algebraic operations min, max, addition, and subtraction, which is not the case for general
NDAs nor for deterministic NDAs. For general NDAs, we look into approximate determinization, which
is always possible as the influence of a word's suffix decays. We show that the naive approach, of
unfolding the automaton computations up to a sufficient level, is doubly exponential in the discount
factor. We provide an alternative construction for approximate determinization, which is singly
exponential in the discount factor, in the precision, and in the number of states. We also prove matching
lower bounds, showing that the exponential dependency on each of these three parameters cannot
be avoided. All our results hold equally for automata over finite words and for automata over infinite
words.
