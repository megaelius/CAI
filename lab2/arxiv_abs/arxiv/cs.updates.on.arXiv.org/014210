With the advancement in personal smart devices and pervasive network connectivity, users are no
longer passive content consumers, but also contributors in producing new contents. This expansion
in live services requires a detailed analysis of broadcasters' and viewers' behavior to maximize
users' Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we present a dataset gathered from one of the popular
live streaming platforms: Facebook. In this dataset, we stored more than 1,500,000 live stream
records collected in June and July 2018. These data include public live videos from all over the world.
However, Facebook live API does not offer the possibility to collect online videos with their fine
grained data. The API allows to get the general data of a stream, only if we know its ID (identifier).
Therefore, using the live map website provided by Facebook and showing the locations of online streams
and locations of viewers, we extracted video IDs and different coordinates along with general metadata.
Then, having these IDs and using the API, we can collect the fine grained metadata of public videos
that might be useful for the research community. We also present several preliminary analyses to
describe and identify the patterns of the streams and viewers. Such fine grained details will enable
the multimedia community to recreate real-world scenarios particularly for resource allocation,
caching, computation, and transcoding in edge networks. Existing datasets do not provide the locations
of the viewers, which limits the efforts made to allocate the multimedia resources as close as possible
to viewers and to offer better QoE.
