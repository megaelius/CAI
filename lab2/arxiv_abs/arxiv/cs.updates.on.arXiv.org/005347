The relentless development of the Internet of Things (IoT) communication technologies and the
gradual maturity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to a powerful cognitive computing ability.
Users can now access efficient and convenient smart services in smart-city, green-IoT and heterogeneous
networks. AI has been applied in various areas, including the intelligent household, advanced
health-care, automatic driving and emotional interactions. This paper focuses on current wireless-communication
technologies, including cellular-communication technologies (4G, 5G), low-power wide-area
(LPWA) technologies with an unlicensed spectrum (LoRa, SigFox), and other LPWA technologies supported
by 3GPP working with an authorized spectrum (EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT). We put forward a cognitive
low-power wide-area-network (Cognitive-LPWAN) architecture to safeguard stable and efficient
communications in a heterogeneous IoT. To ensure that the user can employ the AI efficiently and
conveniently, we realize a variety of LPWA technologies to safeguard the network layer. In addition,
to balance the demand for heterogeneous IoT devices with the communication delay and energy consumption,
we put forward the AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method, starting from the perspective of traffic control.
The AI algorithm provides the smart control of wireless-communication technology, intelligent
applications and services for the choice of different wireless-communication technologies.
As an example, we consider the AIWAC emotion interaction system, build the Cognitive-LPWAN and
test the proposed AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method. The experimental results show that our scheme
can meet the demands of communication-delay applications. Cognitive-LPWAN selects appropriate
communication technologies to achieve a better interaction experience.
