This paper investigates the incentive mechanism design from a novel and practically important
perspective in which mobile users as contributors do not join simultaneously and a requester desires
large efforts from early contributors. A two-stage Tullock contest framework is constructed:at
the second stage the potential contributors compete for splittable reward by exerting efforts,
and at the first stage the requester can orchestrate the incentive mechanism to maximize his crowdsensing
efficiency given the rewarding budget. A general reward discrimination mechanism is developed
for timeliness sensitive crowdsensing where an earlier contributor usually has a larger maximum
achievable reward and thus allocates more efforts. Owning to the lack of joining time information,
two practical implementations, namely earliest-n and termination time, are announced to the contributors.
For each of them, we formulate a Stackelberg Bayesian game in which the joining time of a contributor
is his type and not available to his opponents. The uniqueness of Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE)
is proved in each strategy. To maximize the requester's efficiency, we compute the optimal number
of rewarded contributors in the earliest-n scheme and the optimal deadline in the termination time
scheme. Our contest framework is applicable not only to the closed crowdsensing with fixed number
of contributors, but also to the open crowdsensing that the arrival of contributors is governed
by a stochastic process. Extensive simulations manifest that with appropriate reward discriminations,
the requester is able to achieve a much higher efficiency with the optimal selection of the number
of rewarded contributiors and the termination time.
