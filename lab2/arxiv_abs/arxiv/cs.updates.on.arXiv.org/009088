With use and appropriation of digital environments by the Green Cane movement in Brazil, the informational
character in health is a central discursive resource, and occurs imbued with (self) conceptions
about the characteristic ways of thinking, feeling and acting of the person with low vision. This
work aims at exploring the discourse of the person with low vision in the social media about their
own social identity. Based on the Interactive Health Communication, videos on Youtube and Facebook
and Instagram posts of the Virtual Group Stargardt, a virtual community made up of people with low
vision and suffering from Stargardt's Disease, were investigated. From the selection of excerpts
and their coding, 42 identity traits were identified and grouped into a synthetic model with 08 categories:
(T1) we are low vision and we use the green cane; (T2) we have sensitivity to light and we wear sunglasses;
(T3) we have difficulties in the day-to-day, but we use assistive strategies and technologies;
(T4) we are a PcD (Person with Disability) and we have rights guaranteed by law; (T5) we seek to understand
about our disease and we are the spokesperson of it; (T6) we have a visual impairment, but we are not
just that; (T7) we live with conflicts and contradictions by the way we see things, and; (T8) we recognize
as a community. Such traits are constructed interactively, through a construction based on moments
of agreement, disagreement and good humor. The discourses are oriented in the consolidation of
a proper identity, distinct from the person with blindness, but similar in the legal framework of
the visually impaired person.
