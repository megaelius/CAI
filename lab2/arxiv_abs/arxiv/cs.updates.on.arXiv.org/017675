We study the problem of assigning workers to tasks where each task has demand for a particular number
of workers, and the demands are dynamically changing over time. Specifically, a worker-task assignment
function $\phi$ takes a multiset of $w$ tasks $T \subseteq [t]$ and produces an assignment $\phi(T)$
from the workers $1, 2, \ldots, w$ to the tasks $T$. The assignment function $\phi$ is said to have
switching cost at most $k$ if, for all task multisets $T$, changing the contents of $T$ by one task
changes $\phi(T)$ by at most $k$ worker assignments. The goal of the worker-task assignment problem
is to produce an assignment function $\phi$ with the minimum possible switching cost. Prior work
on this problem (SSS'17, ICALP'20) observed a simple assignment function $\phi$ with switching
cost $\min(w, t - 1)$, but there has been no success in constructing $\phi$ with sublinear switching
cost. We construct the first assignment function $\phi$ with sublinear, and in fact polylogarithmic,
switching cost. We give a probabilistic construction for $\phi$ that achieves switching cost $O(\log
w \log (wt))$ and an explicit construction that achieves switching cost $\operatorname{polylog}
(wt)$. From the lower bounds side, prior work has used involved arguments to prove constant lower
bounds on switching cost, but no super-constant lower bounds are known. We prove the first super-constant
lower bound on switching cost. In particular, we show that for any value of $w$ there exists a value
of $t$ for which the optimal switching cost is $w$. That is, when $w \ll t$, the trivial bound on switching
cost is optimal. We also consider an application of the worker-task assignment problem to a metric
embeddings problem. In particular, we use our results to give the first low-distortion embedding
from sparse binary vectors into low-dimensional Hamming space.
