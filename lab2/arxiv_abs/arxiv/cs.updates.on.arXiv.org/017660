Gynaecologists and obstetricians visually interpret cardiotocography (CTG) traces using the
International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) guidelines to assess the wellbeing
of the foetus during antenatal care. This approach has raised concerns among professionals with
regards to inter- and intra-variability where clinical diagnosis only has a 30\% positive predictive
value when classifying pathological outcomes. Machine learning models, trained with FIGO and
other user derived features extracted from CTG traces, have been shown to increase positive predictive
capacity and minimise variability. This is only possible however when class distributions are
equal which is rarely the case in clinical trials where case-control observations are heavily skewed
in favour of normal outcomes. Classes can be balanced using either synthetic data derived from resampled
case training data or by decreasing the number of control instances. However, this either introduces
bias or removes valuable information. Concerns have also been raised regarding machine learning
studies and their reliance on manually handcrafted features. While this has led to some interesting
results, deriving an optimal set of features is considered to be an art as well as a science and is often
an empirical and time consuming process. In this paper, we address both of these issues and propose
a novel CTG analysis methodology that a) splits CTG time-series signals into n-size windows with
equal class distributions, and b) automatically extracts features from time-series windows using
a one dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) ensemble.
Collectively, the proposed approach normally distributes classes and removes the need to handcrafted
features from CTG traces.
