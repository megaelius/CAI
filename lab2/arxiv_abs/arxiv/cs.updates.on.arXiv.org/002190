Incorporating graph-based techniques in the analysis of multivariate signals is becoming a standard
method to understand the interdependency of activity recorded at different sites. The new research
frontier in this field includes the important problem of how to assess dynamic changes of signal
activity. We address this problem in a novel way by defining the graph-variate signal through the
unified framework of multivariate signals and network science. Inspired by ideas in graph signal
processing, we go in a new direction by considering the relationship between graph edges and the
instantaneous graph signal, leveraging graphs of reliable connectivity information to filter
instantaneous bivariate functions of the multivariate signal. This opens up a powerful and robust
approach to analyse joint signal and network dynamics at sample resolution. Furthermore, this
can be formulated as instantaneous networks for which standard network analysis can be implemented.
In the case for which graph connectivity is estimated from the multivariate signal itself, we illustrate
how the appropriate consideration of instantaneous graph signal functions allow for a novel dynamic
connectivity measure, here referred to as graph-variate dynamic (GVD) connectivity, robust to
spurious short-term dependencies. Particularly, we present appropriate functions for three
pertinent connectivity metrics- correlation, coherence and the phase-lag index. Our approach
can determine signals with a single correlated couple against wholly uncorrelated data up to 128
nodes in signal size; it is shown to be more robust than other GSP approaches in detecting a randomly
traveling spheroid on a 3D grid and than standard dynamic connectivity in determining differences
in EEG resting-state and task related activity, and we demonstrate its use in revealing hidden depth
correlations from geographical gamma ray data.
