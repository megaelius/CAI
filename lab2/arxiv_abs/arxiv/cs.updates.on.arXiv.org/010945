Leveraging an equivalence property in the state-space of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) has been
investigated in several studies. This paper studies equivalence structure in the reinforcement
learning (RL) setup, where transition distributions are no longer assumed to be known. We present
a notion of similarity between transition probabilities of various state-action pairs of an MDP,
which naturally defines an equivalence structure in the state-action space. We present equivalence-aware
confidence sets for the case where the learner knows the underlying structure in advance. These
sets are provably smaller than their corresponding equivalence-oblivious counterparts. In the
more challenging case of an unknown equivalence structure, we present an algorithm called ApproxEquivalence
that seeks to find an (approximate) equivalence structure, and define confidence sets using the
approximate equivalence. To illustrate the efficacy of the presented confidence sets, we present
C-UCRL, as a natural modification of UCRL2 for RL in undiscounted MDPs. In the case of a known equivalence
structure, we show that C-UCRL improves over UCRL2 in terms of regret by a factor of $\sqrt{SA/C}$,
in any communicating MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and $C$ classes, which corresponds to a massive
improvement when $C \ll SA$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing regret
bounds for RL when an equivalence structure in the MDP is efficiently exploited. In the case of an
unknown equivalence structure, we show through numerical experiments that C-UCRL combined with
ApproxEquivalence outperforms UCRL2 in ergodic MDPs.
