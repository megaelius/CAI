We study the planted clique problem in which a clique of size $k$ is planted in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
graph of size $n$ and one wants to recover this planted clique. For $k=\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, polynomial
time algorithms can find the planted clique. The fastest such algorithms run in time linear $O(n^2)$
(or nearly linear) in the size of the input [FR10,DGGP14,DM15a]. In this work, we develop sublinear
time algorithms that find the planted clique when $k=\omega(\sqrt{n \log \log n})$. Our algorithms
can recover the clique in time $\widetilde{O}\left(n+(\frac{n}{k})^{3}\right)=\widetilde{O}\left(n^{\frac{3}{2}}\right)$
when $k=\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$, and in time $\widetilde{O}\left(n^2/\exp{\left(\frac{k^2}{24n}\right)}\right)$
for $\omega(\sqrt{n\log \log n})=k=o(\sqrt{n\log{n}})$. An ${\Omega}(n)$ running time lower
bound for the planted clique recovery problem follows easily from the results of [RS19] and therefore
our recovery algorithms are optimal whenever $k = \Omega(n^{\frac{2}{3}})$. As the lower bound
of [RS19] builds on purely information theoretic arguments, it cannot provide a detection lower
bound stronger than $\widetilde{\Omega}(\frac{n^2}{k^2})$. Since our algorithms for $k = \Omega(\sqrt{n
\log n})$ run in time $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{n^3}{k^3} + n\right)$, we show stronger lower
bounds based on computational hardness assumptions. With a slightly different notion of the planted
clique problem we show that the Planted Clique Conjecture implies the following. A natural family
of non-adaptive algorithms---which includes our algorithms for clique detection---cannot reliably
solve the planted clique detection problem in time $O\left( \frac{n^{3-\delta}}{k^3}\right)$
for any constant $\delta>0$. Thus we provide evidence that if detecting small cliques is hard, it
is also likely that detecting large cliques is not \textit{too} easy.
