This two-part paper presents a feedback-based cross-layer framework for distributed sensing
and estimation of a dynamical process in a wireless sensor network(WSN) in which the sensor nodes
(SNs) communicate their measurements to a fusion center (FC) via B orthogonal wireless channels.Cross-layer
factors such as packet collisions and the sensing-transmission costs are accounted for.Each SN
adapts its sensing-transmission action based on its own local observation quality and the estimation
quality feedback from the FC.The sensing-transmission strategy is optimized,with the overall
objective to minimize the mean squared estimation error (MSE) at the FC,under cost constraints
for each SN.In this first part,the high optimization complexity, typical of multi-agent systems,
is reduced by exploiting the statistical symmetry and large network approximation of the WSN.Structural
properties of the optimal policy are derived for a coordinated scheme, where the FC schedules each
SN, and a decentralized one, where each SN performs a local sensing-transmission decision. It is
proved that a dense WSN provides sensing diversity, i.e., only a few SNs with the best local observation
quality suffice to sense-transmit accurately, with no degradation in the MSE, despite the fluctuations
in the observation quality experienced across the WSN.The optimal policy dictates that, when the
estimation quality is poor, only the best SNs activate, otherwise all SNs remain idle to preserve
energy.The costs of coordination and feedback are evaluated, revealing the scalability of the
decentralized scheme to large WSNs, at the cost of an MSE degradation.Simulation results demonstrate
that adaptive schemes designed in this way yield cost savings from 30% to 70% over non-adaptive ones,
and significant performance gains with respect to an estimator proposed in the literature, which
does not consider these cross-layer factors.
