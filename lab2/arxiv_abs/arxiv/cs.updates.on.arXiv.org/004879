Despite the steady progress in video analysis led by the adoption of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), the relative improvement has been less drastic as that in 2D static image classification.
Three main challenges exist including spatial (image) feature representation, temporal information
representation, and model/computation complexity. It was recently shown by Carreira and Zisserman
that 3D CNNs, inflated from 2D networks and pretrained on ImageNet, could be a promising way for spatial
and temporal representation learning. However, as for model/computation complexity, 3D CNNs
are much more expensive than 2D CNNs and prone to overfit. We seek a balance between speed and accuracy
by building an effective and efficient video classification system through systematic exploration
of critical network design choices. In particular, we show that it is possible to replace many of
the 3D convolutions by low-cost 2D convolutions. Rather surprisingly, best result (in both speed
and accuracy) is achieved when replacing the 3D convolutions at the bottom of the network, suggesting
that temporal representation learning on high-level semantic features is more useful. Our conclusion
generalizes to datasets with very different properties. When combined with several other cost-effective
designs including separable spatial/temporal convolution and feature gating, our system results
in an effective video classification system that that produces very competitive results on several
action classification benchmarks (Kinetics, Something-something, UCF101 and HMDB), as well
as two action detection (localization) benchmarks (JHMDB and UCF101-24).
