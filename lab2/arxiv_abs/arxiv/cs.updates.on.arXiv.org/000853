We give a polynomial time, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the traveling repairman
problem (TRP) in the Euclidean plane and on weighted trees. This improves on the known quasi-polynomial
time approximation schemes for these problems. The algorithm is based on a simple technique that
reduces the TRP to what we call the \emph{segmented TSP}. Here, we are given numbers $l_1,\dots,l_K$
and $n_1,\dots,n_K$ and we need to find a path that visits at least $n_h$ points within path distance
$l_h$ from the starting point for all $h\in\{1,\dots,K\}$. A solution is $\alpha$-approximate
if at least $n_h$ points are visited within distance $\alpha l_h$. It is shown that any algorithm
that is $\alpha$-approximate for \emph{every constant} $K$ in some metric space, gives an $\alpha(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
for the TRP in the same metric space. Subsequently, approximation schemes are given for this segmented
TSP problem in the plane and on weighted trees. The segmented TSP with only one segment ($K=1$) is
equivalent to the $k$-TSP for which a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation is known for a general metric
space. Hence, this approach through the segmented TSP gives new impulse for improving on the 3.59-approximation
for TRP in a general metric space. A similar reduction applies to many other minimum latency problems.
To illustrate the strength of this approach we apply it to the well-studied scheduling problem of
minimizing total weighted completion time under precedence constraints, $1|prec|\sum w_{j}C_{j}$,
and present a polynomial time approximation scheme for the case of interval order precedence constraints.
This improves on the known $3/2$-approximation for this problem. Both approximation schemes apply
as well if release dates are added to the problem.
