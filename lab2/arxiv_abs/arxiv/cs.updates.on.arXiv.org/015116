The main goal of our research is to develop an effective method with a wide range of applications for
the statistical reconstruction of heterogeneous microstructures with compact inclusions of
any shape, such as highly irregular grains. The devised approach uses multi-scale extended entropic
descriptors (ED) that quantify the degree of spatial non-uniformity of configurations of finite-sized
objects. This technique is an innovative development of previously elaborated entropy methods
for statistical reconstruction. For simplicity, we discuss the two-dimensional case, but this
method can be generalized into three dimensions. At the first stage, the developed procedure creates
a set of black synthetic clusters that serve as surrogate inclusions. The clusters have the same
individual areas and interfaces as their target counterparts, but random shapes. Then, from a given
number of easy-to-generate synthetic cluster configurations, we choose the one with the lowest
value of the cost function defined by us using extended ED. At the second stage, we make a significant
change in the standard technique of simulated annealing (SA). Instead of swapping pixels of different
phases, we randomly move each of the selected synthetic clusters. To verify our method, we analyze
a sample selected from the literature dealing with silica randomly dispersed in a rubber matrix.
The results show that our method provides convincing realizations for this type of complex microstructures.
The advantages of the two-stage reconstruction (TSR) include the ease of obtaining synthetic microstructures,
very low computational costs and satisfactory mapping in the statistical context of inclusion
shapes. Finally, the simplicity of TSR should greatly facilitate independent applications.
