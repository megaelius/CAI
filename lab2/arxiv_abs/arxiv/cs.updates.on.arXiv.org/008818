We study the problem of maximizing privacy of data sets by adding random vectors generated via synchronized
chaotic oscillators. In particular, we consider the setup where information about data sets, queries,
is sent through public (unsecured) communication channels to a remote station. To hide private
features (specific entries) within the data set, we corrupt the response to queries by adding random
vectors. We send the distorted query (the sum of the requested query and the random vector) through
the public channel. The distribution of the additive random vector is designed to minimize the mutual
information (our privacy metric) between private entries of the data set and the distorted query.
We cast the synthesis of this distribution as a convex program in the probabilities of the additive
random vector. Once we have the optimal distribution, we propose an algorithm to generate pseudo-random
realizations from this distribution using trajectories of a chaotic oscillator. At the other end
of the channel, we have a second chaotic oscillator, which we use to generate realizations from the
same distribution. Note that if we obtain the same realizations on both sides of the channel, we can
simply subtract the realization from the distorted query to recover the requested query. To generate
equal realizations, we need the two chaotic oscillators to be synchronized, i.e., we need them to
generate exactly the same trajectories on both sides of the channel synchronously in time. We force
the two chaotic oscillators into exponential synchronization using a driving signal. Simulations
are presented to illustrate our results.
