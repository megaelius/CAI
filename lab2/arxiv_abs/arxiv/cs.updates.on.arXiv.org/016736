Observation Resilient Authentication Schemes (ORAS) are a class of shared secret challenge-response
identification schemes where a user mentally computes the response via a cognitive function to
authenticate herself such that eavesdroppers cannot readily extract the secret. Security evaluation
of ORAS generally involves quantifying information leaked via observed challenge-response pairs.
However, little work has evaluated information leaked via human behavior while interacting with
these schemes. A common way to achieve observation resilience is by including a modulus operation
in the cognitive function. This minimizes the information leaked about the secret due to the many-to-one
map from the set of possible secrets to a given response. In this work, we show that user behavior can
be used as a side-channel to obtain the secret in such ORAS. Specifically, the user's eye-movement
patterns and associated timing information can deduce whether a modulus operation was performed
(a fundamental design element), to leak information about the secret. We further show that the secret
can still be retrieved if the deduction is erroneous, a more likely case in practice. We treat the
vulnerability analytically, and propose a generic attack algorithm that iteratively obtains
the secret despite the "faulty" modulus information. We demonstrate the attack on five ORAS, and
show that the secret can be retrieved with considerably less challenge-response pairs than non-side-channel
attacks (e.g., algebraic/statistical attacks). In particular, our attack is applicable on Mod10,
a one-time-pad based scheme, for which no non-side-channel attack exists. We field test our attack
with a small-scale eye-tracking user study.
