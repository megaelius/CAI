Inverse Vandermonde matrix calculation is a long-standing problem to solve nonsingular linear
system $Vc=b$ where the rows of a square matrix $V$ are constructed by progression of the power polynomials.
It has many applications in scientific computing including interpolation, super-resolution,
and construction of special matrices applied in cryptography. Despite its numerous applications,
the matrix is highly ill-conditioned where specialized treatments are considered for approximation
such as conversion to Cauchy matrix, spectral decomposition, and algorithmic tailoring of the
numerical solutions. In this paper, we propose a generalized algorithm that takes arbitrary pairwise
(non-repetitive) sample nodes for solving inverse Vandermonde matrix. This is done in two steps:
first, a highly balanced recursive algorithm is introduced with $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complexity
to solve the combinatorics summation of the elementary symmetric polynomials; and second, a closed-form
solution is tailored for inverse Vandermonde where the matrix' elements utilize this recursive
summation for the inverse calculations. The numerical stability and accuracy of the proposed inverse
method is analyzed through the spectral decomposition of the Frobenius companion matrix that associates
with the corresponding Vandermonde matrix. The results show significant improvement over the
state-of-the-art solutions using specific nodes such as $N$th roots of unity defined on the complex
plane. A basic application in one dimensional interpolation problem is considered to demonstrate
the utility of the proposed method for super-resolved signals.
