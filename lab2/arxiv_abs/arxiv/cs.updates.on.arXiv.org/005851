Robust and lane-level positioning is essential for autonomous vehicles. As an irreplaceable sensor,
LiDAR can provide continuous and high-frequency pose estimation by means of mapping, on condition
that enough environment features are available. The error of mapping can accumulate over time.
Therefore, LiDAR is usually integrated with other sensors. In diverse urban scenarios, the environment
feature availability relies heavily on the traffic (moving and static objects) and the degree of
urbanization. Common LiDAR-based SLAM demonstrations tend to be studied in light traffic and less
urbanized area. However, its performance can be severely challenged in deep urbanized cities,
such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, and New York with dense traffic and tall buildings. This paper proposes
to analyze the performance of standalone NDT-based graph SLAM and its reliability estimation in
diverse urban scenarios to further evaluate the relationship between the performance of LiDAR-based
SLAM and scenario conditions. The normal distribution transform (NDT) is employed to calculate
the transformation between frames of point clouds. Then, the LiDAR odometry is performed based
on the calculated continuous transformation. The state-of-the-art graph-based optimization
is used to integrate the LiDAR odometry measurements to implement optimization. The 3D building
models are generated and the definition of the degree of urbanization based on Skyplot is proposed.
Experiments are implemented in different scenarios with different degrees of urbanization and
traffic conditions. The results show that the performance of the LiDAR-based SLAM using NDT is strongly
related to the traffic condition and degree of urbanization.
