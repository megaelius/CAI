Graph Identification (GI) has long been researched in graph learning and is essential in certain
applications (e.g. social community detection). Specifically, GI requires to predict the label/score
of a target graph given its collection of node features and edge connections. While this task is common,
more complex cases arise in practice---we are supposed to do the inverse thing by, for example, grouping
similar users in a social network given the labels of different communities. This triggers an interesting
thought: can we identify nodes given the labels of the graphs they belong to? Therefore, this paper
defines a novel problem dubbed Inverse Graph Identification (IGI), as opposed to GI. Upon a formal
discussion of the variants of IGI, we choose a particular case study of node clustering by making
use of the graph labels and node features, with an assistance of a hierarchical graph that further
characterizes the connections between different graphs. To address this task, we propose Gaussian
Mixture Graph Convolutional Network (GMGCN), a simple yet effective method that makes the node-level
message passing process using Graph Attention Network (GAT) under the protocol of GI and then infers
the category of each node via a Gaussian Mixture Layer (GML). The training of GMGCN is further boosted
by a proposed consensus loss to take advantage of the structure of the hierarchical graph. Extensive
experiments are conducted to test the rationality of the formulation of IGI. We verify the superiority
of the proposed method compared to other baselines on several benchmarks we have built up. We will
release our codes along with the benchmark data to facilitate more research attention to the IGI
problem.
