Shared edge computing platforms, which enable Application Service Providers (ASPs) to deploy
applications in close proximity to mobile users are providing ultra-low latency and location-awareness
to a rich portfolio of services. Though ubiquitous edge service provisioning, i.e., deploying
the application at all possible edge sites, is always preferable, it is impractical due to often
limited operational budget of ASPs. In this case, an ASP has to cautiously decide where to deploy
the edge service and how much budget it is willing to use. A central issue here is that the service demand
received by each edge site, which is the key factor of deploying benefit, is unknown to ASPs a priori.
What's more complicated is that this demand pattern varies temporally and spatially across geographically
distributed edge sites. In this paper, we investigate an edge resource rental problem where the
ASP learns service demand patterns for individual edge sites while renting computation resource
at these sites to host its applications for edge service provisioning. An online algorithm, called
Context-aware Online Edge Resource Rental (COERR), is proposed based on the framework of Contextual
Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandit (CC-MAB). COERR observes side-information (context) to learn
the demand patterns of edge sites and decides rental decisions (including where to rent the computation
resource and how much to rent) to maximize ASP's utility given a limited budget. COERR provides a
provable performance achieving sublinear regret compared to an Oracle algorithm that knows exactly
the expected service demand of edge sites. Experiments are carried out on a real-world dataset and
the results show that COERR significantly outperforms other benchmarks.
