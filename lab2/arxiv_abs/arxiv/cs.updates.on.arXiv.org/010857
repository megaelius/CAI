Change detection in dynamic networks is an important problem in many areas, such as fraud detection,
cyber intrusion detection and health care monitoring. It is a challenging problem because it involves
a time sequence of graphs, each of which is usually very large and sparse with heterogeneous vertex
degrees, resulting in a complex, high dimensional mathematical object. Spectral embedding methods
provide an effective way to transform a graph to a lower dimensional latent Euclidean space that
preserves the underlying structure of the network. Although change detection methods that use
spectral embedding are available, they do not address sparsity and degree heterogeneity that usually
occur in noisy real-world graphs and a majority of these methods focus on changes in the behaviour
of the overall network. In this paper, we adapt previously developed techniques in spectral graph
theory and propose a novel concept of applying Procrustes techniques to embedded points for vertices
in a graph to detect changes in entity behaviour. Our spectral embedding approach not only addresses
sparsity and degree heterogeneity issues, but also obtains an estimate of the appropriate embedding
dimension. We call this method CDP (change detection using Procrustes analysis). We demonstrate
the performance of CDP through extensive simulation experiments and a real-world application.
CDP successfully detects various types of vertex-based changes including (i) changes in vertex
degree, (ii) changes in community membership of vertices, and (iii) unusual increase or decrease
in edge weight between vertices. The change detection performance of CDP is compared with two other
baseline methods that employ alternative spectral embedding approaches. In both cases, CDP generally
shows superior performance.
