Double slit interference experiment is fundamental for quantum mechanics (QM) presenting wave-particle
duality as emphasized by Richard Feynman. Previous quantum computing (QC) architectures with
simple interference set-ups utilizing generally the wave nature and superposition have cost of
exponential increase in resources of time, space or energy. In this article, wave-particle duality,
tensor product Hilbert space of particle trajectory histories and Feynman's path integral formalism
are combined in a simple multi-plane interference set-up with a novel QC architecture denoted by
quantum path computing (QPC). It is theoretically valid for all particles including electrons,
photons, neutrons and molecules possessing path integral based modeling of QM in slit based interference
architectures. QPC solves specific instances of simultaneous Diophantine approximation problem
(NP-hard) as an important application. It combines exponentially large number of trajectories
exploiting the particle nature while performing interference measurements exploiting the wave
nature. QPC does not explicitly require exponential complexity of resources by combining tensor
product space of path history inherently existing in physical set-up and path integrals naturally
including histories. Hidden subgroup problem is solved as a fundamental QC tool in analogy with
period finding algorithms utilizing quantum gates and multiple qubit entanglement while determining
computational complexity of solving capability is an open issue. In addition, single plane interference
systems analyzing exotic paths are extended to multi-plane set-up while simulations consider
non-negligible effects of multiple exotic paths. Challenges are discussed for modeling complexity
and experimental aspects including source energy and detection sensitivity.
