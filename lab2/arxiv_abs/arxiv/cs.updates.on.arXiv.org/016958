Quantum computations are typically compiled into a circuit of basic quantum gates. Just like for
classical circuits, a quantum compiler should optimize the quantum circuit, e.g. by minimizing
the number of required gates. Optimizing quantum circuits is not only relevant for improving the
runtime of quantum algorithms in the long term, but is also particularly important for near-term
quantum devices that can only implement a small number of quantum gates before noise renders the
computation useless. An important building block for many quantum circuit optimization techniques
is pattern matching, where given a large and a small quantum circuit, we are interested in finding
all maximal matches of the small circuit, called pattern, in the large circuit, considering pairwise
commutation of quantum gates. In this work, we present a classical algorithm for pattern matching
that provably finds all maximal matches in time polynomial in the circuit size (for a fixed pattern
size). Our algorithm works for both quantum and reversible classical circuits. We demonstrate
numerically that our algorithm, implemented in the open-source library Qiskit, scales considerably
better than suggested by the theoretical worst-case complexity and is practical to use for circuit
sizes typical for near-term quantum devices. Using our pattern matching algorithm as the basis
for known circuit optimization techniques such as template matching and peephole optimization,
we demonstrate a significant (~30%) reduction in gate count for random quantum circuits, and are
able to further improve practically relevant quantum circuits that were already optimized with
state-of-the-art techniques.
