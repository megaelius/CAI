Mosquitoes are a major vector for malaria, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths in the developing
world each year. Not only is the prevention of mosquito bites of paramount importance to the reduction
of malaria transmission cases, but understanding in more forensic detail the interplay between
malaria, mosquito vectors, vegetation, standing water and human populations is crucial to the
deployment of more effective interventions. Typically the presence and detection of malaria-vectoring
mosquitoes is only quantified by hand-operated insect traps or signified by the diagnosis of malaria.
If we are to gather timely, large-scale data to improve this situation, we need to automate the process
of mosquito detection and classification as much as possible. In this paper, we present a candidate
mobile sensing system that acts as both a portable early warning device and an automatic acoustic
data acquisition pipeline to help fuel scientific inquiry and policy. The machine learning algorithm
that powers the mobile system achieves excellent off-line multi-species detection performance
while remaining computationally efficient. Further, we have conducted preliminary live mosquito
detection tests using low-cost mobile phones and achieved promising results. The deployment of
this system for field usage in Southeast Asia and Africa is planned in the near future. In order to
accelerate processing of field recordings and labelling of collected data, we employ a citizen
science platform in conjunction with automated methods, the former implemented using the Zooniverse
platform, allowing crowdsourcing on a grand scale.
