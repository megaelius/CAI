Knowledge over the number of animals in large wildlife reserves is a vital necessity for park rangers
in their efforts to protect endangered species. Manual animal censuses are dangerous and expensive,
hence Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with consumer level digital cameras are becoming a popular
alternative tool to estimate livestock. Several works have been proposed that semi-automatically
process UAV images to detect animals, of which some employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
a recent family of deep learning algorithms that proved very effective in object detection in large
datasets from computer vision. However, the majority of works related to wildlife focuses only
on small datasets (typically subsets of UAV campaigns), which might be detrimental when presented
with the sheer scale of real study areas for large mammal census. Methods may yield thousands of false
alarms in such cases. In this paper, we study how to scale CNNs to large wildlife census tasks and present
a number of recommendations to train a CNN on a large UAV dataset. We further introduce novel evaluation
protocols that are tailored to censuses and model suitability for subsequent human verification
of detections. Using our recommendations, we are able to train a CNN reducing the number of false
positives by an order of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art. Setting the requirements
at 90% recall, our CNN allows to reduce the amount of data required for manual verification by three
times, thus making it possible for rangers to screen all the data acquired efficiently and to detect
almost all animals in the reserve automatically.
