Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in biomedical image processing, which recent breakthroughs
in deep learning have allowed to improve. However, deep learning methods in general are not yet widely
used in practice since they require large amount of data for training complex models. This is particularly
challenging for biomedical images, because data and ground truths are a scarce resource. Annotation
efforts for biomedical images come with a real cost, since experts have to manually label images
at pixel-level on samples usually containing many instances of the target anatomy (e.g. in histology
samples: neurons, astrocytes, mitochondria, etc.). In this paper we provide a framework for Deep
Active Learning applied to a real-world scenario. Our framework relies on the U-Net architecture
and overall uncertainty measure to suggest which sample to annotate. It takes advantage of the uncertainty
measure obtained by taking Monte Carlo samples while using Dropout regularization scheme. Experiments
were done on spinal cord and brain microscopic histology samples to perform a myelin segmentation
task. Two realistic small datasets of 14 and 24 images were used, from different acquisition settings
(Serial Block-Face Electron Microscopy and Transmitting Electron Microscopy) and showed that
our method reached a maximum Dice value after adding 3 uncertainty-selected samples to the initial
training set, versus 15 randomly-selected samples, thereby significantly reducing the annotation
effort. We focused on a plausible scenario and showed evidence that this straightforward implementation
achieves a high segmentation performance with very few labelled samples. We believe our framework
may benefit any biomedical researcher willing to obtain fast and accurate image segmentation on
their own dataset. The code is freely available at https://github.com/neuropoly/deep-active-learning.
