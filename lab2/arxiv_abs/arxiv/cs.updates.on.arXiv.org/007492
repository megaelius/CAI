Most languages, especially in Africa, have fewer or no established part-of-speech (POS) tagged
corpus. However, POS tagged corpus is essential for natural language processing (NLP) to support
advanced researches such as machine translation, speech recognition, etc. Even in cases where
there is no POS tagged corpus, there are some languages for which parallel texts are available online.
The task of POS tagging a new language corpus with a new tagset usually face a bootstrapping problem
at the initial stages of the annotation process. The unavailability of automatic taggers to help
the human annotator makes the annotation process to appear infeasible to quickly produce adequate
amounts of POS tagged corpus for advanced NLP research and training the taggers. In this paper, we
demonstrate the efficacy of a POS annotation method that employed the services of two automatic
approaches to assist POS tagged corpus creation for a novel language in NLP. The two approaches are
cross-lingual and monolingual POS tags projection. We used cross-lingual to automatically create
an initial 'errorful' tagged corpus for a target language via word-alignment. The resources for
creating this are derived from a source language rich in NLP resources. A monolingual method is applied
to clean the induce noise via an alignment process and to transform the source language tags to the
target language tags. We used English and Igbo as our case study. This is possible because there are
parallel texts that exist between English and Igbo, and the source language English has available
NLP resources. The results of the experiment show a steady improvement in accuracy and rate of tags
transformation with score ranges of 6.13% to 83.79% and 8.67% to 98.37% respectively. The rate of
tags transformation evaluates the rate at which source language tags are translated to target language
tags.
