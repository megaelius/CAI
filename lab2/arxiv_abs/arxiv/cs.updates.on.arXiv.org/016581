In recent years, the next generation of wireless communication (5G) plays a significant role in
both industry and academy societies. Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication
technology has been one of the prominent services for 5G. For C-V2X transmission mode, there is a
newly defined communication channel (sidelink) that can support direct C-V2X communication.
Direct C-V2X communication is a technology that allows vehicles to communicate and share safety-related
information with other traffic participates directly without going through the cellular network.
The C-V2X data packet will be delivered to all traffic Users (UE) in the proximity of the Transmitter
(Tx). Some UEs might not successfully receive the data packets during one transmission but the sidelink
Tx is not able to check whether the Receivers (Rxs) get the information or not due to the lack of feedback
channel. For enabling the strict requirements in terms of reliability and latency for C-V2X communication,
we propose and evaluate one retransmission scheme and retransmission with different traffic speed
scheme. These schemes try to improve the reliability of the safety-related data by one blind retransmission
without requiring feedback. Although this retransmission scheme is essential to C-V2X communication,
the scheme has a limitation in the performance aspect because of its redundant retransmission.
Since radio resources for CV2X communication are limited, we have to detect the effect of retransmission
on the performance of the communication system. To the end, the simulator for evaluating the proposed
schemes for the C-V2X communication has been implemented, and the performances of the different
communication schemes are shown through the Packet Reception Ratio (PRR).
