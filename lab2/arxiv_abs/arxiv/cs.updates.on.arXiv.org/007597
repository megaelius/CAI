It has been known since Ehrhard and Regnier's seminal work on the Taylor expansion of $\lambda$-terms
that this operation commutes with normalization: the expansion of a $\lambda$-term is always normalizable
and its normal form is the expansion of the B\"ohm tree of the term. We generalize this result to the
non-uniform setting of the algebraic $\lambda$-calculus, i.e. $\lambda$-calculus extended
with linear combinations of terms. This requires us to tackle two difficulties: foremost is the
fact that Ehrhard and Regnier's techniques rely heavily on the uniform, deterministic nature of
the ordinary $\lambda$-calculus, and thus cannot be adapted; second is the absence of any satisfactory
generic extension of the notion of B\"ohm tree in presence of quantitative non-determinism, which
is reflected by the fact that the Taylor expansion of an algebraic $\lambda$-term is not always normalizable.
Our solution is to provide a fine grained study of the dynamics of $\beta$-reduction under Taylor
expansion, by introducing a notion of reduction on resource vectors, i.e. infinite linear combinations
of resource $\lambda$-terms. The latter form the multilinear fragment of the differential $\lambda$-calculus,
and resource vectors are the target of the Taylor expansion of $\lambda$-terms. We show the reduction
of resource vectors contains the image of any $\beta$-reduction step, from which we deduce that
Taylor expansion and normalization commute on the nose. We moreover identify a class of algebraic
$\lambda$-terms, encompassing both normalizable algebraic $\lambda$-terms and arbitrary ordinary
$\lambda$-terms: the expansion of these is always normalizable, which guides the definition of
a generalization of B\"ohm trees to this setting.
