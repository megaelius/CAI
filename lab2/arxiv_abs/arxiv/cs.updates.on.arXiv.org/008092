One prominent security threat that targets unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the capture via GPS
spoofing in which an attacker manipulates a UAV's global positioning system (GPS) signals in order
to capture it. Given the anticipated widespread deployment of UAVs for various purposes, it is imperative
to develop new security solutions against such attacks. In this paper, a mathematical framework
is introduced for analyzing and mitigating the effects of GPS spoofing attacks on UAVs. In particular,
system dynamics are used to model the optimal routes that the UAVs will adopt to reach their destinations.
The GPS spoofer's effect on each UAV's route is also captured by the model. To this end, the spoofer's
optimal imposed locations on the UAVs, are analytically derived; allowing the UAVs to predict their
traveling routes under attack. Then, a countermeasure mechanism is developed to mitigate the effect
of the GPS spoofing attack. The countermeasure is built on the premise of cooperative localization,
in which a UAV can determine its location using nearby UAVs instead of the possibly compromised GPS
locations. To better utilize the proposed defense mechanism, a dynamic Stackelberg game is formulated
to model the interactions between a GPS spoofer and a drone operator. In particular, the drone operator
acts as the leader that determines its optimal strategy in light of the spoofer's expected response
strategy. The equilibrium strategies of the game are then analytically characterized and studied
through a novel proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that, when combined with the Stackelberg
strategies, the proposed defense mechanism will outperform baseline strategy selection techniques
in terms of reducing the possibility of UAV capture
