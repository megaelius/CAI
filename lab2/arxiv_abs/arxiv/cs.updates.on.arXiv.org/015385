As life expectancy rises, age-related diseases causing dementia become more prevalent. In line
with this, the health economic impact of dementia is escalating to unsustainable levels, with estimates
that by 2050 dementia care will cost an annual $1 trillion in the US alone. The development of interventions
capable of improving cognition therefore represents an issue of the highest priority for healthcare.
There has been considerable focus on cognitive training (CT) in particular, but work to date has
been limited by two main factors, namely (i) the lack of transferability of CT gains to real life activities,
and (ii) the lack of adherence to CT programmes. This paper will outline a new CT paradigm designed
to offset these two limitations. This is achieved by combining the benefits of gamification, virtual
reality (VR), and affective adaptation in the development of an engaging, ecologically valid,
CT task. Additionally, it incorporates facial electromyography (EMG) as a means of determining
user emotional state while engaged in the CT task. This information is then utilised to dynamically
adjust the game's difficulty in real-time as users play, with the aim of leading them into a state
of flow. Emotion recognition rates of 64.1% and 76.2%, for valence and arousal respectively, were
achieved by classifying a DWT-Haar approximation of the input signal using kNN. The affect-aware
VR cognitive training intervention was then evaluated with a control group of older adults. The
results obtained substantiated the notion that adaptation techniques can lead to greater feelings
of competence thereby increasing intrinsic motivation for the activity, and a more appropriate
challenge of the user's skills.
