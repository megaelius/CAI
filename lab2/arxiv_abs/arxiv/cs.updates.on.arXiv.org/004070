The rise of graph analytic systems has created a need for new ways to measure and compare the capabilities
of graph processing systems. The MIT/Amazon/IEEE Graph Challenge has been developed to provide
a well-defined community venue for stimulating research and highlighting innovations in graph
analysis software, hardware, algorithms, and systems. GraphChallenge.org provides a wide range
of pre-parsed graph data sets, graph generators, mathematically defined graph algorithms, example
serial implementations in a variety of languages, and specific metrics for measuring performance.
Graph Challenge 2017 received 22 submissions by 111 authors from 36 organizations. The submissions
highlighted graph analytic innovations in hardware, software, algorithms, systems, and visualization.
These submissions produced many comparable performance measurements that can be used for assessing
the current state of the art of the field. There were numerous submissions that implemented the triangle
counting challenge and resulted in over 350 distinct measurements. Analysis of these submissions
show that their execution time is a strong function of the number of edges in the graph, $N_e$, and
is typically proportional to $N_e^{4/3}$ for large values of $N_e$. Combining the model fits of
the submissions presents a picture of the current state of the art of graph analysis, which is typically
$10^8$ edges processed per second for graphs with $10^8$ edges. These results are $30$ times faster
than serial implementations commonly used by many graph analysts and underscore the importance
of making these performance benefits available to the broader community. Graph Challenge provides
a clear picture of current graph analysis systems and underscores the need for new innovations to
achieve high performance on very large graphs.
