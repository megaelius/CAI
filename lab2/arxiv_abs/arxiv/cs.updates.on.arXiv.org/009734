In the last decades, large datasets of fundus photographs have been collected in diabetic retinopathy
(DR) screening networks. Through deep learning, these datasets were used to train automatic detectors
for DR and a few other frequent pathologies, with the goal to automate screening. One challenge limits
the adoption of such systems so far: automatic detectors ignore rare conditions that ophthalmologists
currently detect. The reason is that standard deep learning requires too many examples of these
conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a new machine learning (ML) framework, called
spin-off learning, for the automatic detection of rare conditions, like papilledema or anterior
ischemic optic neuropathy. This framework extends convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained
for frequent conditions, with an unsupervised probabilistic model for rare condition detection.
Spin-off learning is based on the observation that CNNs often perceive photographs containing
the same anomalies as similar, even though these CNNs were trained to detect unrelated conditions.
This observation was based on the t-SNE visualization tool, which we decided to incorporate in our
probabilistic model. Spin-off learning supports heatmap generation, so the detected anomalies
can be highlighted in images for decision support. Experiments in a dataset of 164,660 screening
examinations from the OPHDIAT screening network show that spin-off learning can detect 37 conditions,
out of 41, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) greater than 0.8 (average AUC: 0.938). In particular,
spin-off learning significantly outperforms other candidate ML frameworks for detecting rare
conditions, including multitask learning, transfer learning and one-shot learning. We expect
these richer predictions to trigger the adoption of automated eye pathology screening, which will
revolutionize clinical practice in ophthalmology.
