The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an emerging paradigm, driven by recent advancements in vehicular
communications and networking. Advances in research can now provide reliable communication links
between vehicles, via vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and between vehicles and roadside
infrastructures, via vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Meanwhile, the capability
and intelligence of vehicles are being rapidly enhanced, and this will have the potential of supporting
a plethora of new exciting applications, which will integrate fully autonomous vehicles, the Internet
of Things (IoT), and the environment. These trends will bring about an era of intelligent IoV, which
will heavily depend upon communications, computing, and data analytics technologies. To store
and process the massive amount of data generated by intelligent IoV, onboard processing and Cloud
computing will not be sufficient, due to resource/power constraints and communication overhead/latency,
respectively. By deploying storage and computing resources at the wireless network edge, e.g.,
radio access points, the edge information system (EIS), including edge caching, edge computing,
and edge AI, will play a key role in the future intelligent IoV. Such system will provide not only low-latency
content delivery and computation services, but also localized data acquisition, aggregation
and processing. This article surveys the latest development in EIS for intelligent IoV. Key design
issues, methodologies and hardware platforms are introduced. In particular, typical use cases
for intelligent vehicles are illustrated, including edge-assisted perception, mapping, and
localization. In addition, various open research problems are identified.
