In the context of optimization, visualization techniques can be useful for understanding the behaviour
of optimization algorithms and can even provide a means to facilitate human interaction with an
optimizer. Towards this goal, an image-based visualization framework, without dimension reduction,
that visualizes the solutions to large-scale global optimization problems as images is proposed.
In the proposed framework, the pixels visualize decision variables while the entire image represents
the overall solution quality. This framework affords a number of benefits over existing visualization
techniques including enhanced scalability (in terms of the number of decision variables), facilitation
of standard image processing techniques, providing nearly infinite benchmark cases, and explicit
alignment with human perception. Furthermore, image-based visualization can be used to visualize
the optimization process in real-time, thereby allowing the user to ascertain characteristics
of the search process as it is progressing. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first
realization of a dimension-preserving, scalable visualization framework that embeds the inherent
relationship between decision space and objective space. The proposed framework is utilized with
10 different mapping schemes on an image-reconstruction problem that encompass continuous, discrete,
binary, combinatorial, constrained, dynamic, and multi-objective optimization. The proposed
framework is then demonstrated on arbitrary benchmark problems with known optima. Experimental
results elucidate the flexibility and demonstrate how valuable information about the search process
can be gathered via the proposed visualization framework.
