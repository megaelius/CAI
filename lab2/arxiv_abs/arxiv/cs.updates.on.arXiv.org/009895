Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a manufacturing paradigm that builds three-dimensional objects
from a computer-aided design model by successively adding material layer by layer. AM has become
very popular in the past decade due to its utility for fast prototyping such as 3D printing as well
as manufacturing functional parts with complex geometries using processes such as laser metal
deposition that would be difficult to create using traditional machining. As the process for creating
an intricate part for an expensive metal such as Titanium is prohibitive with respect to cost, computational
models are used to simulate the behavior of AM processes before the experimental run. However, as
the simulations are computationally costly and time-consuming for predicting multiscale multi-physics
phenomena in AM, physics-informed data-driven machine-learning systems for predicting the behavior
of AM processes are immensely beneficial. Such models accelerate not only multiscale simulation
tools but also empower real-time control systems using in-situ data. In this paper, we design and
develop essential components of a scientific framework for developing a data-driven model-based
real-time control system. Finite element methods are employed for solving time-dependent heat
equations and developing the database. The proposed framework uses extremely randomized trees
- an ensemble of bagged decision trees as the regression algorithm iteratively using temperatures
of prior voxels and laser information as inputs to predict temperatures of subsequent voxels. The
models achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 1% for predicting temperature profiles for
AM processes. The code is made available for the research community at https://github.com/paularindam/ml-iter-additive.
