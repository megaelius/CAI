The present white paper focuses on the system requirements of TERRANOVA. Initially details the
key use cases for the TERRANOVA technology and presents the description of the network architecture.
In more detail, the use cases are classified into two categories, namely backhaul & fronthaul and
access and small cell backhaul. The first category refers to fibre extender, point-to-point and
redundancy applications, whereas the latter is designed to support backup connection for small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), internet of things (IoT) dense environments, data centres,
indoor wireless access, ad hoc networks, and last mile access. Then, it provides the networks architecture
for the TERRANOVA system as well as the network elements that need to be deployed. The use cases are
matched to specific technical scenarios, namely outdoor fixed point-to-point (P2P), outdoor/indoor
individual point-to-multipoint (P2MP), and outdoor/indoor "quasi"-omnidirection, and the
key performance requirements of each scenario are identified. Likewise, we present the breakthrough
novel technology concepts, including the joint design of baseband signal processing for the complete
optical and wireless link, the development of broadband and spectrally efficient RF-frontends
for frequencies >275 GHz, as well as channel modelling, waveforms, antenna array and multiple-access
schemes design, which we are going to use in order to satisfy the presented requirements. Next, an
overview of the required new functionalities in both physical (PHY) layer and medium access control
(MAC) layers in the TERRANOVA system architecture will be given. Finally, the individual enablers
of the TERRANOVA system are combined to develop particular candidate architectures for each of
the three technical scenarios.
