In this paper, the Point Adversarial Self Mining (PASM) approach, a simple yet effective way to progressively
mine knowledge from training samples, is proposed to produce training data for CNNs to improve the
performance and network generality in Facial Expression Recognition (FER) task. In order to achieve
a high prediction accuracy under real-world scenarios, most of the existing works choose to manipulate
the network architectures and design sophisticated loss terms. Although demonstrated to be effective
in real scenarios, those aforementioned methods require extra efforts in network design. Inspired
by random erasing and adversarial erasing, we propose PASM for data augmentation, simulating the
data distribution in the wild. Specifically, given a sample and a pre-trained network, our proposed
approach locates the informative region in the sample generated by point adversarial attack policy.
The informative region is highly structured and sparse. Comparing to the regions produced by random
erasing which selects the region in a purely random way and adversarial erasing which operates by
attention maps, the located informative regions obtained by PASM are more adaptive and better aligned
with the previous findings: not all but only a few facial regions contribute to the accurate prediction.
Then, the located informative regions are masked out from the original samples to generate augmented
images, which would force the network to explore additional information from other less informative
regions. The augmented images are used to finetune the network to enhance its generality. In the
refinement process, we take advantage of knowledge distillation, utilizing the pre-trained network
to provide guidance and retain knowledge from old samples to train a new network with the same structural
configuration.
