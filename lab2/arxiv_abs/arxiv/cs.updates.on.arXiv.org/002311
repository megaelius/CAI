We consider the problem of approximating the output of a parametric electromagnetic field model
in the presence of a large number of uncertain input parameters. Given a sufficiently smooth output
with respect to the input parameters, such problems are often tackled with interpolation-based
approaches, such as the stochastic collocation method on tensor-product or isotropic sparse grids.
Due to the so-called curse of dimensionality, those approaches result in increased or even forbidding
computational costs. In order to reduce the growth in complexity with the number of dimensions,
we employ a dimension-adaptive, hierarchical interpolation scheme, based on nested univariate
interpolation nodes. Clenshaw-Curtis and Leja nodes satisfy the nestedness property and have
been found to provide accurate interpolations when the parameters follow uniform distributions.
The dimension-adaptive algorithm constructs the approximation based on the observation that
not all parameters or interactions among them are equally important regarding their impact on the
model's output. Our goal is to exploit this anisotropy in order to construct accurate polynomial
surrogate models at a reduced computational cost compared to isotropic sparse grids. We apply the
stochastic collocation method to two electromagnetic field models with medium- to high-dimensional
input uncertainty. The performances of isotropic and adaptively constructed, anisotropic sparse
grids based on both Clenshaw-Curtis and Leja interpolation nodes are examined. All considered
approaches are compared with one another regarding the surrogate models' approximation accuracies
using a cross-validation error metric.
