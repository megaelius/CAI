Purpose: The motion of the common carotid artery tissue layers along the vessel axis during the cardiac
cycle, observed in ultrasound imaging, is associated with the presence of established cardiovascular
risk factors. However, the vast majority of the methods are based on the tracking of a single point,
thus failing to capture the overall motion of the entire arterial wall. The aim of this work is to introduce
a motion tracking framework able to simultaneously extract the trajectory of a large collection
of points spanning the entire exploitable width of the image. Method: The longitudinal motion,
which is the main focus of the present work, is determined in two steps. First, a series of independent
block matching operations are carried out for all the tracked points. Then, an original dynamic-programming
approach is exploited to regularize the collection of similarity maps and estimate the globally
optimal motion over the entire vessel wall. Sixty-two atherosclerotic participants at high cardiovascular
risk were involved in this study. Results: A dense displacement field, describing the longitudinal
motion of the carotid far wall over time, was extracted. For each cine-loop, the method was evaluated
against manual reference tracings performed on three local points, with an average absolute error
of 150+/-163 um. A strong correlation was found between motion inhomogeneity and the presence of
coronary artery disease (beta-coefficient=0.586, p=0.003). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time that a method is specifically proposed to assess the dense motion field of the
carotid far wall. This approach has potential to evaluate the (in)homogeneity of the wall dynamics.
The proposed method has promising performances to improve the analysis of arterial longitudinal
motion and the understanding of the underlying patho-physiological parameters.
