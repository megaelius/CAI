In recent years, the buildings where we spend most part of our life are rapidly evolving. They are
becoming fully automated environments where energy consumption, access control, heating and
many other subsystems are all integrated within a single system commonly referred to as smart building
(SB). To support the growing complexity of building operations, building automation systems (BAS)
powering SBs are integrating consumer range Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as IP cameras
alongside with operational technology (OT) controllers and actuators. However, these changes
pose important cybersecurity concerns since the attack surface is larger, attack vectors are increasing
and attacks can potentially harm building occupants. In this paper, we analyze the threat landscape
of BASs by focusing on subsystems which are strongly affected by the advent of IoT devices such as
video surveillance systems and smart lightning. We demonstrate how BAS operation can be disrupted
by simple attacks to widely used network protocols. Furthermore, using both known and 0-day vulnerabilities
reported in the paper and previously disclosed, we present the first (at our knowledge) BAS-specific
malware which is able to persist within the BAS network by leveraging both OT and IoT devices connected
to the BAS. Our research highlights how BAS networks can be considered as critical as industrial
control systems and security concerns in BASs deserve more attention from both industrial and scientific
communities. Even within a simulated environment, our proof-of-concept attacks were carried
out with relative ease and a limited amount of budget and resources. Therefore, we believe that well-funded
attack groups will increasingly shift their focus towards BASs with the potential of impacting
the live of thousands of people.
