Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the $H$-free Edge Editing problem is to find whether there exists
at most $k$ pairs of vertices in $G$ such that changing the adjacency of the pairs in $G$ results in
a graph without any induced copy of $H$. The existence of polynomial kernels for $H$-free Edge Editing
received significant attention in the parameterized complexity literature. Nontrivial polynomial
kernels are known to exist for some graphs $H$ with at most 4 vertices, but starting from 5 vertices,
polynomial kernels are known only if $H$ is either complete or empty. This suggests the conjecture
that there is no other $H$ with at least 5 vertices were $H$-free Edge Editing admits a polynomial
kernel. Towards this goal, we obtain a set $\mathcal{H}$ of nine 5-vertex graphs such that if for
every $H\in\mathcal{H}$, $H$-free Edge Editing is incompressible and the complexity assumption
$NP \not\subseteq coNP/poly$ holds, then $H$-free Edge Editing is incompressible for every graph
$H$ with at least five vertices that is neither complete nor empty. That is, proving incompressibility
for these nine graphs would give a complete classification of the kernelization complexity of $H$-free
Edge Editing for every $H$ with at least 5 vertices. We obtain similar result also for $H$-free Edge
Deletion. Here the picture is more complicated due to the existence of another infinite family of
graphs $H$ where the problem is trivial (graphs with exactly one edge). We obtain a larger set $\mathcal{H}$
of nineteen graphs whose incompressibility would give a complete classification of the kernelization
complexity of $H$-free Edge Deletion for every graph $H$ with at least 5 vertices. Analogous results
follow also for the $H$-free Edge Completion problem by simple complementation.
