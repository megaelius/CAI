The reports of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections brought into the center
of public attention concerns related to the ability of foreign actors to increase social discord
and take advantage of personal user data for political purposes. It has raised questions regarding
the ways and the extent to which data can be used to create psychographical profiles to determine
what kind of advertisement would be most effective to persuade a particular person in a particular
location for some political event. In this work, we study the political ads dataset collected by
ProPublica, an American nonprofit newsroom, using a network of volunteers in the period before
the 2018 US midterm elections. We first describe the main characteristics of the data and explore
the user attributes including age, region, activity, and more, with a series of interactive illustrations.
Furthermore, an important first step towards understating of political manipulation via user
targeting is to identify politically related ads, yet manually checking ads is not feasible due
to the scale of social media advertising. Consequently, we address the challenge of automatically
classifying between political and non-political ads, demonstrating a significant improvement
compared to the current text-based classifier used by ProPublica, and study whether the user targeting
attributes are beneficial for this task. Our evaluation sheds light on questions, such as how user
attributes are being used for political ads targeting and which users are more prone to be targeted
with political ads. Overall, our contribution of data exploration, political ad classification
and initial analysis of the targeting attributes, is designed to support future work with the ProPublica
dataset, and specifically with regard to the understanding of political manipulation via user
targeting.
