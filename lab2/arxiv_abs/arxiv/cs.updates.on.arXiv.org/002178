We propose a generative graph model for electrical infrastructure networks that accounts for heterogeneity
in both node and edge type. To inform the design of this model, we analyze the properties of power grid
graphs derived from the U.S. Eastern Interconnection, Texas Interconnection, and Poland transmission
system power grids. Across these datasets, we find subgraphs induced by nodes of the same voltage
level exhibit shared structural properties atypical to small-world networks, including low local
clustering, large diameter and large average distance. On the other hand, we find subgraphs induced
by transformer edges linking nodes of different voltage types contain a more limited structure,
consisting mainly of small, disjoint star graphs. The goal of our proposed model is to match both
these inter and intra-network properties by proceeding in two phases: we first generate subgraphs
for each voltage level and then generate transformer edges that connect these subgraphs. The first
phase of the model adapts the Chung-Lu random graph model, taking desired vertex degrees and desired
diameter as inputs, while the second phase of the model is based on a simpler random star graph generation
process. We test the performance of our model by comparing its output across many runs to the aforementioned
real data. In nearly all categories tested, we find our model is more accurate in reproducing the
unusual mixture of properties apparent in the data than the Chung-Lu model. We also include graph
visualization comparisons, as well as a brief analysis of edge-deletion resiliency. Ultimately,
our model may be used to generate synthetic graph data, test hypotheses and algorithms at different
scales, and serve as a baseline model on top of which further electrical network properties, device
models, and interdependencies to other networks, may be appended.
