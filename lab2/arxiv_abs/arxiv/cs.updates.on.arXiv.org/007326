Advertising is a primary means for revenue generation for millions of websites and smartphone apps
(publishers). Naturally, a fraction of publishers abuse the ad-network to systematically defraud
advertisers of their money. Defenses have matured to overcome some forms of click fraud but are inadequate
against the threat of organic click fraud attacks. Malware detection systems including honeypots
fail to stop click fraud apps; ad-network filters are better but measurement studies have reported
that a third of the clicks supplied by ad-networks are fake; collaborations between ad-networks
and app stores that bad-lists malicious apps works better still, but fails to prevent criminals
from writing fraudulent apps which they monetise until they get banned and start over again. This
work develops novel inference techniques that can isolate click fraud attacks using their fundamental
properties. In the {\em mimicry defence}, we leverage the observation that organic click fraud
involves the re-use of legitimate clicks. Thus we can isolate fake-clicks by detecting patterns
of click-reuse within ad-network clickstreams with historical behaviour serving as a baseline.
Second, in {\em bait-click defence}. we leverage the vantage point of an ad-network to inject a pattern
of bait clicks into the user's device, to trigger click fraud-apps that are gated on user-behaviour.
Our experiments show that the mimicry defence detects around 81\% of fake-clicks in stealthy (low
rate) attacks with a false-positive rate of 110110 per hundred thousand clicks. Bait-click defence
enables further improvements in detection rates of 95\% and reduction in false-positive rates
of between 0 and 30 clicks per million, a substantial improvement over current approaches.
