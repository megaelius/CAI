Ecologists have long suspected that species are more likely to interact if their traits match in
a particular way. For example, a pollination interaction may be more likely if the proportions of
a bee's tongue fit a plant's flower shape. Empirical estimates of the importance of trait-matching
for determining species interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of ecological
networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical trait-matching studies may have arisen
at least in parts from using overly simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we
contrast conventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine Learning (ML)
models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural
Networks, Support Vector Machines, naive Bayes, and k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability
to predict species interactions based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible
for species interactions. We find that the best ML models can successfully predict species interactions
in plant-pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial margin. Our results also demonstrate
that ML models can better identify the causally responsible trait-matching combinations than
GLMs. In two case studies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a global
plant-pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible trait-matching rules for a plant-hummingbird
network, without any prior assumptions. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages
over traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We anticipate that
these results extrapolate to other ecological network types. More generally, our results highlight
the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond
standard tasks such as image or pattern recognition.
