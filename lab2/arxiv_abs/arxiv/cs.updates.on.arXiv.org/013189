In many professional fields, such as medicine, remote sensing and sciences, users often demand
image compression methods to be mathematically lossless. But lossless image coding has a rather
low compression ratio (around 2:1 for natural images). The only known technique to achieve significant
compression while meeting the stringent fidelity requirements is the methodology of $\ell_\infty$-constrained
coding that was developed and standardized in nineties. We make a major progress in $\ell_\infty$-constrained
image coding after two decades, by developing a novel CNN-based soft $\ell_\infty$-constrained
decoding method. The new method repairs compression defects by using a restoration CNN called the
$\ell_\infty\mbox{-SDNet}$ to map a conventionally decoded image to the latent image. A unique
strength of the $\ell_\infty\mbox{-SDNet}$ is its ability to enforce a tight error bound on a per
pixel basis. As such, no small distinctive structures of the original image can be dropped or distorted,
even if they are statistical outliers that are otherwise sacrificed by mainstream CNN restoration
methods. More importantly, this research ushers in a new image compression system of $\ell_\infty$-constrained
encoding and deep soft decoding ($\ell_\infty\mbox{-ED}^2$). The $\ell_\infty \mbox{-ED}^2$
approach beats the best of existing lossy image compression methods (e.g., BPG, WebP, etc.) not
only in $\ell_\infty$ but also in $\ell_2$ error metric and perceptual quality, for bit rates near
the threshold of perceptually transparent reconstruction. Operationally, the new compression
system is practical, with a low-complexity real-time encoder and a cascade decoder consisting
of a fast initial decoder and an optional CNN soft decoder.
