The cumulative distribution network (CDN) is a recently developed class of probabilistic graphical
models (PGMs) permitting a copula factorization, in which the CDF, rather than the density, is factored.
Despite there being much recent interest within the machine learning community about copula representations,
there has been scarce research into the CDN, its amalgamation with copula theory, and no evaluation
of its performance. Algorithms for inference, sampling, and learning in these models are underdeveloped
compared those of other PGMs, hindering widerspread use. One advantage of the CDN is that it allows
the factors to be parameterized as copulae, combining the benefits of graphical models with those
of copula theory. In brief, the use of a copula parameterization enables greater modelling flexibility
by separating representation of the marginals from the dependence structure, permitting more
efficient and robust learning. Another advantage is that the CDN permits the representation of
implicit latent variables, whose parameterization and connectivity are not required to be specified.
Unfortunately, that the model can encode only latent relationships between variables severely
limits its utility. In this thesis, we present inference, learning, and sampling for CDNs, and further
the state-of-the-art. First, we explain the basics of copula theory and the representation of copula
CDNs. Then, we discuss inference in the models, and develop the first sampling algorithm. We explain
standard learning methods, propose an algorithm for learning from data missing completely at random
(MCAR), and develop a novel algorithm for learning models of arbitrary treewidth and size. Properties
of the models and algorithms are investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. We conclude with
further discussion of the advantages and limitations of CDNs, and suggest future work.
