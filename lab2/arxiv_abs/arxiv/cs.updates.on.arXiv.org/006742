Interferometric inversion involves recovery of a signal from cross-correlations of its linear
transformations. A close relative of interferometric inversion is the generalized phase retrieval
problem. Recently, significant advancements have been made in phase retrieval methods despite
the ill-posed, and non-convex nature of the problem. One such method is Wirtinger Flow (WF), a non-convex
optimization framework that provides high probability guarantees of exact recovery under certain
measurement models, such as coded diffraction patterns, and Gaussian sampling vectors. In this
paper, we develop a generalization of WF for interferometric inversion, which we refer to as Generalized
Wirtinger Flow (GWF) and extend the probabilistic exact recovery results of WF to arbitrary measurement
models characterized in the equivalent lifted problem. GWF framework unifies the theory of low
rank matrix recovery (LRMR) and the non-convex optimization approach of WF, thereby establishes
theoretical advantages of the non-convex approach over LRMR. We show that the conditions for exact
recovery via WF can be derived through a low rank matrix recovery formulation. We identify a new sufficient
condition on the lifted forward model that directly implies exact recovery conditions of standard
WF. This condition is less stringent than those of LRMR, which is the state of the art approach for
exact interferometric inversion. We next establish our sufficient condition for the cross-correlations
of linear measurements collected by complex Gaussian sampling vectors. In the particular case
of the Gaussian model, we show that the exact recovery conditions of standard WF imply our sufficient
condition, and that the regularity condition of WF is redundant for the interferometric inversion
problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GWF numerically in a deterministic multi-static
radar imaging scenario.
