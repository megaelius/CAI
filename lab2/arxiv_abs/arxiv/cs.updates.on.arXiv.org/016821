The Internet of Drones (IoD) recently gained momentum due to its high adaptability to a wide variety
of complex scenarios. Indeed, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can successfully be employed in
different application scenarios, like agriculture, search and rescue missions, surveillance
systems, mission-critical services, etc., thanks to some technological and practical advantages:
high mobility, capability to extend wireless coverage areas, or ability to reach places inaccessible
to humans. Moreover, the employment of drones promisingly improves different network architectures
performance indexes, i.e., reliability, connectivity, throughput, delay. Nevertheless, the
adoption of networks of drones gives rise to several issues related to the unreliability of the wireless
medium, batteries lifetime, high mobility degree and frequent topology changes. Moreover, security
and privacy issues need to be properly investigated. This explains the very large number of works
produced in the recent literature on IoD-related topics. With respect to other surveys on IoD-related
topics, this work categorizes the multifaceted aspects of IoD, proposing a classification of the
IoD environment. The proposed classification approach develops along two main directions. At
a macroscopic level, it follows the structure of the Internet protocol stack, starting from the
physical layer and extending to the upper layers, without neglecting crosslayer and optimization
approaches. At a finer level, all the most relevant works belonging to each layer of the stack are
further classified, according to the different issues peculiar of the layer, and highlighting
the most relevant differences with the other surveys present in literature. Finally, a discussion
on the main research challenges and possible future directions is carried out, focusing on the open
issues and the most promising technologies in the IoD field.
