Most existing caching solutions for wireless networks rest on an unrealistic assumption that the
file popularity distribution is perfectly known. In this paper, we consider optimal caching designs
for perfect, imperfect and unknown file popularity distributions in large-scale multi-tier wireless
networks. First, in the case of perfect file popularity distribution, we formulate the optimization
problem to maximize the successful transmission probability (STP), which is a nonconvex problem.
We develop an efficient parallel iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point using parallel
successive convex approximation (SCA). Then, in the case of imperfect file popularity distribution,
we formulate the robust optimization problem to maximize the worst-case STP. To solve this challenging
maximin problem, we transform it to an equivalent complementary geometric programming (CGP),
and develop an efficient iterative algorithm which is shown to converge to a stationary point using
SCA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly considering the estimation error
of file popularity distribution in the optimization of caching design. Next, in the case of unknown
file popularity distribution, we formulate the stochastic optimization problem to maximize the
stochastic STP (i.e., the STP in the stochastic form), which is a challenging nonconvex stochastic
optimization problem. Based on stochastic parallel SCA, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm
to obtain a stationary point, by exploiting structural properties of the stochastic STP and making
full use of instantaneous file requests. As far as we know, this is the first work considering stochastic
optimization in a large-scale multi-tier wireless network. Finally, by numerical results, we
show that the proposed solutions achieve significant gains over existing schemes in all three cases.
