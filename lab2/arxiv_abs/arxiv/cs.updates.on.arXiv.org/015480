In this study we investigated the repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features extracted
from MRI images and provide a workflow to identify robust features. 2D and 3D T$_2$-weighted images
of a pelvic phantom were acquired on three scanners of two manufacturers and two magnetic field strengths.
The repeatability and reproducibility of the radiomic features were assessed respectively by
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), considering
repeated acquisitions with or without phantom repositioning, and with different scanner/acquisition
type, and acquisition parameters. The features showing ICC/CCC > 0.9 were selected, and their dependence
on shape information (Spearman's $\rho$> 0.8) was analyzed. They were classified for their ability
to distinguish textures, after shuffling voxel intensities. From 944 2D features, 79.9% to 96.4%
showed excellent repeatability in fixed position across all scanners. Much lower range (11.2%
to 85.4%) was obtained after phantom repositioning. 3D extraction did not improve repeatability
performance. Excellent reproducibility between scanners was observed in 4.6% to 15.6% of the features,
at fixed imaging parameters. 82.4% to 94.9% of features showed excellent agreement when extracted
from images acquired with TEs 5 ms apart (values decreased when increasing TE intervals) and 90.7%
of the features exhibited excellent reproducibility for changes in TR. 2.0% of non-shape features
were identified as providing only shape information. This study demonstrates that radiomic features
are affected by specific MRI protocols. The use of our radiomic pelvic phantom allowed to identify
unreliable features for radiomic analysis on T$_2$-weighted images. This paper proposes a general
workflow to identify repeatable, reproducible, and informative radiomic features, fundamental
to ensure robustness of clinical studies.
