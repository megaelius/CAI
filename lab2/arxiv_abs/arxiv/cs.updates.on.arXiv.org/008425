Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) estimates the underlying tissue magnetic susceptibility
from MRI gradient-echo phase signal and typically requires several processing steps. These steps
involve phase unwrapping, brain volume extraction, background phase removal and solving an ill-posed
inverse problem. The resulting susceptibility map is known to suffer from inaccuracy near the edges
of the brain tissues, in part due to imperfect brain extraction, edge erosion of the brain tissue
and the lack of phase measurement outside the brain. This inaccuracy has thus hindered the application
of QSM for measuring the susceptibility of tissues near the brain edges, e.g., quantifying cortical
layers and generating superficial venography. To address these challenges, we propose a learning-based
QSM reconstruction method that directly estimates the magnetic susceptibility from total phase
images without the need for brain extraction and background phase removal, referred to as autoQSM.
The neural network has a modified U-net structure and is trained using QSM maps computed by a two-step
QSM method. 209 healthy subjects with ages ranging from 11 to 82 years were employed for patch-wise
network training. The network was validated on data dissimilar to the training data, e.g. in vivo
mouse brain data and brains with lesions, which suggests that the network has generalized and learned
the underlying mathematical relationship between magnetic field perturbation and magnetic susceptibility.
AutoQSM was able to recover magnetic susceptibility of anatomical structures near the edges of
the brain including the veins covering the cortical surface, spinal cord and nerve tracts near the
mouse brain boundaries. The advantages of high-quality maps, no need for brain volume extraction
and high reconstruction speed demonstrate its potential for future applications.
