Age-of-information (AoI) is a newly proposed time-critical networking performance metric. In
this paper, we consider multi-path network communication problems for fulfilling a single-unicast
periodic transmission task. The task generates certain amount of data at a sender periodically,
and streams them to a receiver using multiple paths over a multi-hop network. Our objective is to
minimize either the peak AoI or the average AoI, by jointly optimizing the multi-path routing strategy
and the task activation length. To our best knowledge, (i) as compared to existing AoI studies, we
are the first to minimize the task-level AoI with the multi-path routing optimization involved,
and (ii) as compared to existing time-critical multi-path communication studies, we minimize
the AoI with the task activation length to be a variable, while they minimize the maximum delay given
a fixed task activation length. In this paper, first, comparing the newly proposed AoI with the common-studied
maximum delay, we show that the maximum-delay-optimal solution can achieve suboptimal AoI, and
we characterize near-tight optimality gaps of this suboptimal AoI. Second, we give fundamental
structures of our problems, by proving that the peak-AoI minimization can differ from the average-AoI
minimization, but both of them are weakly NP-hard, with a pseudo-polynomial time exact algorithm
designed. Third, we develop an approximation framework, which can leverage an arbitrary approximation
algorithm of the maximum-delay-minimization problem to solve our AoI-minimization problems
approximately. Our framework has a constant approximation ratio, and a time complexity that is
the same as that of the used approximation algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive random simulations
to empirically verify our proposed results and evaluate our designed algorithms.
