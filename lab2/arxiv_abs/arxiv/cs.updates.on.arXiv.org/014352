Many measurements in computer vision and machine learning manifest as non-Euclidean data samples.
Several researchers recently extended a number of deep neural network architectures for manifold
valued data samples. Researchers have proposed models for manifold valued spatial data which are
common in medical image processing including processing of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) where
images are fields of $3\times 3$ symmetric positive definite matrices or representation in terms
of orientation distribution field (ODF) where the identification is in terms of field on hypersphere.
There are other sequential models for manifold valued data that recently researchers have shown
to be effective for group difference analysis in study for neuro-degenerative diseases. Although,
several of these methods are effective to deal with manifold valued data, the bottleneck includes
the instability in optimization for deeper networks. In order to deal with these instabilities,
researchers have proposed residual connections for manifold valued data. One of the other remedies
to deal with the instabilities including gradient explosion is to use normalization techniques
including {\it batch norm} and {\it group norm} etc.. But, so far there is no normalization techniques
applicable for manifold valued data. In this work, we propose a general normalization techniques
for manifold valued data. We show that our proposed manifold normalization technique have special
cases including popular batch norm and group norm techniques. On the experimental side, we focus
on two types of manifold valued data including manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices
and hypersphere. We show the performance gain in one synthetic experiment for moving MNIST dataset
and one real brain image dataset where the representation is in terms of orientation distribution
field (ODF).
