Most of the physical processes arising in nature are modeled by either ordinary or partial differential
equations. From the point of view of analog computability, the existence of an effective way to obtain
solutions of these systems is essential. A pioneering model of analog computation is the General
Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC), introduced by Shannon as a model of the Differential Analyzer and
improved by Pour-El, Lipshitz and Rubel, Costa and Gra\c{c}a and others. Its power is known to be
characterized by the class of differentially algebraic functions, which includes the solutions
of initial value problems for ordinary differential equations. We address one of the limitations
of this model, concerning the notion of approximability, a desirable property in computation over
continuous spaces that is however absent in the GPAC. In particular, the Shannon GPAC cannot be used
to generate non-differentially algebraic functions which can be approximately computed in other
models of computation. We extend the class of data types using networks with channels which carry
information on a general complete metric space $\xcal$; for example $\xcal=C(\rbb,\rbb)$, the
class of continuous functions of one real (spatial) variable. We consider the original modules
in Shannon's construction (constants, adders, multipliers, integrators) and we add \emph{(continuous
or discrete) limit} modules which have one input and one output. We then define an L-GPAC to be a network
built with $\xcal$-stream channels and the above-mentioned modules. This leads us to a framework
in which the specifications of such analog systems are given by fixed points of certain operators
on continuous data streams. We study these analog systems and their associated operators, and show
how some classically non-generable functions, such as the gamma function and the Riemann zeta function,
can be captured with the L-GPAC.
