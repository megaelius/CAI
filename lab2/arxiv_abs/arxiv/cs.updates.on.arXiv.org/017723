Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that learns a shared model
across decentralized clients. It can alleviate privacy concerns of personal re-identification,
an important computer vision task. In this work, we implement federated learning to person re-identification
(FedReID) and optimize its performance affected by statistical heterogeneity in the real-world
scenario. We first construct a new benchmark to investigate the performance of FedReID. This benchmark
consists of (1) nine datasets with different volumes sourced from different domains to simulate
the heterogeneous situation in reality, (2) two federated scenarios, and (3) an enhanced federated
algorithm for FedReID. The benchmark analysis shows that the client-edge-cloud architecture,
represented by the federated-by-dataset scenario, has better performance than client-server
architecture in FedReID. It also reveals the bottlenecks of FedReID under the real-world scenario,
including poor performance of large datasets caused by unbalanced weights in model aggregation
and challenges in convergence. Then we propose two optimization methods: (1) To address the unbalanced
weight problem, we propose a new method to dynamically change the weights according to the scale
of model changes in clients in each training round; (2) To facilitate convergence, we adopt knowledge
distillation to refine the server model with knowledge generated from client models on a public
dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that our strategies can achieve much better convergence
with superior performance on all datasets. We believe that our work will inspire the community to
further explore the implementation of federated learning on more computer vision tasks in real-world
scenarios.
