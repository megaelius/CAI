A set of mobile robots (represented as points) is distributed in the Cartesian plane. The collection
contains an unknown subset of byzantine robots which are indistinguishable from the reliable ones.
The reliable robots need to gather, i.e., arrive to a configuration in which at the same time, all
of them occupy the same point on the plane. The robots are equipped with GPS devices and at the beginning
of the gathering process they communicate the Cartesian coordinates of their respective positions
to the central authority. On the basis of this information, without the knowledge of which robots
are faulty, the central authority designs a trajectory for every robot. The central authority aims
to provide the trajectories which result in the shortest possible gathering time of the healthy
robots. The efficiency of a gathering strategy is measured by its competitive ratio, i.e., the maximal
ratio between the time required for gathering achieved by the given trajectories and the optimal
time required for gathering in the offline case, i.e., when the faulty robots are known to the central
authority in advance. The role of the byzantine robots, controlled by the adversary, is to act so
that the gathering is delayed and the resulting competitive ratio is maximized. The objective of
our paper is to propose efficient algorithms when the central authority is aware of an upper bound
on the number of byzantine robots. We give optimal algorithms for collections of robots known to
contain at most one faulty robot. When the proportion of byzantine robots is known to be less than
one half or one third, we provide algorithms with small constant competitive ratios. We also propose
algorithms with bounded competitive ratio in the case where the proportion of faulty robots is arbitrary.
