Goal: This paper presents an algorithm for accurately estimating pelvis, thigh, and shank kinematics
during walking using only three wearable inertial sensors. Methods: The algorithm makes novel
use of a constrained Kalman filter (CKF). The algorithm iterates through the prediction (kinematic
equation), measurement (pelvis position pseudo-measurements, zero velocity update, flat-floor
assumption, and covariance limiter), and constraint update (formulation of hinged knee joints
and ball-and-socket hip joints). Results: Evaluation of the algorithm using an optical motion
capture-based sensor-to-segment calibration on nine participants ($7$ men and $2$ women, weight
$63.0 \pm 6.8$ kg, height $1.70 \pm 0.06$ m, age $24.6 \pm 3.9$ years old), with no known gait or lower
body biomechanical abnormalities, who walked within a $4 \times 4$ m$^2$ capture area shows that
it can track motion relative to the mid-pelvis origin with mean position and orientation (no bias)
root-mean-square error (RMSE) of $5.21 \pm 1.3$ cm and $16.1 \pm 3.2^\circ$, respectively. The
sagittal knee and hip joint angle RMSEs (no bias) were $10.0 \pm 2.9^\circ$ and $9.9 \pm 3.2^\circ$,
respectively, while the corresponding correlation coefficient (CC) values were $0.87 \pm 0.08$
and $0.74 \pm 0.12$. Conclusion: The CKF-based algorithm was able to track the 3D pose of the pelvis,
thigh, and shanks using only three inertial sensors worn on the pelvis and shanks. Significance:
Due to the Kalman-filter-based algorithm's low computation cost and the relative convenience
of using only three wearable sensors, gait parameters can be computed in real-time and remotely
for long-term gait monitoring. Furthermore, the system can be used to inform real-time gait assistive
devices.
