Very-high-resolution (VHR) images can provide abundant ground details and spatial geometric
information. Change detection in multi-temporal VHR images plays a significant role in urban expansion
and area internal change analysis. Nevertheless, traditional change detection methods can neither
take full advantage of spatial context information nor cope with the complex internal heterogeneity
of VHR images. In this paper, a powerful feature extraction model entitled multi-scale feature
convolution unit (MFCU) is adopted for change detection in multi-temporal VHR images. MFCU can
extract multi-scale spatial-spectral features in the same layer. Based on the unit two novel deep
siamese convolutional neural networks, called as deep siamese multi-scale convolutional network
(DSMS-CN) and deep siamese multi-scale fully convolutional network (DSMS-FCN), are designed
for unsupervised and supervised change detection, respectively. For unsupervised change detection,
an automatic pre-classification is implemented to obtain reliable training samples, then DSMS-CN
fits the statistical distribution of changed and unchanged areas from selected training samples
through MFCU modules and deep siamese architecture. For supervised change detection, the end-to-end
deep fully convolutional network DSMS-FCN is trained in any size of multi-temporal VHR images,
and directly outputs the binary change map. In addition, for the purpose of solving the inaccurate
localization problem, the fully connected conditional random field (FC-CRF) is combined with
DSMS-FCN to refine the results. The experimental results with challenging data sets confirm that
the two proposed architectures perform better than the state-of-the-art methods.
