Community detection is one of the most important and interesting issues in social network analysis.
In recent years, simultaneous considering of nodes' attributes and topological structures of
social networks in the process of community detection has attracted the attentions of many scholars,
and this consideration has been recently used in some community detection methods to increase their
efficiencies and to enhance their performances in finding meaningful and relevant communities.
But the problem is that most of these methods tend to find non-overlapping communities, while many
real-world networks include communities that often overlap to some extent. In order to solve this
problem, an evolutionary algorithm called MOBBO-OCD, which is based on multi-objective biogeography-based
optimization (BBO), is proposed in this paper to automatically find overlapping communities in
a social network with node attributes with synchronously considering the density of connections
and the similarity of nodes' attributes in the network. In MOBBO-OCD, an extended locus-based adjacency
representation called OLAR is introduced to encode and decode overlapping communities. Based
on OLAR, a rank-based migration operator along with a novel two-phase mutation strategy and a new
double-point crossover are used in the evolution process of MOBBO-OCD to effectively lead the population
into the evolution path. In order to assess the performance of MOBBO-OCD, a new metric called alpha_SAEM
is proposed in this paper, which is able to evaluate the goodness of both overlapping and non-overlapping
partitions with considering the two aspects of node attributes and linkage structure. Quantitative
evaluations reveal that MOBBO-OCD achieves favorable results which are quite superior to the results
of 15 relevant community detection algorithms in the literature.
