Robust and lane-level positioning is essential for autonomous vehicles. As an irreplaceable sensor,
LiDAR can provide continuous and high frequency 6-dimensions (6D) positioning by means of mapping,
in condition that enough environment features are available. In diverse urban scenarios, the environment
feature availability relies heavily on the traffic (moving and static objects) and the degree of
urbanization. However, the LiDAR-based positioning can be severely challenged in deep urbanized
cities, such as Hong Kong, Tokyo and New York with dense traffic and tall buildings. This paper proposes
to analyze the performance of LiDAR-based positioning and its reliability estimation in diverse
urban scenarios to further evaluate the relationship between the performance of LiDAR-based positioning
and scenarios conditions. The normal distribution transform (NDT) is employed to calculate the
transformation between frames of point clouds. Then, the LiDAR odometry is performed based on the
calculated continuous transformation. The state-of-art graph-based optimization is used to
integrate the LiDAR odometry measurements to implement the global optimization. Experiments
are implemented in different scenarios with different degrees of urbanization and traffic conditions.
The results show that the performance if the LiDAR-based positioning is strongly related to the
traffic condition and degree of urbanization. The LiDAR-positioning obtains best performance
in sparse area with normal traffic and the worse performance in edge-urban area with 3D positioning
error gradient of 0.024 m/s and 0.189 m/s respectively. The analyzed results can be a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance of LiDAR-based SLAM in diverse scenarios which is significant
for multi-sensor fusion of autonomous driving.
