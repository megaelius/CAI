Electronic (E) learning management system is not a novel idea in the educational domain. Learning
management systems are used to deal with academic activities such as course syllabi, time table
scheduling, assessments and project discussion forums. Almost, all the top universities of world
are using general purpose/customized solutions to manage learning management systems like SAP,
Oracle, Moodle and Blackboard. The aim of this paper i.e., Mobile (M) Learning System (MLS) is not
to substitute the traditional web based E learning applications but to enhance it by amalgamating
both web and mobile technologies. This idea justifies the proposal of M learning system to use some
of the services of E learning system from mobiles. MLS will use state-of-the-art IP Multimedia Sub
System technology. The emphasis in this research will be on the technical implementation of the
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) using IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) to develop an MLS not only
for the students of the King Abdulaziz University but it will be beneficial for the students of other
universities at Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A customized CBD is proposed as per the nature of MLS project.
MLS case study is used as a research design to validate the customized CBD model. Multi-tier applications
architecture (client, web, and business) will be adopted during the development of MLS case study.
An MLS will be developed and tested using IMS platform to check its practicality for the students
of King Abdulaziz University. It is anticipated that the proposed system will significantly facilitate
to both the students and teachers of KAU during their off campus activities.
