Adding attributes for nodes to network embedding helps to improve the ability of the learned joint
representation to depict features from topology and attributes simultaneously. Recent research
on the joint embedding has exhibited a promising performance on a variety of tasks by jointly embedding
the two spaces. However, due to the indispensable requirement of globality based information,
present approaches contain a flaw of in-scalability. Here we propose \emph{SANE}, a scalable attribute-aware
network embedding algorithm with locality, to learn the joint representation from topology and
attributes. By enforcing the alignment of a local linear relationship between each node and its
K-nearest neighbors in topology and attribute space, the joint embedding representations are
more informative comparing with a single representation from topology or attributes alone. And
we argue that the locality in \emph{SANE} is the key to learning the joint representation at scale.
By using several real-world networks from diverse domains, We demonstrate the efficacy of \emph{SANE}
in performance and scalability aspect. Overall, for performance on label classification, SANE
successfully reaches up to the highest F1-score on most datasets, and even closer to the baseline
method that needs label information as extra inputs, compared with other state-of-the-art joint
representation algorithms. What's more, \emph{SANE} has an up to 71.4\% performance gain compared
with the single topology-based algorithm. For scalability, we have demonstrated the linearly
time complexity of \emph{SANE}. In addition, we intuitively observe that when the network size
scales to 100,000 nodes, the "learning joint embedding" step of \emph{SANE} only takes $\approx10$
seconds.
