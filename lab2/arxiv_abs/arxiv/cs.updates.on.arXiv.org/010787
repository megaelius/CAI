The problem of deciding the validity (QSAT) of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) is a vivid research
area in both theory and practice. In the field of parameterized algorithmics, the well-studied
graph measure treewidth turned out to be a successful parameter. A well-known result by Chen in parameterized
complexity is that QSAT when parameterized by the treewidth of the primal graph of the input formula
together with the quantifier depth of the formula is fixed-parameter tractable. More precisely,
the runtime of such an algorithm is polynomial in the formula size and exponential in the treewidth,
where the exponential function in the treewidth is a tower, whose height is the quantifier depth.
A natural question is whether one can significantly improve these results and decrease the tower
while assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). In the last years, there has been a growing
interest in the quest of establishing lower bounds under ETH, showing mostly problem-specific
lower bounds up to the third level of the polynomial hierarchy. Still, an important question is to
settle this as general as possible and to cover the whole polynomial hierarchy. In this work, we show
lower bounds based on the ETH for arbitrary QBFs parameterized by treewidth (and quantifier depth).
More formally, we establish lower bounds for QSAT and treewidth, namely, that under ETH there cannot
be an algorithm that solves QSAT of quantifier depth i in runtime significantly better than i-fold
exponential in the treewidth and polynomial in the input size. In doing so, we provide a versatile
reduction technique to compress treewidth that encodes the essence of dynamic programming on arbitrary
tree decompositions. Further, we describe a general methodology for a more fine-grained analysis
of problems parameterized by treewidth that are at higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.
