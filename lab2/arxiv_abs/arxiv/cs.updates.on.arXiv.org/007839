Our understanding and ability to effectively monitor and manage coastal ecosystems are severely
limited by observation methods. Automatic recognition of species in natural environment is a promising
tool which would revolutionize video and image analysis for a wide range of applications in marine
ecology. However, classifying fish from images captured by underwater cameras is in general very
challenging due to noise and illumination variations in water. Previous classification methods
in the literature relies on filtering the images to separate the fish from the background or sharpening
the images by removing background noise. This pre-filtering process may negatively impact the
classification accuracy. In this work, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the
Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) architecture for classifying images of fish without pre-filtering.
Different from conventional schemes, this scheme is divided into two steps. The first step is to
train the fish classifier via a public data set, i.e., Fish4Knowledge, without using image augmentation,
named as pre-training. The second step is to train the classifier based on a new data set consisting
of species that we are interested in for classification, named as post-training. The weights obtained
from pre-training are applied to post-training as a priori. This is also known as transfer learning.
Our solution achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.27% accuracy on the pre-training. The
accuracy on the post-training is 83.68%. Experiments on the post-training with image augmentation
yields an accuracy of 87.74%, indicating that the solution is viable with a larger data set.
