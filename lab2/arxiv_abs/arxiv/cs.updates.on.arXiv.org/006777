A novel geomechanics concept is presented for studying the behavior of geomaterials and structures
by capturing the underlying dynamics as realistically as possible for earthquake excitation applied
in time domain. Enormous amount of damages caused to infrastructures during recent earthquakes
in all over the world indicate that there is a considerable room for improvement. Causes for extensive
damages are generally attributed to poor soil conditions at the region. It is interesting to note
that all structures in a region with poor soil condition do not suffer similar damages; in fact, some
of them remain damage-free. There are many reasons for this including inability to model the soil-structural
systems properly, predict the future design earthquake time history at the site, model the dynamic
amplification of responses caused by the excitation, incorporate major sources of nonlinearity
and energy dissipation, and most importantly consider the presence of a considerable amount of
uncertainty at every phase of the evaluation process. The most recent research trend is to capture
complicated behavior by conducting multiple deterministic analyses by taking advantage of current
significantly improved computational capability. By conducting few dozens of deterministic
analyses at very intelligently selected points, structures can be designed more seismic load-tolerant.
The performance based seismic design concept recently introduced in the U.S. is showcased in this
paper. The requirements in the guidelines appear to be reasonable. The concept is expected to change
the current engineering design paradigm. The authors believe that the proposed alternatives to
the simulation and the basic random vibration concept.
