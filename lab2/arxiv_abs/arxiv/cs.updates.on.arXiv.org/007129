Conjunctive queries select and are expected to return certain tuples from a relational database.
We study the potentially easier problem of counting all selected tuples, rather than enumerating
them. In particular, we are interested in the problem's parameterized and data complexity, where
the query is considered to be small or fixed, and the database is considered to be large. We identify
two structural parameters for conjunctive queries that capture their inherent complexity: The
dominating star size and the linked matching number. If the dominating star size of a conjunctive
query is large, then we show that counting solution tuples to the query is at least as hard as counting
dominating sets, which yields a fine-grained complexity lower bound under the Strong Exponential
Time Hypothesis as well as a #W[2]-hardness result. Moreover, if the linked matching number of a
conjunctive query is large, then we show that the structure of the query is so rich that arbitrary
queries up to a certain size can be encoded into it; this essentially establishes #A[2]-completeness.
Using ideas stemming from Lov\'asz, we lift complexity results from the class of conjunctive queries
to arbitrary existential or universal formulas that might contain inequalities and negations
on constraints over the free variables. As a consequence, we obtain a complexity classification
that generalizes previous results of Chen, Durand, and Mengel (ToCS 2015; ICDT 2015; PODS 2016)
for conjunctive queries and of Curticapean and Marx (FOCS 2014) for the subgraph counting problem.
Our proof also relies on graph minors, and we show a strengthening of the Excluded-Grid-Theorem
which might be of independent interest: If the linked matching number is large, then not only can
we find a large grid somewhere in the graph, but we can find a large grid whose diagonal has disjoint
paths leading into an assumed node-well-linked set.
