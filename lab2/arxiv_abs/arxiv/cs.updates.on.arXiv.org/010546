Seismic events, among many other natural hazards, reduce due functionality and exacerbate vulnerability
of in-service buildings. Accurate modeling and prediction of building's response subjected to
earthquakes makes possible to evaluate building performance. To this end, we leverage the recent
advances in deep learning and develop a physics-guided convolutional neural network (PhyCNN)
framework for data-driven seismic response modeling and serviceability assessment of buildings.
The proposed PhyCNN approach is capable of accurately predicting building's seismic response
in a data-driven fashion without the need of a physics-based analytical/numerical model. The basic
concept is to train a deep PhyCNN model based on available seismic input-output datasets (e.g.,
from simulation or sensing) and physics constraints. The trained PhyCNN can then used as a surrogate
model for structural seismic response prediction. Available physics (e.g., the law of dynamics)
can provide constraints to the network outputs, alleviate overfitting issues, reduce the need
of big training datasets, and thus improve the robustness of the trained model for more reliable
prediction. The trained surrogate model is then utilized for fragility analysis given certain
limit state criteria (e.g., the serviceability state). In addition, an unsupervised learning
algorithm based on K-means clustering is also proposed to partition the limited number of datasets
to training, validation and prediction categories, so as to maximize the use of limited datasets.
The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies including
both numerical and experimental examples. Convincing results illustrate that the proposed PhyCNN
paradigm outperforms conventional pure data-based neural networks.
