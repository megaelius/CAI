Federated recommender systems have distinct advantages in terms of privacy protection over traditional
recommender systems that are centralized at a data center. However, previous work on federated
recommender systems does not fully consider the limitations of storage, RAM, energy and communication
bandwidth in a mobile environment. The scales of the models proposed are too large to be easily run
on mobile devices. And existing federated recommender systems need to fine-tune recommendation
models on each device, making it hard to effectively exploit collaborative filtering information
among users/devices. Our goal in this paper is to design a novel federated learning framework for
rating prediction (RP) for mobile environments. We introduce a federated matrix factorization
(MF) framework, named meta matrix factorization (MetaMF). Given a user, we first obtain a collaborative
vector by collecting useful information with a collaborative memory module. Then, we employ a meta
recommender module to generate private item embeddings and a RP model based on the collaborative
vector in the server. To address the challenge of generating a large number of high-dimensional
item embeddings, we devise a rise-dimensional generation strategy that first generates a low-dimensional
item embedding matrix and a rise-dimensional matrix, and then multiply them to obtain high-dimensional
embeddings. We use the generated model to produce private RPs for the given user on her device. MetaMF
shows a high capacity even with a small RP model, which can adapt to the limitations of a mobile environment.
We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to compare MetaMF with existing MF
methods and find that MetaMF can achieve competitive performance. Moreover, we find MetaMF achieves
higher RP performance over existing federated methods by better exploiting collaborative filtering
among users/devices.
