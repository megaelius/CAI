We present a new method for automatically generating the implementation of state-estimation algorithms
from a machine-readable specification of the physics of a sensing system and physics of its signals
and signal constraints. We implement the new state-estimator code generation method as a backend
for a physics specification language and we apply the backend to generate complete C code implementations
of state estimators for both linear systems (Kalman filters) and non-linear systems (extended
Kalman filters). The state estimator code generation from physics specification is completely
automated and requires no manual intervention. The generated filters can incorporate an Automatic
Differentiation technique which combines function evaluation and differentiation in a single
process. Using the description of physical system of a range of complexities, we generate extended
Kalman filters, which we evaluate in terms of prediction accuracy using simulation traces. The
results show that our automatically-generated sensor fusion and state estimation implementations
provide state estimation within the same error bound as the human-written hand-optimized counterparts.
We additionally quantify the code size and dynamic instruction count requirements of the generated
state estimator implementations on the RISC-V architecture. The results show that our synthesized
state estimation implementation employing Automatic Differentiation leads to an average improvement
in the dynamic instruction count of the generated Kalman filter of 7%-16% compared to the standard
differentiation technique. This is improvement comes at the limited cost of an average 4.5% increase
in the code size of the generated filters.
