We investigate the problem $\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$ of counting all induced subgraphs of size
$k$ in a graph $G$ that satisfy a given property $\Phi$. This continues the work of Jerrum and Meeks
who proved the problem to be $\#\mathrm{W[1]}$-hard for some families of properties which include,
among others, (dis)connectedness [JCSS 15] and even- or oddness of the number of edges [Combinatorica
17]. Using the recent framework of graph motif parameters due to Curticapean, Dell and Marx [STOC
17], we discover that for monotone properties $\Phi$, the problem $\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$
is hard for $\#\mathrm{W[1]}$ if the reduced Euler characteristic of the associated simplicial
(graph) complex of $\Phi$ is non-zero. This observation links $\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$ to Karp's
famous Evasiveness Conjecture, as every graph complex with non-vanishing reduced Euler characteristic
is known to be evasive. Applying tools from the "topological approach to evasiveness" which was
introduced in the seminal paper of Khan, Saks and Sturtevant [FOCS 83], we prove that $\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$
is $\#\mathrm{W[1]}$-hard for every monotone property $\Phi$ that does not hold on the Hamilton
cycle as well as for some monotone properties that hold on the Hamilton cycle such as being triangle-free
or not $k$-edge-connected for $k > 2$. Moreover, we show that for those properties $\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$
can not be solved in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k)}$ for any computable function $f$ unless the Exponential
Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. In the final part of the paper, we investigate non-monotone properties
and prove that $\#\mathsf{IndSub}(\Phi)$ is $\#\mathrm{W[1]}$-hard if $\Phi$ is any non-trivial
modularity constraint on the number of edges with respect to some prime $q$ or if $\Phi$ enforces
the presence of a fixed isolated subgraph.
