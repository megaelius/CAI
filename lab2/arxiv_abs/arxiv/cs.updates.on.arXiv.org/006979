Most existing models for information flow propagation in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications
environment are descriptive. They lack capabilities to control information flow, which may preclude
their ability to meet application needs, including the need to propagate different information
types simultaneously to different target locations within corresponding time delay bounds. This
study proposes a queuing-based modeling approach to control the propagation of information flow
of multiple classes. Two control parameters associated with a vehicle are leveraged to control
the propagation performance of different information classes. A two-layer model is developed
to characterize the information flow propagation wave (IFPW) under the designed queuing strategy.
The upper layer is formulated as integro-differential equations to characterize the spatiotemporal
information dissemination due to V2V communication. The lower layer characterizes the traffic
flow dynamics using the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. The analytical solution of the asymptotic
density of informed vehicles and the necessary condition for existence of the IFPW are derived for
homogeneous traffic conditions. Numerical experiments provide insights on the impact of the mean
communication service rate on information spread and its spatial coverage. Further, a numerical
solution method is developed to solve the two-layer model, which aids in estimating the impacts
of the control parameters in the queuing strategy on the IFPW speed under homogeneous and heterogeneous
conditions. The proposed modeling approach enables controlling the propagation of information
of different information classes to meet application needs, which can assist traffic managers
to design effective and efficient traffic management and control strategies under V2V communications.
