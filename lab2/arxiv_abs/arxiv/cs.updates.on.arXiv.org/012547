While crack nucleation and propagation in the brittle or quasi-brittle regime can be predicted
via variational or material-force-based phase field fracture models, these models often assume
that the underlying elastic response of the material is non-polar and yet a length scale parameter
must be introduced to enable the sharp cracks represented by a regularized implicit function. However,
many materials with internal microstructures that contain surface tension, micro-cracks, micro-fracture,
inclusion, cavity or those of particulate nature often exhibit size-dependent behaviors in both
the path-independent and path-dependent regimes. This paper is intended to introduce a unified
treatment that captures the size effect of the materials in both elastic and damaged states. By introducing
a cohesive micropolar phase field fracture theory, along with the computational model and validation
exercises, we explore the interacting size-dependent elastic deformation and fracture mechanisms
exhibits in materials of complex microstructures. To achieve this goal, we introduce the distinctive
degradation functions of the force-stress-strain and couple-stress-micro-rotation energy-conjugated
pairs for a given regularization profile such that the macroscopic size-dependent responses of
the micropolar continua is insensitive to the length scale parameter of the regularized interface.
Then, we apply the variational principle to derive governing equations from the micropolar stored
energy and dissipative functionals. Numerical examples are introduced to demonstrate the proper
way to identify material parameters and the capacity of the new formulation to simulate complex
crack patterns in the quasi-static regime.
