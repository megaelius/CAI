In this paper, we present Breadcrumbs, a mobility dataset collected in the city of Lausanne (Switzerland)
from multiple mobile phone sensors (GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth) from 81 users for a duration of 12 weeks.
Currently available mobility datasets are restricted to geospatial information obtained through
a single sensor at low spatiotemporal granularities. Furthermore, this passively collected data
lacks ground-truth information regarding points of interest and their semantic labels. These
features are critical in order to push the possibilities of geospatial data analysis towards analyzing
mobility behaviors and movement patterns at a fine-grained scale. To this end, Breadcrumbs provides
ground-truth and semantic labels for the points of interest of all the participants. The dataset
also contains fine-grained demographic attributes, contact records, calendar events and social
relationship tags between the participants. In order to demonstrate the significance of the ground-truth
annotations, we discuss several use cases of this dataset. Furthermore, we compare four contrasting
and widely used unsupervised clustering approaches for point of interest extraction from geolocation
trajectories. Using the ground-truth information, we perform a detailed performance validation
of these techniques and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Given that mobility data is derived
from an individuals inherent need of participating in activities, narrowing the gap between raw
trajectory data points and complete trip annotation in essential. We thus make Breadcrumbs accessible
to the research community in order to facilitate research in the direction of supervised human mobility
learning schemes.
