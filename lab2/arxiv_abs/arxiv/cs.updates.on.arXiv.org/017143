In this paper, we investigate jointly sparse signal recovery and jointly sparse support recovery
in Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) models for complex signals, which arise in many applications
in communications and signal processing. Recent key applications include channel estimation
and device activity detection in MIMO-based grant-free random access which is proposed to support
massive machine-type communications (mMTC) for \lscr{ Internet of Things (IoT)}. Utilizing techniques
in compressive sensing, optimization and deep learning, we propose \wq{two model-driven} approaches,
based on the standard auto-encoder structure for real numbers. One is to jointly design the common
measurement matrix and jointly sparse signal recovery method, and the other aims to jointly design
the common measurement matrix and jointly sparse support recovery method. The proposed model-driven
approaches can effectively \lscr{utilize features of} sparsity patterns in \lscr{designing
common} measurement matrices and \lscr{adjusting \wq{model-driven}} decoders, and can greatly
benefit from the underlying state-of-the-art recovery methods with theoretical guarantee. Hence,
\lscr{the obtained common measurement matrices and recovery methods} \lscb{can significantly
outperform} the underlying advanced recovery methods. We conduct extensive numerical results
on channel estimation and device activity detection in MIMO-based grant-free random access. The
numerical results show that the proposed approaches \lscb{provide} pilot sequences and channel
estimation or device activity detection methods \lscb{which can} achieve \lscb{higher} \lscr{estimation
or detection} accuracy with shorter computation time than \lscb{existing ones}. Furthermore,
the numerical results explain how such gains are achieved \lscb{via the} proposed approaches.
