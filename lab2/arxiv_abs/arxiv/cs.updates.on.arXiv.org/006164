Objective: Asthma is a chronic pulmonary disease with multiple triggers manifesting as symptoms
with various intensities. This paper evaluates the suitability of long-term monitoring of pediatric
asthma using diverse data to qualify and quantify triggers that contribute to the asthma symptoms
and control to enable a personalized management plan. Materials and Methods: Asthma condition,
environment, and adherence to the prescribed care plan were continuously tracked for 97 pediatric
patients using kHealth-Asthma technology for one or three months. Result: At the cohort level,
among 21% of the patients deployed in spring, 63% and 19% indicated pollen and Particulate Matter
(PM2.5), respectively, as the major asthma contributors. Of the 18% of the patients deployed in
fall, 29% and 21% found pollen and PM2.5 respectively, to be the contributors. For the 28% of the patients
deployed in winter, PM2.5 was identified as the major contributor for 80% of them. One patient across
each season has been chosen to explain the determination of personalized triggers by observing
correlations between triggers and asthma symptoms gathered from anecdotal evidence. Discussion
and Conclusion: Both public and personal health signals including compliance to prescribed care
plan have been captured through continuous monitoring using the kHealth-Asthma technology which
generated insights on causes of asthma symptoms across different seasons. Collectively, they
can form the underlying basis for personalized management plan and intervention. KEYWORDS: Personalized
