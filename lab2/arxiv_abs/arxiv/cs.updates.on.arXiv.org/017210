In time-sensitive networks (as in the context of IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet), some limited amount of
packet reordering may be acceptable. Re-sequencing buffers are then used to provide in-order delivery
of packets; they depend on critical parameters (timeout value and buffer size) and may affect the
worst-case delay and delay jitter. However, there is no precise understanding of per-flow reordering
metrics nor of the dimensioning of re-sequencing buffers in order to provide worst-case guarantees,
as required in time-sensitive networks. We close this gap as follows. First, we show that a previously
proposed per-flow reordering metric, namely, reordering late time offset (RTO) determines the
timeout value. If the network can be assumed to be lossless, another previously defined metric,
the reordering byte offset (RBO), determines the required buffer size. However, if packet losses
cannot be ignored, the required buffer may be larger than the RBO, and the exact value depends on a
combination of the delay jitter between the source and the re-sequencing buffer, an arrival curve
of the flow at its source, and the timeout. Then we develop a method to compute the RTO for a flow path;
the method uses a novel relation with delay jitter and arrival curve, together with a decomposition
of the path into non order-preserving and order-preserving elements. We also analyze the effect
of re-sequencing buffers on worst-case delay, delay jitter and arrival curve propagation. We show
in particular that, in a lossless (but non order-preserving) network, re-sequencing is "for free",
in the sense that it does not increase worst-case delay nor delay jitter, whereas in a lossy network,
re-sequencing increases the worst-case delay and delay jitter. We apply the analysis to evaluate
the performance impact of placing re-sequencing buffers at intermediate points and illustrate
the results on two industrial test cases.
