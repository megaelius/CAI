We introduce a comprehensive and statistical framework in a model free setting for a complete treatment
of localized data corruptions due to severe noise sources, e.g., an occluder in the case of a visual
recording. Within this framework, we propose i) a novel algorithm to efficiently separate, i.e.,
detect and localize, possible corruptions from a given suspicious data instance and ii) a Maximum
A Posteriori (MAP) estimator to impute the corrupted data. As a generalization to Euclidean distance,
we also propose a novel distance measure, which is based on the ranked deviations among the data attributes
and empirically shown to be superior in separating the corruptions. Our algorithm first splits
the suspicious instance into parts through a binary partitioning tree in the space of data attributes
and iteratively tests those parts to detect local anomalies using the nominal statistics extracted
from an uncorrupted (clean) reference data set. Once each part is labeled as anomalous vs normal,
the corresponding binary patterns over this tree that characterize corruptions are identified
and the affected attributes are imputed. Under a certain conditional independency structure assumed
for the binary patterns, we analytically show that the false alarm rate of the introduced algorithm
in detecting the corruptions is independent of the data and can be directly set without any parameter
tuning. The proposed framework is tested over several well-known machine learning data sets with
synthetically generated corruptions; and experimentally shown to produce remarkable improvements
in terms of classification purposes with strong corruption separation capabilities. Our experiments
also indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the typical approaches and are robust to
varying training phase conditions.
