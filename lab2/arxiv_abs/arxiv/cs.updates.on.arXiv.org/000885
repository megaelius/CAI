During the earliest phase of architectural design process, practitioners after analyzing the
client's design program, legal requirements, topographic constraints, and preferences synthesize
these requirements into architectural floor plan drawings. Design decisions taken in this phase
may significantly contribute to the building performance. On account of this reason, it is important
to estimate and compare alternative solutions, when it is still manageable to change the building
design. The authors have been developing a prototype tool to assist architects during this initial
design phase. It is made up of two algorithms. The first algorithm generates alternative floor plans
according to the architect's preferences and requirements, and the client's design program. It
consists in one evolutionary strategy approach enhanced with local search technique to allocate
rooms on several levels in the two-dimensional space. The second algorithm evaluates, ranks, and
optimizes those floor plans according to thermal performance criteria. The prototype tool is coupled
with dynamic simulation program, which estimates the thermal behavior of each solution. A sequential
variable optimization is used to change several geometric values of different architectural elements
in the floor plans to explore the improvement potential. In the present communication, the two algorithms
are used in an iterative process to generate and optimize the thermal performance of alternative
floor plans. In the building simulation specifications of EnergyPlus program, the airflow network
model has been used in order to adequately model the air infiltration and the airflows through indoor
spaces. A case study of a single-family house with three rooms in a single level is presented.
