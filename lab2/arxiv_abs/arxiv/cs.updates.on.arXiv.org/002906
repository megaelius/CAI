The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) issued a proposed rule on January 12th, 2017 to mandate
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) safety communications in light vehicles in the US. Cybersecurity and
privacy are major challenges for such a deployment. The authors present a Security Credential Management
System (SCMS) for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications in this paper, which has been developed
by the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partners LLC (CAMP) under a Cooperative Agreement with the USDOT.
This system design is currently transitioning from research to Proof-of-Concept, and is a leading
candidate to support the establishment of a nationwide Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for V2X
security. It issues digital certificates to participating vehicles and infrastructure nodes
for trustworthy communications among them, which is necessary for safety and mobility applications
that are based on V2X communications. The main design goal is to provide both security and privacy
to the largest extent reasonable and possible. To achieve a reasonable level of privacy in this context,
vehicles are issued pseudonym certificates, and the generation and provisioning of those certificates
are divided among multiple organizations. Given the large number of pseudonym certificates per
vehicle, one of the main challenges is to facilitate efficient revocation of misbehaving or malfunctioning
vehicles, while preserving privacy against attacks from insiders. The proposed SCMS supports
all identified V2X use-cases and certificate types necessary for V2X communication security.
