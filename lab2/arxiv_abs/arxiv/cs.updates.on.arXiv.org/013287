We study graph realization problems from a distributed perspective and we study it in the node capacitated
clique (NCC) model of distributed computing, recently introduced for representing peer-to-peer
networks. We focus on two central variants, degree-sequence realization and minimum threshold-connectivity
realization both of which result in overlay network realizations. Overlay network realizations
can be either explicit or implicit. Explicit realizations require both endpoints of any edge in
the realized graph to be aware of the edge. In implicit realizations, on the other hand, at least one
endpoint of each edge of the realized graph needs to be aware of the edge. The main realization algorithms
we present are the following. 1. An $\tilde{O}(\min\{\sqrt{m},\Delta\})$ time algorithm for
implicit realization of a degree sequence. Here, $\Delta = \max_v d(v)$ is the maximum degree and
$m = (1/2) \sum_v d(v)$ is the number of edges in the final realization. An $\tilde{O}(\Delta)$ time
algorithm for an explicit realization of a degree sequence. We first compute an implicit realization
and then transform it into an explicit one in $\tilde{O}(\Delta)$ additional rounds. 2. An $\tilde{O}(\Delta)$
time algorithm for the threshold connectivity problem that obtains an explicit solution and an
improved $\tilde{O}(1)$ algorithm for implicit realization when all nodes know each other's IDs.
These algorithms are 2-approximations w.r.t. the number of edges. We complement our upper bounds
with lower bounds to show that the above algorithms are tight up to factors of $\log n$. Additionally,
we provide algorithms for realizing trees and an $\tilde{O}(1)$ round algorithm for approximate
degree sequence realization.
