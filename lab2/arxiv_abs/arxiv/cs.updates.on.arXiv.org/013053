The Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES) is one of the most important Latin American
Software Engineering conferences. It was first held in 1987, and in 2019 marks its 33rd edition.
Over these years, many researchers have participated in SBES, attending the conference, submitting,
and reviewing papers. The researchers who participate in the Program Committee (PC) and perform
the reviewers' role are fundamentally important to SBES, since their evaluations (e.g., deciding
whether a paper is accepted or not) have the potential of drawing what SBES is now. Knowing that diversity
is an important aspect of any group work, we wanted to understand diversity in the SBES PC community.
We investigated a number of characteristics of SBES PC members, including their gender and geographic
location. We also analyzed the turnover and renovation of the committee. Among the findings, we
observed that although the number of participants in the SBES PC has increased over the years, most
of them are men (~80%) and from the Southeast and Northeast of Brazil, with very few members from the
North region. We also observed that there is a small turnover: during the 2010 decade, only 11% of
new members were added to the PC. Finally, we investigated the participation of the PC members publishing
papers at SBES. We observed that only 24% of the papers accepted to SBES were authored by members who
were not committee members of the respective year. Moreover, committee members usually do not collaborate
among themselves: a significant number of the papers are authored by the PC members and students.
This paper may contribute to the SBES community, in particular, its special interest group, in understanding
the needs and challenges of the PC's participants.
