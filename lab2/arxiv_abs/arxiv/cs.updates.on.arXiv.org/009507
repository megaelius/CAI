We describe a new family of $k$-uniform hypergraphs with independent random edges. The hypergraphs
have a high probability of being peelable, i.e. to admit no sub-hypergraph of minimum degree $2$,
even when the edge density (number of edges over vertices) is close to $1$. In our construction, the
vertex set is partitioned into linearly arranged segments and each edge is incident to random vertices
of $k$ consecutive segments. Quite surprisingly, the linear geometry allows our graphs to be peeled
"from the outside in". The density thresholds $f_k$ for peelability of our hypergraphs ($f_3 \approx
0.918$, $f_4 \approx 0.977$, $f_5 \approx 0.992$, ...) are well beyond the corresponding thresholds
($c_3 \approx 0.818$, $c_4 \approx 0.772$, $c_5 \approx 0.702$, ...) of standard $k$-uniform random
hypergraphs. To get a grip on $f_k$, we analyse an idealised peeling process on the random weak limit
of our hypergraph family. The process can be described in terms of an operator on functions and $f_k$
can be linked to thresholds relating to the operator. These thresholds are then tractable with numerical
methods. Random hypergraphs underlie the construction of various data structures based on hashing.
These data structures frequently rely on peelability of the hypergraph or peelability allows for
simple linear time algorithms. To demonstrate the usefulness of our construction, we used our $3$-uniform
hypergraphs as a drop-in replacement for the standard $3$-uniform hypergraphs in a retrieval data
structure by Botelho et al. This reduces memory usage from $1.23m$ bits to $1.12m$ bits ($m$ being
the input size) with almost no change in running time.
