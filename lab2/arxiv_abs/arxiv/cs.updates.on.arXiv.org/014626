Cloud Gaming is an emerging service that catches growing interest in the research community as well
as industry. While the paradigm shift from a game execution on clients to streaming games from the
cloud offers a variety of benefits, the new services also require a highly reliable and low latency
network to achieve a satisfying Quality of Experience (QoE) for its users. Using a cloud gaming service
with high latency would harm the interaction of the user with the game, leading to a decrease in playing
performance and thus frustration of players. However, the negative effect of delay on gaming QoE
depends strongly on the game content. At a certain level of delay, a slow-paced card game is typically
not as delay sensitive as a shooting game. For optimal resource allocation and quality estimation,
it is highly important for cloud providers, game developers, and network planners to consider the
impact of the game content. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the delay impact
on QoE for cloud gaming applications by identifying game characteristics influencing the delay
perception of users. In addition, an expert evaluation methodology to quantify these characteristics,
as well as a delay sensitivity classification based on a decision tree is presented. The ratings
of 14 experts for the quantification indicated an excellent level of agreement which demonstrates
the reliability of the proposed method. Additionally, the decision tree reached an accuracy of
86.6 % on determining the delay sensitivity classes which were derived from a large dataset of subjective
input quality ratings during a series of experiments.
