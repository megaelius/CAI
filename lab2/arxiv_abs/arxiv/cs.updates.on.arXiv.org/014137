Children diagnosed with a scoliosis pathology are exposed during their follow up to ionic radiations
in each X-rays diagnosis. This exposure can have negative effects on the patient's health and cause
diseases in the adult age. In order to reduce X-rays scanning, recent systems provide diagnosis
of scoliosis patients using solely RGB images. The output of such systems is a set of augmented images
and scoliosis related angles. These angles, however, confuse the physicians due to their large
number. Moreover, the lack of X-rays scans makes it impossible for the physician to compare RGB and
X-rays images, and decide whether to reduce X-rays exposure or not. In this work, we exploit both
RGB images of scoliosis captured during clinical diagnosis, and X-rays hard copies provided by
patients in order to register both images and give a rich comparison of diagnoses. The work consists
in, first, establishing the monomodal (RGB topography of the back) and multimodal (RGB and Xrays)
image database, then registering images based on patient landmarks, and finally blending registered
images for a visual analysis and follow up by the physician. The proposed registration is based on
a rigid transformation that preserves the topology of the patient's back. Parameters of the rigid
transformation are estimated using a proposed angle minimization of Cervical vertebra 7, and Posterior
Superior Iliac Spine landmarks of a source and target diagnoses. Experiments conducted on the constructed
database show a better monomodal and multimodal registration using our proposed method compared
to registration using an Equation System Solving based registration.
