Nonprofit crowdsourcing platforms such as food recovery organizations rely on volunteers to perform
time-sensitive tasks. To encourage volunteers to complete a task, platforms use nudging mechanisms
to notify a subset of volunteers with the hope that at least one of them responds positively. However,
since excessive notifications may reduce volunteer engagement, the platform faces a trade-off
between notifying more volunteers for the current task and saving them for future ones. Motivated
by these applications, we introduce the online volunteer notification problem, a generalization
of online stochastic bipartite matching where tasks arrive following a known time-varying distribution
over task types. Upon arrival of a task, the platform notifies a subset of volunteers with the objective
of minimizing the number of missed tasks. To capture each volunteer's adverse reaction to excessive
notifications, we assume that a notification triggers a random period of inactivity, during which
she will ignore all notifications. However, if a volunteer is active and notified, she will perform
the task with a given pair-specific match probability that captures her preference for the task.
We develop two online randomized policies that achieve constant-factor guarantees close to the
upper bound we establish for the performance of any online policy. Our policies as well as hardness
results are parameterized by the minimum discrete hazard rate of the inter-activity time distribution.
The design of each policy relies on modifying an ex-ante feasible solution, either by properly scaling
down the notification probability prescribed by the ex-ante solution or by sparsifying that solution.
Further, in collaboration with Food Rescue U.S., a volunteer-based food recovery platform, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our policies by testing them on the platform's data from various
locations across the U.S.
