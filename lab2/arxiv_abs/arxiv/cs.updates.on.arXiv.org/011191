Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have drastically gained popularity in various Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS) applications to improve the safety and efficiency of transportation systems. In this
context, the combination of ground vehicles, such as delivery trucks, with drones to assist in the
last mile pick-up and delivery of the parcels has been recently proposed. While aerial vehicles
promise increased efficiency based on flexible routes and parallelized operation, highly reliable
wireless communication is also required for the control and coordination of potentially many drones
acting in a self-organized way. In this paper, we analyze the improvements procured by drone usage
in parcel delivery compared to traditional delivery and propose a simulation framework to further
quantify the efficiency gains of the parcel delivery logistics and to analyze the performance of
different wireless communications options. To this end, we consider a heterogeneous vehicle routing
problem with various constraints. We consider two approaches regarding the dispatching and recovery
of drones and evaluate their benefits as opposed to parcel delivery with a classic truck only. Furthermore,
we compare two networking technologies for enabling coordination of the self-organizing teams
of drones with a realistically modeled environment: one approach relying on base station oriented
Long Term Evolution (LTE) vs. a more decentralized Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) solution.
The results show time savings of nearly 40% can be achieved through drone usage and that the negative
impact of urban shadowing on network communications in the base station oriented LTE approach can
be compensated by leveraging decentralized C-V2X communications
