Recent debates over adults' theory of mind use have been fueled by surprising failures of perspective-taking
in communication, suggesting that perspective-taking can be relatively effortful. How, then,
should speakers and listeners allocate their resources to achieve successful communication?
We begin with the observation that this shared goal induces a natural division of labor: the resources
one agent chooses to allocate toward perspective-taking should depend on their expectations about
the other's allocation. We formalize this idea in a resource-rational model augmenting recent
probabilistic weighting accounts with a mechanism for (costly) control over the degree of perspective-taking.
In a series of simulations, we first derive an intermediate degree of perspective weighting as an
optimal tradeoff between expected costs and benefits of perspective-taking. We then present two
behavioral experiments testing novel predictions of our model. In Experiment 1, we manipulated
the presence or absence of occlusions in a director-matcher task and found that speakers spontaneously
produced more informative descriptions to account for "known unknowns" in their partner's private
view. In Experiment 2, we compared the scripted utterances used by confederates in prior work with
those produced in interactions with unscripted directors. We found that confederates were systematically
less informative than listeners would initially expect given the presence of occlusions, but listeners
used violations to adaptively make fewer errors over time. Taken together, our work suggests that
people are not simply "mindblind"; they use contextually appropriate expectations to navigate
the division of labor with their partner. We discuss how a resource rational framework may provide
a more deeply explanatory foundation for understanding flexible perspective-taking under processing
constraints.
