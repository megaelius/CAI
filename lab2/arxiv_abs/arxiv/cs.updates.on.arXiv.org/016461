As the world braces itself for a pandemic-induced surge in automation and a consequent (accelerated)
shift in the nature of jobs, it is essential now more than ever to understand how people's creative
performances are impacted by their interactions with peers in a social network. However, when it
comes to creative ideation, it is unclear how the demographic cues of one's peers can influence the
network dynamics and the associated performance outcomes of people. In this paper, we ask: (1) Given
the task of creative idea generation, how do social network connectivities adapt to people's demographic
cues? (2) How are creative outcomes influenced by such demography-informed network dynamics?
We find that link formations in creativity-centric networks are primarily guided by the creative
performances of one's peers. However, in the presence of demographic information, the odds of same-gender
links to persist increase by 82.03%, after controlling for merit-based link persistence. In essence,
homophily-guided link persistence takes place when demographic cues are available. We further
find that the semantic similarities between socially stimulated idea-sets increase significantly
in the presence of demographic cues (P<1e-4), which is counter-productive for the purposes of divergent
creativity. This result can partly be explained by the observation that people's ideas tend to be
more homogeneous within demographic groups than between demographic groups (P<1e-7). Therefore,
choosing to maintain connections based on demographic similarity can negatively impact one's
creative inspiration sources by taking away potential diversity bonuses. Our results can inform
intelligent intervention possibilities towards maximizing a social system's creative outcomes.
