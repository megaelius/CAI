It was conjectured by \v{C}ern\'y in 1964, that a synchronizing DFA on $n$ states always has a synchronizing
word of length at most $(n-1)^2$, and he gave a sequence of DFAs for which this bound is reached. Until
now a full analysis of all DFAs reaching this bound was only given for $n \leq 5$, and with bounds on
the number of symbols for $n \leq 12$. Here we give the full analysis for $n \leq 7$, without bounds
on the number of symbols. For PFAs (partial automata) on $\leq 7$ states we do a similar analysis as
for DFAs and find the maximal shortest synchronizing word lengths, exceeding $(n-1)^2$ for $n \geq
4$. Where DFAs with long synchronization typically have very few symbols, for PFAs we observe that
more symbols may increase the synchronizing word length. For PFAs on $\leq 10$ states and two symbols
we investigate all occurring synchronizing word lengths. We give series of PFAs on two and three
symbols, reaching the maximal possible length for some small values of $n$. For $n=6,7,8,9$, the
construction on two symbols is the unique one reaching the maximal length. For both series the growth
is faster than $(n-1)^2$, although still quadratic. Based on string rewriting, for arbitrary size
we construct a PFA on three symbols with exponential shortest synchronizing word length, giving
significantly better bounds than earlier exponential constructions. We give a transformation
of this PFA to a PFA on two symbols keeping exponential shortest synchronizing word length, yielding
a better bound than applying a similar known transformation. Both PFAs are transitive. Finally,
we show that exponential lengths are even possible with just one single undefined transition, again
with transitive constructions.
