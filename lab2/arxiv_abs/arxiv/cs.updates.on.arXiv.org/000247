Despite considerable progress in genome- and proteome-based high-throughput screening methods
and in rational drug design, the increase in approved drugs in the past decade did not match the increase
of drug development costs. Network description and analysis not only give a systems-level understanding
of drug action and disease complexity, but can also help to improve the efficiency of drug design.
We give a comprehensive assessment of the analytical tools of network topology and dynamics. The
state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity, protein structure, protein-protein interaction,
signaling, genetic interaction and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized.
We propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The central hit strategy selectively
targets central nodes/edges of the flexible networks of infectious agents or cancer cells to kill
them. The network influence strategy works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration
of rigid networks needs to be achieved by targeting the neighbors of central nodes or edges. It is
shown how network techniques can help in the identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target
and allo-network drug target candidates. We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit
identification, lead selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing side-effects
and drug toxicity. Successful network-based drug development strategies are shown through the
examples of infections, cancer, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Summarizing
more than 1200 references we suggest an optimized protocol of network-aided drug development,
and provide a list of systems-level hallmarks of drug quality. Finally, we highlight network-related
drug development trends helping to achieve these hallmarks by a cohesive, global approach.
