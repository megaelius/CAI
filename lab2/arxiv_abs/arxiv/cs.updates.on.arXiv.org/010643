The high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) is reshaping the electricity net-load curve and has a
significant impact on power system operation and planning. The concept of duck curve is widely used
to describe the timing imbalance between peak demand and PV generation. The traditional duck curve
is deterministic and only shows a single extreme or typical scenario during a day. Thus, it cannot
capture both the probability of that scenario and the uncertainty of PV generation and loads. These
weaknesses limit the application of the duck curve on power system planning under high PV penetration.
To address this issue, the novel concepts of probabilistic duck curve (PDC) and probabilistic ramp
curve (PRC) are proposed to accurately model the uncertainty and variability of electricity net
load and ramp under high PV penetration. An efficient method is presented for modeling PDC and PRC
using kernel density estimation, copula function, and dependent discrete convolution. Several
indices are designed to quantify the characteristics of the PDC and PRC. For the application, we
demonstrate how the PDC and PRC will benefit flexible resource planning. Finally, an empirical
study on the Qinghai provincial power system of China validates the effectiveness of the presented
method. The results of PDC and PRC intuitively illustrate that the ramp demand and the valley of net
load face considerable uncertainty under high PV penetration. The results of flexible resource
planning indicate that retrofitting coal-fired units has remarkable performance on enhancing
the power system flexibility in Qinghai. In average, reducing the minimal output of coal-fired
units by 1 MW will increase PV accommodation by over 4 MWh each day.
