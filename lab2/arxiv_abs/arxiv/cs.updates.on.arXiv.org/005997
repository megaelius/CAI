Talbot-Lau X-ray phase-contrast imaging is a novel imaging modality, which provides not only an
X-ray absorption image, but also additionally a differential phase image and a dark-field image.
The dark-field image is related to small angle scattering and has an interesting property when canning
oriented structures: the recorded signal depends on the relative orientation of the structure
in the imaging system. Exactly this property allows to draw conclusions about the orientation and
to reconstruct the structure. However, the reconstruction is a complex, non-trivial challenge.
A lot of research was conducted towards this goal in the last years and several reconstruction algorithms
were proposed. A key step of the reconstruction algorithm is the inversion of a forward projection
model. Up until now, only 2-D projection models are available, with effectively limit the scanning
trajectory to a 2-D plane. To obtain true 3-D information, this limitation requires to combine several
2-D scans, which leads to quite complex, impractical acquisitions schemes. Furthermore, it is
not possible with these models to use 3-D trajectories that might allow simpler protocols, like
for example a helical trajectory. To address these limitations, we propose in this work a very general
3-D projection model. Our projection model defines the dark-field signal dependent on an arbitrarily
chosen ray and sensitivity direction. We derive the projection model under the assumption that
the observed scatter distribution has a Gaussian shape. We theoretically show the consistency
of our model with more constrained existing 2-D models. Furthermore, we experimentally show the
compatibility of our model with dark-field measurements of two matchsticks. We believe that this
3-D projection model is an important step towards more flexible trajectories and imaging protocols
that are much better applicable in practice.
