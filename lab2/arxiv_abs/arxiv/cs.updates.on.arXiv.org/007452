Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus exhibits higher throughput in comparison to Proof of
Work (PoW) in blockchains. But BFT-based protocols suffer from scalability problems with respect
to the number of replicas in the network. The main reason for this limitation is the quadratic message
complexity of BFT protocols. Previously, proposed solutions improve BFT performance for normal
operation, but will fall back to quadratic message complexity once the protocol observes a certain
number of failures. This makes the protocol performance unpredictable as it is not guaranteed that
the network will face a a certain number of failures. As a result, such protocols are only scalable
when conditions are favorable (i.e., the number of failures are less than a given threshold). To
address this issue we propose Proteus, a new BFT-based consensus protocol which elects a subset
of nodes $c$ as a root committee. Proteus guarantees stable performance, regardless of the number
of failures in the network and it improves on the quadratic message complexity of typical BFT-based
protocols to $O(cn)$, where $c<<n$, for large $n$. Thus, message complexity remains small and less
than quadratic when $c$ is asymptotically smaller than $n$, and this helps the protocol to provide
stable performance even during the view change process (change of root committee). Our view change
process is different than typical BFT protocols as it replaces the whole root committee compared
to replacing a single primary in other protocols. We deployed and tested our protocol on $200$ Amazon
$EC2$ instances, with two different baseline BFT protocols (PBFT and Bchain) for comparison. In
these tests, our protocol outperformed the baselines by more than $2\times$ in terms of throughput
as well as latency.
