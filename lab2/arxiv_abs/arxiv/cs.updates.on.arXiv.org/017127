As 5G communication technology develops, vehicular communications that require high reliability,
low latency, and massive connectivity are drawing increasing interest from those in academia and
industry. Due to these developing technologies, vehicular communication is not limited to vehicle
components in the forms of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) networks,
but has also been extended to connect with others, such as pedestrians and cellular users. Dedicated
Short-Range Communications (DSRC) is the conventional vehicular communication standard for
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). More recently, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
introduced Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X), a competitor to DSRC. Meanwhile, the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC)issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to consider deploying
Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII)devices in the ITS band with two interference
mitigation approaches: Detect-and-Vacate (DAV)and Re-channelization (Re-CH). With multiple
standard options and interference mitigation approaches, numerous regulatory taxonomies can
be identified and notification of relevant technical challenges issued. However, these challenges
are much broader than the current and future regulatory taxonomies pursued by the different countries
involved. Because their plans differ, the technical and regulatory challenges vary. This paper
presents a literature survey about the technical challenges, the current and future ITS band usage
plans, and the major research testbeds for the U.S., Europe, China, Korea, and Japan. This survey
shows that the most likely deployment taxonomies are (1) DSRC, C-V2X, and Wi-Fi with Re-CH; (2) DSRC
and C-V2X with interoperation, and (3) C-V2X only. The most difficult technical challenge is the
interoperability between the Wi-Fi-like DSRC and 4G LTE-like C-V2X.
