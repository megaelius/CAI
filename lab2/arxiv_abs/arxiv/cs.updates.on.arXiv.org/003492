This paper presents the CAT Vehicle (Cognitive and Autonomous Test Vehicle) Testbed: a research
testbed comprised of a distributed simulation-based autonomous vehicle, with straightforward
transition to hardware in the loop testing and execution, to support research in autonomous driving
technology. The evolution of autonomous driving technology from active safety features and advanced
driving assistance systems to full sensor-guided autonomous driving requires testing of every
possible scenario. However, researchers who want to demonstrate new results on a physical platform
face difficult challenges, if they do not have access to a robotic platform in their own labs. Thus,
there is a need for a research testbed where simulation-based results can be rapidly validated through
hardware in the loop simulation, in order to test the software on board the physical platform. The
CAT Vehicle Testbed offers such a testbed that can mimic dynamics of a real vehicle in simulation
and then seamlessly transition to reproduction of use cases with hardware. The simulator utilizes
the Robot Operating System (ROS) with a physics-based vehicle model, including simulated sensors
and actuators with configurable parameters. The testbed allows multi-vehicle simulation to support
vehicle to vehicle interaction. Our testbed also facilitates logging and capturing of the data
in the real time that can be played back to examine particular scenarios or use cases, and for regression
testing. As part of the demonstration of feasibility, we present a brief description of the CAT Vehicle
Challenge, in which student researchers from all over the globe were able to reproduce their simulation
results with fewer than 2 days of interfacing with the physical platform.
