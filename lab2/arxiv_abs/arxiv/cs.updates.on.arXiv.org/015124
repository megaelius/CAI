This article presents an axiomatic approach for deductive verification of existence and liveness
for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with differential dynamic logic (dL). The approach
yields proofs that the solution of a given ODE exists long enough to reach a given target region without
leaving a given evolution domain. Numerous subtleties complicate the generalization of discrete
liveness verification techniques, such as loop variants, to the continuous setting. For example,
ODE solutions may blow up in finite time or their progress towards the goal may converge to zero. These
subtleties are handled in dL by successively refining ODE liveness properties using ODE invariance
properties which have a well-understood deductive proof theory. This approach is widely applicable:
several liveness arguments from the literature are surveyed and derived as special instances of
axiomatic refinement in dL. These derivations also identify and correct several soundness errors
in the surveyed literature, which further highlights the subtlety of ODE liveness reasoning and
the utility of an axiomatic deductive approach. An important special case of the approach yields
formal deduction of (global) existence properties of ODEs, which are a fundamental part of every
ODE liveness argument. Thus, all generalizations of existence properties and their proofs immediately
lead to corresponding generalizations of ODE liveness arguments. Overall, the resulting library
of common refinement steps enables both the sound development and justification of new ODE existence
and liveness proof rules from dL axioms. These insights also enable and inform an implementation
of those proof rules in the KeYmaera X theorem prover for hybrid systems.
