Multimedia content especially videos is expected to dominate data traffic in next-generation
mobile networks. Caching popular content at the network edge has emerged to be a solution for low-latency
content delivery. Compared with the traditional wireless communication, content delivery has
a key characteristic that many signals coexisting in the air carry identical popular content. They,
however, can interfere with each other at a receiver if their modulation-and-coding (MAC) schemes
are adapted to individual channels following the classic approach. To address this issue, we present
a novel idea of content adaptive MAC (CAMAC) where adapting MAC schemes to content ensures that all
signals carry identical content are encoded using an identical MAC scheme, achieving spatial MAC
alignment. Consequently, interference can be harnessed as signals, to improve the reliability
of wireless delivery. In the remaining part of the paper, we focus on quantifying the gain CAMAC can
bring to a content-delivery network using a stochastic-geometry model. Specifically, content
helpers are distributed as a Poisson point process, each of which transmits a file from a content
database based on a given popularity distribution. It is discovered that the successful content-delivery
probability is closely related to the distribution of the ratio of two independent shot noise processes,
named a shot-noise ratio. The distribution itself is an open mathematical problem that we tackle
in this work. Using stable-distribution theory and tools from stochastic geometry, the distribution
function is derived in closed form. Extending the result in the context of content-delivery networks
with CAMAC yields the content-delivery probability in different closed forms. In addition, the
gain in the probability due to CAMAC is shown to grow with the level of skewness in the content popularity
distribution.
