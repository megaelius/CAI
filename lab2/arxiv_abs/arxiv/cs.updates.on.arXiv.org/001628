While machine learning and artificial intelligence have long been applied in networking research,
the bulk of such works has focused on supervised learning. Recently there has been a rising trend
of employing unsupervised machine learning using unstructured raw network data to improve network
performance and provide services such as traffic engineering, anomaly detection, Internet traffic
classification, and quality of service optimization. The interest in applying unsupervised learning
techniques in networking emerges from their great success in other fields such as computer vision,
natural language processing, speech recognition, and optimal control (e.g., for developing autonomous
self-driving cars). Unsupervised learning is interesting since it can unconstrain us from the
need of labeled data and manual handcrafted feature engineering thereby facilitating flexible,
general, and automated methods of machine learning. The focus of this survey paper is to provide
an overview of the applications of unsupervised learning in the domain of networking. We provide
a comprehensive survey highlighting the recent advancements in unsupervised learning techniques
and describe their applications for various learning tasks in the context of networking. We also
provide a discussion on future directions and open research issues, while also identifying potential
pitfalls. While a few survey papers focusing on the applications of machine learning in networking
have previously been published, a survey of similar scope and breadth is missing in literature.
Through this paper, we advance the state of knowledge by carefully synthesizing the insights from
these survey papers while also providing contemporary coverage of recent advances.
