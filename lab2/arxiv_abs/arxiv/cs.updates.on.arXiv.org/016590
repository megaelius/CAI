A vector addition system with states (VASS) consists of a finite set of states and counters. A transition
changes the current state to the next state, and every counter is either incremented, or decremented,
or left unchanged. A state and value for each counter is a configuration; and a computation is an infinite
sequence of configurations with transitions between successive configurations. A probabilistic
VASS consists of a VASS along with a probability distribution over the transitions for each state.
Qualitative properties such as state and configuration reachability have been widely studied
for VASS. In this work we consider multi-dimensional long-run average objectives for VASS and probabilistic
VASS. For a counter, the cost of a configuration is the value of the counter; and the long-run average
value of a computation for the counter is the long-run average of the costs of the configurations
in the computation. The multi-dimensional long-run average problem given a VASS and a threshold
value for each counter, asks whether there is a computation such that for each counter the long-run
average value for the counter does not exceed the respective threshold. For probabilistic VASS,
instead of the existence of a computation, we consider whether the expected long-run average value
for each counter does not exceed the respective threshold. Our main results are as follows: we show
that the multi-dimensional long-run average problem (a) is NP-complete for integer-valued VASS;
(b) is undecidable for natural-valued VASS (i.e., nonnegative counters); and (c) can be solved
in polynomial time for probabilistic integer-valued VASS, and probabilistic natural-valued
VASS when all computations are non-terminating.
