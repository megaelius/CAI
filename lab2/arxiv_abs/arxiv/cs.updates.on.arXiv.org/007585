Let ${R} = \{R_1, R_2, ..., R_n\}$ be a set of regions and let $ X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$ be an (unknown)
point set with $x_i \in R_i$. Region $R_i$ represents the uncertainty region of $x_i$. We consider
the following question: how fast can we establish order if we are allowed to preprocess the regions
in $R$? The preprocessing model of uncertainty uses two consecutive phases: a preprocessing phase
which has access only to ${R}$ followed by a reconstruction phase during which a desired structure
on $X$ is computed. Recent results in this model parametrize the reconstruction time by the ply of
${R}$, which is the maximum overlap between the regions in ${R}$. We introduce the ambiguity $A({R})$
as a more fine-grained measure of the degree of overlap in ${R}$. We show how to preprocess a set of
$d$-dimensional disks in $O(n \log n)$ time such that we can sort $X$ (if $d=1$) and reconstruct a
quadtree on $X$ (if $d\geq 1$ but constant) in $O(A({R}))$ time. If $A({R})$ is sub-linear, then
reporting the result dominates the running time of the reconstruction phase. However, we can still
return a suitable data structure representing the result in $O(A({R}))$ time. In one dimension,
${R}$ is a set of intervals and the ambiguity is linked to interval entropy, which in turn relates
to the well-studied problem of sorting under partial information. The number of comparisons necessary
to find the linear order underlying a poset $P$ is lower-bounded by the graph entropy of $P$. We show
that if $P$ is an interval order, then the ambiguity provides a constant-factor approximation of
the graph entropy. This gives a lower bound of $\Omega(A({R}))$ in all dimensions for the reconstruction
phase (sorting or any proximity structure), independent of any preprocessing; hence our result
is tight.
