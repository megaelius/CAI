Besides the advantages derived from the ever present communication properties, it increases the
attack surface of a network as well. As industrial protocols and systems were not designed with security
in mind, spectacular attacks on industrial systems occurred over the last years. Most industrial
communication protocols do not provide means to ensure authentication or encryption. This means
attackers with access to a network can read and write information. Originally not meant to be connected
to public networks, the use cases of Industry 4.0 require interconnectivity, often through insecure
public networks. This lead to an increasing interest in information security products for industrial
applications. In this work, the concept for holistic intrusion detection methods in an industrial
context is presented. It is based on different works considering several aspects of industrial
environments and their capabilities to identify intrusions as an anomaly in network or process
data. These capabilities are based on preceding experiments on real and synthetic data. In order
to justify the concept, an overview of potential and actual attack vectors and attacks on industrial
systems is provided. It is shown that different aspects of industrial facilities, e.g. office IT,
shop floor OT, firewalled connections to customers and partners are analysed as well as the different
layers of the automation pyramid require different methods to detect attacks. Additionally, the
singular steps of an attack on industrial applications are characterised. Finally, a resulting
concept for integration of these methods is proposed, providing the means to detect the different
stages of an attack by different means.
