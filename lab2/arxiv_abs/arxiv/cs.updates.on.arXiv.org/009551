We propose an integrated control architecture to address the gap that currently exists for efficient
real-time implementation of MPC-based control approaches for highly nonlinear systems with fast
dynamics and a large number of control constraints. The proposed architecture contains two types
of controllers: base controllers that are tuned or optimized offline, and parallel controllers
that solve an optimization-based control problem online. The control inputs computed by the base
controllers provide starting points for the optimization problem of the parallel controllers,
which operate in parallel within a limited time budget that does not exceed the control sampling
time. The resulting control system is very flexible and its architecture can easily be modified
or changed online, e.g., by adding or eliminating controllers, for online improvement of the performance
of the controlled system. In a case study, the proposed control architecture is implemented for
highway traffic, which is characterized by nonlinear, fast dynamics with multiple control constraints,
to minimize the overall travel time of the vehicles, while increasing their total traveled distance
within the fixed simulation time window. The results of the simulation show the excellent real-time
(i.e., within the given time budget) performance of the proposed control architecture, with the
least realized value of the overall cost function. Moreover, among the online control approaches
considered for the case study, the average cost per vehicle for the base-parallel control approach
is the closest to the online MPC-based controllers, which have excellent performance but may involve
computation times that exceed the given time budget.
