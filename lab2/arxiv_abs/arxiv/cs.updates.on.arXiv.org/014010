Users' reviews contain valuable information which are not taken into account in most recommender
systems. According to the latest studies in this field, using review texts could not only improve
the performance of recommendation, but it can also alleviate the impact of data sparsity and help
to tackle the cold start problem. In this paper, we present a neural recommender model which recommends
items by leveraging user reviews. In order to predict user rating for each item, our proposed model,
named MatchPyramid Recommender System (MPRS), represents each user and item with their corresponding
review texts. Thus, the problem of recommendation is viewed as a text matching problem such that
the matching score obtained from matching user and item texts could be considered as a good representative
of their joint extent of similarity. To solve the text matching problem, inspired by MatchPyramid
(Pang, 2016), we employed an interaction-based approach according to which a matching matrix is
constructed given a pair of input texts. The matching matrix, which has the property of hierarchical
matching patterns, is then fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to compute the matching
score for the given user-item pair. Our experiments on the small data categories of Amazon review
dataset show that our proposed model gains from 1.76% to 21.72% relative improvement compared to
DeepCoNN model, and from 0.83% to 3.15% relative improvement compared to TransNets model. Also,
on two large categories, namely AZ-CSJ and AZ-Mov, our model achieves relative improvements of
8.08% and 7.56% compared to the DeepCoNN model, and relative improvements of 1.74% and 0.86% compared
to the TransNets model, respectively.
