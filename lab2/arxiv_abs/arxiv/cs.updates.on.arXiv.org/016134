Bio-inspired molecular communications (MC), where molecules are used to transfer information,
is the most promising technique to realise the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), thanks to its inherent
biocompatibility, energy-efficiency, and reliability in physiologically-relevant environments.
Despite a substantial body of theoretical work concerning MC, the lack of practical micro/nanoscale
MC devices and MC testbeds has led researchers to make overly simplifying assumptions about the
implications of the channel conditions and the physical architectures of the practical transceivers
in developing theoretical models and devising communication methods for MC. On the other hand,
MC imposes unique challenges resulting from the highly complex, nonlinear, time-varying channel
properties that cannot be always tackled by conventional information and communication tools
and technologies (ICT). As a result, the reliability of the existing MC methods, which are mostly
adopted from electromagnetic communications and not validated with practical testbeds, is highly
questionable. As the first step to remove this discrepancy, in this study, we report on the fabrication
of a nanoscale MC receiver based on graphene field-effect transistor biosensors. We perform its
ICT characterisation in a custom-designed microfluidic MC system with the information encoded
into the concentration of single-stranded DNA molecules. This experimental platform is the first
practical implementation of a micro/nanoscale MC system with nanoscale MC receivers, and can serve
as a testbed for developing realistic MC methods and IoNT applications.
