A reliable and accurate forecasting method for crop yields is very important for the farmer, the
economy of a country, and the agricultural stakeholders. However, due to weather extremes and uncertainties
as a result of increasing climate change, most crop yield forecasting models are not reliable and
accurate. In this paper, a hybrid crop yield probability density forecasting method via quantile
regression forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-SJ) is proposed to capture the uncertainties
and extremes of weather in crop yield forecasting. By assigning probability to possible crop yield
values, probability density forecast gives a complete description of the yield of crops. A case
study using the annual crop yield of groundnut and millet in Ghana is presented to illustrate the
efficiency and robustness of the proposed technique. The proposed model is able to capture the nonlinearity
between crop yield and the weather variables via random forest. The values of prediction interval
coverage probability and prediction interval normalized average width for the two crops show that
the constructed prediction intervals cover the target values with perfect probability. The probability
density curves show that QRF-SJ method has a very high ability to forecast quality prediction intervals
with a higher coverage probability. The feature importance gave a score of the importance of each
weather variable in building the quantile regression forest model. The farmer and other stakeholders
are able to realize the specific weather variable that affect the yield of a selected crop through
feature importance. The proposed method and its application on crop yield dataset is the first of
its kind in literature.
