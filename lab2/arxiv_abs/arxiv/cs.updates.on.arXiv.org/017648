Trajectory planning and coordination for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have been studied
at isolated ``signal-free'' intersections and in ``signal-free'' corridors under the fully CAV
environment in the literature. Most of the existing studies are based on the definition of approaching
and exit lanes. The route a vehicle takes to pass through an intersection is determined from its movement.
That is, only the origin and destination arms are included. This study proposes a mixed-integer
linear programming (MILP) model to optimize vehicle trajectories at an isolated ``signal-free''
intersection without lane allocation, which is denoted as ``lane-allocation-free'' (LAF) control.
Each lane can be used as both approaching and exit lanes for all vehicle movements including left-turn,
through, and right-turn. A vehicle can take a flexible route by way of multiple arms to pass through
the intersection. In this way, the spatial-temporal resources are expected to be fully utilized.
The interactions between vehicle trajectories are modeled explicitly at the microscopic level.
Vehicle routes and trajectories (i.e., car-following and lane-changing behaviors) at the intersection
are optimized in one unified framework for system optimality in terms of total vehicle delay. Considering
varying traffic conditions, the planning horizon is adaptively adjusted in the implementation
procedure of the proposed model to make a balance between solution feasibility and computational
burden. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed LAF control in terms of both vehicle
delay and throughput with different demand structures and temporal safety gaps.
