We present CosmoHub (https://cosmohub.pic.es), a web application based on Hadoop to perform interactive
exploration and distribution of massive cosmological datasets. Recent Cosmology seeks to unveil
the nature of both dark matter and dark energy mapping the large-scale structure of the Universe,
through the analysis of massive amounts of astronomical data, progressively increasing during
the last (and future) decades with the digitization and automation of the experimental techniques.
CosmoHub, hosted and developed at the Port d'Informaci\'o Cient\'ifica (PIC), provides support
to a worldwide community of scientists, without requiring the end user to know any Structured Query
Language (SQL). It is serving data of several large international collaborations such as the Euclid
space mission, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS)
and the Marenostrum Institut de Ci\`encies de l'Espai (MICE) numerical simulations. While originally
developed as a PostgreSQL relational database web frontend, this work describes the current version
of CosmoHub, built on top of Apache Hive, which facilitates scalable reading, writing and managing
huge datasets. As CosmoHub's datasets are seldomly modified, Hive it is a better fit. Over 60 TiB
of catalogued information and $50 \times 10^9$ astronomical objects can be interactively explored
using an integrated visualization tool which includes 1D histogram and 2D heatmap plots. In our
current implementation, online exploration of datasets of $10^9$ objects can be done in a timescale
of tens of seconds. Users can also download customized subsets of data in standard formats generated
in few minutes.
