Achieving high bandwidth utilization in cloud computing is essential for better network performance.
However, it is difficult to attain high bandwidth utilization in cloud computing due to the complex
and distributed natures of cloud computing resources. Recently, a growing demand for multicast
transmission is perceived in cloud computing, due to the explosive growth of multi-point communication
applications, such as video conferencing, online gaming, etc. Nonetheless, the inherent complexity
in multicast routing in cloud computing, existing multicast plans failed to produce effective
and efficient protocol schemes, which limits the application of multicast communication on the
Internet. In this paper, a technique is proposed in how the newly developed network architecture,
Software Defined Network (SDN), can promote the design of the multicast protocol and improve the
performance of the multicast transmission in the cloud computing. The approach is to use the SDN-cloud
Computing-enabled multicast communication scheme with ultra-high bandwidth utilization. The
bandwidth utilization is enhanced by measuring various routing trees for each multicast transmission
session and distributing the traffic load over all available routes in the cloud computing resources.
The SDN is utilized to tackle with various design hurdles in the cloud computing, including both
the current ones with the conventional multicast pattern and the newly emerged ones with multi-tree
multicast. The prototype implementation and experiments demonstrate the performance enhancement
of the proposed approach in the cloud computing in compared to conventional single-tree multicast
designs.
