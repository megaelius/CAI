Identifying the distribution of users' transportation modes is an essential part of travel demand
analysis and transportation planning. With the advent of ubiquitous GPS-enabled devices (e.g.,
a smartphone), a cost-effective approach for inferring commuters' mobility mode(s) is to leverage
their GPS trajectories. A majority of studies have proposed mode inference models based on hand-crafted
features and traditional machine learning algorithms. However, manual features engender some
major drawbacks including vulnerability to traffic and environmental conditions as well as possessing
human's bias in creating efficient features. One way to overcome these issues is by utilizing Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) schemes that are capable of automatically driving high-level features from
the raw input. Accordingly, in this paper, we take advantage of CNN architectures so as to predict
travel modes based on only raw GPS trajectories, where the modes are labeled as walk, bike, bus, driving,
and train. Our key contribution is designing the layout of the CNN's input layer in such a way that
not only is adaptable with the CNN schemes but represents fundamental motion characteristics of
a moving object including speed, acceleration, jerk, and bearing rate. Furthermore, we ameliorate
the quality of GPS logs through several data preprocessing steps. Using the clean input layer, a
variety of CNN configurations are evaluated to achieve the best CNN architecture. The highest accuracy
of 84.8% has been achieved through the ensemble of the best CNN configuration. In this research,
we contrast our methodology with traditional machine learning algorithms as well as the seminal
and most related studies to demonstrate the superiority of our framework.
