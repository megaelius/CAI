A primary indicator of success in the fight against COVID-19 is avoiding stress on critical care
infrastructure and services (CCIS). However, CCIS will likely remain stressed until sustained
herd immunity is built. There are also secondary considerations for success: mitigating economic
damage; curbing the spread of misinformation, improving morale, and preserving a sense of control;
building global trust for diplomacy, trade and travel; and restoring reliability and normalcy
to day-to-day life, among others. We envision technology plays a pivotal role. Here, we focus on
the effective use of readily available technology to improve the primary and secondary success
criteria for the fight against SARS-CoV-2. In a multifaceted technology approach, we start with
effective technology use for remote patient monitoring (RPM) of COVID-19 with the following objectives:
1. Deploy readily available technology for continuous real-time remote monitoring of patient
vitals with the help of biosensors on a large scale. 2. Effective and safe remote large-scale communitywide
care of low-severity cases as a buffer against surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations to reduce strain
on critical care services and emergency hospitals. 3. Improve the patient, their family, and their
community's sense of control and morale. 4. Propose a clear technology and medical definition of
remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 to address an urgent technology need; address obfuscated,
narrow, and erroneous information and provide examples; and urge publishers to be clear and complete
in their disclosures. 5. Leverage the cloud-based distributed cognitive RPM platform for community
leaders and decision makers to enable planning and resource management, pandemic research, damage
prevention and containment, and receiving feedback on strategies and executions.
