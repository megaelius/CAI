Treatment of patients with obstructive coronary artery disease is guided by the functional significance
of a coronary artery stenosis. Fractional flow reserve (FFR), measured during invasive coronary
angiography (ICA), is considered the gold standard to define the functional significance of a coronary
stenosis. Here, we present a method for non-invasive detection of patients with functionally significant
coronary artery stenosis, combining analysis of the coronary artery tree and the left ventricular
(LV) myocardium in cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) images. We retrospectively collected CCTA scans
of 126 patients who underwent invasive FFR measurements, to determine the functional significance
of coronary stenoses. We combine our previous works for the analysis of the complete coronary artery
tree and the LV myocardium: Coronary arteries are encoded by two disjoint convolutional autoencoders
(CAEs) and the LV myocardium is characterized by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a CAE.
Thereafter, using the extracted encodings of all coronary arteries and the LV myocardium, patients
are classified according to the presence of functionally significant stenosis, as defined by the
invasively measured FFR. To handle the varying number of coronary arteries in a patient, the classification
is formulated as a multiple instance learning problem and is performed using an attention-based
neural network. Cross-validation experiments resulted in an average area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve of $0.74 \pm 0.01$, and showed that the proposed combined analysis outperformed
the analysis of the coronary arteries or the LV myocardium only. The results demonstrate the feasibility
of combining the analyses of the complete coronary artery tree and the LV myocardium in CCTA images
for the detection of patients with functionally significant stenosis in coronary arteries.
