New sources of citation data have recently become available, such as Microsoft Academic, Dimensions,
and the OpenCitations Index of CrossRef open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI). Although these have
been compared to the Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, or Google Scholar, there is no systematic evidence
of their differences across subject categories. In response, this paper investigates 3,073,351
citations found by these six data sources to 2,515 English-language highly-cited documents published
in 2006 from 252 subject categories, expanding and updating the largest previous study. Google
Scholar found 88% of all citations, many of which were not found by the other sources, and nearly all
citations found by the remaining sources (89%-94%). A similar pattern held within most subject
categories. Microsoft Academic is the second largest overall (60% of all citations), including
82% of Scopus citations and 86% of Web of Science citations. In most categories, Microsoft Academic
found more citations than Scopus and WoS (182 and 223 subject categories, respectively), but had
coverage gaps in some areas, such as Physics and some Humanities categories. After Scopus, Dimensions
is fourth largest (54% of all citations), including 84% of Scopus citations and 88% of WoS citations.
It found more citations than Scopus in 36 categories, more than WoS in 185, and displays some coverage
gaps, especially in the Humanities. Following WoS, COCI is the smallest, with 28% of all citations.
Google Scholar is still the most comprehensive source. In many subject categories Microsoft Academic
and Dimensions are good alternatives to Scopus and WoS in terms of coverage.
