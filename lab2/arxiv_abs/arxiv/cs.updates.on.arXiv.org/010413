A new mathematical method for the dynamic analysis of nonlinear compartmental systems in the context
of ecology has recently been developed by the author and was presented in a separate article. Based
on this methodology, multiple new dynamic ecological system measures and indices of matrix, vector,
and scalar types are systematically introduced in the present paper. These mathematical system
analysis tools are quantitative ecological indicators that monitor the flow distribution and
storage organization, quantify the direct, indirect, acyclic, cycling, and transfer (diact)
effect and utility of one compartment directly or indirectly on another, identify the system efficiency
and stress, measure the compartmental exposure to system flows, determine the residence time and
compartmental activity levels, and ascertain the restoration time and resilience in the case of
disturbances. The proposed dynamic system measures and indices, thus, extract detailed information
about ecosystems' characteristics, as well as their functions, properties, behaviors, and various
other system attributes that are potentially hidden in and even obscured by data. A dynamic technique
for the quantitative characterization and classification of main interspecific interactions
and the determination of their strength within food webs is also developed based on the diact effect
and utility indices. Moreover, major concepts and quantities in the current static network analyses
are also extended to nonlinear dynamic settings and integrated with the proposed dynamic measures
and indices in this unifying mathematical framework. Therefore, the proposed methodology enables
a holistic view and analysis of ecological systems.
