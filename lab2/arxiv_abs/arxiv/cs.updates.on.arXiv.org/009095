Parareal and multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT) are two popular parallel-in-time algorithms.
The idea of both algorithms is to combine the (fine-grid) time-stepping scheme of interest with
a ``coarse-grid'' time-integration scheme that approximates several steps of the fine-grid time-stepping
method. Convergence of Parareal and MGRIT has been studied in a number of papers. Research on the
optimality of both methods, however, is limited, with results existing only for specific time-integration
schemes. This paper focuses on analytically showing $h_x$- and $h_t$-independent convergence
of two-level Parareal and MGRIT, for linear problems of the form $\mathbf{u}'(t) + \mathcal{L}\mathbf{u}(t)
= f(t)$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is symmetric positive definite and Runge-Kutta time integration
is used. The analysis is based on recently derived tight bounds of two-level Parareal and MGRIT convergence
that allow for analyzing arbitrary coarse- and fine-grid time integration schemes, coarsening
factors, and time-step sizes. The theory presented in this paper shows that not all Runge-Kutta
schemes are equal from the perspective of parallel-in-time. Some schemes, particularly L-stable
methods, offer significantly better convergence than others. On the other hand, some schemes do
not obtain $h$-optimal convergence, and two-level convergence is restricted to certain parameter
regimes. In certain cases, an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor change in time step $h_t$ can be the difference
between convergence factors $\rho\approx0.02$ and divergence! Numerical results confirm the
analysis in the practical setting and, in particular, emphasize the importance of a priori analysis
in choosing an effective coarse-grid scheme and coarsening factor. A Mathematica notebook to perform
a priori two-grid analysis is available at https://github.com/XBraid/xbraid-convergence-est.
