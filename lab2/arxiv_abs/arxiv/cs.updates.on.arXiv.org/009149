This paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm for distributed fusion in a sensor network
in which multi-Bernoulli (MB) filters are locally running in every sensor node for multi-target
tracking. The generalized Covariance Intersection (GCI) fusion rule is employed to fuse multiple
MB random finite set densities. The fused density comprises a set of fusion hypotheses that grow
exponentially with the number of Bernoulli components. Thus, GCI fusion with MB filters can become
computationally intractable in practical applications that involve tracking of even a moderate
number of objects. In order to accelerate the multi-sensor fusion procedure, we derive a theoretically
sound approximation to the fused density. The number of fusion hypotheses in the resulting density
is significantly smaller than the original fused density. It also has a parallelizable structure
that allows multiple clusters of Bernoulli components to be fused independently. By carefully
clustering Bernoulli components into isolated clusters using the GCI divergence as the distance
metric, we propose an alternative to build exactly the approximated density without exhaustively
computing all the fusion hypotheses. The combination of the proposed approximation technique
and the fast clustering algorithm can enable a novel and fast GCIMB fusion implementation. Our analysis
shows that the proposed fusion method can dramatically reduce the computational and memory requirements
with small bounded L1-error. The Gaussian mixture implementation of the proposed method is also
presented. In various numerical experiments, including a challenging scenario with up to forty
objects, the efficacy of the proposed fusion method is demonstrated.
