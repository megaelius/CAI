The increasing popularity of social media has attracted a huge number of people to participate in
numerous activities on a daily basis. This results in tremendous amounts of rich user-generated
data. This data provides opportunities for researchers and service providers to study and better
understand users' behaviors and further improve the quality of the personalized services. Publishing
user-generated data risks exposing individuals' privacy. Users privacy in social media is an emerging
task and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. These works study privacy issues in
social media from the two different points of views: identification of vulnerabilities, and mitigation
of privacy risks. Recent research has shown the vulnerability of user-generated data against the
two general types of attacks, identity disclosure and attribute disclosure. These privacy issues
mandate social media data publishers to protect users' privacy by sanitizing user-generated data
before publishing it. Consequently, various protection techniques have been proposed to anonymize
user-generated social media data. There is a vast literature on privacy of users in social media
from many perspectives. In this survey, we review the key achievements of user privacy in social
media. In particular, we review and compare the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the privacy
leakage attacks and anonymization algorithms. We overview the privacy risks from different aspects
of social media and categorize the relevant works into five groups 1) graph data anonymization and
de-anonymization, 2) author identification, 3) profile attribute disclosure, 4) user location
and privacy, and 5) recommender systems and privacy issues. We also discuss open problems and future
research directions for user privacy issues in social media.
