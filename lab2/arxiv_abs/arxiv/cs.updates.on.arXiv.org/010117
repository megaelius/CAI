Background: While machine learning (ML) models are rapidly emerging as promising screening tools
in critical care medicine, the identification of homogeneous subphenotypes within populations
with heterogeneous conditions such as pediatric sepsis may facilitate attainment of high-predictive
performance of these prognostic algorithms. This study is aimed to identify subphenotypes of pediatric
sepsis and demonstrate the potential value of partitioned data/subtyping-based training. Methods:
This was a retrospective study of clinical data extracted from medical records of 6,446 pediatric
patients that were admitted at a major hospital system in the DC area. Vitals and labs associated
with patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for sepsis were used to perform latent profile analysis.
Modern ML algorithms were used to explore the predictive performance benefits of reduced training
data heterogeneity via label profiling. Results: In total 134 (2.1%) patients met the diagnostic
criteria for sepsis in this cohort and latent profile analysis identified four profiles/subphenotypes
of pediatric sepsis. Profiles 1 and 3 had the lowest mortality and included pediatric patients from
different age groups. Profile 2 were characterized by respiratory dysfunction; profile 4 by neurological
dysfunction and highest mortality rate (22.2%). Machine learning experiments comparing the predictive
performance of models derived without training data profiling against profile targeted models
suggest statistically significant improved performance of prediction can be obtained. For example,
area under ROC curve (AUC) obtained to predict profile 4 with 24-hour data (AUC = .998, p < .0001) compared
favorably with the AUC obtained from the model considering all profiles as a single homogeneous
group (AUC = .918) with 24-hour data.
