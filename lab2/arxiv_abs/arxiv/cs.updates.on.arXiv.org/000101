SYNTAGMA is a grammar-based parsing system, structured on two levels: a general grammar and a language-specific
grammar. The general grammar is implemented in the program; language-specific grammars are resources
conceived as text files which contain a lexical database with meaning-related grammatical features,
a description of constituent structures, a meaning-specific syntactical constraints database
and a semantic network. Since its theoretical background is principally Tesni\`ere's \'El\'ements
de syntaxe, SYNTAGMA's grammar emphasizes the role of argument structure (valency) in constraint
satisfaction, and allows also horizontal bounds, for instance treating coordination, which constitutes
a significant difference in respect to most Dependency Parsing theories. Notions such as traces,
empty categories are derived from Generative Grammar and some solutions are close to Government
& Binding Theory, although they come from an autonomous research. These proprieties allows
SYNTAGMA to easily manage complex syntactic configurations and well known weak points in parsing
engineering. An important resource is the semantic network, which is used by the SYNTAGMA in disambiguation
tasks. In contrast to statistical and data driven systems, the system's behavior may be controlled
and fine tuned, since gaps, traces and long-term relations are structurally set and its constituent
generation process is not a linear left-to-right shift and reduce, but a bottom-up, rule driven
procedure. Keywords: natural language processing, grammar-based parsing, dependency parsing,
