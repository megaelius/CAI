Given a directed graph $G$ and a pair of nodes $s$ and $t$, an \emph{$s$-$t$ bridge} of $G$ is an edge
whose removal breaks all $s$-$t$ paths of $G$ (and thus appears in all $s$-$t$ paths). Computing
all $s$-$t$ bridges of $G$ is a basic graph problem, solvable in linear time. In this paper, we consider
a natural generalisation of this problem, with the notion of "safety" from bioinformatics. We say
that a walk $W$ is \emph{safe} with respect to a set $\mathcal{W}$ of $s$-$t$ walks, if $W$ is a subwalk
of all walks in $\mathcal{W}$. We start by considering the maximal safe walks when $\mathcal{W}$
consists of: all $s$-$t$ paths, all $s$-$t$ trails, or all $s$-$t$ walks of $G$. We show that the first
two problems are immediate linear-time generalisations of finding all $s$-$t$ bridges, while
the third problem is more involved. In particular, we show that there exists a compact representation
computable in linear time, that allows outputting all maximal safe walks in time linear in their
length. We further generalise these problems, by assuming that safety is defined only with respect
to a subset of \emph{visible} edges. Here we prove a dichotomy between the $s$-$t$ paths and $s$-$t$
trails cases, and the $s$-$t$ walks case: the former two are NP-hard, while the latter is solvable
with the same complexity as when all edges are visible. We also show that the same complexity results
hold for the analogous generalisations of \emph{$s$-$t$ articulation points} (nodes appearing
in all $s$-$t$ paths). We thus obtain the best possible results for natural "safety"-generalisations
of these two fundamental graph problems. Moreover, our algorithms are simple and do not employ any
complex data structures, making them ideal for use in practice.
