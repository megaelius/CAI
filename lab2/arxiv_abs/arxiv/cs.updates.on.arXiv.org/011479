Machine learning models have made many decision support systems to be faster, more accurate and
more efficient. However, applications of machine learning in network security face more disproportionate
threat of active adversarial attacks compared to other domains. This is because machine learning
applications in network security such as malware detection, intrusion detection, and spam filtering
are by themselves adversarial in nature. In what could be considered an arms race between attackers
and defenders, adversaries constantly probe machine learning systems with inputs which are explicitly
designed to bypass the system and induce a wrong prediction. In this survey, we first provide a taxonomy
of machine learning techniques, styles, and algorithms. We then introduce a classification of
machine learning in network security applications. Next, we examine various adversarial attacks
against machine learning in network security and introduce two classification approaches for
adversarial attacks in network security. First, we classify adversarial attacks in network security
based on a taxonomy of network security applications. Secondly, we categorize adversarial attacks
in network security into a problem space vs. feature space dimensional classification model. We
then analyze the various defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning-based network
security applications. We conclude by introducing an adversarial risk model and evaluate several
existing adversarial attacks against machine learning in network security using the risk model.
We also identify where each attack classification resides within the adversarial risk model
