Food is very essential for human life and it is fundamental to the human experience. Food-related
study may support multifarious applications and services, such as guiding the human behavior,
improving the human health and understanding the culinary culture. With the rapid development
of social networks, mobile networks, and Internet of Things (IoT), people commonly upload, share,
and record food images, recipes, cooking videos, and food diaries, leading to large-scale food
data. Large-scale food data offers rich knowledge about food and can help tackle many central issues
of human society. Therefore, it is time to group several disparate issues related to food computing.
Food computing acquires and analyzes heterogenous food data from disparate sources for perception,
recognition, retrieval, recommendation, and monitoring of food. In food computing, computational
approaches are applied to address food related issues in medicine, biology, gastronomy and agronomy.
Both large-scale food data and recent breakthroughs in computer science are transforming the way
we analyze food data. Therefore, vast amounts of work has been conducted in the food area, targeting
different food-oriented tasks and applications. However, there are very few systematic reviews,
which shape this area well and provide a comprehensive and in-depth summary of current efforts or
detail open problems in this area. In this paper, we formalize food computing and present such a comprehensive
overview of various emerging concepts, methods, and tasks. We summarize key challenges and future
directions ahead for food computing. This is the first comprehensive survey that targets the study
of computing technology for the food area and also offers a collection of research studies and technologies
to benefit researchers and practitioners working in different food-related fields.
