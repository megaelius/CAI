In this paper we consider the problem of mixed-criticality (MC) scheduling of implicit-deadline
sporadic task systems on a homogenous multiprocessor platform. Focusing on dual-criticality
systems, algorithms based on the fluid scheduling model have been proposed in the past. These algorithms
use a dual-rate execution model for each high-criticality task depending on the system mode. Once
the system switches to the high-criticality mode, the execution rates of such tasks are increased
to meet their increased demand. Although these algorithms are speed-up optimal, they are unable
to schedule several feasible dual-criticality task systems. This is because a single fixed execution
rate for each high-criticality task after the mode switch is not efficient to handle the high variability
in demand during the transition period immediately following the mode switch. This demand variability
exists as long as the carry-over jobs of high-criticality tasks, that is jobs released before the
mode switch, have not completed. Addressing this shortcoming, we propose a multi-rate fluid execution
model for dual-criticality task systems in this paper. Under this model, high-criticality tasks
are allocated varying execution rates in the transition period after the mode switch to efficiently
handle the demand variability. We derive a sufficient schedulability test for the proposed model
and show its dominance over the dual-rate fluid execution model. Further, we also present a speed-up
optimal rate assignment strategy for the multi-rate model, and experimentally show that the proposed
model outperforms all the existing MC scheduling algorithms with known speed-up bounds.
