Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are designed to assist clinicians in various tasks, including
highlighting abnormal regions in a medical image. A common approach consists in training a voxel-level
binary classifier on a set of feature vectors extracted from normal and pathological areas in patients'
scans. However, many pathologies (such as epilepsy) are characterized by lesions that may be located
anywhere in the brain, have various shapes, sizes and texture. An adequate representation of such
a heterogeneity requires a significant amount of annotated data which is a major issue in the medical
domain. Therefore, we built on a previously proposed approach that considers epilepsy lesion detection
task as a voxel-level outlier detection problem. It consists in building a oc-SVM classifier for
each voxel in the brain volume using a small number of clinically-guided features El Azami et al.,
2016. Our goal in this study is to make a step forward by replacing the handcrafted features with automatically
learnt representations using neural networks. We propose a novel version of siamese networks trained
on patches extracted from healthy patients' scans only. This network, composed of stacked autoencoders
as subnetworks, is regularized by the reconstruction error of the patches. It is designed to learn
representations that bring patches centered at the same voxel localization 'closer' with respect
to the chosen metric (i.e. cosine). Finally, the middle layer representations of the subnetworks
are fed to oc-SVM classifiers at voxel-level. The method is validated on 3 patients' MRI scans with
confirmed epilepsy lesions and shows a promising performance.
