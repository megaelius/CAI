Detailed knowledge about the electrical power consumption in industrial production environments
is a prerequisite to reduce and optimize their power consumption. Today's industrial production
sites are equipped with a variety of sensors that, inter alia, monitor electrical power consumption
in detail. However, these environments often lack an automated data collation and analysis. We
present a system architecture that integrates different sensors and analyzes and visualizes the
power consumption of devices, machines, and production plants. It is designed with a focus on scalability
to support production environments of various sizes and to handle varying loads. We argue that a
scalable architecture in this context must meet requirements for fault tolerance, extensibility,
real-time data processing, and resource efficiency. As a solution, we propose a microservice-based
architecture augmented by big data and stream processing techniques. Applying the fog computing
paradigm, parts of it are deployed in an elastic, central cloud while other parts run directly, decentralized
in the production environment. A prototype implementation of this architecture presents solutions
how different kinds of sensors can be integrated and their measurements can be continuously aggregated.
In order to make analyzed data comprehensible, it features a single-page web application that provides
different forms of data visualization. We deploy this pilot implementation in the data center of
a medium-sized enterprise, where we successfully monitor the power consumption of 16~servers.
Furthermore, we show the scalability of our architecture with 20,000~simulated sensors.
