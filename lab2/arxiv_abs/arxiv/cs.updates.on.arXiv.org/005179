The lane keeping assistance system (LKAS), a representative of the advanced driver assistance
system (ADAS), comprises a shared control that cooperates with the driver to achieve a common goal.
The experience of the driver through the steering wheel may vary significantly depending on the
steering control strategy of the system. In this study, we examine how driving experience changes
according to various steering control strategies. Based on the preliminary study and typical LKAS
parameters, nine control strategies (3 torque amounts (TOR) x 3 deviations to start control (DEV))
were designed as a prototype. Eighteen participants participated in evaluating each strategy
in a highway environment provided by a driving simulator. Two-way repeated measure ANOVA was used
to assess the effects of the system. Both the objective measures (standard deviation of lane position,
steering reversal rate, and root mean square of lateral speed) and subjective measures (pleasure
and arousal of emotion, trust, disturbance, and satisfaction) are analyzed. The experimental
results demonstrate that all dependent measures are significant. As the TOR increased, SDLP decreased.
However, no difference is observed between the 2-Nm and 3-Nm TOR in terms of trust and satisfaction.
The high disturbance and negative emotion in 3 Nm appear to be the cause. In terms of the DEV, the high
level of the root mean square of the lateral speed is observed at 0.8 m. Further, negative effects
are found in pleasure, trust, and satisfaction. There is little difference at all dependent measures
between 0.0-m and 0.4-m DEV. In the regression model analyzed from the aspect of satisfaction, the
2.32-Nm TOR and 0.27-m DEV are the optimal values. We expect our research on shared steering control
with an assistance system to be applied to the experience design of a lateral semi-autonomous vehicle.
