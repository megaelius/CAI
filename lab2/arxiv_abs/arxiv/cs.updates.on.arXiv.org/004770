Multispectral imaging is an important technique for improving the readability of written or printed
text where the letters have faded, either due to deliberate erasing or simply due to the ravages of
time. Often the text can be read simply by looking at individual wavelengths, but in some cases the
images need further enhancement to maximise the chances of reading the text. There are many possible
enhancement techniques and this paper assesses and compares an extended set of dimensionality
reduction methods for image processing. We assess 15 dimensionality reduction methods in two different
manuscripts. This assessment was performed both subjectively by asking the opinions of scholars
who were experts in the languages used in the manuscripts which of the techniques they preferred
and also by using the Davies-Bouldin and Dunn indexes for assessing the quality of the resulted image
clusters. We found that the Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) method which was using a Matlab implementation
and we have used previously to enhance multispectral images, it was indeed superior to all the other
tested methods. However it is very likely that other approaches will be more suitable in specific
circumstance so we would still recommend that a range of these techniques are tried. In particular,
CVA is a supervised clustering technique so it requires considerably more user time and effort than
a non-supervised technique such as the much more commonly used Principle Component Analysis Approach
(PCA). If the results from PCA are adequate to allow a text to be read then the added effort required
for CVA may not be justified. For the purposes of comparing the computational times and the image
results, a CVA method is also implemented in C programming language and using the GNU (GNUs Not Unix)
Scientific Library (GSL) and the OpenCV (OPEN source Computer Vision) computer vision programming
library.
