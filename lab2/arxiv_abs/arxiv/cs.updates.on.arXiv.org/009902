Clients are increasingly looking for fast and effective means to quickly and frequently survey
and communicate the condition of their buildings so that essential repairs and maintenance work
can be done in a proactive and timely manner before it becomes too dangerous and expensive. Traditional
methods for this type of work commonly comprise of engaging building surveyors to undertake a condition
assessment which involves a lengthy site inspection to produce a systematic recording of the physical
condition of the building elements, including cost estimates of immediate and projected long-term
costs of renewal, repair and maintenance of the building. Current asset condition assessment procedures
are extensively time consuming, laborious, and expensive and pose health and safety threats to
surveyors, particularly at height and roof levels which are difficult to access. This paper aims
at evaluating the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) towards an automated detection
and localisation of key building defects, e.g., mould, deterioration, and stain, from images.
The proposed model is based on pre-trained CNN classifier of VGG-16 (later compaired with ResNet-50,
and Inception models), with class activation mapping (CAM) for object localisation. The challenges
and limitations of the model in real-life applications have been identified. The proposed model
has proven to be robust and able to accurately detect and localise building defects. The approach
is being developed with the potential to scale-up and further advance to support automated detection
of defects and deterioration of buildings in real-time using mobile devices and drones.
