Simple heuristics often show a remarkable performance in practice for optimization problems.
Worst-case analysis often falls short of explaining this performance. Because of this, "beyond
worst-case analysis" of algorithms has recently gained a lot of attention, including probabilistic
analysis of algorithms. The instances of many optimization problems are essentially a discrete
metric space. Probabilistic analysis for such metric optimization problems has nevertheless
mostly been conducted on instances drawn from Euclidean space, which provides a structure that
is usually heavily exploited in the analysis. However, most instances from practice are not Euclidean.
Little work has been done on metric instances drawn from other, more realistic, distributions.
Some initial results have been obtained by Bringmann et al. (Algorithmica, 2013), who have used
random shortest path metrics on complete graphs to analyze heuristics. The goal of this paper is
to generalize these findings to non-complete graphs, especially Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs.
A random shortest path metric is constructed by drawing independent random edge weights for each
edge in the graph and setting the distance between every pair of vertices to the length of a shortest
path between them with respect to the drawn weights. For such instances, we prove that the greedy
heuristic for the minimum distance maximum matching problem, the nearest neighbor and insertion
heuristics for the traveling salesman problem, and a trivial heuristic for the $k$-median problem
all achieve a constant expected approximation ratio. Additionally, we show a polynomial upper
bound for the expected number of iterations of the 2-opt heuristic for the traveling salesman problem.
