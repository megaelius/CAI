The majority of cancer treatments end in failure due to Intra-Tumor Heterogeneity (ITH). ITH in
cancer is represented by clonal evolution where different sub-clones compete with each other for
resources under conditions of Darwinian natural selection. Predicting the growth of these sub-clones
within a tumour is among the key challenges of modern cancer research. Predicting tumor behavior
enables the creation of risk profiles for patients and the optimisation of their treatment by therapeutically
targeting sub-clones more likely to grow. Current research efforts in this space are focused on
mathematical modelling of population genetics to quantify the selective advantage of sub-clones,
thus enabling predictions of which sub-clones are more likely to grow. These tumor evolution models
are based on assumptions which are not valid for real-world tumor micro-environment. Furthermore,
these models are often fit on a single instance of a tumor, and hence prediction models cannot be validated.
This paper presents an alternative approach for predicting cancer evolution using a data-driven
machine learning method. Our proposed method is based on the intuition that if we can capture the
true characteristics of sub-clones within a tumor and represent it in the form of features, a sophisticated
machine learning algorithm can be trained to predict its behavior. The work presented here provides
a novel approach to predicting cancer evolution, utilizing a data-driver approach. We strongly
believe that the accumulation of data from microbiologists, oncologists and machine learning
researchers could be used to encapsulate the true essence of tumor sub-clones, and can play a vital
role in selecting the best cancer treatments for patients.
