Social recommendation has emerged to leverage social connections among users for predicting users'
unknown preferences, which could alleviate the data sparsity issue in collaborative filtering
based recommendation. Early approaches relied on utilizing each user's first-order social neighbors'
interests for better user modeling and failed to model the social influence diffusion process from
the global social network structure. Recently, we propose a preliminary work of a neural influence
diffusion network (i.e., DiffNet) for social recommendation (Diffnet), which models the recursive
social diffusion process to capture the higher-order relationships for each user. However, we
argue that, as users play a central role in both user-user social network and user-item interest
network, only modeling the influence diffusion process in the social network would neglect the
users' latent collaborative interests in the user-item interest network. In this paper, we propose
DiffNet++, an improved algorithm of DiffNet that models the neural influence diffusion and interest
diffusion in a unified framework. By reformulating the social recommendation as a heterogeneous
graph with social network and interest network as input, DiffNet++ advances DiffNet by injecting
these two network information for user embedding learning at the same time. This is achieved by iteratively
aggregating each user's embedding from three aspects: the user's previous embedding, the influence
aggregation of social neighbors from the social network, and the interest aggregation of item neighbors
from the user-item interest network. Furthermore, we design a multi-level attention network that
learns how to attentively aggregate user embeddings from these three aspects. Finally, extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed
model.
