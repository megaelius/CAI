We introduce the Stellar decomposition, a model for efficient topological data structures over
a broad range of simplicial and cell complexes. A Stellar decomposition of a complex is a collection
of regions indexing the complex's vertices and cells such that each region has sufficient information
to locally reconstruct the star of its vertices, i.e., the cells incident in the region's vertices.
Stellar decompositions are general in that they can compactly represent and efficiently traverse
arbitrary complexes with a manifold or non-manifold domain They are scalable to complexes in high
dimension and of large size, and they enable users to easily construct tailored application-dependent
data structures using a fraction of the memory required by the corresponding topological data structure
on the global complex. As a concrete realization of this model for spatially embedded complexes,
we introduce the Stellar tree, which combines a nested spatial tree with a simple tuning parameter
to control the number of vertices in a region. Stellar trees exploit the complex's spatial locality
by reordering vertex and cell indices according to the spatial decomposition and by compressing
sequential ranges of indices. Stellar trees are competitive with state-of-the-art topological
data structures for manifold simplicial complexes and offer significant improvements for cell
complexes and non-manifold simplicial complexes. As a proxy for larger applications, we describe
how Stellar trees can be used to generate existing state-of-the-art topological data structures.
In addition to faster generation times, the reduced memory requirements of a Stellar tree enable
generating these data structures over large and high-dimensional complexes even on machines with
limited resources.
