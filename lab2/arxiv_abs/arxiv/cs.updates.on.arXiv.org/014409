Revenue maximization (RM) is one of the most important problems on online social networks (OSNs),
which attempts to find a small subset of users in OSNs that makes the expected revenue maximized.
It has been researched intensively before. However, most of exsiting literatures were based on
non-adaptive seeding strategy and on simple information diffusion model, such as IC/LT-model.
It considered the single influenced user as a measurement unit to quantify the revenue. Until Collaborate
Game model appeared, it considered activity as a basic object to compute the revenue. An activity
initiated by a user can only influence those users whose distance are within k-hop from the initiator.
Based on that, we adopt adaptive seed strategy and formulate the Revenue Maximization under the
Size Budget (RMSB) problem. If taking into account the product's promotion, we extend RMSB to the
Revenue Maximization under the Community Budget (RMCB) problem, where the influence can be distributed
over the whole network. The objective function of RMSB and RMCB is adatpive monotone and not adaptive
submodular, but in some special cases, it is adaptive submodular. We study the RMSB and RMCB problem
under both the speical submodular cases and general non-submodular cases, and propose RMSBSolver
and RMCBSolver to solve them with strong theoretical guarantees, respectively. Especially, we
give a data-dependent approximation ratio for RMSB problem under the general non-submodular cases.
Finally, we evaluate our proposed algorithms by conducting experiments on real datasets, and show
the effectiveness and accuracy of our solutions.
