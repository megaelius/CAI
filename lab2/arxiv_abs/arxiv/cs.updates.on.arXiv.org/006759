The extensive use of social media for sharing and obtaining information has resulted in the development
of topic detection models to facilitate the comprehension of the overwhelming amount of short and
distributed posts. Probabilistic topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and matrix
factorization based approaches such as Latent Semantic Analysis and Non-negative Matrix Factorization
represent topics as sets of terms that are useful for many automated processes. However, the determination
of what a topic is about is left as a further task. Alternatively, techniques that produce summaries
are human comprehensible, but less suitable for automated processing. This work proposes an approach
that utilizes Linked Open Data (LOD) resources to extract semantically represented topics from
collections of microposts. The proposed approach utilizes entity linking to identify the elements
of topics from microposts. The elements are related through co-occurrence graphs, which are processed
to yield topics. The topics are represented using an ontology that is introduced for this purpose.
A prototype of the approach is used to identify topics from 11 datasets consisting of more than one
million posts collected from Twitter during various events, such as the 2016 US election debates
and the death of Carrie Fisher. The characteristics of the approach with more than 5 thousand generated
topics are described in detail. The potentials of semantic topics in revealing information, that
is not otherwise easily observable, is demonstrated with semantic queries of various complexities.
A human evaluation of topics from 36 randomly selected intervals resulted in a precision of 81.0%
and F1 score of 93.3%. Furthermore, they are compared with topics generated from the same datasets
from an approach that produces human readable topics from micrblog post collections.
