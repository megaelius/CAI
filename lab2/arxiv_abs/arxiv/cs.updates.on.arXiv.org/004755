Self-assembly is a process which is ubiquitous in natural, especially biological systems. It occurs
when groups of relatively simple components spontaneously combine to form more complex structures.
While such systems have inspired a large amount of research into designing theoretical models of
self-assembling systems, and even laboratory-based implementations of them, these artificial
models and systems often tend to be lacking in one of the powerful features of natural systems (e.g.
the assembly and folding of proteins), namely the dynamic reconfigurability of structures. In
this paper, we present a new mathematical model of self-assembly, based on the abstract Tile Assembly
Model (aTAM), called the Flexible Tile Assembly Model (FTAM). In the FTAM, the individual components
are 2-dimensional square tiles as in the aTAM, but in the FTAM, bonds between the edges of tiles can
be flexible, allowing bonds to flex and entire structures to reconfigure, thus allowing 2-dimensional
components to form 3-dimensional structures. We analyze the powers and limitations of FTAM systems
by (1) demonstrating how flexibility can be controlled to carefully build desired structures,
and (2) showing how flexibility can be beneficially harnessed to form structures which can "efficiently"
reconfigure into many different configurations and/or greatly varying configurations. We also
show that with such power comes a heavy burden in terms of computational complexity of simulation
and prediction by proving that, for important properties of FTAM systems, determining their existence
is intractable, even for properties which are easily computed for systems in less dynamic models.
