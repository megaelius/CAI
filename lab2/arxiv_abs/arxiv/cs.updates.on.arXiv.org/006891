Rivest's seminal paper introduced the first All-Or-Nothing (AON) method transforming input data
into ciphertext in a way that the decryption of the input data is only possible when the ciphertext
is complete. The AON processing, when combined with data fragmentation and dispersal, protects
against an attacker that was able to acquire the encryption key but could not gather all of the data
fragments. The reinforcement in data protection comes at the cost of a significant decrease of performance
as Rivest's proposal requires at least two rounds of data encryption. Recently, a new scheme named
Bastion was introduced that protects fragmented data against key exposure using only a single round
of data encryption combined with a linear post-processing transform. In this paper, we make three
advancements in the state-of-the-art. First, we formulate a new security model for the all-or-nothing
processing that depends not on the amount of data acquired by the attacker but on the number of compromised
storage nodes. Second, we introduce the Circular All-Or-Nothing (CAON): an algorithm protecting
encrypted data against a situation of key exposure. It transforms, fragments, and disperses data
in a way that initial data is protected unless all of the storage nodes are compromised. It is faster
than the Bastion's scheme as it reduces the number of exclusive-or operations made in addition to
encryption by almost a half. We believe it can be integrated inside modern distributed storage systems
or multi-cloud data solutions in order to reinforce the confidentiality level of the stored data
at the cost of a very small, almost negligible, performance overhead. Third, we provide security
properties that are easy to formalize under standard cryptographic hypotheses.
