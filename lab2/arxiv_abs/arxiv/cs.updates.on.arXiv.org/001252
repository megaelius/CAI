Objective: To apply deep learning pose estimation algorithms for vision-based assessment of parkinsonism
and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Methods: Nine participants with Parkinson's disease
(PD) and LID completed a levodopa infusion protocol, where symptoms were assessed at regular intervals
using the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS). A state-of-the-art deep learning pose estimation method was used to extract movement
trajectories from videos of PD assessments. Features of the movement trajectories were used to
detect and estimate the severity of parkinsonism and LID using random forest. Communication and
drinking tasks were used to assess LID, while leg agility and toe tapping tasks were used to assess
parkinsonism. Feature sets from tasks were also combined to predict total UDysRS and UPDRS Part
III scores. Results: For LID, the communication task yielded the best results for dyskinesia (severity
estimation: r = 0.661, detection: AUC = 0.930). For parkinsonism, leg agility had better results
for severity estimation (r = 0.618), while toe tapping was better for detection (AUC = 0.773). UDysRS
and UPDRS Part III scores were predicted with r = 0.741 and 0.530, respectively. Conclusion: This
paper presents the first application of deep learning for vision-based assessment of parkinsonism
and LID and demonstrates promising performance for the future translation of deep learning to PD
clinical practices. Significance: The proposed system provides insight into the potential of
computer vision and deep learning for clinical application in PD.
