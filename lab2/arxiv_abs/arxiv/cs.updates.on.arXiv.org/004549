We present a straightforward procedure to evaluate the scientific contribution of territories
and institutions that combines the size-dependent geometric mean, Q, of the number of research
documents (N) and citations (C), and a scale-free measure of quality, q=C/N. We introduce a Global
Research Output (GRO-index) as the geometric mean of Q and q. We show that the GRO-index correlates
with the h-index, but appears to be more strongly correlated with other well known, widely used bibliometric
indicators. We also compute relative GRO-indexes (GROr) associated with the scientific production
within research fields. We note that although total sums of GROr values are larger than the GRO-index,
due to the non-linearity in the computation of the geometric means, both counts are nevertheless
highly correlated. That enables us to make useful comparative analyses among territories and institutions.
Furthermore, to identify strengths and weaknesses of a given country or institution, we compute
a Relative Research Output count (RROr-index) to tackle variations of the C/N ratio across research
fields. Moreover, by using a wealth-index also based on quantitative and qualitative variables,
we show that the GRO and RRO indexes are highly correlated with the wealth of the countries and the
states of the USA. Given the simplicity of the procedures introduced in this paper and the fact that
their results are easily understandable by non-specialists, we believe they could become as useful
for the assessment of the research output of countries and institutions as the impact factor is for
journals or the h-index for individuals.
