Efficient and accurate polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification
with a limited number of prior labels is always full of challenges. For general supervised deep learning
classification algorithms, the pixel-by-pixel algorithm achieves precise yet inefficient classification
with a small number of labeled pixels, whereas the pixel mapping algorithm achieves efficient yet
edge-rough classification with more prior labels required. To take efficiency, accuracy and prior
labels into account, we propose a novel pixel-refining parallel mapping network in the complex
domain named CRPM-Net and the corresponding training algorithm for PolSAR image classification.
CRPM-Net consists of two parallel sub-networks: a) A transfer dilated convolution mapping network
in the complex domain (C-Dilated CNN) activated by a complex cross-convolution neural network
(Cs-CNN), which is aiming at precise localization, high efficiency and the full use of phase information;
b) A complex domain encoder-decoder network connected parallelly with C-Dilated CNN, which is
to extract more contextual semantic features. Finally, we design a two-step algorithm to train
the Cs-CNN and CRPM-Net with a small number of labeled pixels for higher accuracy by refining misclassified
labeled pixels. We verify the proposed method on AIRSAR and E-SAR datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate that CRPM-Net achieves the best classification results and substantially outperforms
some latest state-of-the-art approaches in both efficiency and accuracy for PolSAR image classification.
