In [1], we have explored the theoretical aspects of feature selection and evolutionary algorithms.
In this chapter, we focus on optimization algorithms for enhancing data analytic process, i.e.,
we propose to explore applications of nature-inspired algorithms in data science. Feature selection
optimization is a hybrid approach leveraging feature selection techniques and evolutionary algorithms
process to optimize the selected features. Prior works solve this problem iteratively to converge
to an optimal feature subset. Feature selection optimization is a non-specific domain approach.
Data scientists mainly attempt to find an advanced way to analyze data n with high computational
efficiency and low time complexity, leading to efficient data analytics. Thus, by increasing generated/measured/sensed
data from various sources, analysis, manipulation and illustration of data grow exponentially.
Due to the large scale data sets, Curse of dimensionality (CoD) is one of the NP-hard problems in data
science. Hence, several efforts have been focused on leveraging evolutionary algorithms (EAs)
to address the complex issues in large scale data analytics problems. Dimension reduction, together
with EAs, lends itself to solve CoD and solve complex problems, in terms of time complexity, efficiently.
In this chapter, we first provide a brief overview of previous studies that focused on solving CoD
using feature extraction optimization process. We then discuss practical examples of research
studies are successfully tackled some application domains, such as image processing, sentiment
analysis, network traffics / anomalies analysis, credit score analysis and other benchmark functions/data
sets analysis.
