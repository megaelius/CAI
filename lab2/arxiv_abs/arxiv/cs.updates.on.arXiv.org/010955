The popular social media platforms are now making it possible for scholarly articles to be shared
rapidly in different forms, which in turn can significantly improve the visibility and reach of
articles. Many authors are now utilizing the social media platforms to disseminate their scholarly
articles (often as pre- or post- prints) beyond the paywalls of journals. It is however not very well
established if the level of social media coverage and attention of scholarly articles is same across
all research disciplines or there exist discipline-wise variations. This paper aims to explore
the disciplinary variations in coverage and altmetric attention by analyzing a significantly
large amount of data from Web of Science and Altmetric.com. Results obtained show interesting patterns.
Medical Sciences and Biology are found to account for more than 50% of all instances in Altmetrics.
In terms of coverage, disciplines like Biology, Medical Science and Multidisciplinary Sciences
have more than 60% of their articles covered in Altmetrics, whereas disciplines like Engineering,
Mathematics and Material Science have less than 25% of their articles covered in Altmetrics. The
coverage percentages further vary across different altmetric platforms, with Twitter and Mendeley
having much higher overall coverage than Facebook and News. Disciplinary variations in coverage
are also found in different altmetric platforms, with variations as large as 7.5% for Engineering
discipline to 55.7% for Multidisciplinary in Twitter. The paper also looks into the possible role
of source of publication in altmetric coverage level of articles. Interestingly, some journals
are found to have a higher altmetric coverage in comparison to the average altmetric coverage level
of that discipline.
