The application of deep learning to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging
in Parkinson's disease shows effectively high diagnosis accuracy. However, difficulties in model
interpretation were occurred due to the complexity of the deep learning model. Although several
interpretation methods were created to show the attention map that contains important features
of the input data, it is still uncertain whether these methods can be applied in PD diagnosis. Four
different models of the deep learning approach based on 3-dimensional convolution neural network
(3D-CNN) of well-established architectures have been trained with an accuracy up to 95-96% in classification
performance. These four models have been used as the comparative study for well-known interpretation
methods. Generally, radiologists interpret SPECT images by confirming the shape of the I123-Ioflupane
uptake in the striatal nuclei. To evaluate the interpretation performance, the segmented striatal
nuclei of SPECT images are chosen as the ground truth. Results suggest that guided backpropagation
and SHAP which were developed recently, provided the best interpretation performance. Guided
backpropagation has the best performance to generate the attention map that focuses on the location
of striatal nuclei. On the other hand, SHAP surpasses other methods in suggesting the change of the
striatal nucleus uptake shape from healthy to PD subjects. Results from both methods confirm that
3D-CNN focuses on the striatal nuclei in the same way as the radiologist, and both methods should
be suggested to increase the credibility of the model.
