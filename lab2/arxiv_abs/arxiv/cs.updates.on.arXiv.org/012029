In this paper, we show that the Minimum Spanning Tree problem can be solved \emph{deterministically},
in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ rounds of the $\mathsf{Congested}$ $\mathsf{Clique}$ model. In the $\mathsf{Congested}$
$\mathsf{Clique}$ model, there are $n$ players that perform computation in synchronous rounds.
Each round consist of a phase of local computation and a phase of communication, in which each pair
of players is allowed to exchange $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ bit messages. The studies of this model
began with the MST problem: in the paper by Lotker et al.[SPAA'03, SICOMP'05] that defines the $\mathsf{Congested}$
$\mathsf{Clique}$ model the authors give a deterministic $\mathcal{O}(\log \log n)$ round algorithm
that improved over a trivial $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ round adaptation of Bor\r{u}vka's algorithm.
There was a sequence of gradual improvements to this result: an $\mathcal{O}(\log \log \log n)$
round algorithm by Hegeman et al. [PODC'15], an $\mathcal{O}(\log^* n)$ round algorithm by Ghaffari
and Parter, [PODC'16] and an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ round algorithm by Jurdzi\'nski and Nowicki, [SODA'18],
but all those algorithms were randomized, which left the question about the existence of any deterministic
$o(\log \log n)$ round algorithms for the Minimum Spanning Tree problem open. Our result resolves
this question and establishes that $\mathcal{O}(1)$ rounds is enough to solve the MST problem in
the $\mathsf{Congested}$ $\mathsf{Clique}$ model, even if we are not allowed to use any randomness.
Furthermore, the amount of communication needed by the algorithm makes it applicable to some variants
of the $\mathsf{MPC}$ model.
