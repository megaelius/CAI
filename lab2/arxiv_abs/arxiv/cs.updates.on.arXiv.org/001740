We introduce a conceptual framework and an interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, reconstruct
the dynamics and produce generating mechanisms of dynamic systems from observations based on the
evolution and contribution of each of the system's components to their overall algorithmic complexity
by exploiting principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus
consists in finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how
its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards
and away from randomness. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches to infer principles
and provide theoretical expectations of the effects of perturbations. We find that the algorithmic
information landscape of a system's degree of freedom runs in parallel to its dynamic space-time
evolution providing a path to move systems on the algorithmic information landscape having effects
on the system's dynamics landscape. Based on these causal methods, we advance methods for reprogramming
a system that do not require the full knowledge or access to the system's actual kinetic equations
or probability distributions. This new dimension provides a suite of powerful parameter-free
algorithms of wide applicability ranging from causal discovery, dimension reduction, feature
selection, model generation, maximal randomness principle analysis and system's (re)programmability.
We apply these methods to static and evolving genetic regulatory networks demonstrating the identification
of key elements (genes) related to cell function and cell development conforming with the literature
and biological knowledge demonstrating how the method can reshape a system's dynamics in a controlled
manner by directly manipulating first principles and generating mechanisms of the systems in question.
