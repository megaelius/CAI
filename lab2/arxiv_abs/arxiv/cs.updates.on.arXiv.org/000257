Collective classification has been intensively studied due to its impact in many important applications,
such as web mining, bioinformatics and citation analysis. Collective classification approaches
exploit the dependencies of a group of linked objects whose class labels are correlated and need
to be predicted simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on studying the collective classification
problem in heterogeneous networks, which involves multiple types of data objects interconnected
by multiple types of links. Intuitively, two objects are correlated if they are linked by many paths
in the network. However, most existing approaches measure the dependencies among objects through
directly links or indirect links without considering the different semantic meanings behind different
paths. In this paper, we study the collective classification problem taht is defined among the same
type of objects in heterogenous networks. Moreover, by considering different linkage paths in
the network, one can capture the subtlety of different types of dependencies among objects. We introduce
the concept of meta-path based dependencies among objects, where a meta path is a path consisting
a certain sequence of linke types. We show that the quality of collective classification results
strongly depends upon the meta paths used. To accommodate the large network size, a novel solution,
called HCC (meta-path based Heterogenous Collective Classification), is developed to effectively
assign labels to a group of instances that are interconnected through different meta-paths. The
proposed HCC model can capture different types of dependencies among objects with respect to different
meta paths. Empirical studies on real-world networks demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed
meta path-based collective classification approach.
