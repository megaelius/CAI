Quantum error-correcting codes are used to protect qubits involved in quantum computation. This
process requires logical operators, acting on protected qubits, to be translated into physical
operators (circuits) acting on physical quantum states. We propose a mathematical framework for
synthesizing physical circuits that implement logical Clifford operators for stabilizer codes.
Circuit synthesis is enabled by representing the desired physical Clifford operator in $\mathbb{C}^{N
\times N}$ as a partial $2m \times 2m$ binary symplectic matrix, where $N = 2^m$. We state and prove
two theorems that use symplectic transvections to efficiently enumerate all binary symplectic
matrices that satisfy a system of linear equations. As a corollary of these results, we prove that
for an $[\![ m,k ]\!]$ stabilizer code every logical Clifford operator has $2^{r(r+1)/2}$ symplectic
solutions, where $r = m-k$, up to stabilizer degeneracy. The desired physical circuits are then
obtained by decomposing each solution into a product of elementary symplectic matrices, that correspond
to elementary circuits. This enumeration of all physical realizations enables optimization over
the ensemble with respect to a suitable metric. Furthermore, we show that any circuit that normalizes
the stabilizer of the code can be transformed into a circuit that centralizes the stabilizer, while
realizing the same logical operation. Our method of circuit synthesis can be applied to any stabilizer
code, and this paper discusses a proof of concept synthesis for the $[\![ 6,4,2 ]\!]$ CSS code. Programs
implementing the algorithms in this paper, which includes routines to solve for binary symplectic
solutions of general linear systems and our overall LCS (logical circuit synthesis) algorithm,
