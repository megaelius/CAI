Most optimization problems are notoriously hard. Considerable efforts must be spent in obtaining
an optimal solution to certain instances that we encounter in the real world scenarios. Often it
turns out that input instances get modified locally in some small ways due to changes in the application
world. The natural question here is, given an optimal solution for an old instance $I_O$, can we construct
an optimal solution for the new instance $I_N$, where $I_N$ is the instance $I_O$ with some local
modifications. Reoptimization of NP-hard optimization problem precisely addresses this concern.
It turns out that for some reoptimization versions of the NP-hard problems, we may only hope to obtain
an approximate solution to a new instance. In this paper, we specifically address the reoptimization
of path vertex cover problem. The objective in $k$-$path$ vertex cover problem is to compute a minimum
subset $S$ of the vertices in a graph $G$ such that after removal of $S$ from $G$ there is no path with
$k$ vertices in the graph. We show that when a constant number of vertices are inserted, reoptimizing
unweighted $k$-$path$ vertex cover problem admits a PTAS. For weighted $3$-$path$ vertex cover
problem, we show that when a constant number of vertices are inserted, the reoptimization algorithm
achieves an approximation factor of $1.5$, hence an improvement from known $2$-approximation
algorithm for the optimization version. We provide reoptimization algorithm for weighted $k$-$path$
vertex cover problem $(k \geq 4)$ on bounded degree graphs, which is also an NP-hard problem. Given
a $\rho$-approximation algorithm for $k$-$path$ vertex cover problem on bounded degree graphs,
we show that it can be reoptimized within an approximation factor of $(2-\frac{1}{\rho})$ under
constant number of vertex insertions.
