Aperiodic metamaterials represent a class of structural systems that are composed of different
building blocks (cells), instead of a self-repeating chain of the same unit cells. Optimizing aperiodic
cellular structural systems thus presents high-dimensional problems that are challenging to
solve using purely high-fidelity structural optimization approaches. Specialized analytical
modeling along with metamodel based optimization can provide a more tractable alternative solution
approach. To this end, this paper presents a design automation framework applied to a 1D metamaterial
system, namely a drill string, where vibration suppression is of utmost importance. The drill string
comprises a set of nonuniform rings attached to the outer surface of a longitudinal rod. As such,
the resultant system can now be perceived as an aperiodic 1D metamaterial with each ring/gap representing
a cell. Despite being a 1D system, the simultaneous consideration of multiple DoF (i.e., torsional,
axial, and lateral motions) poses significant computational challenges. Therefore, a transfer
matrix method (TMM) is employed to analytically determine the frequency response of the drill string.
A suite of neural networks (ANN) is trained on TMM samples (which present minute-scale computing
costs per evaluation), to model the frequency response. ANN-based optimization is then performed
to minimize mass subject to constraints on the gap between consecutive resonance peaks in one case,
and minimizing this gap in the second case, leading to crucial improvements over baselines. Further
novel contribution occurs through the development of an inverse modeling approach that can instantaneously
produce the 1D metamaterial design with minimum mass for a given desired non-resonant frequency
range. This is accomplished by using invertible neural networks, and results show promising alignment
with forward solutions.
