For most algorithms dealing with sets of points in the plane, the only relevant information carried
by the input is the combinatorial configuration of the points: the orientation of each triple of
points in the set (clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear). This information is called the
order type of the point set. In the dual, realizable order types and abstract order types are combinatorial
analogues of line arrangements and pseudoline arrangements. Too often in the literature we analyze
algorithms in the real-RAM model for simplicity, putting aside the fact that computers as we know
them cannot handle arbitrary real numbers without some sort of encoding. Encoding an order type
by the integer coordinates of some realizing point set is known to yield doubly exponential coordinates
in some cases. Other known encodings can achieve quadratic space or fast orientation queries, but
not both. In this contribution, we give a compact encoding for abstract order types that allows efficient
query of the orientation of any triple: the encoding uses O(n^2) bits and an orientation query takes
O(log n) time in the word-RAM model. This encoding is space-optimal for abstract order types. We
show how to shorten the encoding to O(n^2 (loglog n)^2 / log n) bits for realizable order types, giving
the first subquadratic encoding for those order types with fast orientation queries. We further
refine our encoding to attain O(log n/loglog n) query time without blowing up the space requirement.
In the realizable case, we show that all those encodings can be computed efficiently. Finally, we
generalize our results to the encoding of point configurations in higher dimension.
