In this article we start from the observation that REST services are the most used as tools of interoperability
and orchestration in the Internet of Things (IoT). But REST does not make it possible to inject artificial
intelligence into connected objects, ie it cannot allow autonomy and decision-making by the objects
themselves. To define an intelligence to a connected object, one can use a Beleive Desire Intention
agent (BDI an intelligent agent that adopts human behavior) such as Jason Agentspeak. But Jason
AgentSpeak does not guarantee orchestration or choreography between connected objects. There
are platforms for service orchestration and choreography in IoT, still the interconnection with
artificial intelligence needs to be built. In this article, we propose a new approach called Jason-RS.
It is a result of pairing Jason BDI agent with the web service technologies to exploit the agent capacity
as a service, Jason-RS turn in Java SE and it does not need any middleware. The architecture that we
propose allows to create the link between Artificial Intelligence and Services choreography to
reduce human intervention in the service choreography. In order to validate the proposed approach,
we have interconnected the Iot BeC 3 platform and the REST agent (Jason-RS). The decision-making
faculty offered by Jason-RS is derived from the information sent by the objects according to the
different methods of REST (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) that Jason-RS offers. As a result, the objects
feed the inter-agent collaborations and decision-making inside the agent. Finally, we show that
Jason-RS allows the Web of Objects to power complex systems such as an artificial intelligence responsible
for processing data. This performance is promising.
