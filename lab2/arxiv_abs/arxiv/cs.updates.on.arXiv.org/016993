Deep learning methods are being increasingly used for urban traffic prediction where spatiotemporal
traffic data is aggregated into sequentially organized matrices that are then fed into convolution-based
residual neural networks. However, the widely known modifiable areal unit problem within such
aggregation processes can lead to perturbations in the network inputs. This issue can significantly
destabilize the feature embeddings and the predictions, rendering deep networks much less useful
for the experts. This paper approaches this challenge by leveraging unit visualization techniques
that enable the investigation of many-to-many relationships between dynamically varied multi-scalar
aggregations of urban traffic data and neural network predictions. Through regular exchanges
with a domain expert, we design and develop a visual analytics solution that integrates 1) a Bivariate
Map equipped with an advanced bivariate colormap to simultaneously depict input traffic and prediction
errors across space, 2) a Morans I Scatterplot that provides local indicators of spatial association
analysis, and 3) a Multi-scale Attribution View that arranges non-linear dot plots in a tree layout
to promote model analysis and comparison across scales. We evaluate our approach through a series
of case studies involving a real-world dataset of Shenzhen taxi trips, and through interviews with
domain experts. We observe that geographical scale variations have important impact on prediction
performances, and interactive visual exploration of dynamically varying inputs and outputs benefit
experts in the development of deep traffic prediction models.
