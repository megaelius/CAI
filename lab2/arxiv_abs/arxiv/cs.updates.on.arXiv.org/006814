As mobile devices become more and more popular, mobile gaming has emerged as a promising market with
billion-dollar revenues. A variety of mobile game platforms and services have been developed around
the world. A critical challenge for these platforms and services is to understand the churn behavior
in mobile games, which usually involves churn at micro level (between an app and a specific user)
and macro level (between an app and all its users). Accurate micro-level churn prediction and macro-level
churn ranking will benefit many stakeholders such as game developers, advertisers, and platform
operators. In this paper, we present the first large-scale churn analysis for mobile games that
supports both micro-level churn prediction and macro-level churn ranking. For micro-level churn
prediction, in view of the common limitations of the state-of-the-art methods built upon traditional
machine learning models, we devise a novel semi-supervised and inductive embedding model that
jointly learns the prediction function and the embedding function for user-app relationships.
We model these two functions by deep neural networks with a unique edge embedding technique that
is able to capture both contextual information and relationship dynamics. We also design a novel
attributed random walk technique that takes into consideration both topological adjacency and
attribute similarities. To address macro-level churn ranking, we propose to construct a relationship
graph with estimated micro-level churn probabilities as edge weights and adapt link analysis algorithms
on the graph. We devise a simple algorithm SimSum and adapt two more advanced algorithms PageRank
and HITS. The performance of our solutions for the two-level churn analysis problems is evaluated
on real-world data collected from the Samsung Game Launcher platform.
