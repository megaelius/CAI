Personal cryptographic keys are the foundation of many secure services, but storing these keys
securely is a challenge, especially if they are used from multiple devices. Storing keys in a centralized
location, like an Internet-accessible server, raises serious security concerns (e.g. server
compromise). Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a well-known solution
for protecting sensitive data in untrusted environments, and are now becoming available on commodity
server platforms. Although the idea of protecting keys using a server-side TEE is straight-forward,
in this paper we validate this approach and show that it enables new desirable functionality. We
describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a TEE-based Cloud Key Store (CKS), an online
service for securely generating, storing, and using personal cryptographic keys. Using remote
attestation, users receive strong assurance about the behaviour of the CKS, and can authenticate
themselves using passwords while avoiding typical risks of password-based authentication like
password theft or phishing. In addition, this design allows users to i) define policy-based access
controls for keys; ii) delegate keys to other CKS users for a specified time and/or a limited number
of uses; and iii) audit all key usages via a secure audit log. We have implemented a proof of concept
CKS using Intel SGX and integrated this into GnuPG on Linux and OpenKeychain on Android. Our CKS implementation
performs approximately 6,000 signature operations per second on a single desktop PC. The latency
is in the same order of magnitude as using locally-stored keys, and 20x faster than smart cards.
