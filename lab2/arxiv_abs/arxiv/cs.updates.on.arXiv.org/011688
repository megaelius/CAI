The inability of conventional electronic architectures to efficiently solve large combinatorial
problems motivates the development of novel computational hardware. There has been much effort
recently toward developing novel, application-specific hardware, across many different fields
of engineering, such as integrated circuits, memristors, and photonics. However, unleashing
the true potential of such novel architectures requires the development of featured algorithms
which optimally exploit their fundamental properties. We here present the Photonic Recurrent
Ising Sampler (PRIS), a heuristic method tailored for parallel architectures that allows for fast
and efficient sampling from distributions of combinatorially hard Ising problems. Since the PRIS
relies essentially on vector-to-fixed matrix multiplications, we suggest the implementation
of the PRIS in photonic parallel networks, which realize these operations at an unprecedented speed.
The PRIS provides sample solutions to the ground state of arbitrary Ising models, by converging
in probability to their associated Gibbs distribution. By running the PRIS at various noise levels,
we probe the critical behavior of universality classes and their critical exponents. In addition
to the attractive features of photonic networks, the PRIS relies on intrinsic dynamic noise and
eigenvalue dropout to find ground states more efficiently. Our work suggests speedups in heuristic
methods via photonic implementations of the PRIS. We also hint at a broader class of (meta)heuristic
algorithms derived from the PRIS, such as combined simulated annealing on the noise and eigenvalue
dropout levels. Our algorithm can also be implemented in a competitive manner on fast parallel electronic
hardware, such as FPGAs and ASICs.
