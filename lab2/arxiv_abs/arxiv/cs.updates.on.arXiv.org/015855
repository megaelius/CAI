Traditional techniques for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security design either treat the cyber
and physical systems independently, or do not address the specific vulnerabilities of real time
embedded controllers and networks used to monitor and control physical processes. In this work,
we develop and test an integrated model-based approach for CPS security risk assessment utilizing
a CPS testbed with real-world industrial controllers and communication protocols. The testbed
monitors and controls an exothermic Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) simulated in real-time.
CSTR is a fundamental process unit in many industries, including Oil \& Gas, Petrochemicals, Water
treatment, and nuclear industry. In addition, the process is rich in terms of hazardous scenarios
that could be triggered by cyber attacks due to the lack of possible mechanical protection. The paper
presents an integrated approach to analyze and design the cyber security system for a given CPS where
the physical threats are identified first to guide the risk assessment process. A mathematical
model is derived for the physical system using a hybrid automaton to enumerate potential hazardous
states of the system. The cyber system is then analyzed using network and data flow models to develop
the attack scenarios that may lead to the identified hazards. Finally, the attack scenarios are
performed on the testbed and observations are obtained on the possible ways to prevent and mitigate
the attacks. The insights gained from the experiments result in several key findings, including
the expressive power of hybrid automaton in security risk assessment, the hazard development time
and its impact on cyber security design, and the tight coupling between the physical and the cyber
systems for CPS that requires an integrated design approach to achieve cost-effective and secure
designs.
