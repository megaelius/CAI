Objective: The efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments of western medicine
diseases relies heavily on the proper sub-classification of the patients from the TCM perspective
in a process known as syndrome differentiation. We develop an evidence-based method, called the
latent tree analysis, for solving the sub-classification problem where definitions of patient
subclasses and classification rules are established based on patterns detected in clinic symptom
data. Methods: The approach starts with a survey of patients with a western medicine disease where
information about symptoms and signs of interest to TCM is collected. The data are analyzed using
latent tree models to reveal symptom co-occurrence/mutual-exclusion patterns, which are represented
by latent variables. The patterns are then used to perform clustering analysis of the patients.
The resulting patient clusters are used to define patient subclasses and to establish classification
rules. Results: The approach is illustrated using a data set about vascular mild cognitive impairment
that involves 803 patients and 93 symptoms. A latent tree model with 31 latent variables is obtained.
The patients are clustered based on a combination of eight of latent variables that are related to
qi deficiency. A quantitative definition of the qi deficiency subclass and the associated classification
rule are established. Conclusions: An evidence-based approach to TCM syndrome classification
is presented. The approach can be used to answer the following questions about a western medicine
disease: What TCM syndrome subclasses are there among the patients with the disease? What are the
sizes of the subclasses? What are the statistical characteristics of each subclass? How can we determine
whether a particular patient belongs to a specific subclass?
