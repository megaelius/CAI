Phase retrieval refers to the problem of recovering a signal $\mathbf{x}_{\star}\in\mathbb{C}^n$
from its phaseless measurements $y_i=|\mathbf{a}_i^{\mathrm{H}}\mathbf{x}_{\star}|$, where
$\{\mathbf{a}_i\}_{i=1}^m$ are the measurement vectors. Many popular phase retrieval algorithms
are based on the following two-step procedure: (i) initialize the algorithm based on a spectral
method, (ii) refine the initial estimate by a local search algorithm (e.g., gradient descent).
The quality of the spectral initialization step can have a major impact on the performance of the
overall algorithm. In this paper, we focus on the model where the measurement matrix $\mathbf{A}=[\mathbf{a}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{a}_m]^{\mathrm{H}}$
has orthonormal columns, and study the spectral initialization under the asymptotic setting $m,n\to\infty$
with $m/n\to\delta\in(1,\infty)$. We use the expectation propagation framework to characterize
the performance of spectral initialization for Haar distributed matrices. Our numerical results
confirm that the predictions of the EP method are accurate for not-only Haar distributed matrices,
but also for realistic Fourier based models (e.g. the coded diffraction model). The main findings
of this paper are the following: (1) There exists a threshold on $\delta$ (denoted as $\delta_{\mathrm{weak}}$)
below which the spectral method cannot produce a meaningful estimate. We show that $\delta_{\mathrm{weak}}=2$
for the column-orthonormal model. In contrast, previous results by Mondelli and Montanari show
that $\delta_{\mathrm{weak}}=1$ for the i.i.d. Gaussian model. (2) The optimal design for the
spectral method coincides with that for the i.i.d. Gaussian model, where the latter was recently
introduced by Luo, Alghamdi and Lu.
