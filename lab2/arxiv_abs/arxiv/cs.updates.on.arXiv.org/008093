Clinical researchers use disease progression modeling algorithms to predict future patient status
and characterize progression patterns. One approach for disease progression modeling is to describe
patient status using a small number of states that represent distinctive distributions over a set
of observed measures. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and its variants are a class of models that both
discover these states and make predictions concerning future states for new patients. HMMs can
be trained using longitudinal observations of subjects from large-scale cohort studies, clinical
trials, and electronic health records. Despite the advantages of using the algorithms for discovering
interesting patterns, it still remains challenging for medical experts to interpret model outputs,
complex modeling parameters, and clinically make sense of the patterns. To tackle this problem,
we conducted a design study with physician scientists, statisticians, and visualization experts,
with the goal to investigate disease progression pathways of certain chronic diseases, namely
type 1 diabetes (T1D), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). As a result, we introduce DPVis which seamlessly integrates model parameters and
outcomes of HMMs into interpretable, and interactive visualizations. In this study, we demonstrate
that DPVis is successful in evaluating disease progression models, visually summarizing disease
states, interactively exploring disease progression patterns, and designing and comparing clinically
relevant subgroup cohorts by introducing a case study on observation data from clinical studies
of T1D.
