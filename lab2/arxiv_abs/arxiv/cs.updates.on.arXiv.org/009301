Defects in requirements specifications can have severe consequences during the software development
lifecycle. Some of them result in overall project failure due to incorrect or missing quality characteristics
such as security. There are several concerns that make security difficult to deal with; for instance,
(1) when stakeholders discuss general requirements in (review) meetings, they are often not aware
that they should also discuss security-related topics, and (2) they typically do not have enough
security expertise. These concerns become even more challenging in agile development contexts,
where lightweight documentation is typically involved. The goal of this paper is to design and evaluate
an approach to support reviewing security-related aspects in agile requirements specifications
of web applications. The designed approach considers user stories and security specifications
as input and relates those user stories to security properties via Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques. Based on the related security properties, our approach then identifies high-level
security requirements from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to be verified and
generates a focused reading techniques to support reviewers in detecting detects. We evaluate
our approach via two controlled experiment trials, comparing the effectiveness and efficiency
of novice inspectors verifying security aspects in agile requirements using our reading technique
against using the complete list of OWASP high-level security requirements. The (statistically
significant) results indicate that using the reading technique has a positive impact (with very
large effect size) on the performance of inspectors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
