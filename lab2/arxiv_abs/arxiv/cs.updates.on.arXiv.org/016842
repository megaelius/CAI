This paper develops entropy stable (ES) adaptive moving mesh schemes for the 2D and 3D special relativistic
hydrodynamic (RHD) equations. They are built on the ES finite volume approximation of the RHD equations
in curvilinear coordinates, the discrete geometric conservation laws, and the mesh adaptation
implemented by iteratively solving the Euler-Lagrange equations of the mesh adaption functional
in the computational domain with suitably chosen monitor functions. First, a sufficient condition
is proved for the two-point entropy conservative (EC) flux, by mimicking the derivation of the continuous
entropy identity in curvilinear coordinates and using the discrete geometric conservation laws
given by the conservative metrics method. Based on such sufficient condition, the EC fluxes for
the RHD equations in curvilinear coordinates are derived and the second-order accurate semi-discrete
EC schemes are developed to satisfy the entropy identity for the given convex entropy pair. Next,
the semi-discrete ES schemes satisfying the entropy inequality are proposed by adding a suitable
dissipation term to the EC scheme and utilizing linear reconstruction with the minmod limiter in
the scaled entropy variables in order to suppress the numerical oscillations of the above EC scheme.
Then, the semi-discrete ES schemes are integrated in time by using the second-order strong stability
preserving explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Finally, several numerical results show that our 2D
and 3D ES adaptive moving mesh schemes effectively capture the localized structures, such as sharp
transitions or discontinuities, and are more efficient than their counterparts on uniform mesh.
