This paper continues the discussion of the representation of ontologies in the first-order logical
environment FOLE. According to Gruber, an ontology defines the primitives with which to model the
knowledge resources for a community of discourse. These primitives, consisting of classes, relationships
and properties, are represented by the entity-relationship-attribute ERA data model of Chen.
An ontology uses formal axioms to constrain the interpretation of these primitives. In short, an
ontology specifies a logical theory. A series of three papers by the author provide a rigorous mathematical
representation for the ERA data model in particular, and ontologies in general, within FOLE. The
first two papers, which provide a foundation and superstructure for FOLE, represent the formalism
and semantics of (many-sorted) first-order logic in a classification form corresponding to ideas
discussed in the Information Flow Framework (IFF). The third paper will define an interpretation
of FOLE in terms of the transformational passage, first described in (Kent, 2013), from the classification
form of first-order logic to an equivalent interpretation form, thereby defining the formalism
and semantics of first-order logical/relational database systems. Two papers will provide a precise
mathematical basis for FOLE interpretation: the current paper develops the notion of a FOLE relational
table following the relational model of Codd, and a follow-up paper will develop the notion of a FOLE
relational database. Both of these papers expand on material found in the paper (Kent, 2011). Although
the classification form follows the entity-relationship-attribute data model of Chen, the interpretation
form follows the relational data model of Codd. In general, the FOLE representation uses a conceptual
structures approach, that is completely compatible with formal concept analysis and information
flow.
