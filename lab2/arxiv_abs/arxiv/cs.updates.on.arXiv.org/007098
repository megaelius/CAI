Recent years have witnessed an increased focus on interpretability and the use of machine learning
to inform policy analysis and decision making. This paper applies machine learning to examine travel
behavior and, in particular, on modeling changes in travel modes when individuals are presented
with a novel (on-demand) mobility option. It addresses the following question: Can machine learning
be applied to model individual taste heterogeneity (preference heterogeneity for travel modes
and response heterogeneity to travel attributes) in travel mode choice? This paper first develops
a high-accuracy classifier to predict mode-switching behavior under a hypothetical Mobility-on-Demand
Transit system (i.e., stated-preference data), which represents the case study underlying this
research. We show that this classifier naturally captures individual heterogeneity available
in the data. Moreover, the paper derives insights on heterogeneous switching behaviors through
the generation of marginal effects and elasticities by current travel mode, partial dependence
plots, and individual conditional expectation plots. The paper also proposes two new model-agnostic
interpretation tools for machine learning, i.e., conditional partial dependence plots and conditional
individual partial dependence plots, specifically designed to examine response heterogeneity.
The results on the case study show that the machine-learning classifier, together with model-agnostic
interpretation tools, provides valuable insights on travel mode switching behavior for different
individuals and population segments. For example, the existing drivers are more sensitive to additional
pickups than people using other travel modes, and current transit users are generally willing to
share rides but reluctant to take any additional transfers.
