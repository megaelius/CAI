Sharing and working on sensitive data in distributed settings from healthcare to finance is a major
challenge due to security and privacy concerns. Secure multiparty computation (SMC) is a viable
panacea for this, allowing distributed parties to make computations while the parties learn nothing
about their data, but the final result. Although SMC is instrumental in such distributed settings,
it does not provide any guarantees not to leak any information about individuals to adversaries.
Differential privacy (DP) can be utilized to address this; however, achieving SMC with DP is not
a trivial task, either. In this paper, we propose a novel Secure Multiparty Distributed Differentially
Private (SM-DDP) protocol to achieve secure and private computations in a multiparty environment.
Specifically, with our protocol, we simultaneously achieve SMC and DP in distributed settings
focusing on linear regression on horizontally distributed data. That is, parties do not see each
others' data and further, can not infer information about individuals from the final constructed
statistical model. Any statistical model function that allows independent calculation of local
statistics can be computed through our protocol. The protocol implements homomorphic encryption
for SMC and functional mechanism for DP to achieve the desired security and privacy guarantees.
In this work, we first introduce the theoretical foundation for the SM-DDP protocol and then evaluate
its efficacy and performance on two different datasets. Our results show that one can achieve individual-level
privacy through the proposed protocol with distributed DP, which is independently applied by each
party in a distributed fashion. Moreover, our results also show that the SM-DDP protocol incurs
minimal computational overhead, is scalable, and provides security and privacy guarantees.
