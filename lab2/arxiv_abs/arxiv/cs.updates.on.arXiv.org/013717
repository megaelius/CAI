Collector's seals provide important clues about the ownership of a book. They contain much information
pertaining to the essential elements of ancient materials and also show the details of possession,
its relation to the book, the identity of the collectors and their social status and wealth, amongst
others. Asian collectors have typically used artistic ancient characters rather than modern ones
to make their seals. In addition to the owner's name, several other words are used to express more
profound meanings. A system that automatically recognizes these characters can help enthusiasts
and professionals better understand the background information of these seals. However, there
is a lack of training data and labelled images, as samples of some seals are scarce and most of them
are degraded images. It is necessary to find new ways to make full use of such scarce data. While these
data are available online, they do not contain information on the characters'position. The goal
of this research is to provide retrieval tools assist in obtaining more information from Asian collector's
seals imprints without consuming a lot of computational resources. In this paper, a character segmentation
method is proposed to predict the candidate characters'area without any labelled training data
that contain character coordinate information. A retrieval-based recognition system that focuses
on a single character is also proposed to support seal retrieval and matching. The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed character segmentation method performs well on Asian collector's
seals, with 92% of the test data being correctly segmented.
