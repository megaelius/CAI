Recommender systems are systems that are capable of offering the most suitable services and products
to users. Through specific methods and techniques, the recommender systems try to identify the
most appropriate items, such as types of information and goods and propose the closest to the user's
tastes. Collaborative filtering offering active user suggestions based on the rating of a set of
users is one of the simplest and most comprehensible and successful models for finding people in
the same tastes in the recommender systems. In this model, with increasing number of users and movie,
the system is subject to scalability. On the other hand, it is important to improve the performance
of the system when there is little information available on the ratings. In this paper, a movie hybrid
recommender system based on FNHSM_HRS structure using resource allocation approach called FCNHSMRA_HRS
is presented. The FNHSM_HRS structure was based on the heuristic similarity measure (NHSM), along
with fuzzy clustering. Using the fuzzy clustering method in the proposed system improves the scalability
problem and increases the accuracy of system suggestions. The proposed systems is based on collaborative
filtering and, by using the heuristic similarity measure and applying the resource allocation
approach, improves the performance, accuracy and precision of the system. The experimental results
using MAE, Accuracy, Precision and Recall metrics based on MovieLens dataset show that the performance
of the system is improved and the accuracy of recommendations in comparison of FNHSM_HRS and collaborative
filtering methods that use other similarity measures for finding similarity, is increased
