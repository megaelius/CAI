Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are the most popular kind of wireless Internet connection
because of their simplicity of deployment and operation. As a result, the number of devices accessing
the Internet through WLANs such as laptops, smartphones, or wearables, is increasing drastically
at the same time that applications' throughput requirements do. To cope with these challenges,
channel bonding (CB) techniques are used for enabling higher data rates by transmitting in wider
channels, thus increasing spectrum efficiency. However, important issues like higher potential
co-channel and adjacent channel interference arise when bonding channels. This may harm the performance
of the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol because of recurrent backoff freezing while
making nodes more sensitive to hidden node effects. In this paper, we address the following point
at issue: is it convenient for high-density (HD) WLANs to use wider channels and potentially overlap
in the spectrum? First, we highlight key aspects of DCB in toy scenarios through a continuous time
Markov network (CTMN) model. Then, by means of extensive simulations covering a wide range of traffic
loads and access point (AP) densities, we show that dynamic channel bonding (DCB) - which adapts
the channel bandwidth on a per-packet transmission - significantly outperforms traditional single-channel
on average. Nevertheless, results also corroborate that DCB is more prone to generate unfair situations
where WLANs may starve. Contrary to most of the current thoughts pushing towards non-overlapping
channels in HD deployments, we highlight the benefits of allocating channels as wider as possible
to WLANs altogether with implementing adaptive access policies to cope with the unfairness situations
that may appear.
