The rapid spread of the new pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has seriously threatened
global health. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is the tried-and-true polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), but PCR is a laborious, time-consuming and complicated manual process that is in
short supply. Deep learning based computer-aided screening, e.g., infection segmentation, is
thus viewed as an alternative due to its great successes in medical imaging. However, the publicly
available COVID-19 training data are limited, which would easily cause overfitting of traditional
deep learning methods that are usually data-hungry with millions of parameters. On the other hand,
fast training/testing and low computational cost are also important for quick deployment and development
of computer-aided COVID-19 screening systems, but traditional deep learning methods, especially
for image segmentation, are usually computationally intensive. To address the above problems,
we propose MiniSeg, a lightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation. Compared
with traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant strengths: i) it only
has 472K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii) it has high computational efficiency and
is thus convenient for practical deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their
private COVID-19 data for further improving performance. In addition, we build a comprehensive
COVID-19 segmentation benchmark for comparing MiniSeg with traditional methods. Code and models
will be released to promote the research and practical deployment for computer-aided COVID-19
screening.
