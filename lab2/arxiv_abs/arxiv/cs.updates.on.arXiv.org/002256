Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be applied to graph similarity matching, in which case
they are called graph CNNs. Graph CNNs are attracting increasing attention due to their effectiveness
and efficiency. However, the existing convolution approaches focus only on regular data forms
and require the transfer of the graph or key node neighborhoods of the graph into the same fixed form.
During this transfer process, structural information of the graph can be lost, and some redundant
information can be incorporated. To overcome this problem, we propose the disordered graph convolutional
neural network (DGCNN) based on the mixed Gaussian model, which extends the CNN by adding a preprocessing
layer called the disordered graph convolutional layer (DGCL). The DGCL uses a mixed Gaussian function
to realize the mapping between the convolution kernel and the nodes in the neighborhood of the graph.
The output of the DGCL is the input of the CNN. We further implement a backward-propagation optimization
process of the convolutional layer by which we incorporate the feature-learning model of the irregular
node neighborhood structure into the network. Thereafter, the optimization of the convolution
kernel becomes part of the neural network learning process. The DGCNN can accept arbitrary scaled
and disordered neighborhood graph structures as the receptive fields of CNNs, which reduces information
loss during graph transformation. Finally, we perform experiments on multiple standard graph
datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
in graph classification and retrieval.
