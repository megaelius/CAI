In this paper, we propose a new method for measuring the similarity between time-varying dynamical
financial networks. Specifically, we explore whether the proposed similarity measure can be employed
to understand the structural evolution of the financial networks with time. For a family of time-varying
financial networks with each vertex representing the individual time series of a stock and each
edge between a pair of time series representing their degree of correlation, we commence by computing
the commute time matrix for the network structures where each element of the matrix represents the
expected correlation value between pairwise stocks. For each network, we show how the commute time
matrix allows us to identify a reliable set of dominant correlated time series as well as an associated
dominant probability distribution of the stock belonging to this set. Furthermore, we represent
each original network as a dominant Shannon entropy time series computed from the dominant probability
distribution. With the dominant entropy time series for each pair of financial networks to hand,
we define the similarity measure based on the classical dynamic time warping framework, for analyzing
the financial time-varying networks. We show that the resulting similarity measure is positive
definite and therefore corresponds to a kernel measure on graphs. The proposed kernel bridges the
gap between graph kernels and the classical dynamic time warping framework for time series analysis.
Experiments on time-varying networks abstracted from New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) database
demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect abrupt changes in networks as time
series structures and can be used to characterize different stages in time-varying financial network
evolutions.
