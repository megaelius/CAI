Many countries are suffering from severe air pollution. Understanding how different air pollutants
accumulate and propagate is critical to making relevant public policies. In this paper, we use urban
big data (air quality data and meteorological data) to identify the \emph{spatiotemporal (ST)
causal pathways} for air pollutants. This problem is challenging because: (1) there are numerous
noisy and low-pollution periods in the raw air quality data, which may lead to unreliable causality
analysis, (2) for large-scale data in the ST space, the computational complexity of constructing
a causal structure is very high, and (3) the \emph{ST causal pathways} are complex due to the interactions
of multiple pollutants and the influence of environmental factors. Therefore, we present \emph{p-Causality},
a novel pattern-aided causality analysis approach that combines the strengths of \emph{pattern
mining} and \emph{Bayesian learning} to efficiently and faithfully identify the \emph{ST causal
pathways}. First, \emph{Pattern mining} helps suppress the noise by capturing frequent evolving
patterns (FEPs) of each monitoring sensor, and greatly reduce the complexity by selecting the pattern-matched
sensors as "causers". Then, \emph{Bayesian learning} carefully encodes the local and ST causal
relations with a Gaussian Bayesian network (GBN)-based graphical model, which also integrates
environmental influences to minimize biases in the final results. We evaluate our approach with
three real-world data sets containing 982 air quality sensors, in three regions of China from 01-Jun-2013
to 19-Dec-2015. Results show that our approach outperforms the traditional causal structure learning
methods in time efficiency, inference accuracy and interpretability.
