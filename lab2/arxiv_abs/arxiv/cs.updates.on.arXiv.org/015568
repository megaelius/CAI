Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of amendments that extend Ethernet to support distributed
safety-critical and real-time applications in the industrial automation, aerospace and automotive
areas. TSN integrates multiple traffic types and supports interactions in several combinations.
In this paper we consider the configuration supporting Scheduled Traffic (ST) traffic scheduled
based on Gate-Control-Lists (GCLs), Audio-Video-Bridging (AVB) traffic according to IEEE 802.1BA
that has bounded latencies, and Best-Effort (BE) traffic, for which no guarantees are provided.
The paper extends the timing analysis method to multiple AVB classes and proofs the credit bounds
for multiple classes of AVB traffic, respectively under frozen and non-frozen behaviors of credit
during guard band (GB). They are prerequisites for non-overflow credits of Credit-Based Shaper
(CBS) and preventing starvation of AVB traffic. Moreover, this paper proposes an improved timing
analysis method reducing the pessimism for the worst-case end-to-end delays of AVB traffic by considering
the limitations from the physical link rate and the output of CBS. Finally, we evaluate the improved
analysis method on both synthetic and real-world test cases, showing the significant reduction
of pessimism on latency bounds compared to related work, and presenting the correctness validation
compared with simulation results. We also compare the AVB latency bounds in the case of frozen and
non-frozen credit during GB. Additionally, we evaluate the scalability of our method with variation
of the load of ST flows and of the bandwidth reservation for AVB traffic.
