The StarLight program conceptualizes fast interstellar travel via small wafer satellites (wafersats)
that are propelled by directed energy. This process is wildly different from traditional space
travel and trades large and slow spacecraft for small, fast, inexpensive, and fragile ones. The
main goal of these wafer satellites is to gather useful images during their deep space journey. We
introduce and solve some of the main problems that accompany this concept. First, we need an object
detection system that can detect planets that we have never seen before, some containing features
that we may not even know exist in the universe. Second, once we have images of exoplanets, we need
a way to take these images and rank them by importance. Equipment fails and data rates are slow, thus
we need a method to ensure that the most important images to humankind are the ones that are prioritized
for data transfer. Finally, the energy on board is minimal and must be conserved and used sparingly.
No exoplanet images should be missed, but using energy erroneously would be detrimental. We introduce
simulator-based methods that leverage artificial intelligence, mostly in the form of computer
vision, in order to solve all three of these issues. Our results confirm that simulators provide
an extremely rich training environment that surpasses that of real images, and can be used to train
models on features that have yet to be observed by humans. We also show that the immersive and adaptable
environment provided by the simulator, combined with deep learning, lets us navigate and save energy
in an otherwise implausible way.
