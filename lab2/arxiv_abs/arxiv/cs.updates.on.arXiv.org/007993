QUIC is a secure transport protocol and aims to improve the performance of HTTPS traffic. It is a design
goal of QUIC to reduce the delay overhead of its connection establishment. However, an initial handshake
enforcing strict validation of the client's source address still requires two round-trips. QUIC
provides address validation tokens which allow saving a round-trip during the address validation
upon repeat connections. In this work, we extend the existing address validation mechanism by out-of-band
validation tokens. The proposed tokens allow sharing address validation between the QUIC server
and trusted entities issuing these tokens. This practice allows saving a round-trip time for the
address validation also during initial connection establishments. Furthermore, we introduce
distribution mechanisms for these tokens using DNS resolvers and QUIC connections to other hostnames.
We evaluate our proposal based on the duration of QUIC's connection establishment and find that
it can save up to 50% of the delay overhead of an initial handshake. Moreover, we analyze the benefit
of out-of-band validation tokens for popular websites. For this analysis, we assume a usual transatlantic
connection with a round-trip time of 90ms. We find that 100% of the connections required to retrieve
the investigated websites can save a round-trip time during their initial handshakes by deploying
our proposal. Furthermore, our results indicate that 363.6ms in total can be saved of all connections
that are required to retrieve an average website. Overall, we report huge performance improvements
for QUIC's connection establishment without compromising the user's privacy or communication
security.
