The multi-valued logic of {\L}ukasiewicz is a substructural logic that has been widely studied
and has many interesting properties. It is classical, in the sense that it admits the axiom schema
of double negation, [DNE]. However, our understanding of {\L}ukasiewicz logic can be improved
by separating its classical and intuitionistic aspects. The intuitionistic aspect of {\L}ukasiewicz
logic is captured in an axiom schema, [CWC], which asserts the commutativity of a weak form of conjunction.
This is equivalent to a very restricted form of contraction. We show how {\L}ukasiewicz Logic can
be viewed both as an extension of classical affine logic with [CWC], or as an extension of what we call
\emph{intuitionistic} {\L}ukasiewicz logic with [DNE], intuitionistic {\L}ukasiewicz logic
being the extension of intuitionistic affine logic by the schema [CWC]. At first glance, intuitionistic
affine logic seems very weak, but, in fact, [CWC] is surprisingly powerful, implying results such
as intuitionistic analogues of De Morgan's laws. However the proofs can be very intricate. We present
these results using derived connectives to clarify and motivate the proofs and give several applications.
We give an analysis of the applicability to these logics of the well-known methods that use negation
to translate classical logic into intuitionistic logic. The usual proofs of correctness for these
translations make much use of contraction. Nonetheless, we show that all the usual negative translations
are already correct for intuitionistic {\L}ukasiewicz logic, where only the limited amount of
contraction given by [CWC] is allowed. This is in contrast with affine logic for which we show, by
appeal to results on semantics proved in a companion paper, that both the Gentzen and the Glivenko
translations fail.
