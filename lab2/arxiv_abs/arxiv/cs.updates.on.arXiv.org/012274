Acquiring High Resolution (HR) Magnetic Resonance (MR) images requires the patient to remain still
for long periods of time, which causes patient discomfort and increases the probability of motion
induced image artifacts. A possible solution is to acquire low resolution (LR) images and to process
them with the Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) to create a super-resolved
version. This work applies SRGAN to MR images of the prostate and performs three experiments. The
first experiment explores improving the in-plane MR image resolution by factors of 4 and 8, and shows
that, while the PSNR and SSIM (Structural SIMilarity) metrics are lower than the isotropic bicubic
interpolation baseline, the SRGAN is able to create images that have high edge fidelity. The second
experiment explores anisotropic super-resolution via synthetic images, in that the input images
to the network are anisotropically downsampled versions of HR images. This experiment demonstrates
the ability of the modified SRGAN to perform anisotropic super-resolution, with quantitative
image metrics that are comparable to those of the anisotropic bicubic interpolation baseline.
Finally, the third experiment applies a modified version of the SRGAN to super-resolve anisotropic
images obtained from the through-plane slices of the volumetric MR data. The output super-resolved
images contain a significant amount of high frequency information that make them visually close
to their HR counterparts. Overall, the promising results from each experiment show that super-resolution
for MR images is a successful technique and that producing isotropic MR image volumes from anisotropic
slices is an achievable goal.
