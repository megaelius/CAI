The dot-depth hierarchy of Brzozowski and Cohen classifies the star-free languages of finite words.
By a theorem of McNaughton and Papert, these are also the first-order definable languages. The dot-depth
rose to prominence following the work of Thomas, who proved an exact correspondence with the quantifier
alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth hierarchy consists of
all languages that can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous
open problems in automata theory is to settle whether the membership problem is decidable for each
level: is it possible to decide whether an input regular language belongs to this level? Despite
a significant research effort, membership by itself has only been solved for low levels. A recent
breakthrough was achieved by replacing membership with a more general problem: separation. Given
two input languages, one has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated
level containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The motivation is that: (1) while
more difficult, separation is more rewarding (2) it provides a more convenient framework (3) all
recent membership algorithms are reductions to separation for lower levels. We present a separation
algorithm for dot-depth two. While this is our most prominent application, our result is more general.
We consider a family of hierarchies that includes the dot-depth: concatenation hierarchies. They
are built via a generic construction process. One first chooses an initial class, the basis, which
is the lowest level in the hierarchy. Further levels are built by applying generic operations. Our
main theorem states that for any concatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite, separation is decidable
for level one. In the special case of the dot-depth, this can be lifted to level two using previously
known results.
