We continue the investigation of polynomial-time sparsification for NP-complete Boolean Constraint
Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). The goal in sparsification is to reduce the number of constraints
in a problem instance without changing the answer, such that a bound on the number of resulting constraints
can be given in terms of the number of variables n. We investigate how the worst-case sparsification
size depends on the types of constraints allowed in the problem formulation (the constraint language).
Two algorithmic results are presented. The first result essentially shows that for any arity k,
the only constraint type for which no nontrivial sparsification is possible has exactly one falsifying
assignment, and corresponds to logical OR (up to negations). Our second result concerns linear
sparsification, that is, a reduction to an equivalent instance with O(n) constraints. Using linear
algebra over rings of integers modulo prime powers, we give an elegant necessary and sufficient
condition for a constraint type to be captured by a degree-1 polynomial over such a ring, which yields
linear sparsifications. The combination of these algorithmic results allows us to prove two characterizations
that capture the optimal sparsification sizes for a range of Boolean CSPs. For NP-complete Boolean
CSPs whose constraints are symmetric (the satisfaction depends only on the number of 1 values in
the assignment, not on their positions), we give a complete characterization of which constraint
languages allow for a linear sparsification. For Boolean CSPs in which every constraint has arity
at most three, we characterize the optimal size of sparsifications in terms of the largest OR that
can be expressed by the constraint language.
