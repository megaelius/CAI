This paper contributes to the theory of the modal $\mu$-calculus by proving some model-theoretic
results. More in particular, we discuss a number of semantic properties pertaining to formulas
of the modal $\mu$-calculus. For each of these properties we provide a corresponding syntactic
fragment,in the sense that a $\mu$-formula $\xi$ has the given property iff it is equivalent to a
formula $\xi'$ in the corresponding fragment. Since this formula $\xi'$ will always be effectively
obtainable from $\xi$, as a corollary, for each of the properties under discussion, we prove that
it is decidable in elementary time whether a given $\mu$-calculus formula has the property or not.
The properties that we study all concern the way in which the meaning of a formula $\xi$ in a model depends
on the meaning of a single, fixed proposition letter $p$. For example, consider a formula $\xi$ which
is monotone in $p$; such a formula a formula $\xi$ is called continuous (respectively, fully additive),
if in addition it satisfies the property that, if $\xi$ is true at a state $s$ then there is a finite
set (respectively, a singleton set) $U$ such that $\xi$ remains true at $s$ if we restrict the interpretation
of $p$ to the set $U$. Each of the properties that we consider is, in a similar way, associated with
one of the following special kinds of subset of a tree model: singletons, finite sets, finitely branching
subtrees, noetherian subtrees (i.e., without infinite paths), and branches. Our proofs for these
characterization results will be automata-theoretic in nature; we will see that the effectively
defined maps on formulas are in fact induced by rather simple transformations on modal automata.
Thus our results can also be seen as a contribution to the model theory of modal automata.
