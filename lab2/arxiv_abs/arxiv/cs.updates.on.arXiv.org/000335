Dynamics on networks refer to changes in the state of network nodes or links considering a static
topology. Dynamics of networks refer to changes in the topology of a network, without explicitly
modeling its underlying causes. Real networks often exhibit both types of dynamics, forming an
adaptive, or co-evolutionary, system in which the network topology and the state of nodes/links
affect each other in a feedback loop. In this paper we focus on the co-evolutionary dynamics of online
social networks, and on Twitter in particular. We show the presence of such co-evolutionary dynamics,
propose a model to capture the probability and timing of their occurrence, and discuss their importance
in terms of network structure and function. We focus on one specific form of co-evolutionary dynamics
in Twitter, namely the addition of new follower links as a result of retweets. Monitoring the activity
of thousands of Twitter users in almost real-time, and tracking their followers and tweets/retweets,
we collect data that allow the inference of such new retweet-driven follower relations. We show
that the formation of such relations is much more likely than the exogenous arrival of new followers
in the absence of any retweets. We identify the most significant factors in this effect, namely,
reciprocity and the number of retweets that a potential new follower receives in a given time interval.
Based on these findings, we create a model that captures the probability and timing of this type of
co-evolutionary dynamics in Twitter. Finally, we discuss the long-term implications of such co-evolutionary
dynamics on the topology and function of an online social network.
