The increasing popularity of JavaScript has led to a variety of JavaScript frameworks that aim to
help developers to address programming tasks. However, the JavaScript frameworks' number has
risen rapidly to thousands and more. It is challenging for practitioners to identify the frameworks
that best fit to their needs and to develop new ones fitting such needs. There is a lack of knowledge
regarding what drives developers towards the choice. This paper explores the factors and actors
that lead to a choice of a JavaScript framework. We conducted a qualitative interpretive study of
semi-structured interviews, analyzed and sampled using the grounded theory methodology. We interviewed
18 participants, chosen with judgmental sampling of decision makers regarding the JavaScript
framework selection, up to reaching theoretical saturation. We offer a model of desirable JavaScript
framework adoption factors. The factors are grouped into categories that are derived by the Unified
Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (Venkatesh et al., 2003). The factors are performance
expectancy (performance, size), effort expectancy (automatization, learnability, flexibility,
complexity, understandability), social influence (competitor analysis, collegial advice,
community size, community responsiveness), facilitating conditions (suitability, updates,
modularity, isolation, extensibility), and price value. A combination of four decision makers,
which are customer, developer, team, and team leader, leads to the choice. Our model contributes
to the body of knowledge related to technology adoption of software engineers. As a practical implication,
our model is useful for Web and framework developers.
