Many exciting robotic applications require multiple robots with many degrees of freedom, such
as manipulators, to coordinate their motion in a shared workspace. Discovering high-quality paths
in such scenarios can be achieved, in principle, by exploring the composite space of all robots.
Sampling-based planners do so by building a roadmap or a tree data structure in the corresponding
configuration space and can achieve asymptotic optimality. The hardness of motion planning, however,
renders the explicit construction of such structures in the composite space of multiple robots
impractical. This work proposes a scalable solution for such coupled multi-robot problems, which
provides desirable path-quality guarantees and is also computationally efficient. In particular,
the proposed \drrtstar\ is an informed, asymptotically-optimal extension of a prior sampling-based
multi-robot motion planner, \drrt. The prior approach introduced the idea of building roadmaps
for each robot and implicitly searching the tensor product of these structures in the composite
space. This work identifies the conditions for convergence to optimal paths in multi-robot problems,
which the prior method was not achieving. Building on this analysis, \drrt\ is first properly adapted
so as to achieve the theoretical guarantees and then further extended so as to make use of effective
heuristics when searching the composite space of all robots. The case where the various robots share
some degrees of freedom is also studied. Evaluation in simulation indicates that the new algorithm,
\drrtstar\, converges to high-quality paths quickly and scales to a higher number of robots where
various alternatives fail. This work also demonstrates the planner's capability to solve problems
involving multiple real-world robotic arms.
