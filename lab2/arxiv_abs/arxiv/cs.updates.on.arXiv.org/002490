This paper proposes a strategy for efficient geometrical verification in unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) image matching. First, considering the complex transformation model between correspondence
set in the image-space, feature points of initial candidate matches are projected onto an elevation
plane in the object-space, with assistant of UAV flight control data and camera mounting angles.
Spatial relationships are simplified as a 2D-translation in which a motion establishes the relation
of two correspondence points. Second, a hierarchical motion consistency constraint, termed HMCC,
is designed to eliminate outliers from initial candidate matches, which includes three major steps,
namely the global direction consistency constraint, the local direction-change consistency
constraint and the global length consistency constraint. To cope with scenarios with high outlier
ratios, the HMCC is achieved by using a voting scheme. Finally, an efficient geometrical verification
strategy is proposed by using the HMCC as a pre-processing step to increase inlier ratios before
the consequent application of the basic RANSAC algorithm. The performance of the proposed strategy
is verified through comprehensive comparison and analysis by using real UAV datasets captured
with different photogrammetric systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated
motions have noticeable separation ability, and the HMCC-RANSAC algorithm can efficiently eliminate
outliers based on the motion consistency constraint, with a speedup ratio reaching to 6 for oblique
UAV images. Even though the completeness sacrifice of approximately 7 percent of points is observed
from image orientation tests, competitive orientation accuracy is achieved from all used datasets.
For geometrical verification of both nadir and oblique UAV images, the proposed method can be a more
efficient solution.
