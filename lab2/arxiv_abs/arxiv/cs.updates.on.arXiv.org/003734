Problem: The involvement of external stakeholders in capstone projects and project courses is
desirable due to its potential positive effects on the students. Capstone projects particularly
profit from the inclusion of an industrial partner to make the project relevant and help students
acquire professional skills. In addition, an increasing push towards education that is aligned
with industry and incorporates industrial partners can be observed. However, the involvement
of external stakeholders in teaching moments can create friction and could, in the worst case, lead
to frustration of all involved parties. Contribution: We developed a model that allows analysing
the involvement of external stakeholders in university courses both in a retrospective fashion,
to gain insights from past course instances, and in a constructive fashion, to plan the involvement
of external stakeholders. Key Concepts: The conceptual model and the accompanying guideline guide
the teachers in their analysis of stakeholder involvement. The model is comprised of several activities
(define, execute, and evaluate the collaboration). The guideline provides questions that the
teachers should answer for each of these activities. In the constructive use, the model allows teachers
to define an action plan based on an analysis of potential stakeholders and the pedagogical objectives.
In the retrospective use, the model allows teachers to identify issues that appeared during the
project and their underlying causes. Drawing from ideas of the reflective practitioner, the model
contains an emphasis on reflection and interpretation of the observations made by the teacher and
other groups involved in the courses. Key Lessons: Applying the model retrospectively to a total
of eight courses shows that it is possible to reveal hitherto implicit risks and assumptions and
to gain a better insight into the interaction...
