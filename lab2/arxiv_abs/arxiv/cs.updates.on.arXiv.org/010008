The advancement of machine learning algorithms has opened a wide scope for vibration-based SHM
(Structural Health Monitoring). Vibration-based SHM is based on the fact that damage will alter
the dynamic properties viz., structural response, frequencies, mode shapes, etc of the structure.
The responses measured using sensors, which are high dimensional in nature, can be intelligently
analyzed using machine learning techniques for damage assessment. Neural networks employing
multilayer architectures are expressive models capable of capturing complex relationships between
input-output pairs but do not account for uncertainty in network outputs. A BNN (Bayesian Neural
Network) refers to extending standard networks with posterior inference. It is a neural network
with a prior distribution on its weights. Deep learning architectures like CNN (Convolutional
neural network) and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) are good candidates for representation learning
from high dimensional data. The advantage of using CNN over multi-layer neural networks is that
they are good feature extractors as well as classifiers, which eliminates the need for generating
hand-engineered features. LSTM networks are mainly used for sequence modeling. This paper presents
both a Bayesian multi-layer perceptron and deep learning-based approach for damage detection
and location identification in beam-like structures. Raw frequency response data simulated using
finite element analysis is fed as the input of the network. As part of this, frequency response was
generated for a series of simulations in the cantilever beam involving different damage scenarios.
This case study shows the effectiveness of the above approaches to predict bending rigidity with
an acceptable error rate.
