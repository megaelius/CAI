Through the quantification of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), health care monitoring
has the potential to stimulate vital and healthy ageing, inducing behavioural changes in older
people and linking these to personal health gains. To be able to measure PAEE in a monitoring environment,
methods from wearable accelerometers have been developed, however, mainly targeted towards younger
people. Since elderly subjects differ in energy requirements and range of physical activities,
the current models may not be suitable for estimating PAEE among the elderly. Because past activities
influence present PAEE, we propose a modeling approach known for its ability to model sequential
data, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To train the RNN for an elderly population, we used the
GOTOV dataset with 34 healthy participants of 60 years and older (mean 65 years old), performing
16 different activities. We used accelerometers placed on wrist and ankle, and measurements of
energy counts by means of indirect calorimetry. After optimization, we propose an architecture
consisting of an RNN with 3 GRU layers and a feedforward network combining both accelerometer and
participant-level data. In this paper, we describe our efforts to go beyond the standard facilities
of a GRU-based RNN, with the aim of achieving accuracy surpassing the state of the art. These efforts
include switching aggregation function from mean to dispersion measures (SD, IQR, ...), combining
temporal and static data (person-specific details such as age, weight, BMI) and adding symbolic
activity data as predicted by a previously trained ML model. The resulting architecture manages
to increase its performance by approximatelly 10% while decreasing training input by a factor of
10. It can thus be employed to investigate associations of PAEE with vitality parameters related
to metabolic and cognitive health and mental well-being.
