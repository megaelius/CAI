We study the impact that persistent memory has on the classical rendezvous problem of two mobile
computational entities, called robots, in the plane. It is well known that, without additional
assumptions, rendezvous is impossible if the entities are oblivious (i.e., have no persistent
memory) even if the system is semi-synchronous (SSynch). It has been recently shown that rendezvous
is possible even if the system is asynchronous (ASynch) if each robot is endowed with O(1) bits of
persistent memory, can transmit O(1) bits in each cycle, and can remember (i.e., can persistently
store) the last received transmission. This setting is overly powerful. In this paper we weaken
that setting in two different ways: (1) by maintaining the O(1) bits of persistent memory but removing
the communication capabilities; and (2) by maintaining the O(1) transmission capability and the
ability to remember the last received transmission, but removing the ability of an agent to remember
its previous activities. We call the former setting finite-state (FState) and the latter finite-communication
(FComm). Note that, even though its use is very different, in both settings, the amount of persistent
memory of a robot is constant. We investigate the rendezvous problem in these two weaker settings.
We model both settings as a system of robots endowed with visible lights: in FState, a robot can only
see its own light, while in FComm a robot can only see the other robot's light. We prove, among other
things, that finite-state robots can rendezvous in SSynch, and that finite-communication robots
are able to rendezvous even in ASynch. All proofs are constructive: in each setting, we present a
protocol that allows the two robots to rendezvous in finite time.
