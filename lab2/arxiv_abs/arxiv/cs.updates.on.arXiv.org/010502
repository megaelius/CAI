Purpose: This paper proposes a pipeline to acquire a scalar tapering measurement from the carina
to the most distal point of an individual airway visible on CT. We show the applicability of using
tapering measurements on clinically acquired data by quantifying the reproducibility of the tapering
measure. Methods: We generate a spline from the centreline of an airway to measure the area and arclength
at contiguous intervals. The tapering measurement is the gradient of the linear regression between
area in log space and arclength. The reproducibility of the measure was assessed by analysing different
radiation doses, voxel sizes and reconstruction kernel on single timepoint and longitudinal CT
scans and by evaluating the effct of airway bifurcations. Results: Using 74 airways from 10 CT scans,
we show a statistical difference, p = 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ in tapering between healthy airways
(n = 35) and those affected by bronchiectasis (n = 39). The difference between the mean of the two populations
was 0.011mm$^{-1}$ and the difference between the medians of the two populations was 0.006mm$^{-1}$.
The tapering measurement retained a 95\% confidence interval of $\pm$0.005mm$^{-1}$ in a simulated
25 mAs scan and retained a 95% confidence of $\pm$0.005mm$^{-1}$ on simulated CTs up to 1.5 times
the original voxel size. Conclusion: We have established an estimate of the precision of the tapering
measurement and estimated the effect on precision of simulated voxel size and CT scan dose. We recommend
that the scanner calibration be undertaken with the phantoms as described, on the specific CT scanner,
radiation dose and reconstruction algorithm that is to be used in any quantitative studies. Our
