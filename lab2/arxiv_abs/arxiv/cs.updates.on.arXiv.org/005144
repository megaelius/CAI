Label information plays an important role in supervised hyperspectral image classification problem.
However, current classification methods all ignore an important and inevitable problem---labels
may be corrupted and collecting clean labels for training samples is difficult, and often impractical.
Therefore, how to learn from the database with noisy labels is a problem of great practical importance.
In this paper, we study the influence of label noise on hyperspectral image classification, and
develop a random label propagation algorithm (RLPA) to cleanse the label noise. The key idea of RLPA
is to exploit knowledge (e.g., the superpixel based spectral-spatial constraints) from the observed
hyperspectral images and apply it to the process of label propagation. Specifically, RLPA first
constructs a spectral-spatial probability transfer matrix (SSPTM) that simultaneously considers
the spectral similarity and superpixel based spatial information. It then randomly chooses some
training samples as "clean" samples and sets the rest as unlabeled samples, and propagates the label
information from the "clean" samples to the rest unlabeled samples with the SSPTM. By repeating
the random assignment (of "clean" labeled samples and unlabeled samples) and propagation, we can
obtain multiple labels for each training sample. Therefore, the final propagated label can be calculated
by a majority vote algorithm. Experimental studies show that RLPA can reduce the level of noisy label
and demonstrates the advantages of our proposed method over four major classifiers with a significant
margin---the gains in terms of the average OA, AA, Kappa are impressive, e.g., 9.18%, 9.58%, and
0.1043. The Matlab source code is available at https://github.com/junjun-jiang/RLPA
