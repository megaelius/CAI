Mobile devices have shown to be very useful during and post disaster. If the communication infrastructure
breaks down, however, they become almost useless as most services rely on Internet connectivity.
Building post-disaster networks based purely on smartphones remains a challenging task, and,
as of today, no practical solutions exist. The rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) offers the
possibility to improve this situation. With an increase in smart spaces such as smart homes and smart
offices, we move towards digital cities that are deeply penetrated by IoT technology. Many IoT devices
are battery powered and can aid in mediating an emergency network. In scenarios where the electrical
grid is still operational, yet communication infrastructure failed, non-battery powered IoT
devices can similarly help to relief congestion or build a backup network in case of cyber attacks.
With the recent release of the Bluetooth Mesh standard, a common interface between mobile devices
and the IoT has become available. The key idea behind this standard is to allow existing and new devices
to build large-scale multi-hop sensor networks. By enabling hundreds of devices to communicate
with each other, Bluetooth Mesh (BT MESH) becomes a practical technical solution for enabling communication
post disaster. In this paper, we propose a novel emergency network concept that utilises the parts
of digital cities that remains operational in case of disaster, thus mediating large-scale post-disaster
device-to-device communication. Since the Bluetooth Mesh standard is backwards compatible to
Bluetooth 4.0, most of todays mobile devices can join such a network. No special hardware or software
modifications are necessary, especially no jail-breaking of the smartphones.
