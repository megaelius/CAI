The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives control of personal data back to the owners
by appointing higher requirements and obligations on service providers who manage and process
personal data. As the verification of GDPR-compliance, handled by a supervisory authority, is
irregularly conducted; it is challenging to be certified that a service provider has been continuously
adhering to the GDPR. Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner's capability to perceive whether
a service provider complies with the GDPR and effectively protects her personal data. This motivates
us to envision a design concept for developing a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform
leveraging the emerging blockchain and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform
are to provide decentralised mechanisms to both service providers and data owners for processing
personal data; meanwhile, empower data provenance and transparency by leveraging advanced features
of the blockchain technology. The platform enables data owners to impose data usage consent, ensures
only designated parties can process personal data, and logs all data activities in an immutable
distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography techniques. By honestly participating
in the platform, a service provider can be endorsed by the blockchain network that it is fully GDPR-compliant;
otherwise, any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by associated parties.
We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design concept by developing
a profile management platform implemented on top of the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain
framework, following by valuable analysis and discussion.
