Deep learning has shown outstanding performance in identifying intricate structures in complex
high-dimensional data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The application of deep learning
to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained
considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale
multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches
and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar
search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018.
These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and
the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination
of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches.
The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder
(SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for
prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep
learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN),
that use neuroimaging data without preprocessing for feature selection have yielded accuracies
of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification
performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. AD
research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional
hybrid data types, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of
specific disease-related features and mechanisms.
