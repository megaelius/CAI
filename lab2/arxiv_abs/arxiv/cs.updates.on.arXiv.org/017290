Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that differ from conventional frame cameras: Instead of
capturing images at a fixed rate, they asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes, and
output a stream of events that encode the time, location and sign of the brightness changes. Event
cameras offer attractive properties compared to traditional cameras: high temporal resolution
(in the order of microseconds), very high dynamic range (140 dB vs. 60 dB), low power consumption,
and high pixel bandwidth (on the order of kHz) resulting in reduced motion blur. Hence, event cameras
have a large potential for robotics and computer vision in challenging scenarios for traditional
cameras, such as low-latency, high speed, and high dynamic range. However, novel methods are required
to process the unconventional output of these sensors in order to unlock their potential. This paper
provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of event-based vision, with a focus on the
applications and the algorithms developed to unlock the outstanding properties of event cameras.
We present event cameras from their working principle, the actual sensors that are available and
the tasks that they have been used for, from low-level vision (feature detection and tracking, optic
flow, etc.) to high-level vision (reconstruction, segmentation, recognition). We also discuss
the techniques developed to process events, including learning-based techniques, as well as specialized
processors for these novel sensors, such as spiking neural networks. Additionally, we highlight
the challenges that remain to be tackled and the opportunities that lie ahead in the search for a more
efficient, bio-inspired way for machines to perceive and interact with the world.
