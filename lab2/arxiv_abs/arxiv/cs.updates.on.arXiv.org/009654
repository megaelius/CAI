Consider a graph problem that is locally checkable but not locally solvable: given a solution we
can check that it is feasible by verifying all constant-radius neighborhoods, but to find a solution
each node needs to explore the input graph at least up to distance $\Omega(\log n)$ in order to produce
its output.Such problems have been studied extensively in the recent years in the area of distributed
computing, where the key complexity measure has been distance: how far does a node need to see in order
to produce its output. However, if we are interested in e.g. sublinear-time centralized algorithms,
a more appropriate complexity measure would be volume: how large a subgraph does a node need to see
in order to produce its output. In this work we study locally checkable graph problems on bounded-degree
graphs. We give a number of constructions that exhibit tradeoffs between deterministic distance,
randomized distance, deterministic volume, and randomized volume: - If the deterministic distance
is linear, it is also known that randomized distance is near-linear. In contrast, we show that there
are problems with linear deterministic volume but only logarithmic randomized volume. - We prove
a volume hierarchy theorem for randomized complexity: among problems with linear deterministic
volume complexity, there are infinitely many distinct randomized volume complexity classes between
$\Omega(\log n)$ and $O(n)$. This hierarchy persists even when restricting to problems whose randomized
and deterministic distance complexities are $\Theta(\log n)$. - Similar hierarchies exist for
polynomial distance complexities: for any $k, \ell \in N$ with $k \leq \ell$, there are problems
whose randomized and deterministic distance complexities are $\Theta(n^{1/\ell})$, randomized
volume complexities are $\Theta(n^{1/k})$, and whose deterministic volume complexities are
$\Theta(n)$.
