Counting independent sets on bipartite graphs (#BIS) is considered a canonical counting problem
of intermediate approximation complexity. It is conjectured that #BIS neither has an FPRAS nor
is as hard as #Sat to approximate [DGGJ03]. We study #BIS in the general framework of two-state spin
systems in bipartite graphs. Such a system is parameterized by three numbers $(\beta,\gamma,\lambda)$,
where $\beta$ (respectively $\gamma$) represents the weight of an edge (or "interaction strength")
whose end points are of the same 0 (respectively 1) spin, and $\lambda$ is the weight of a 1 vertex,
also known as an "external field". By convention, the edge weight with unequal 0/1 end points and
the vertex weight with spin 0 are both normalized to 1. The partition function of the special case
$\beta=1$, $\gamma=0$, and $\lambda=1$ counts the number of independent sets. We define two notions,
nearly-independent phase-correlated spins and symmetry breaking. We prove that it is #BIS-hard
to approximate the partition function of any two-spin system on bipartite graphs supporting these
two notions. As a consequence, we show that #BIS on graphs of degree at most 6 is as hard to approximate
as #BIS without degree bound. The degree bound 6 is the best possible as Weitz [Wei06] presented an
FPTAS to count independent sets on graphs of maximum degree 5. This result extends to the hard-core
model and to other anti-ferromagnetic two-spin models. We also achieve a complete classification
for all $0<\beta,\gamma<1$ and $\lambda>0$ on bipartite graphs without degree bound:
Every such 2-spin system on bipartite graphs is equivalent to #BIS in approximation complexity,
except for the case $\beta=\gamma$ and $\lambda=1$. The exceptional case is precisely the antiferromagnetic
Ising model without an external field and we show that it admits an FPRAS on bipartite graphs for all
$0<\beta=\gamma<1$ and $\lambda=1$.
