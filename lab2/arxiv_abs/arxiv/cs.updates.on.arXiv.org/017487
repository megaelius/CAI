With the recent advances in voice synthesis, AI-synthesized fake voices are indistinguishable
to human ears and widely are applied to produce realistic and natural DeepFakes, exhibiting real
threats to our society. However, effective and robust detectors for synthesized fake voices are
still in their infancy and are not ready to fully tackle this emerging threat. In this paper, we devise
a novel approach, named \emph{DeepSonar}, based on monitoring neuron behaviors of speaker recognition
(SR) system, \ie, a deep neural network (DNN), to discern AI-synthesized fake voices. Layer-wise
neuron behaviors provide an important insight to meticulously catch the differences among inputs,
which are widely employed for building safety, robust, and interpretable DNNs. In this work, we
leverage the power of layer-wise neuron activation patterns with a conjecture that they can capture
the subtle differences between real and AI-synthesized fake voices, in providing a cleaner signal
to classifiers than raw inputs. Experiments are conducted on three datasets (including commercial
products from Google, Baidu, \etc) containing both English and Chinese languages to corroborate
the high detection rates (98.1\% average accuracy) and low false alarm rates (about 2\% error rate)
of DeepSonar in discerning fake voices. Furthermore, extensive experimental results also demonstrate
its robustness against manipulation attacks (\eg, voice conversion and additive real-world noises).
Our work further poses a new insight into adopting neuron behaviors for effective and robust AI aided
multimedia fakes forensics as an inside-out approach instead of being motivated and swayed by various
artifacts introduced in synthesizing fakes.
