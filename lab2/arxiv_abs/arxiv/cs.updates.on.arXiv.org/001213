The political discourse in Western European countries such as Germany has recently seen a resurgence
of the topic of refugees, fueled by an influx of refugees from various Middle Eastern and African
countries. Even though the topic of refugees evidently plays a large role in online and offline politics
of the affected countries, the fact that protests against refugees stem from the right-wight political
spectrum has lead to corresponding media to be shared in a decentralized fashion, making an analysis
of the underlying social and mediatic networks difficult. In order to contribute to the analysis
of these processes, we present a quantitative study of the social media activities of a contemporary
nationwide protest movement against local refugee housing in Germany, which organizes itself
via dedicated Facebook pages per city. We analyse data from 136 such protest pages in 2015, containing
more than 46,000 posts and more than one million interactions by more than 200,000 users. In order
to learn about the patterns of communication and interaction among users of far-right social media
sites and pages, we investigate the temporal characteristics of the social media activities of
this protest movement, as well as the connectedness of the interactions of its participants. We
find several activity metrics such as the number of posts issued, discussion volume about crime
and housing costs, negative polarity in comments, and user engagement to peak in late 2015, coinciding
with chancellor Angela Merkel's much criticized decision of September 2015 to temporarily admit
the entry of Syrian refugees to Germany. Furthermore, our evidence suggests a low degree of direct
connectedness of participants in this movement, (i.a., indicated by a lack of geographical collaboration
patterns), yet we encounter a strong affiliation of the pages' user base with far-right political
parties.
