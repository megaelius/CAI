The Internet of Things (IoT) will be a main data generation infrastructure for achieving better
system intelligence. This paper considers the design and implementation of a practical privacy-preserving
collaborative learning scheme, in which a curious learning coordinator trains a better machine
learning model based on the data samples contributed by a number of IoT objects, while the confidentiality
of the raw forms of the training data is protected against the coordinator. Existing distributed
machine learning and data encryption approaches incur significant computation and communication
overhead, rendering them ill-suited for resource-constrained IoT objects. We study an approach
that applies independent random projection at each IoT object to obfuscate data and trains a deep
neural network at the coordinator based on the projected data from the IoT objects. This approach
introduces light computation overhead to the IoT objects and moves most workload to the coordinator
that can have sufficient computing resources. Although the independent projections performed
by the IoT objects address the potential collusion between the curious coordinator and some compromised
IoT objects, they significantly increase the complexity of the projected data. In this paper, we
leverage the superior learning capability of deep learning in capturing sophisticated patterns
to maintain good learning performance. Extensive comparative evaluation shows that this approach
outperforms other lightweight approaches that apply additive noisification for differential
privacy and/or support vector machines for learning in the applications with light to moderate
data pattern complexities.
