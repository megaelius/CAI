High-performance actuators are crucial to enable mechanical versatility of lower-limb wearable
robots, which are required to be lightweight, highly backdrivable, and with high bandwidth. State-of-the-art
actuators, e.g., series elastic actuators (SEAs), have to compromise bandwidth to improve compliance
(i.e., backdrivability). In this paper, we describe the design and human-robot interaction modeling
of a portable hip exoskeleton based on our custom quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuation (i.e., a high
torque density motor with low ratio gear). We also present a model-based performance benchmark
comparison of representative actuators in terms of torque capability, control bandwidth, backdrivability,
and force tracking accuracy. This paper aims to corroborate the underlying philosophy of "design
for control", namely meticulous robot design can simplify control algorithms while ensuring high
performance. Following this idea, we create a lightweight bilateral hip exoskeleton (overall
mass is 3.4 kg) to reduce joint loadings during normal activities, including walking and squatting.
Experimental results indicate that the exoskeleton is able to produce high nominal torque (17.5
Nm), high backdrivability (0.4 Nm backdrive torque), high bandwidth (62.4 Hz), and high control
accuracy (1.09 Nm root mean square tracking error, i.e., 5.4% of the desired peak torque). Its controller
is versatile to assist walking at different speeds (0.8-1.4 m/s) and squatting at 2 s cadence. This
work demonstrates significant improvement in backdrivability and control bandwidth compared
with state-of-the-art exoskeletons powered by the conventional actuation or SEA.
