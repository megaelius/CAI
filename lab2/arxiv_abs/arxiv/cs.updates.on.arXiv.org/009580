The problem of increased queueing delays in the Internet motivates the study of currently implemented
transport protocols and active queue management (AQM) policies. We study Compound TCP (default
protocol in Windows) with Random Early Detection (RED). RED uses an exponentially weighted moving
average of the queue size to make packet-dropping decisions, aiming to control the queue size. One
must study RED with current protocols in order to explore its viability in the context of increased
queueing delays. We derive a non-linear time-delayed model for Compound TCP-RED. We derive a sufficient
condition for local stability of this model, and examine the impact of (i) round-trip time (RTT)
of the TCP flows, (ii) queue averaging parameter and (iii) packet-dropping thresholds. Further,
we establish that the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation as any of the above parameters is varied.
This suggests the emergence of limit cycles in the queue size, which may lead to synchronisation
of TCP flows and loss of link utilisation. Next, we study a regime where queue size averaging is not
performed, and packet-dropping decisions are based on instantaneous queue size. In this regime,
we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for local stability. A comparison of the stability
results for Compound TCP-RED in the two regimes--with and without queue size averaging--reveals
that averaging may not be beneficial to system stability. Packet-level simulations show that the
queue size indeed exhibits limit cycle oscillations as system parameters are varied. We then outline
a simple threshold-based queue policy, that could ensure stable low-latency operation. We show
that the threshold policy outperforms RED in terms of queueing delay, flow completion time and packet
loss. We highlight that the threshold-based policy could mitigate the issue of increased queueing
delays in the Internet.
