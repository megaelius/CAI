Mindless eating, or the lack of awareness of the food we are consuming, has been linked to health problems
attributed to unhealthy eating behaviour, including obesity. Traditional approaches used to
moderate eating behaviour often rely on inaccurate self-logging, manual observations or bulky
equipment. Overall, there is a need for an intelligent and lightweight system which can automatically
monitor eating behaviour and provide feedback. In this paper, we investigate: i) the development
of an automated system for detecting eating behaviour using wearable Electromyography (EMG) sensors,
and ii) the application of such a system in combination with real time wristband haptic feedback
to facilitate mindful eating. Data collected from 16 participants were used to develop an algorithm
for detecting chewing and swallowing. We extracted 18 features from EMG and presented those features
to different classifiers. We demonstrated that eating behaviour can be automatically assessed
accurately using the EMG-extracted features and a Support Vector Machine (SVM): F1-Score=0.94
for chewing classification, and F1-Score=0.86 for swallowing classification. Based on this algorithm,
we developed a system to enable participants to self-moderate their chewing behaviour using haptic
feedback. An experiment study was carried out with 20 additional participants showing that participants
exhibited a lower rate of chewing when haptic feedback delivered in forms of wristband vibration
was used compared to a baseline and non-haptic condition (F (2,38)=58.243, p<0.001). These findings
may have major implications for research in eating behaviour, providing key new insights into the
impacts of automatic chewing detection and haptic feedback systems on moderating eating behaviour
with the aim to improve health outcomes.
