Artificial Intelligence allows the improvement of our daily life, for instance, speech and handwritten
text recognition, real time translation and weather forecasting are common used applications.
In the livestock sector, machine learning algorithms have the potential for early detection and
warning of problems, which represents a significant milestone in the poultry industry. Production
problems generate economic loss that could be avoided by acting in a timely manner. In the current
study, training and testing of support vector machines are addressed, for an early detection of
problems in the production curve of commercial eggs, using farm's egg production data of 478,919
laying hens grouped in 24 flocks. Experiments using support vector machines with a 5 k-fold cross-validation
were performed at different previous time intervals, to alert with up to 5 days of forecasting interval,
whether a flock will experience a problem in production curve. Performance metrics such as accuracy,
specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value were evaluated, reaching 0-day values
of 0.9874, 0.9876, 0.9783 and 0.6518 respectively on unseen data (test-set). The optimal forecasting
interval was from zero to three days, performance metrics decreases as the forecasting interval
is increased. It should be emphasized that this technique was able to issue an alert a day in advance,
achieving an accuracy of 0.9854, a specificity of 0.9865, a sensitivity of 0.9333 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6135. This novel application embedded in a computer system of poultry management
is able to provide significant improvements in early detection and warning of problems related
to the production curve.
