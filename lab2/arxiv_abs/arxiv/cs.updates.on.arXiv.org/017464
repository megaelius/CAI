Virtualization facilitates heterogeneous cloud applications to share the same physical infrastructure
with admirable flexibility, while resource efficiency and survivability are critical concerns
for virtual network embedding (VNE). As more and more internet applications migrate to the cloud,
the resource efficiency and the survivability of VNs, such as single link failure or large-scale
disaster survivability, have become crucial issues. Separating the VNE problem into node and link
mapping sub-problems without coordination might cause a high embedding cost. This dissertation
presents two independent approaches to solve the aforementioned challenges. First, we study two-stage
coordinated survivable VNE (SVNE) problem and propose an adaptive path splitting based SVNE (APSS)
scheme. We first develop a concise anchor node strategy to restrict the solution space of the candidate
substrate nodes, which coordinates node mapping with link mapping to limit the distance spans of
the virtual links. Then, we employ an adaptive path splitting policy to provide full protection
against single-link failures with partial backup resource, and design an agile frequency slot
windows choosing mechanism to mitigate the spectrum fragmentation for link resource efficiency.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed APSS scheme can achieve satisfactory performance
in terms of spectrum utilization and blocking ratio. Second, we propose a synchronous evacuation
strategy for VNs with dual virtual machines (VMs) inside a disaster risk zone (DRZ), which suffer
higher risks than the VNs with single. The evacuation strategy exploits post-copy technique to
sustain the online service alive and enhances synchronous VM migrations to shorten the dual-VM
evacuation time. Numerical results show that the proposed strategy can outperform the best-effort
scheme in terms of average and total evacuation times of dual-VMs.
