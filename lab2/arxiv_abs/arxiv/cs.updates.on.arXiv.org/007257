The rise of smart contract systems such as Ethereum has resulted in a proliferation of blockchain-based
decentralized applications including applications that store and manage a wide range of data.
Current smart contracts are designed to be executed solely by miners and are revealed entirely on-chain,
resulting in reduced scalability and privacy. In this paper, we discuss that scalability and privacy
of smart contracts can be enhanced by splitting a given contract into an off-chain contract and an
on-chain contract. Specifically, functions of the contract that involve high-cost computation
or sensitive information can be split and included as the off-chain contract, that is signed and
executed by only the interested participants. The proposed approach allows the participants to
reach unanimous agreement off-chain when all of them are honest, allowing computing resources
of miners to be saved and content of the off-chain contract to be hidden from the public. In case of
a dispute caused by any dishonest participants, a signed copy of the off-chain contract can be revealed
so that a verified instance can be created to make miners enforce the true execution result. Thus,
honest participants have the ability to redress and penalize any fraudulent or dishonest behavior,
which incentivizes all participants to honestly follow the agreed off-chain contract. We discuss
techniques for splitting a contract into a pair of on/off-chain contracts and propose a mechanism
to address the challenges of handling dishonest participants in the system. Our implementation
and evaluation of the proposed approach using an example smart contract demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach in Ethereum.
