Increasingly modern data science platforms today have non-intrusive and extensible provenance
ingestion mechanisms to collect rich provenance and context information, handle modifications
to the same file using distinguishable versions, and use graph data models (e.g., property graphs)
and query languages (e.g., Cypher) to represent and manipulate the stored provenance/context
information. Due to the schema-later nature of the metadata, multiple versions of the same files,
and unfamiliar artifacts introduced by team members, the "provenance graph" is verbose and evolving,
and hard to understand; using standard graph query model, it is difficult to compose queries and
utilize this valuable information. In this paper, we propose two high-level graph query operators
to address the verboseness and evolving nature of such provenance graphs. First, we introduce a
graph segmentation operator, which queries the retrospective provenance between a set of source
vertices and a set of destination vertices via flexible boundary criteria to help users get insight
about the derivation relationships among those vertices. We show the semantics of such a query in
terms of a context-free grammar, and develop efficient algorithms that run orders of magnitude
faster than state-of-the-art. Second, we propose a graph summarization operator that combines
similar segments together to query prospective provenance of the underlying project. The operator
allows tuning the summary by ignoring vertex details and characterizing local structures, and
ensures the provenance meaning using path constraints. We show the optimal summary problem is PSPACE-complete
and develop effective approximation algorithms. The operators are implemented on top of a property
graph backend. We evaluate our query methods extensively and show the effectiveness and efficiency
of the proposed methods.
