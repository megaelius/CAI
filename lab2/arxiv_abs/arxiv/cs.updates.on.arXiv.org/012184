Estimating arbitrary quantities of interest (QoIs) that are non-linear operators of complex,
expensive-to-evaluate, black-box functions is a challenging problem due to missing domain knowledge
and finite budgets. Bayesian optimal design of experiments (BODE) is a family of methods that identify
an optimal design of experiments (DOE) under different contexts, using only in a limited number
of function evaluations. Under BODE methods, sequential design of experiments (SDOE) accomplishes
this task by selecting an optimal sequence of experiments while using data-driven probabilistic
surrogate models instead of the expensive black-box function. Probabilistic predictions from
the surrogate model are used to define an information acquisition function (IAF) which quantifies
the marginal value contributed or the expected information gained by a hypothetical experiment.
The next experiment is selected by maximizing the IAF. A generally applicable IAF is the expected
information gain (EIG) about a QoI as captured by the expectation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the predictive distribution of the QoI after doing a hypothetical experiment and the current
predictive distribution about the same QoI. We model the underlying information source as a fully-Bayesian,
non-stationary Gaussian process (FBNSGP), and derive an approximation of the information gain
of a hypothetical experiment about an arbitrary QoI conditional on the hyper-parameters The EIG
about the same QoI is estimated by sample averages to integrate over the posterior of the hyper-parameters
and the potential experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the performance of our method in four numerical
examples and a practical engineering problem of steel wire manufacturing. The method is compared
to two classic SDOE methods: random sampling and uncertainty sampling.
