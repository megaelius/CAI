Despite several works on secrecy coding for fading and MIMO wiretap channels from an error probability
perspective, the construction of information-theoretically secure codes over such channels
remains an open problem. In this paper, we consider a fading wiretap channel model where the transmitter
has only partial statistical channel state information. Our channel model includes static channels,
i.i.d. block fading channels, and ergodic stationary fading with fast decay of time correlations
for the eavesdropper's channel. We extend the flatness factor criterion from the Gaussian wiretap
channel to fading and MIMO wiretap channels, and establish a simple design criterion where the normalized
product distance / minimum determinant of the lattice and its dual should be maximized simultaneously.
Moreover, we propose concrete lattice codes satisfying this design criterion, which are built
from algebraic number fields with constant root discriminant in the single-antenna case, and from
division algebras centered at such number fields in the multiple-antenna case. The proposed lattice
codes achieve strong secrecy and semantic security for all rates $R<C_b-C_e-\kappa$, where $C_b$
and $C_e$ are Bob and Eve's channel capacities respectively, and $\kappa$ is an explicit constant
gap. Furthermore, these codes are almost universal in the sense that a fixed code is good for secrecy
for a wide range of fading models. Finally, we consider a compound wiretap model with a more restricted
uncertainty set, and show that rates $R<\bar{C}_b-\bar{C}_e-\kappa$ are achievable, where $\bar{C}_b$
is a lower bound for Bob's capacity and $\bar{C}_e$ is an upper bound for Eve's capacity for all the
channels in the set.
