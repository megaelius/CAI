Segmentation of the pixels corresponding to human skin is an essential first step in multiple applications
ranging from surveillance to heart-rate estimation from remote-photoplethysmography. However,
the existing literature considers the problem only in the visible-range of the EM-spectrum which
limits their utility in low or no light settings where the criticality of the application is higher.
To alleviate this problem, we consider the problem of skin segmentation from the Near-infrared
images. However, Deep learning based state-of-the-art segmentation techniques demands large
amounts of labelled data that is unavailable for the current problem. Therefore we cast the skin
segmentation problem as that of target-independent Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) where
we use the data from the Red-channel of the visible-range to develop skin segmentation algorithm
on NIR images. We propose a method for target-independent segmentation where the 'nearest-clone'
of a target image in the source domain is searched and used as a proxy in the segmentation network trained
only on the source domain. We prove the existence of 'nearest-clone' and propose a method to find
it through an optimization algorithm over the latent space of a Deep generative model based on variational
inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for NIR skin segmentation over the
state-of-the-art UDA segmentation methods on the two newly created skin segmentation datasets
in NIR domain despite not having access to the target NIR data. Additionally, we report state-of-the-art
results for adaption from Synthia to Cityscapes which is a popular setting in Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation for semantic segmentation. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/ambekarsameer96/GLSS.
