Mobile applications are used to handle different types of data. Commonly, there is a set of personal
identifiable information present in the data stored, shared and used by these applications. From
that, attackers can try to exploit the mobile application in order to obtain or to cause private data
leakage. Therefore, performing security assessments is an important practice to find vulnerabilities
in the applications and systems before the application is deployed, or even during their use. Regarding
security assessments, Penetration Test (Pentest) is one of the security test types that can be used
to detect vulnerabilities through simulated attacks. Additionally, Pentest can be performed
using different methodologies and best practices, through several frameworks to: organize the
test execution, execute tools, provide estimations, provide reports and document a Pentest. One
such framework is Tramonto, which aims to assist a cybersecurity expert during the Pentest execution
by providing organization, standardization and flexibility to the whole Pentest process. This
paper presents a Pentest case study applied to a Brazilian university Mobile App using the Tramonto
framework. The main goal of this case study is to present how Tramonto can be applied during a Pentest
execution, assisting cybersecurity experts in the tasks included in the Pentest process. Our results
show details on how to perform a Pentest using Tramonto and the found vulnerabilities in the Mobile
App. Besides that, there is a discussion about the main contributions obtained from our results,
and we were able to verify that Tramonto managed, organized and optimized the whole Pentest process.
