We examine the problem of target tracking whilst simultaneously preserving the target's privacy
as epitomized by the robotic panda tracking scenario, which O'Kane introduced at the 2008 Workshop
on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics in order to elegantly illustrate the utility of ignorance.
The present paper reconsiders his formulation and the tracking strategy he proposed, along with
its completeness. We explore how the capabilities of the robot and panda affect the feasibility
of tracking with a privacy stipulation, uncovering intrinsic limits, no matter the strategy employed.
This paper begins with a one-dimensional setting and, putting the trivially infeasible problems
aside, analyzes the strategy space as a function of problem parameters. We show that it is not possible
to actively track the target as well as protect its privacy for every nontrivial pair of tracking
and privacy stipulations. Secondly, feasibility can be sensitive, in several cases, to the information
available to the robot initially. Quite naturally in the one-dimensional model, one may quantify
sensing power by the number of perceptual (or output) classes available to the robot. The robot's
power to achieve privacy-preserving tracking is bounded, converging asymptotically with increasing
sensing power. We analyze the entire space of possible tracking problems, characterizing every
instance as either achievable, constructively by giving a policy where one exists (some of which
depend on the initial information), or proving the instance impossible. Finally, to relate some
of the impossibility results in one dimension to their higher-dimensional counterparts, including
the planar panda tracking problem studied by O'Kane, we establish a connection between tracking
dimensionality and the sensing power of a one-dimensional robot.
