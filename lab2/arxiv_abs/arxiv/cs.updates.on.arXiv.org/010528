A new approach to the sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA)is proposed with the aim of discovering
interpretable associations in very high-dimensional multi-view, i.e.observations of multiple
sets of variables on the same subjects, problems. Inspired by the sparse PCA approach of Journee
et al. (2010), we also show that the sparse CCA formulation, while non-convex, is equivalent to a
maximization program of a convex objective over a compact set for which we propose a first-order
gradient method. This result helps us reduce the search space drastically to the boundaries of the
set. Consequently, we propose a two-step algorithm, where we first infer the sparsity pattern of
the canonical directions using our fast algorithm, then we shrink each view, i.e. observations
of a set of covariates, to contain observations on the sets of covariates selected in the previous
step, and compute their canonical directions via any CCA algorithm. We also introduceDirected
Sparse CCA, which is able to find associations which are aligned with a specified experiment design,
andMulti-View sCCA which is used to discover associations between multiple sets of covariates.
Our simulations establish the superior convergence properties and computational efficiency
of our algorithm as well as accuracy in terms of the canonical correlation and its ability to recover
the supports of the canonical directions. We study the associations between metabolomics, trasncriptomics
and microbiomics in a multi-omic study usingMuLe, which is an R-package that implements our approach,
in order to form hypotheses on mechanisms of adaptations of Drosophila Melanogaster to high doses
of environmental toxicants, specifically Atrazine, which is a commonly used chemical fertilizer.
