Echo State Network (ESN) presents a distinguished kind of recurrent neural networks. It is built
upon a sparse, random and large hidden infrastructure called reservoir. ESNs have succeeded in
dealing with several non-linear problems such as prediction, classification, etc. Thanks to its
rich dynamics, ESN is used as an Autoencoder (AE) to extract features from original data representations.
ESN is not only used with its basic single layer form but also with the recently proposed Multi-Layer
(ML) architecture. The well setting of ESN (basic and ML) architectures and training parameters
is a crucial and hard labor task. Generally, a number of parameters (hidden neurons, sparsity rates,
input scaling) is manually altered to achieve minimum learning error. However, this randomly hand
crafted task, on one hand, may not guarantee best training results and on the other hand, it can raise
the network's complexity. In this paper, a hierarchical bi-level evolutionary optimization is
proposed to deal with these issues. The first level includes a multi-objective architecture optimization
providing maximum learning accuracy while sustaining the complexity at a reduced standard. Multi-objective
Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) is used to optimize ESN structure in a way to provide a trade-off
between the network complexity decreasing and the accuracy increasing. A pareto-front of optimal
solutions is generated by the end of the MOPSO process. These solutions present the set of candidates
that succeeded in providing a compromise between different objectives (learning error and network
complexity). At the second level, each of the solutions already found undergo a mono-objective
weights optimization to enhance the obtained pareto-front. Empirical results ensure the effectiveness
of the evolved ESN recurrent AEs (basic and ML) for noisy and noise free data.
