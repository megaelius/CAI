Stack Overflow has accumulated millions of answers. Informative comments can strengthen their
associated answers (e.g., providing additional information). Currently, Stack Overflow hides
comments that are ranked beyond the top 5. Stack Overflow aims to display more informative comments
(i.e., the ones with higher scores) and hide less informative ones using this mechanism. As a result,
4.4 million comments are hidden under their answer threads. Therefore, it is very important to understand
how well the current comment hiding mechanism works. In this study, we investigate whether the mechanism
can effectively deliver informative comments while hiding uninformative comments. We find that:
1) Hidden comments are as informative as displayed comments; more than half of the comments (both
hidden and displayed) are informative (e.g., providing alternative answers, or pointing out flaws
in their associated answers). 2) The current comment hiding mechanism tends to rank and hide comments
based on their creation time instead of their score in most cases due to the large amount of tie-scored
comments (e.g., 87% of the comments have 0-score). 3) In 97.3% of answers that have hidden comments,
at least one comment is hidden while there is another comment with the same score is displayed (i.e.,
we refer to such cases as unfairly hidden comments). Among such unfairly hidden comments, the longest
unfairly hidden comment is more likely to be informative than the shortest unfairly displayed comments.
Our findings suggest that Stack Overflow should consider adjusting their current comment hiding
mechanism, e.g., displaying longer unfairly hidden comments to replace shorter unfairly displayed
comments. We also recommend that users examine all comments, in case they would miss informative
details such as software obsolescence, code error reports, or notices of security vulnerability
in hidden comments.
