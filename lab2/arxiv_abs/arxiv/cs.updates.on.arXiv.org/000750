Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a new paradigm of secondary spectrum utilization and sharing.
It allows unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to exploit the under-utilized radio spectrum licensed
to primary users opportunistically. Market mechanism is a widely-used promising means to regulate
the consuming behaviours of users and, hence, achieve the efficient allocation and consumption
of limited resources. In this paper, we propose and study a hybrid secondary spectrum market consisting
of both the futures market and the spot market, in which SUs (buyers) purchase under-utilized licensed
spectrum from a primary spectrum regulator (PR), either through predefined contracts via the futures
market, or through spot transactions via the spot market. We focus on the optimal spectrum allocation
among SUs in an exogenous hybrid market that maximizes the secondary spectrum utilization efficiency.
The problem is challenging due to the stochasticity and asymmetry of network information. To solve
this problem, we first derive an o?ff-line optimal allocation policy that maximizes the ex-ante
expected spectrum utilization efficiency based on the stochastic distribution of network information.
We then propose an on-line VCG auction that determines the real-time allocation and pricing of every
spectrum based on the realized network information and the derived allocation policy. We further
show that with the spatial frequency reuse, the proposed VCG auction is NP-hard; hence, it is not
suitable for on-line implementation, especially in a large-scale market. To this end, we propose
a heuristics approach based on an on-line VCG-like mechanism with polynomial-time complexity,
and further characterize the corresponding performance loss bound analytically. We finally provide
extensive numerical results to evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions.
