While manufacturers have been generating highly distributed data from various systems, devices
and applications, a number of challenges in both data management and data analysis require new approaches
to support the big data era. These challenges for industrial big data analytics is real-time analysis
and decision-making from massive heterogeneous data sources in manufacturing space. This survey
presents new concepts, methodologies, and applications scenarios of industrial big data analytics,
which can provide dramatic improvements in velocity and veracity problem solving. We focus on five
important methodologies of industrial big data analytics: 1) Highly distributed industrial data
ingestion: access and integrate to highly distributed data sources from various systems, devices
and applications; 2) Industrial big data repository: cope with sampling biases and heterogeneity,
and store different data formats and structures; 3) Large-scale industrial data management: organizes
massive heterogeneous data and share large-scale data; 4) Industrial data analytics: track data
provenance, from data generation through data preparation; 5) Industrial data governance: ensures
data trust, integrity and security. For each phase, we introduce to current research in industries
and academia, and discusses challenges and potential solutions. We also examine the typical applications
of industrial big data, including smart factory visibility, machine fleet, energy management,
proactive maintenance, and just in time supply chain. These discussions aim to understand the value
of industrial big data. Lastly, this survey is concluded with a discussion of open problems and future
directions.
