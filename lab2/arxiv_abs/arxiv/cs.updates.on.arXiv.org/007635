The recommender system is an important form of intelligent application, which assists users to
alleviate from information redundancy. Among the metrics used to evaluate a recommender system,
the metric of conversion has become more and more important. The majority of existing recommender
systems perform poorly on the metric of conversion due to its extremely sparse feedback signal.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a deep hierarchical reinforcement learning based recommendation
framework, which consists of two components, i.e., high-level agent and low-level agent. The high-level
agent catches long-term sparse conversion signals, and automatically sets abstract goals for
low-level agent, while the low-level agent follows the abstract goals and interacts with real-time
environment. To solve the inherent problem in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose
a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm via multi-goals abstraction (HRL-MG).
Our proposed algorithm contains three characteristics: 1) the high-level agent generates multiple
goals to guide the low-level agent in different stages, which reduces the difficulty of approaching
high-level goals; 2) different goals share the same state encoder parameters, which increases
the update frequency of the high-level agent and thus accelerates the convergence of our proposed
algorithm; 3) an appreciate benefit assignment function is designed to allocate rewards in each
goal so as to coordinate different goals in a consistent direction. We evaluate our proposed algorithm
based on a real-world e-commerce dataset and validate its effectiveness.
