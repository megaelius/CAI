We abstractly formulate an analytic problem that arises naturally in the study of coordination
in multi-agent systems. Let I be a set of arbitrary cardinality (the set of actions) and assume that
for each pair of distinct actions (i,j), we are given a number \delta(i,j). We say that a function
t, specifying a time for each action, satisfies the timely constraint {\delta} if for every pair
of distinct actions (i,j), we have t(j)-t(i) <= \delta(i,j) (and thus also t(j)-t(i) >= -\delta(j,i)).
While the approach that first comes to mind for analysing these definitions is an analytic/geometric
one, it turns out that graph-theoretic tools yield powerful results when applied to these definitions.
Using such tools, we characterise the set of satisfiable timely constraints, and reduce the problem
of satisfiability of a timely constraint to the all-pairs shortest-path problem, and for finite
I, furthermore to the negative-cycle detection problem. Moreover, we constructively show that
every satisfiable timely constraint has a minimal satisfying function - a key milestone on the way
to optimally solving a large class of coordination problems - and reduce the problem of finding this
minimal satisfying function, as well as the problems of classifying and comparing timely constraints,
to the all-pairs shortest-path problem. At the heart of our analysis lies the constructive definition
of a "nicely-behaved" representative for each class of timely constraints sharing the same set
of satisfying functions. We show that this canonical representative, as well as the map from such
canonical representatives to the the sets of functions satisfying the classes of timely constraints
they represent, has many desired properties, which provide deep insights into the structure underlying
the above definitions.
