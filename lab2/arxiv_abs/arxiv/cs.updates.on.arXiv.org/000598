Modalities of communication for human beings are gradually increasing in number with the advent
of new forms of technology. Many human beings can readily transition between these different forms
of communication with little or no effort, which brings about the question: How similar are these
different communication modalities? To understand technology$\text{'}$s influence on English
communication, four different corpora were analyzed and compared: Writing from Books using the
1-grams database from the Google Books project, Twitter, IRC Chat, and transcribed Talking. Multi-word
confusion matrices revealed that Talking has the most similarity when compared to the other modes
of communication, while 1-grams were the least similar form of communication analyzed. Based on
the analysis of word usage, word usage frequency distributions, and word class usage, among other
things, Talking is also the most similar to Twitter and IRC Chat. This suggests that communicating
using Twitter and IRC Chat evolved from Talking rather than Writing. When we communicate online,
even though we are writing, we do not Tweet or Chat how we write books; we Tweet and Chat how we Speak.
Nonfiction and Fiction writing were clearly differentiable from our analysis with Twitter and
Chat being much more similar to Fiction than Nonfiction writing. These hypotheses were then tested
using author and journalists Cory Doctorow. Mr. Doctorow$\text{'}$s Writing, Twitter usage,
and Talking were all found to have very similar vocabulary usage patterns as the amalgamized populations,
as long as the writing was Fiction. However, Mr. Doctorow$\text{'}$s Nonfiction writing is different
from 1-grams and other collected Nonfiction writings. This data could perhaps be used to create
more entertaining works of Nonfiction.
