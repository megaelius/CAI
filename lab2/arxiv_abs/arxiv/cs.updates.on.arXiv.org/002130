Many real-world networks are representations of dynamic systems with interactions that change
over time, often in uncoordinated ways and at irregular intervals. For example, university students
connect in intermittent groups that repeatedly form and dissolve based on multiple factors, including
their lectures, interests, and friends. Such dynamic systems can be represented as multilayer
networks where each layer represents a snapshot of the temporal network. In this representation,
it is crucial that the links between layers accurately capture real dependencies between those
layers. Often, however, these dependencies are unknown. Therefore, current methods connect layers
based on simplistic assumptions that cannot capture node-level layer dependencies. For example,
connecting every node to itself in other layers with the same weight can wipe out essential dependencies
between intermittent groups, making it difficult or even impossible to identify them. In this paper,
we present a principled approach to estimating node-level layer dependencies based on the network
structure within each layer. We implement our node-level coupling method in the community detection
framework Infomap and demonstrate its performance compared to current methods on synthetic and
real temporal networks. We show that our approach more effectively constrains information inside
multilayer communities so that Infomap can better recover planted groups in multilayer benchmark
networks that represent multiple modes with different groups and better identify intermittent
communities in real temporal contact networks. These results suggest that node-level layer coupling
can improve the modeling of information spreading in temporal networks and better capture their
dynamic community structure.
