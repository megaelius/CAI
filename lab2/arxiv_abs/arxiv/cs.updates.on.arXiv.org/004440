While microscopic analysis of histopathological slides is generally considered as the gold standard
method for performing cancer diagnosis and grading, the current method for analysis is extremely
time consuming and labour intensive as it requires pathologists to visually inspect tissue samples
in a detailed fashion for the presence of cancer. As such, there has been significant recent interest
in computer aided diagnosis systems for analysing histopathological slides for cancer grading
to aid pathologists to perform cancer diagnosis and grading in a more efficient, accurate, and consistent
manner. In this work, we investigate and explore a deep triple-stream residual network (TriResNet)
architecture for the purpose of tile-level histopathology grading, which is the critical first
step to computer-aided whole-slide histopathology grading. In particular, the design mentality
behind the proposed TriResNet network architecture is to facilitate for the learning of a more diverse
set of quantitative features to better characterize the complex tissue characteristics found
in histopathology samples. Experimental results on two widely-used computer-aided histopathology
benchmark datasets (CAMELYON16 dataset and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) dataset) demonstrated
that the proposed TriResNet network architecture was able to achieve noticeably improved accuracies
when compared with two other state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network architectures.
Based on these promising results, the hope is that the proposed TriResNet network architecture
could become a useful tool to aiding pathologists increase the consistency, speed, and accuracy
of the histopathology grading process.
