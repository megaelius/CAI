Interference alignment (IA) is one of the major theoretical breakthroughs in the information theoretic
understanding of Gaussian interference channels with more than two transmit-receive pairs. Unfortunately,
practical one-shot IA precoding, where alignment is obtained on a number of channel dimensions
that does not grow with the network size, provides vanishing degrees of freedom (DoFs) gain for fully
connected large networks with generic channel coefficients. Achieving non-trivial DoFs gains
by one-shot alignment precoding in partially connected networks remains an open problem, as it
critically depends on the specific network topology. In our previous work, we introduced the concept
of "Cellular IA'" for a network topology induced by hexagonal cells with sectors and nearest neighbor
inter-sector interference. For the uplink, assuming that neighboring base-stations can exchange
individually decoded messages (and not received signal samples), we proved one-shot DoFs optimality
of M/2 DoFs per user when transmitters and receivers have the same number M of antennas. In this paper
we extend this line of work by considering omni-directional (non-sectorized) cells where the users
have 2 antennas, and the base-stations have 2, 3 or 4 antennas. For the 2x2 case, we show that 3/4 DoFs
per user can be achieved with linear one-shot IA precoding and prove that it is optimal for large extended
cellular networks. For the 2x3 and 2x4 cases, we show the achievability of 1 and 7/6 DoFs per user respectively.
Our one-shot achievability schemes are highly non-trivial and make use of a network-wide interference
cancellation framework that enables local decoded message passing between base-stations. Our
converse technique is based on the explicit solution of a linear programming bound on the feasible
DoFs.
