In this paper, we study resource allocation for multiuser multiple-input single-output secondary
communication systems with multiple system design objectives. We consider cognitive radio networks
where the secondary receivers are able to harvest energy from the radio frequency when they are idle.
The secondary system provides simultaneous wireless power and secure information transfer to
the secondary receivers. We propose a multi-objective optimization framework for the design of
a Pareto optimal resource allocation algorithm based on the weighted Tchebycheff approach. In
particular, the algorithm design incorporates three important system objectives: total transmit
power minimization, energy harvesting efficiency maximization, and interference power leakage-to-transmit
power ratio minimization. The proposed framework takes into account a quality of service requirement
regarding communication secrecy in the secondary system and the imperfection of the channel state
information of potential eavesdroppers (idle secondary receivers and primary receivers) at the
secondary transmitter. The adopted multi-objective optimization problem is non-convex and is
recast as a convex optimization problem via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. It is shown
that the global optimal solution of the original problem can be constructed by exploiting both the
primal and the dual optimal solutions of the SDP relaxed problem. Besides, two suboptimal resource
allocation schemes for the case when the solution of the dual problem is unavailable for constructing
the optimal solution are proposed. Numerical results not only demonstrate the close-to-optimal
performance of the proposed suboptimal schemes, but also unveil an interesting trade-off between
the considered conflicting system design objectives.
