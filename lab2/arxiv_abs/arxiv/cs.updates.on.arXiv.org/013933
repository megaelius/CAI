With the rapid development of Internet and communication systems, both in services and technologies,
communication networks have been suffering increasing complexity. It is imperative to improve
intelligence in communication network, and several aspects have been incorporating with Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Optical network, which plays an important role both
in core and access network in communication networks, also faces great challenges of system complexity
and the requirement of manual operations. To overcome the current limitations and address the issues
of future optical networks, it is essential to deploy more intelligence capability to enable autonomous
and exible network operations. ML techniques are proved to have superiority on solving complex
problems; and thus recently, ML techniques have been used for many optical network applications.
In this paper, a detailed survey of existing applications of ML for intelligent optical networks
is presented. The applications of ML are classified in terms of their use cases, which are categorized
into optical network control and resource management, and optical networks monitoring and survivability.
The use cases are analyzed and compared according to the used ML techniques. Besides, a tutorial
for ML applications is provided from the aspects of the introduction of common ML algorithms, paradigms
of ML, and motivations of applying ML. Lastly, challenges and possible solutions of ML application
in optical networks are also discussed, which intends to inspire future innovations in leveraging
ML to build intelligent optical networks.
