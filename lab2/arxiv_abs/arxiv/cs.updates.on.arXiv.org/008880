There are a lot of hidden dangers in the change of human skin conditions, such as the sunburn caused
by long-time exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which not only has aesthetic impact causing psychological
depression and lack of self-confidence, but also may even be life-threatening due to skin canceration.
Current skin disease researches adopt the auto-classification system for improving the accuracy
rate of skin disease classification. However, the excessive dependence on the image sample database
is unable to provide individualized diagnosis service for different population groups. To overcome
this problem, a medical AI framework based on data width evolution and self-learning is put forward
in this paper to provide skin disease medical service meeting the requirement of real time, extendibility
and individualization. First, the wide collection of data in the close-loop information flow of
user and remote medical data center is discussed. Next, a data set filter algorithm based on information
entropy is given, to lighten the load of edge node and meanwhile improve the learning ability of remote
cloud analysis model. In addition, the framework provides an external algorithm load module, which
can be compatible with the application requirements according to the model selected. Three kinds
of deep learning model, i.e. LeNet-5, AlexNet and VGG16, are loaded and compared, which have verified
the universality of the algorithm load module. The experiment platform for the proposed real-time,
individualized and extensible skin disease recognition system is built. And the system's computation
and communication delay under the interaction scenario between tester and remote data center are
analyzed. It is demonstrated that the system we put forward is reliable and effective.
