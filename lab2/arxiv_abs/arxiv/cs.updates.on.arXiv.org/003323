The decoupling of data and control planes, as proposed for 5G networks, will enable the efficient
implementation of multitier networks where user equipment (UE) nodes obtain coverage and connectivity
through the top-tier macro-cells, and, at the same time, achieve high-throughput low-latency
communication through lower tiers in the hierarchy. This paper considers a new architecture for
such lower tiers, dubbed fog massive MIMO, where the UEs are able to establish high-throughput low-latency
data links in a seamless and opportunistic manner, as they travel through a dense fog of high-capacity
wireless infrastructure nodes, referred to as remote radio heads (RRHs). Traditional handover
mechanisms in dense multicell networks inherently give rise to frequent handovers and pilot sequence
re-assignments, incurring, as a result, excessive protocol overhead and significant latency.
In the proposed fog massive MIMO architecture, UEs seamlessly and implicitly associate themselves
to the most convenient RRHs in a completely autonomous manner. Each UE makes use of a unique uplink
pilot sequence, and pilot contamination is mitigated by a novel coded "on-the-fly" pilot contamination
control mechanism. We analyze the spectral efficiency and the outage probability of the proposed
architecture via stochastic geometry, using some recent results on unique coverage in Boolean
models, and provide a detailed comparison with respect to an idealized baseline massive MIMO cellular
system, that neglects protocol overhead and latency due to explicit user-cell association. Our
analysis, supported by extensive system simulation, reveals that there exists a "sweet spot" of
the per-pilot user load (number of users per pilot), such that the proposed system achieves spectral
efficiency close to that of an ideal cellular system with the minimum distance user-base station
association and no pilot/handover overhead.
