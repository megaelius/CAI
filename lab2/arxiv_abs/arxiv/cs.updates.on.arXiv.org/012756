Defining similarity measures is a requirement for some machine learning methods. One such method
is case-based reasoning (CBR) where the similarity measure is used to retrieve the stored case or
set of cases most similar to the query case. Describing a similarity measure analytically is challenging,
even for domain experts working with CBR experts. However, data sets are typically gathered as part
of constructing a CBR or machine learning system. These datasets are assumed to contain the features
that correctly identify the solution from the problem features, thus they may also contain the knowledge
to construct or learn such a similarity measure. The main motivation for this work is to automate
the construction of similarity measures using machine learning, while keeping training time as
low as possible. Our objective is to investigate how to apply machine learning to effectively learn
a similarity measure. Such a learned similarity measure could be used for CBR systems, but also for
clustering data in semi-supervised learning, or one-shot learning tasks. Recent work has advanced
towards this goal, relies on either very long training times or manually modeling parts of the similarity
measure. We created a framework to help us analyze current methods for learning similarity measures.
This analysis resulted in two novel similarity measure designs. One design using a pre-trained
classifier as basis for a similarity measure. The second design uses as little modeling as possible
while learning the similarity measure from data and keeping training time low. Both similarity
measures were evaluated on 14 different datasets. The evaluation shows that using a classifier
as basis for a similarity measure gives state of the art performance. Finally the evaluation shows
that our fully data-driven similarity measure design outperforms state of the art methods while
keeping training time low.
