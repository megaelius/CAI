Bilateral filtering (BF) is one of the most classical denoising filters, however, the manually
initialized filtering kernel hampers its adaptivity across images with various characteristics.
To deal with image variation (i.e., non-stationary noise), in this paper, we propose multi-kernel
filter (MKF) which adapts filtering kernels to specific image characteristics automatically.
The design of MKF takes inspiration from adaptive mechanisms of human vision that make full use of
information in a visual context. More specifically, for simulating the visual context and its adaptive
function, we construct the image context based on which we simulate the contextual impact on filtering
kernels. We first design a hierarchically clustering algorithm to generate a hierarchy of large
to small coherent image patches, organized as a cluster tree, so that obtain multi-scale image representation.
The leaf cluster and corresponding predecessor clusters are used to generate one of multiple range
kernels that are capable of catering to image variation. At first, we design a hierarchically clustering
framework to generate a hierarchy of large to small coherent image patches that organized as a cluster
tree, so that obtain multi-scale image representation, i.e., the image context. Next, a leaf cluster
is used to generate one of the multiple kernels, and two corresponding predecessor clusters are
used to fine-tune the adopted kernel. Ultimately, the single spatially-invariant kernel in BF
becomes multiple spatially-varying ones. We evaluate MKF on two public datasets, BSD300 and BrainWeb
which are added integrally-varying noise and spatially-varying noise, respectively. Extensive
experiments show that MKF outperforms state-of-the-art filters w.r.t. both mean absolute error
and structural similarity.
