Influence maximization is the problem of finding the set of nodes of a network that maximizes the
size of the outbreak of a spreading process occurring on the network. Solutions to this problem are
important for strategic decisions in marketing and political campaigns. The typical setting consists
in the identification of small sets of initial spreaders in very large networks. This setting makes
the optimization problem computationally infeasible for standard greedy optimization algorithms
that account simultaneously for information about network topology and spreading dynamics, leaving
space only to heuristic methods based on the drastic approximation of relying on the geometry of
the network alone. The literature on the subject is plenty of purely topological methods for the
identification of influential spreaders in networks. However, it is unclear how far these methods
are from being optimal. Here, we perform a systematic test of the performance of a multitude of heuristic
methods for the identification of influential spreaders. We quantify the performance of the various
methods on a corpus of 100 real-world networks; the corpus consists of networks small enough for
the application of greedy optimization so that results from this algorithm are used as the baseline
needed for the analysis of the performance of the other methods on the same corpus of networks. We
find that relatively simple network metrics, such as adaptive degree or closeness centralities,
are able to achieve performances very close to the baseline value, thus providing good support for
the use of these metrics in large-scale problem settings....
