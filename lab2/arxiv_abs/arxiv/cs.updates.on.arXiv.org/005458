Coronary artery centerline extraction in cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) images is a prerequisite
for evaluation of stenoses and atherosclerotic plaque. We propose an algorithm that extracts coronary
artery centerlines in CCTA using a convolutional neural network (CNN). A 3D dilated CNN is trained
to predict the most likely direction and radius of an artery at any given point in a CCTA image based
on a local image patch. Starting from a single seed point placed manually or automatically anywhere
in a coronary artery, a tracker follows the vessel centerline in two directions using the predictions
of the CNN. Tracking is terminated when no direction can be identified with high certainty. The CNN
was trained using 32 manually annotated centerlines in a training set consisting of 8 CCTA images
provided in the MICCAI 2008 Coronary Artery Tracking Challenge (CAT08). Evaluation using 24 test
images of the CAT08 challenge showed that extracted centerlines had an average overlap of 93.7%
with 96 manually annotated reference centerlines. Extracted centerline points were highly accurate,
with an average distance of 0.21 mm to reference centerline points. In a second test set consisting
of 50 CCTA scans, 5,448 markers in the coronary arteries were used as seed points to extract single
centerlines. This showed strong correspondence between extracted centerlines and manually placed
markers. In a third test set containing 36 CCTA scans, fully automatic seeding and centerline extraction
led to extraction of on average 92% of clinically relevant coronary artery segments. The proposed
method is able to accurately and efficiently determine the direction and radius of coronary arteries.
The method can be trained with limited training data, and once trained allows fast automatic or interactive
extraction of coronary artery trees from CCTA images.
