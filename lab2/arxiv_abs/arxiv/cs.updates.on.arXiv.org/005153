A conflict-free k-coloring of a graph assigns one of k different colors to some of the vertices such
that, for every vertex v, there is a color that is assigned to exactly one vertex among v and v's neighbors.
Such colorings have applications in wireless networking, robotics, and geometry, and are well-studied
in graph theory. Here we study the natural problem of the conflict-free chromatic number chi_CF(G)
(the smallest k for which conflict-free k-colorings exist). We provide results both for closed
neighborhoods N[v], for which a vertex v is a member of its neighborhood, and for open neighborhoods
N(v), for which vertex v is not a member of its neighborhood. For closed neighborhoods, we prove the
conflict-free variant of the famous Hadwiger Conjecture: If an arbitrary graph G does not contain
K_{k+1} as a minor, then chi_CF(G) <= k. For planar graphs, we obtain a tight worst-case bound: three
colors are sometimes necessary and always sufficient. We also give a complete characterization
of the computational complexity of conflict-free coloring. Deciding whether chi_CF(G)<= 1 is
NP-complete for planar graphs G, but polynomial for outerplanar graphs. Furthermore, deciding
whether chi_CF(G)<= 2 is NP-complete for planar graphs G, but always true for outerplanar graphs.
For the bicriteria problem of minimizing the number of colored vertices subject to a given bound
k on the number of colors, we give a full algorithmic characterization in terms of complexity and
approximation for outerplanar and planar graphs. For open neighborhoods, we show that every planar
bipartite graph has a conflict-free coloring with at most four colors; on the other hand, we prove
that for k in {1,2,3}, it is NP-complete to decide whether a planar bipartite graph has a conflict-free
k-coloring. Moreover, we establish that any general} planar graph has a conflict-free coloring
with at most eight colors.
