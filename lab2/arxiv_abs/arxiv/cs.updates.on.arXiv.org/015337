In an election, we are given a set of voters, each having a preference list over a set of candidates,
that are distributed on a social network. We consider a scenario where voters may change their preference
lists as a consequence of the messages received by their neighbors in a social network. Specifically,
we consider a political campaign that spreads messages in a social network in support or against
a given candidate and the spreading follows a dynamic model for information diffusion. When a message
reaches a voter, this latter changes its preference list according to an update rule. The election
control problem asks to find a bounded set of nodes to be the starter of a political campaign in support
(constructive problem) or against (destructive problem) a given target candidate $c$, in such
a way that the margin of victory of $c$ w.r.t. its most voted opponents is maximized. It has been shown
that several variants of the problem can be solved within a constant factor approximation of the
optimum, which shows that controlling elections by means of social networks is doable and constitutes
a real problem for modern democracies. Most of the literature, however, focuses on the case of single-winner
elections. In this paper, we define the election control problem in social networks for "multi-winner
elections" with the aim of modeling parliamentarian elections. Differently from the single-winner
case, we show that the multi-winner election control problem is NP-hard to approximate within any
factor in both constructive and destructive cases. We then study a relaxation of the problem where
votes are aggregated on the basis of parties (instead of single candidates), which is a variation
of the so-called "straight-party voting" used in some real parliamentarian elections. We show
that the latter problem remains NP-hard but can be approximated within a constant factor.
