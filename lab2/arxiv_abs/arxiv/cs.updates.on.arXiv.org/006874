In this paper, we propose a new method to tackle the mapping challenge from time-series data to spatial
image in the field of seismic exploration, i.e., reconstructing the velocity model directly from
seismic data by deep neural networks (DNNs). The conventional way to address this ill-posed seismic
inversion problem is through iterative algorithms, which suffer from poor nonlinear mapping and
strong non-uniqueness. Other attempts may either import human intervention errors or underuse
seismic data. The challenge for DNNs mainly lies in the weak spatial correspondence, the uncertain
reflection-reception relationship between seismic data and velocity model as well as the time-varying
property of seismic data. To approach these challenges, we propose an end-to-end Seismic Inversion
Networks (SeisInvNet for short) with novel components to make the best use of all seismic data. Specifically,
we start with every seismic trace and enhance it with its neighborhood information, its observation
setup and global context of its corresponding seismic profile. Then from enhanced seismic traces,
the spatially aligned feature maps can be learned and further concatenated to reconstruct velocity
model. In general, we let every seismic trace contribute to the reconstruction of the whole velocity
model by finding spatial correspondence. The proposed SeisInvNet consistently produces improvements
over the baselines and achieves promising performance on our proposed SeisInv dataset according
to various evaluation metrics, and the inversion results are more consistent with the target from
the aspects of velocity value, subsurface structure and geological interface. In addition to the
superior performance, the mechanism is also carefully discussed, and some potential problems
are identified for further study.
