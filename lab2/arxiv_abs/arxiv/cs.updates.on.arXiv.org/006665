This paper is concerned with the problem of broadcasting information from a source node to every
node in an ad-hoc network. Flooding, as a broadcast mechanism, involves each node forwarding any
packet it receives to all its neighbours. This results in excessive transmissions and thus a high
energy expenditure overall. Probabilistic forwarding or gossiping involves each node forwarding
a received packet to all its neighbours only with a certain probability $p$. In this paper, we study
the effect of introducing redundancy, in the form of coded packets, into a probabilistic forwarding
protocol. Specifically, we assume that the source node has $k$ data packets to broadcast, which
are encoded into $n \ge k$ coded packets, such that any $k$ of these coded packets are sufficient to
recover the original $k$ data packets. Our interest is in determining the minimum forwarding probability
$p$ for a "successful broadcast", which we take to be the event that the expected fraction of network
nodes that receive at least $k$ of the $n$ coded packets is close to 1. We examine, via simulations
and analysis of a number of different network topologies (e.g., trees, grids, random geometric
graphs), how this minimum forwarding probability, and correspondingly, the expected total number
of packet transmissions varies with the amount of redundancy added. Our simulation results indicate
that over network topologies that are highly connected, the introduction of redundancy into the
probabilistic forwarding protocol is useful, as it can significantly reduce the expected total
number of transmissions needed for a successful broadcast. On the other hand, for trees, our analysis
shows that the expected total number of transmissions needed increases with redundancy.
