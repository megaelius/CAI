A multilabeled tree (or MUL-tree) is a rooted tree in which every leaf is labelled by an element from
some set, but in which more than one leaf may be labelled by the same element of that set. In phylogenetics,
such trees are used in biogeographical studies, to study the evolution of gene families, and also
within approaches to construct phylogenetic networks. A multilabelled tree in which no leaf-labels
are repeated is called a phylogenetic tree, and one in which every label is the same is also known as
a tree-shape. In this paper, we consider the complexity of computing metrics on MUL-trees that are
obtained by extending metrics on phylogenetic trees. In particular, by restricting our attention
to tree shapes, we show that computing the metric extension on MUL-trees is NP complete for two well-known
metrics on phylogenetic trees, namely, the path-difference and Robinson Foulds distances. We
also show that the extension of the Robinson Foulds distance is fixed parameter tractable with respect
to the distance parameter. The path distance complexity result allows us to also answer an open problem
concerning the complexity of solving the quadratic assignment problem for two matrices that are
a Robinson similarity and a Robinson dissimilarity, which we show to be NP-complete. We conclude
by considering the maximum agreement subtree (MAST) distance on phylogenetic trees to MUL-trees.
Although its extension to MUL-trees can be computed in polynomial time, we show that computing its
natural generalization to more than two MUL-trees is NP-complete, although fixed-parameter tractable
in the maximum degree when the number of given trees is bounded.
