Deep learning (DL) in remote sensing has nowadays become an effective operative tool: it is largely
used in applications such as change detection, image restoration, segmentation, detection and
classification. With reference to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) domain the application of DL
techniques is not straightforward due to non trivial interpretation of SAR images, specially caused
by the presence of speckle. Several deep learning solutions for SAR despeckling have been proposed
in the last few years. Most of these solutions focus on the definition of different network architectures
with similar cost functions not involving SAR image properties. In this paper, a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a multi-objective cost function taking care of spatial and statistical
properties of the SAR image is proposed. This is achieved by the definition of a peculiar loss function
obtained by the weighted combination of three different terms. Each of this term is dedicated mainly
to one of the following SAR image characteristics: spatial details, speckle statistical properties
and strong scatterers identification. Their combination allows to balance these effects. Moreover,
a specifically designed architecture is proposed for effectively extract distinctive features
within the considered framework. Experiments on simulated and real SAR images show the accuracy
of the proposed method compared to the State-of-Art despeckling algorithms, both from quantitative
and qualitative point of view. The importance of considering such SAR properties in the cost function
is crucial for a correct noise rejection and details preservation in different underlined scenarios,
such as homogeneous, heterogeneous and extremely heterogeneous.
