In this paper, we study the formalism of unsupervised multi-class domain adaptation (multi-class
UDA), which underlies some recent algorithms whose learning objectives are only motivated empirically.
A Multi-Class Scoring Disagreement (MCSD) divergence is presented by aggregating the absolute
margin violations in multi-class classification; the proposed MCSD is able to fully characterize
the relations between any pair of multi-class scoring hypotheses. By using MCSD as a measure of domain
distance, we develop a new domain adaptation bound for multi-class UDA as well as its data-dependent,
probably approximately correct bound, which naturally suggest adversarial learning objectives
to align conditional feature distributions across the source and target domains. Consequently,
an algorithmic framework of Multi-class Domain-adversarial learning Networks (McDalNets) is
developed, whose different instantiations via surrogate learning objectives either coincide
with or resemble a few of recently popular methods, thus (partially) underscoring their practical
effectiveness. Based on our same theory of multi-class UDA, we also introduce a new algorithm of
Domain-Symmetric Networks (SymmNets), which is featured by a novel adversarial strategy of domain
confusion and discrimination. SymmNets afford simple extensions that work equally well under
the problem settings of either closed set, partial, or open set UDA. We conduct careful empirical
studies to compare different algorithms of McDalNets and our newly introduced SymmNets. Experiments
verify our theoretical analysis and show the efficacy of our proposed SymmNets. We make our implementation
codes publicly available.
