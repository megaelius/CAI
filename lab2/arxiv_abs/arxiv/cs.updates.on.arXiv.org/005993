Consider the problem of guessing the realization of a random vector $\textbf{X}$ by repeatedly
submitting queries (guesses) of the form "Is $\textbf{X}$ equal to $\textbf{x}$?" until an affirmative
answer is obtained. In this setup, a key figure of merit is the number of queries required until the
right vector is identified, a number that is termed the \emph{guesswork}. Typically, one wishes
to devise a guessing strategy which minimizes a certain guesswork moment. In this work, we study
a universal, decentralized scenario where the guesser does not know the distribution of $\textbf{X}$,
and is not allowed to use a strategy which prepares a list of words to be guessed in advance, or even
remember which words were already used. Such a scenario is useful, for example, if bots within a Botnet
carry out a brute-force attack in order to guess a password or decrypt a message, yet cannot coordinate
the guesses between them or even know how many bots actually participate in the attack. We devise
universal decentralized guessing strategies, first, for memoryless sources, and then generalize
them for finite-state sources. In each case, we derive the guessing exponent, and then prove its
asymptotic optimality by deriving a compatible converse bound. The strategies are based on randomized
guessing using a universal distribution. We also extend the results to guessing with side information.
Finally, for all above scenarios, we design efficient algorithms in order to sample from the universal
distributions, resulting in strategies which do not depend on the source distribution, are efficient
to implement, and can be used asynchronously by multiple agents.
