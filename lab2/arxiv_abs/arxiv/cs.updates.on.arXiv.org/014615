A key motivation to fasten roll-out of electric vehicles (EVs) to the market is to implement Vehicle-to-Grid
(V2G) functionalities. With V2G in place, EV owners can have an extra freedom to interact their battery
energy with power grids, namely by selling their energy to the grid when their EVs are not in use. On
the other hand, EV aggregators and utility companies can leverage the flexibility of the collected
energy to implement various ancillary services to the grids, which may significantly reduce costs
of, for instance, running spinning reserve of traditional power plants on the grid side. However,
this extra freedom also poses practical challenges in terms of how to devise a discharging strategy
for a group of EVs that is fair and in some sense optimal. In this paper, we present a new design of EV
discharging strategy in a typical V2G energy trading framework whilst leveraging the whale optimization
algorithm in a decentralized manner, a metaheuristic algorithm that has been shown effective in
solving large-scale centralized optimization problems. We illustrate that by using basic ideas
of the optimization theory, one can design an EV discharging strategy in a fair, optimal and privacy-aware
manner, where the privacy refers to the fact that some critical information of an EV should be preserved
locally and such key information should not be revealed to a central computing node during V2G. The
fairness implies that some trade-offs should be achieved while balancing the revenue of V2G and
inconvenience to vehicle owners. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the efficacy
of our proposed algorithm and the devised strategy.
