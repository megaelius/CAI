For $k\geq 3$, a k-rollercoaster is a sequence of numbers whose every maximal contiguous subsequence,
that is increasing or decreasing, has length at least $k$; $3$-rollercoasters are called simply
rollercoasters. Given a sequence of distinct numbers, we are interested in computing its maximum-length
(not necessarily contiguous) subsequence that is a $k$-rollercoaster. Biedl et al. [ICALP 2018]
have shown that each sequence of $n$ distinct real numbers contains a rollercoaster of length at
least $\lceil n/2\rceil$ for $n>7$, and that a longest rollercoaster contained in such a sequence
can be computed in $O(n\log n)$-time. They have also shown that every sequence of $n\geq (k-1)^2+1$
distinct real numbers contains a $k$-rollercoaster of length at least $\frac{n}{2(k-1)}-\frac{3k}{2}$,
and gave an $O(nk\log n)$-time algorithm computing a longest $k$-rollercoaster in a sequence of
length $n$. In this paper, we give an $O(nk^2)$-time algorithm computing the length of a longest
$k$-rollercoaster contained in a sequence of $n$ distinct real numbers; hence, for constant $k$,
our algorithm computes the length of a longest $k$-rollercoaster in optimal linear time. The algorithm
can be easily adapted to output the respective $k$-rollercoaster. In particular, this improves
the results of Biedl et al. [ICALP 2018], by showing that a longest rollercoaster can be computed
in optimal linear time. We also present an algorithm computing the length of a longest $k$-rollercoaster
in $O(n \log^2 n)$-time, that is, subquadratic even for large values of $k\leq n$. Again, the rollercoaster
can be easily retrieved. Finally, we show an $\Omega(n \log k)$ lower bound for the number of comparisons
in any comparison-based algorithm computing the length of a longest $k$-rollercoaster.
