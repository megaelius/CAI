In this study, we attempt to add to the literature of Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) security
by incorporating the security vulnerabilities and countermeasures of the Vehicular Ad hoc Networks
(VANETs) and their access technologies. Compounding VANETs and modern vehicles will allow adversaries
to gain access to the in-vehicle networks and take control of vehicles remotely to use them as a target
or a foothold. Extensive attention has been given to the security breaches in VANETs and in-vehicle
networks in literature but there is a gap in literature to assess the security vulnerabilities associated
with VANETs access technologies. That is, in this paper we contribute to the CAV security literature
in threefold. First, we synthesize the current literature in order to investigate security attacks
and countermeasures on VANETs as an ad hoc network. Second, we survey security challenges that emerge
from application of different VANETs access technologies. To augment this discussion, we investigate
security solutions to thwart adversaries to compromise the access technologies. Third, we provide
a detailed comparison of different access technologies performance, security challenges and
propound heterogeneous technologies to achieve the highest security and best performance in VANETs.
These access technologies extend from DSRC, Satellite Radio, and Bluetooth to VLC and 5G. The outcome
of this study is of critical importance, because of two main reasons: (1) independent studies on
security of VANETs on different strata need to come together and to be covered from a whole end-to-end
system perspective, (2) adversaries taking control of the VANETs entities will compromise the
safety, privacy, and security of the road users and will be followed by legal exposures, as well as
data, time and monetary losses.
