Digital twin technology has a huge potential for widespread applications in different industrial
sectors such as infrastructure, aerospace, and automotive. However, practical adoptions of this
technology have been slower, mainly due to a lack of application-specific details. Here we focus
on a digital twin framework for linear single-degree-of-freedom structural dynamic systems evolving
in two different operational time scales in addition to its intrinsic dynamic time-scale. Our approach
strategically separates into two components -- (a) a physics-based nominal model for data processing
and response predictions, and (b) a data-driven machine learning model for the time-evolution
of the system parameters. The physics-based nominal model is system-specific and selected based
on the problem under consideration. On the other hand, the data-driven machine learning model is
generic. For tracking the multi-scale evolution of the system parameters, we propose to exploit
a mixture of experts as the data-driven model. Within the mixture of experts model, Gaussian Process
(GP) is used as the expert model. The primary idea is to let each expert track the evolution of the system
parameters at a single time-scale. For learning the hyperparameters of the `mixture of experts
using GP', an efficient framework the exploits expectation-maximization and sequential Monte
Carlo sampler is used. Performance of the digital twin is illustrated on a multi-timescale dynamical
system with stiffness and/or mass variations. The digital twin is found to be robust and yields reasonably
accurate results. One exciting feature of the proposed digital twin is its capability to provide
reasonable predictions at future time-steps. Aspects related to the data quality and data quantity
are also investigated.
