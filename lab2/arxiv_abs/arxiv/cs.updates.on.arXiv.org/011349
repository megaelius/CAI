Developing electrophysiological recordings of brain neuronal activity and their analysis provide
a basis for exploring the structure of brain function and nervous system investigation. The recorded
signals are typically a combination of spikes and noise. High amounts of background noise and possibility
of electric signaling recording from several neurons adjacent to the recording site have led scientists
to develop neuronal signal processing tools such as spike sorting to facilitate brain data analysis.
Spike sorting plays a pivotal role in understanding the electrophysiological activity of neuronal
networks. This process prepares recorded data for interpretations of neurons interactions and
understanding the overall structure of brain functions. Spike sorting consists of three steps:
spike detection, feature extraction, and spike clustering. There are several methods to implement
each of spike sorting steps. This paper provides a systematic comparison of various spike sorting
sub-techniques applied to real extracellularly recorded data from a rat brain basolateral amygdala.
An efficient sorted data resulted from careful choice of spike sorting sub-methods leads to better
interpretation of the brain structures connectivity under different conditions, which is a very
sensitive concept in diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. Here, spike detection
is performed by appropriate choice of threshold level via three different approaches. Feature
extraction is done through PCA and Kernel PCA methods, which Kernel PCA outperforms. We have applied
four different algorithms for spike clustering including K-means, Fuzzy C-means, Bayesian and
Fuzzy maximum likelihood estimation. As one requirement of most clustering algorithms, optimal
number of clusters is achieved through validity indices for each method. Finally, the sorting results
are evaluated using inter-spike interval histograms.
