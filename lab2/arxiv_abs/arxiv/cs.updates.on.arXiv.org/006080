We present DeepVesselNet, an architecture tailored to the challenges to be addressed when extracting
vessel networks and corresponding features in 3-D angiographic volume using deep learning. We
discuss the problems of low execution speed and high memory requirements associated with full 3-D
convolutional networks, high class imbalance arising from low percentage (less than 3%) of vessel
voxels, and unavailability of accurately annotated training data - and offer solutions that are
the building blocks of DeepVesselNet. First, we formulate 2-D orthogonal cross-hair filters which
make use of 3-D context information at a reduced computational burden. Second, we introduce a class
balancing cross-entropy score with false positive rate correction to handle the high class imbalance
and high false positive rate problems associated with existing loss functions. Finally, we generate
synthetic dataset using a computational angiogenesis model, capable of generating vascular networks
under physiological constraints on local network structure and topology, and use these data for
transfer learning. DeepVesselNet is optimized for segmenting and analyzing vessels, and we test
the performance on a range of angiographic volumes including clinical Time-of-Flight MRA data
of the human brain, as well as synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy scans of the rat
brain. Our experiments show that, by replacing 3-D filters with 2-D orthogonal cross-hair filters
in our network, we achieve over 23% improvement in speed, lower memory footprint, lower network
complexity which prevents over fitting and comparable and even sometimes higher accuracy. Our
class balancing metric is crucial for training the network and pre-training with synthetic data
helps in early convergence of the training process.
