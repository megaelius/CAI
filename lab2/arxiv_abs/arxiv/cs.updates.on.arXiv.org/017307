Purpose: The aim of this work is to shed light on the issue of reproducibility in MR image reconstruction
in the context of a challenge. Participants had to recreate the results of "Advances in sensitivity
encoding with arbitrary k-space trajectories" by Pruessmann et al. Methods: The task of the challenge
was to reconstruct radially acquired multi-coil k-space data (brain/heart) following the method
in the original paper, reproducing its key figures. Results were compared to consolidated reference
implementations created after the challenge, accounting for the two most common programming languages
used in the submissions (Matlab/Python). Results: Visually, differences between submissions
were small. Pixel-wise differences originated from image orientation, assumed field-of-view
or resolution. The reference implementations were in good agreement, both visually and in terms
of image similarity metrics. Discussion and Conclusion: While the description level of the published
algorithm enabled participants to reproduce CG-SENSE in general, details of the implementation
varied, e.g., density compensation or Tikhonov regularization. Implicit assumptions about the
data lead to further differences, emphasizing the importance of sufficient meta-data accompanying
open data sets. Defining reproducibility quantitatively turned out to be non-trivial for this
image reconstruction challenge, in the absence of ground-truth results. Typical similarity measures
like NMSE of SSIM were misled by image intensity scaling and outlier pixels. Thus, to facilitate
reproducibility, researchers are encouraged to publish code and data alongside the original paper.
Future methodological papers on MR image reconstruction might benefit from the consolidated reference
implementations of CG-SENSE presented here, as a benchmark for methods comparison.
