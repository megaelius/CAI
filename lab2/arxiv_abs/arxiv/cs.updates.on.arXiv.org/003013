Blind image deblurring, i.e., deblurring without knowledge of the blur kernel, is a highly ill-posed
problem. The problem can be solved in two parts: i) estimate a blur kernel from the blurry image, and
ii) given estimated blur kernel, de-convolve blurry input to restore the target image. In this paper,
we propose a graph-based blind image deblurring algorithm by interpreting an image patch as a signal
on a weighted graph. Specifically, we first argue that a skeleton image---a proxy that retains the
strong gradients of the target but smooths out the details---can be used to accurately estimate
the blur kernel and has a unique bi-modal edge weight distribution. Then, we design a reweighted
graph total variation (RGTV) prior that can efficiently promote a bi-modal edge weight distribution
given a blurry patch. Further, to analyze RGTV in the graph frequency domain, we introduce a new weight
function to represent RGTV as a graph $l_1$-Laplacian regularizer. This leads to a graph spectral
filtering interpretation of the prior with desirable properties, including robustness to noise
and blur, strong piecewise smooth (PWS) filtering and sharpness promotion. Minimizing a blind
image deblurring objective with RGTV results in a non-convex non-differentiable optimization
problem. We leverage the new graph spectral interpretation for RGTV to design an efficient algorithm
that solves for the skeleton image and the blur kernel alternately. Specifically for Gaussian blur,
we propose a further speedup strategy for blind Gaussian deblurring using accelerated graph spectral
filtering. Finally, with the computed blur kernel, recent non-blind image deblurring algorithms
can be applied to restore the target image. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm
successfully restores latent sharp images and outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively
and qualitatively.
