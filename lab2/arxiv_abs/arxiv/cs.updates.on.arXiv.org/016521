Submodular function maximization has been a central topic in the theoretical computer science
community over the last decade. Plenty of well-performing approximation algorithms have been
designed for the maximization of monotone/non-monotone submodular functions over a variety of
constraints. In this paper, we consider the submodular multiple knapsack problem (SMKP), which
is the submodular version of the well-studied multiple knapsack problem (MKP). Roughly speaking,
the problem asks to maximize a monotone submodular function over multiple bins (knapsacks). Recently,
Fairstein et al. [13] presented a tight $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation randomized algorithm
for SMKP. Their algorithm is based on the continuous greedy technique which inherently involves
randomness. However, the deterministic algorithm of this problem has not been understood very
well previously. In this paper, we present deterministic algorithms with improved approximation
ratios for SMKP. We first consider the case when the number of bins is a constant and provide a simple
combinatorial deterministic algorithm with an optimal $(1-1/e)$ ratio. Previously, a randomized
approximation algorithm obtained a $(1 - 1/e-\epsilon)$ approximation ratio based on the involved
continuous greedy technique. We then generalize the result to arbitrary number of bins. When the
capacity of bins are identical, we design a combinatorial and deterministic algorithm which achieves
an almost tight approximation ratio $(1 - 1 / e-\epsilon)$. In the general case, we provide a $(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm which is also combinatorial and deterministic. We finally boost this algorithm to a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$
randomized algorithm for the general case, thus matching the result of Fairstein et al. [13].
