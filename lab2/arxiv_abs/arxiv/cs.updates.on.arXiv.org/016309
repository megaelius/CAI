Security and privacy of the users have become significant concerns due to the involvement of the
Internet of things (IoT) devices in numerous applications. Cyber threats are growing at an explosive
pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet
is a product for hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce accurate
outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can be used to predict and detect
vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming
popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been
conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security
or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on
efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and
BC techniques. In this paper, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years,
starting from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BCtechniques
in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported
in the past twelve years in the IoT domain. Then, we classify the literature on security and privacy
efforts based on ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. Finally, we identify and illuminate
several challenges and future research directions in using ML algorithms and BC techniques to address
security and privacy issues in the IoT domain.
