Convolutional Neural Networks have reached extremely high performances on the Face Recognition
task. Largely used datasets, such as VGGFace2, focus on gender, pose and age variations trying to
balance them to achieve better results. However, the fact that images have different resolutions
is not usually discussed and resize to 256 pixels before cropping is used. While specific datasets
for very low resolution faces have been proposed, less attention has been payed on the task of cross-resolution
matching. Such scenarios are of particular interest for forensic and surveillance systems in which
it usually happens that a low-resolution probe has to be matched with higher-resolution galleries.
While it is always possible to either increase the resolution of the probe image or to reduce the size
of the gallery images, to the best of our knowledge an extensive experimentation of cross-resolution
matching was missing in the recent deep learning based literature. In the context of low- and cross-resolution
Face Recognition, the contributions of our work are: i) we proposed a training method to fine-tune
a state-of-the-art model in order to make it able to extract resolution-robust deep features; ii)
we tested our models on the benchmark datasets IJB-B/C considering images at both full and low resolutions
in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed training algorithm. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work testing extensively the performance of a FR model in a cross-resolution scenario;
iii) we tested our models on the low resolution and low quality datasets QMUL-SurvFace and TinyFace
and showed their superior performances, even though we did not train our model on low-resolution
faces only and our main focus was cross-resolution; iv) we showed that our approach can be more effective
with respect to preprocessing faces with super resolution techniques.
