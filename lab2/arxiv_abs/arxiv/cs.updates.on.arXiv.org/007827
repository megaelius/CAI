Raman spectroscopy's capability to provide meaningful composition predictions is heavily reliant
on a pre-processing step to remove insignificant spectral variation. This is crucial in biofluid
analysis. Widespread adoption of diagnostics using Raman requires a robust model which can withstand
routine spectra discrepancies due to unavoidable variations such as age, diet, and medical background.
A wealth of pre-processing methods are available, and it is often up to trial-and-error or user experience
to select the method which gives the best results. This process can be incredibly time consuming
and inconsistent for multiple operators. In this study we detail a method to analyze the statistical
variability within a set of training spectra and determine suitability to form a robust model. This
allows us to selectively qualify or exclude a pre-processing method, predetermine robustness,
and simultaneously identify the number of components which will form the best predictive model.
We demonstrate the ability of this technique to improve predictive models of two artificial biological
fluids. Raman spectroscopy is ideal for noninvasive, nondestructive analysis. Routine health
monitoring which maximizes comfort is increasingly crucial, particularly in epidemic-level
diabetes diagnoses. High variability in spectra of biological samples can hinder Raman's adoption
for these methods. Our technique allows the decision of optimal pre-treatment method to be determined
for the operator; model performance is no longer a function of user experience. We foresee this statistical
technique being an instrumental element to widening the adoption of Raman as a monitoring tool in
a field of biofluid analysis.
