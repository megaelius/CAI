The goal of this paper is to advance an extensible theory of living systems using an approach to biomathematics
and biocomputation that suitably addresses self-organized, self-referential and anticipatory
systems with multi-temporal multi-agents. Our first step is to provide foundations for modelling
of emergent and evolving dynamic multi-level organic complexes and their sustentative processes
in artificial and natural life systems. Main applications are in life sciences, medicine, ecology
and astrobiology, as well as robotics, industrial automation and man-machine interface. Since
2011 over 100 scientists from a number of disciplines have been exploring a substantial set of theoretical
frameworks for a comprehensive theory of life known as Integral Biomathics. That effort identified
the need for a robust core model of organisms as dynamic wholes, using advanced and adequately computable
mathematics. The work described here for that core combines the advantages of a situation and context
aware multivalent computational logic for active self-organizing networks, Wandering Logic
Intelligence (WLI), and a multi-scale dynamic category theory, Memory Evolutive Systems (MES),
hence WLIMES. This is presented to the modeller via a formal augmented reality language as a first
step towards practical modelling and simulation of multi-level living systems. Initial work focuses
on the design and implementation of this visual language and calculus (VLC) and its graphical user
interface. The results will be integrated within the current methodology and practices of theoretical
biology and (personalized) medicine to deepen and to enhance the holistic understanding of life.
