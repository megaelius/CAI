The construction industry has demonstrated a high frequency and severity of accidents. Construction
accidents are the result of the interaction between unsafe work conditions and workers unsafe behaviors.
Given this relation, perceived risk is determined by an individual response to a potential work
hazard during the work. As such, risk perception is critical to understand workers unsafe behaviors.
Established methods of assessing workers perceived risk have mainly relied on surveys and interviews.
However, these post-hoc methods, which are limited to monitoring dynamic changes in risk perception
and conducting surveys at a construction site, may prove cumbersome to workers. Additionally,
these methods frequently suffer from self-reported bias. To overcome the limitations of previous
subjective measures, this study aims to develop a framework for the objective and continuous prediction
of construction workers perceived risk using physiological signals [e.g., electrodermal activity
(EDA)] acquired from workers wristband-type biosensors. To achieve this objective, physiological
signals were collected from eight construction workers while they performed regular tasks in the
field. Various filtering methods were applied to exclude noises recorded in the signal and to extract
various features of the signals as workers experienced different risk levels. Then, a supervised
machine-learning model was trained to explore the applicability of the collected physiological
signals for the prediction of risk perception. The results showed that features based on EDA data
collected from wristbands are feasible and useful to the process of continuously monitoring workers
perceived risk during ongoing work. This study contributes to an in-depth understanding of construction
workers perceived risk by developing a noninvasive means of continuously monitoring workers perceived
risk.
