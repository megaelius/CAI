The COVID-19 pandemic has had a wide-ranging impact on information workers such as higher stress
levels, increased workloads, new workstreams, and more caregiving responsibilities during lockdown.
COVID-19 also caused the overwhelming majority of information workers to rapidly shift to working
from home (WFH). The central question this work addresses is: can we isolate the effects of WFH on
information workers' collaboration activities from all other factors, especially the other effects
of COVID-19? This is important because in the future, WFH will likely to be more common than it was
prior to the pandemic. We use difference-in-differences (DiD), a causal identification strategy
commonly used in the social sciences, to control for unobserved confounding factors and estimate
the causal effect of WFH. Our analysis relies on measuring the difference in changes between those
who WFH prior to COVID-19 and those who did not. Our preliminary results suggest that on average,
people spent more time on collaboration in April (Post WFH mandate) than in February (Pre WFH mandate),
but this is primarily due to factors other than WFH, such as lockdowns during the pandemic. The change
attributable to WFH specifically is in the opposite direction: less time on collaboration and more
focus time. This reversal shows the importance of using causal inference: a simple analysis would
have resulted in the wrong conclusion. We further find that the effect of WFH is moderated by individual
remote collaboration experience prior to WFH. Meanwhile, the medium for collaboration has also
shifted due to WFH: instant messages were used more, whereas scheduled meetings were used less.
We discuss design implications -- how future WFH may affect focused work, collaborative work, and
creative work.
