This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless sensor network, in which
one UAV flies in the sky to collect the data transmitted from a set of sensors via distributed beamforming.
We consider two scenarios with delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive applications, in which the
sensors send the common/shared messages to the UAV via adaptive- and fixed-rate transmissions,
respectively. For the two scenarios, we aim to maximize the average data-rate throughput and minimize
the transmission outage probability, respectively, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory
design and the sensors' transmit power allocation over time, subject to the UAV's flight speed constraints
and the sensors' individual average power constraints. However, the two formulated problems are
both non-convex and thus generally difficult to be optimally solved. To tackle this issue, we first
consider the relaxed problems in the ideal case with the UAV's flight speed constraints ignored,
for which the well-structured optimal solutions are obtained to reveal the fundamental performance
upper bounds. It is shown that for the two approximate problems, the optimal trajectory solutions
have the same multi-location-hovering structure, but with different optimal power allocation
strategies. Next, for the general problems with the UAV's flight speed constraints considered,
we propose efficient algorithms to obtain high-quality solutions by using the techniques from
convex optimization and approximation. Finally, numerical results show that our proposed designs
significantly outperform other benchmark schemes, in terms of the achieved data-rate throughput
and outage probability under the two scenarios. It is also observed that when the mission period
becomes sufficiently long, our proposed designs approach the performance upper bounds when the
UAV's flight speed constraints are ignored.
