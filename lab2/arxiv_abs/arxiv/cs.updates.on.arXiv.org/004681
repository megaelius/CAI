The environmental impacts of medium to large scale buildings receive substantial attention in
research, industry, and media. This paper studies the energy savings potential of a commercial
soccer stadium during day-to-day operation. Buildings of this kind are characterized by special
purpose system installations like grass heating systems and by event-driven usage patterns. This
work presents a methodology to holistically analyze the stadiums characteristics and integrate
its existing instrumentation into a Cyber-Physical System, enabling to deploy different control
strategies flexibly. In total, seven different strategies for controlling the studied stadiums
grass heating system are developed and tested in operation. Experiments in winter season 2014/2015
validated the strategies impacts within the real operational setup of the Commerzbank Arena, Frankfurt,
Germany. With 95% confidence, these experiments saved up to 66% of median daily weather-normalized
energy consumption. Extrapolated to an average heating season, this corresponds to savings of
775 MWh and 148 t of CO2 emissions. In winter 2015/2016 an additional predictive nighttime heating
experiment targeted lower temperatures, which increased the savings to up to 85%, equivalent to
1 GWh (197 t CO2) in an average winter. Beyond achieving significant energy savings, the different
control strategies also met the target temperature levels to the satisfaction of the stadiums operational
staff. While the case study constitutes a significant part, the discussions dedicated to the transferability
of this work to other stadiums and other building types show that the concepts and the approach are
of general nature. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the first successful application of Deep
Belief Networks to regress and predict the thermal evolution of building systems.
