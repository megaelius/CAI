The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that allows a fine-grained and autonomous control
of the surrounding environment. This is achieved through a large number of devices that collaboratively
perform complex tasks. To date, IoT networks are used in a variety of critical scenarios and therefore
their security has become a primary concern. A robust technique to enhance the integrity of remote
devices is called Remote Attestation (RA). However, classic RA schemes require a central and powerful
entity, called Verifier, that manages the entire process of attestation. This makes the entire
system dependent on an external entity and inevitably introduces a single point of failure. In our
work, we present SAFE^d: the first concrete solution to self-attest autonomous networks of heterogeneous
embedded devices. SAFE d overcomes the limitations of the previous works by spreading the duties
of the Verifier among all the devices in a scalable way. In our schema, the information needed for
the attestation phase is replicated inside the network, thus raising the bar to accomplish an attack.
As a result, the IoT network can self-inspect its integrity and self-recover in case of attack, without
the need of an external entity. Our proposal exploits the security guarantees offered by ARM TrustZone
chips to perform a decentralized attestation protocol based on an enhanced version of a distributed
hash table. We implemented a prototype of SAFE d for the Raspberry Pi platform to evaluate the feasibility
and the security properties of our protocol. Moreover, we measured the scalable properties of SAFE
d by using a large network of virtual devices. The results show that SAFE d can detect infected devices
and recover up to 99.7% of its initial status in case of faults or attacks. Moreover, we managed to
protect 50 devices with a logarithmic overhead on the network and the devices' memory.
