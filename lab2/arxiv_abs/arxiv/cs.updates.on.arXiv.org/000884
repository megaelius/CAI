The inefficiency of the cellular-network architecture has prevented the promising theoretic
gains of communication technologies, such as network MIMO, massive MIMO and distributed antennas,
from fully materializing in practice. The revolutionary cell-less cloud radio access networks
(C-RANs) are designed to overcome the drawbacks of cellular networks. In C-RANs, centralized cloud
signal processing and minimum onsite hardware make it possible to deploy ubiquitous distributed
antennas and coordinate them to form a gigantic array, called the ubiquitous array (UA). This paper
develops a framework for designing and analyzing the UA communication techniques based on a geometric
model. Specifically, the UA is modeled as a continuous circular array enclosing target mobiles
and free-space propagation is assumed. First, exploiting the fact that the UA channels are induced
by mobile locations, a novel channel estimation scheme is proposed that translates multiuser channel
estimation into peak detection of superimposed Bessel functions of mobile separation distances.
By exploiting the UA's gigantic circular structure, this scheme suppresses noise by averaging
and requires only single pilot symbols. Moreover, it is proved that estimation errors due to interference
can be eliminated by using orthogonal pilot sequences instead of single symbols. Next, schemes
are designed for UA data transmission including channel conjugate and multiuser phase mode (MU-PM)
transmissions. In particular, for MU-PM transmission, the proposed precoder for each mobile properly
excites different phase modes of the UA to avoid interference to other mobiles.
