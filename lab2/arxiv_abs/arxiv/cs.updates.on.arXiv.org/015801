The flow regime of micro flow varies from collisionless regime to hydrodynamic regime according
to the Knudsen number. On the kinetic scale, the dynamics of micro flow can be described by the linearized
kinetic equation. In the continuum regime, hydrodynamic equations such as linearized Navier-Stokes
equations and Euler equations can be derived from the linearized kinetic equation by the Chapman-Enskog
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, based on the linearized kinetic equation we are going to propose
a unified gas kinetic scheme scheme (UGKS) for micro flow simulation, which is an effective multiscale
scheme in the whole micro flow regime. The important methodology of UGKS is the following. Firstly,
the evolution of microscopic distribution function is coupled with the evolution of macroscopic
flow quantities. Secondly, the numerical flux of UGKS is constructed based on the integral solution
of kinetic equation, which provides a genuinely multiscale and multidimensional numerical flux.
The UGKS recovers the linear kinetic solution in the rarefied regime, and converges to the linear
hydrodynamic solution in the continuum regime. An outstanding feature of UGKS is its capability
of capturing the accurate viscous solution even when the cell size is much larger than the kinetic
kinetic length scale, such as the capturing of the viscous boundary layer with a cell size ten times
larger than the particle mean free path. Such a multiscale property is called unified preserving
(UP) which has been studied in \cite{guo2019unified}. In this paper, we are also going to give a mathematical
proof for the UP property of UGKS.
