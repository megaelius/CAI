Bone fragility and fracture caused by osteoporosis or injury are prevalent in adults over the age
of 50 and can reduce their quality of life. Hence, predicting the biomechanical bone strength, specifically
of the proximal femur, through non-invasive imaging-based methods is an important goal for the
diagnosis of Osteoporosis as well as estimating fracture risk. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
has been used as a standard clinical procedure for assessment and diagnosis of bone strength and
osteoporosis through bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. However, previous studies have
shown that quantitative computer tomography (QCT) can be more sensitive and specific to trabecular
bone characterization because it reduces the overlap effects and interferences from the surrounding
soft tissue and cortical shell. This study proposes a new method to predict the bone strength of proximal
femur specimens from quantitative multi-detector computer tomography (MDCT) images. Texture
analysis methods such as conventional statistical moments (BMD mean), Isotropic Minkowski Functionals
(IMF) and Anisotropic Minkowski Functionals (AMF) are used to quantify BMD properties of the trabecular
bone micro-architecture. Combinations of these extracted features are then used to predict the
biomechanical strength of the femur specimens using sophisticated machine learning techniques
such as multiregression (MultiReg) and support vector regression with linear kernel (SVRlin).
The prediction performance achieved with these feature sets is compared to the standard approach
that uses the mean BMD of the specimens and multiregression models using root mean square error (RMSE).
