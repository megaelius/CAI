The scalable, low overhead attributes of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Internet protocols and networks lend
themselves well to being exploited by criminals to execute a large range of cybercrimes. The types
of crimes aided by P2P technology include copyright infringement, sharing of illicit images of
children, fraud, hacking/cracking, denial of service attacks and virus/malware propagation
through the use of a variety of worms, botnets, malware, viruses and P2P file sharing. This project
is focused on study of active P2P nodes along with the analysis of the undocumented communication
methods employed in many of these large unstructured networks. This is achieved through the design
and implementation of an efficient P2P monitoring and crawling toolset. The requirement for investigating
P2P based systems is not limited to the more obvious cybercrimes listed above, as many legitimate
P2P based applications may also be pertinent to a digital forensic investigation, e.g, voice over
IP, instant messaging, etc. Investigating these networks has become increasingly difficult due
to the broad range of network topologies and the ever increasing and evolving range of P2P based applications.
In this work we introduce the Universal P2P Network Investigation Framework (UP2PNIF), a framework
which enables significantly faster and less labour intensive investigation of newly discovered
P2P networks through the exploitation of the commonalities in P2P network functionality. In combination
with a reference database of known network characteristics, it is envisioned that any known P2P
network can be instantly investigated using the framework, which can intelligently determine
the best investigation methodology and greatly expedite the evidence gathering process. A proof
of concept tool was developed for conducting investigations on the BitTorrent network.
