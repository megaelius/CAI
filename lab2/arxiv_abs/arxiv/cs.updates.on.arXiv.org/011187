Clustering is a difficult and widely-studied data mining task, with many varieties of clustering
algorithms proposed in the literature. Nearly all algorithms use a similarity measure such as a
distance metric (e.g. Euclidean distance) to decide which instances to assign to the same cluster.
These similarity measures are generally pre-defined and cannot be easily tailored to the properties
of a particular dataset, which leads to limitations in the quality and the interpretability of the
clusters produced. In this paper, we propose a new approach to automatically evolving similarity
functions for a given clustering algorithm by using genetic programming. We introduce a new genetic
programming-based method which automatically selects a small subset of features (feature selection)
and then combines them using a variety of functions (feature construction) to produce dynamic and
flexible similarity functions that are specifically designed for a given dataset. We demonstrate
how the evolved similarity functions can be used to perform clustering using a graph-based representation.
The results of a variety of experiments across a range of large, high-dimensional datasets show
that the proposed approach can achieve higher and more consistent performance than the benchmark
methods. We further extend the proposed approach to automatically produce multiple complementary
similarity functions by using a multi-tree approach, which gives further performance improvements.
We also analyse the interpretability and structure of the automatically evolved similarity functions
to provide insight into how and why they are superior to standard distance metrics.
