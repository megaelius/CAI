We study a distributed sampling problem where a set of processors want to output approximately (in
the sense of asymptotically vanishing total variation distance) independent and identically
distributed samples from a given joint distribution with the help of a coordinator. We consider
two settings. In the omniscient coordinator setting, the coordinator has access to several independent
sources of randomness and each processor has access to a subset of these sources. The oblivious coordinator
setting is similar except that the coordinator does not have access to any of the shared randomness
sources. In addition, all processors and the coordinator may privately randomize. In the omniscient
coordinator setting, when the subsets at the processors are disjoint (individually shared randomness
model), we characterize the rate of communication required from the coordinator to the processors
over a multicast link. We also give an upper bound on the communication rate for the randomness-on-the-forehead
model where each processor observes all but one source of randomness and we give an achievable strategy
in the omniscient coordinator setting for the general case where the processors have access to arbitrary
subsets of sources of randomness. Also, we consider a more general model where the processors observe
components of correlated sources (with the coordinator observing all the components), where we
characterize the communication rate when all the processors wish to output the same random sequence.
In the oblivious coordinator setting, we completely characterize the trade-off region between
the communication and shared randomness rates for the general case where the processors have access
to arbitrary subsets of sources of randomness.
