To ensure the security of the general mass, crime prevention is one of the most higher priorities
for any government. An accurate crime prediction model can help the government, law enforcement
to prevent violence, detect the criminals in advance, allocate the government resources, and recognize
problems causing crimes. To construct any future-oriented tools, examine and understand the crime
patterns in the earliest possible time is essential. In this paper, I analyzed a real-world crime
and accident dataset of Denver county, USA, from January 2014 to May 2019, which containing 478,578
incidents. This project aims to predict and highlights the trends of occurrence that will, in return,
support the law enforcement agencies and government to discover the preventive measures from the
prediction rates. At first, I apply several statistical analysis supported by several data visualization
approaches. Then, I implement various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision
Tree, AdaBoost Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Neighbors
Classifiers, and 4 Ensemble Models to classify 15 different classes of crimes. The outcomes are
captured using two popular test methods: train-test split, and k-fold cross-validation. Moreover,
to evaluate the performance flawlessly, I also utilize precision, recall, F1-score, Mean Squared
Error (MSE), ROC curve, and paired-T-test. Except for the AdaBoost classifier, most of the algorithms
exhibit satisfactory accuracy. Random Forest, Decision Tree, Ensemble Model 1, 3, and 4 even produce
me more than 90% accuracy. Among all the approaches, Ensemble Model 4 presented superior results
for every evaluation basis. This study could be useful to raise the awareness of peoples regarding
the occurrence locations and to assist security agencies to predict future outbreaks of violence
in a specific area within a particular time.
