In this paper, we study the problem of compressed sensing using binary measurement matrices and
$\ell_1$-norm minimization (basis pursuit) as the recovery algorithm. We derive new upper and
lower bounds on the number of measurements to achieve robust sparse recovery with binary matrices.
We establish sufficient conditions for a column-regular binary matrix to satisfy the robust null
space property (RNSP) and show that the associated sufficient conditions % sparsity bounds for
robust sparse recovery obtained using the RNSP are better by a factor of $(3 \sqrt{3})/2 \approx
2.6$ compared to the sufficient conditions obtained using the restricted isometry property (RIP).
Next we derive universal \textit{lower} bounds on the number of measurements that any binary matrix
needs to have in order to satisfy the weaker sufficient condition based on the RNSP and show that bipartite
graphs of girth six are optimal. Then we display two classes of binary matrices, namely parity check
matrices of array codes and Euler squares, which have girth six and are nearly optimal in the sense
of almost satisfying the lower bound. In principle, randomly generated Gaussian measurement matrices
are "order-optimal". So we compare the phase transition behavior of the basis pursuit formulation
using binary array codes and Gaussian matrices and show that (i) there is essentially no difference
between the phase transition boundaries in the two cases and (ii) the CPU time of basis pursuit with
binary matrices is hundreds of times faster than with Gaussian matrices and the storage requirements
are less. Therefore it is suggested that binary matrices are a viable alternative to Gaussian matrices
for compressed sensing using basis pursuit. \end{abstract}
