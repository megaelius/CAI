Machine Translation is one of the major oldest and the most active research area in Natural Language
Processing. Currently, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) dominates the Machine Translation
research. Statistical Machine Translation is an approach to Machine Translation which uses models
to learn translation patterns directly from data, and generalize them to translate a new unseen
text. The SMT approach is largely language independent, i.e. the models can be applied to any language
pair. Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) attempts to generate translations using statistical
methods based on bilingual text corpora. Where such corpora are available, excellent results can
be attained translating similar texts, but such corpora are still not available for many language
pairs. Statistical Machine Translation systems, in general, have difficulty in handling the morphology
on the source or the target side especially for morphologically rich languages. Errors in morphology
or syntax in the target language can have severe consequences on meaning of the sentence. They change
the grammatical function of words or the understanding of the sentence through the incorrect tense
information in verb. Baseline SMT also known as Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT)
system does not use any linguistic information and it only operates on surface word form. Recent
researches shown that adding linguistic information helps to improve the accuracy of the translation
with less amount of bilingual corpora. Adding linguistic information can be done using the Factored
Statistical Machine Translation system through pre-processing steps. This paper investigates
about how English side pre-processing is used to improve the accuracy of English-Tamil SMT system.
