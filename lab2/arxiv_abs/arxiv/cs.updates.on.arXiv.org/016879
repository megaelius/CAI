Protein-ligand interactions are one of the fundamental types of molecular interactions in living
systems. Ligands are small molecules that interact with protein molecules at specific regions
on their surfaces called binding sites. Tasks such as assessment of protein functional similarity
and detection of side effects of drugs need identification of similar binding sites of disparate
proteins across diverse pathways. Machine learning methods for similarity assessment require
feature descriptors of binding sites. Traditional methods based on hand engineered motifs and
atomic configurations are not scalable across several thousands of sites. In this regard, deep
neural network algorithms are now deployed which can capture very complex input feature space.
However, one fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to structures of binding sites is
the input representation and the reference frame. We report here a novel algorithm Site2Vec that
derives reference frame invariant vector embedding of a protein-ligand binding site. The method
is based on pairwise distances between representative points and chemical compositions in terms
of constituent amino acids of a site. The vector embedding serves as a locality sensitive hash function
for proximity queries and determining similar sites. The method has been the top performer with
more than 95% quality scores in extensive benchmarking studies carried over 10 datasets and against
23 other site comparison methods. The algorithm serves for high throughput processing and has been
evaluated for stability with respect to reference frame shifts, coordinate perturbations and
residue mutations. We provide Site2Vec as a stand alone executable and a web service hosted at \url{this
