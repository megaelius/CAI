In this study we assessed the repeatability of the values of radiomics features for small prostate
tumors using test-retest? Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) images. The premise
of radiomics is that quantitative image features can serve as biomarkers characterizing disease.
For such biomarkers to be useful, repeatability is a basic requirement, meaning its value must remain
stable between two scans, if the conditions remain stable. We investigated repeatability of radiomics
features under various preprocessing and extraction configurations including various image
normalization schemes, different image pre-filtering, 2D vs 3D texture computation, and different
bin widths for image discretization. Image registration as means to re-identify regions of interest
across time points was evaluated against human-expert segmented regions in both time points. Even
though we found many radiomics features and preprocessing combinations with a high repeatability
(Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) > 0.85), our results indicate that overall the repeatability
is highly sensitive to the processing parameters (under certain configurations, it can be below
0.0). Image normalization, using a variety of approaches considered, did not result in consistent
improvements in repeatability. There was also no consistent improvement of repeatability through
the use of pre-filtering options, or by using image registration between timepoints to improve
consistency of the region of interest localization. Based on these results we urge caution when
interpreting radiomics features and advise paying close attention to the processing configuration
details of reported results. Furthermore, we advocate reporting all processing details in radiomics
studies and strongly recommend making the implementation available.
