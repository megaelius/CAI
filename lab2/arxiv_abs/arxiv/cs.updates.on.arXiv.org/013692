Recent drought and population growth are planting unprecedented demand for the use of available
limited water resources. Irrigated agriculture is one of the major consumers of freshwater. A large
amount of water in irrigated agriculture is wasted due to poor water management practices. To improve
water management in irrigated areas, models for estimation of future water requirements are needed.
Developing a model for forecasting irrigation water demand can improve water management practices
and maximise water productivity. Data mining can be used effectively to build such models. In this
study, we prepare a dataset containing information on suitable attributes for forecasting irrigation
water demand. The data is obtained from three different sources namely meteorological data, remote
sensing images and water delivery statements. In order to make the prepared dataset useful for demand
forecasting and pattern extraction, we pre-process the dataset using a novel approach based on
a combination of irrigation and data mining knowledge. We then apply and compare the effectiveness
of different data mining methods namely decision tree (DT), artificial neural networks (ANNs),
systematically developed forest (SysFor) for multiple trees, support vector machine (SVM), logistic
regression, and the traditional Evapotranspiration (ETc) methods and evaluate the performance
of these models to predict irrigation water demand. Our experimental results indicate the usefulness
of data pre-processing and the effectiveness of different classifiers. Among the six methods we
used, SysFor produces the best prediction with 97.5% accuracy followed by a decision tree with 96%
and ANN with 95% respectively by closely matching the predictions with actual water usage. Therefore,
we recommend using SysFor and DT models for irrigation water demand forecasting.
