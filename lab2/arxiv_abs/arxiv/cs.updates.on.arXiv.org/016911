The challenge of wildfire management and detection is recently gaining increased attention due
to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires worldwide. Popular fire detection techniques
such as satellite imaging and remote camera-based sensing suffer from late detection and low reliability
while early wildfire detection is a key to prevent massive fires. In this paper, we propose a novel
wildfire detection solution based on unmanned aerial vehicles assisted Internet of things (UAV-IoT)
networks. The main objective is to (1) study the performance and reliability of the UAV-IoT networks
for wildfire detection and (2) present a guideline to optimize the UAV-IoT network to improve fire
detection probability under limited budgets. We focus on optimizing the IoT devices' density and
number of UAVs covering the forest area such that a lower bound of the wildfires detection probability
is maximized within a limited time and budget. At any time after the fire ignition, the IoT devices
within a limited distance from the fire can detect it. These IoT devices can then report their measurements
only when the UAV is nearby. Discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) analysis is utilized to compute the
fire detection probability at discrete time. Before declaring fire detection, a validation state
is designed to account for IoT devices' practical limitations such as miss-detection and false
alarm probabilities. Numerical results suggest that given enough system budget, the UAV-IoT based
fire detection can offer a faster and more reliable wildfire detection solution than the state of
the art satellite imaging techniques.
