Liquid democracy is a collective decision making paradigm which lies between direct and representative
democracy. One of its main features is that voters can delegate their votes in a transitive manner
such that: A delegates to B and B delegates to C leads to A indirectly delegates to C. These delegations
can be effectively empowered by implementing liquid democracy in a social network, so that voters
can delegate their votes to any of their neighbors in the network. However, it is uncertain that such
a delegation process will lead to a stable state where all voters are satisfied with the people representing
them. We study the stability (w.r.t. voters preferences) of the delegation process in liquid democracy
and model it as a game in which the players are the voters and the strategies are their possible delegations.
We answer several questions on the equilibria of this process in any social network or in social networks
that correspond to restricted types of graphs. We show that a Nash-equilibrium may not exist, and
that it is even NP-complete to decide whether one exists or not. This holds even if the social network
is a complete graph or a bounded degree graph. We further show that this existence problem is W[1]-hard
w.r.t. the treewidth of the social network. Besides these hardness results, we demonstrate that
an equilibrium always exists whatever the preferences of the voters iff the social network is a tree.
We design a dynamic programming procedure to determine some desirable equilibria (e.g., minimizing
the dissatisfaction of the voters) in polynomial time for tree social networks. Lastly, we study
the convergence of delegation dynamics. Unfortunately, when an equilibrium exists, we show that
a best response dynamics may not converge, even if the social network is a path or a complete graph.
