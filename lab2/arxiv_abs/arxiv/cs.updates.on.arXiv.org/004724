This paper explores the co-existence of a macro cell and a small cell for heterogeneous cellular
networks, where a macro base station (MBS) and small base station (SBS) transmit to respective macro
user (MU) and small user (SU) through their shared spectrum in the face of a common eavesdropper.
We consider two spectrum sharing mechanisms, namely the overlay spectrum sharing (OSS) and underlay
spectrum sharing (USS). In the OSS, MBS and SBS take turns to access their shared spectrum. By contrast,
the USS allows MBS and SBS to simultaneously transmit over the shared spectrum with the aid of power
control for limiting their mutual interference, thus called interference-limited USS (IL-USS).
In order to take advantage of mutual interference in confusing the eavesdropper without causing
adverse effect on the MU, we propose an interference-canceled USS (IC-USS) scheme. Closed-form
expressions of overall outage probability and intercept probability are derived for OSS, IL-USS
and IC-USS schemes by taking into account both MBS-MU and SBS-SU transmissions. The secrecy diversity
analysis is also carried out by characterizing an asymptotic behavior of the overall outage probability
with a given intercept probability in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. It is shown that the
secrecy diversity gains of conventional OSS and IL-USS are zero, whereas the proposed IC-USS achieves
a higher secrecy diversity gain of one. This implies that with an arbitrarily low overall intercept
probability, the conventional OSS and IL-USS methods converge to their respective outage probability
floors, however the proposed IC-USS scheme can make the overall outage probability asymptotically
decrease to zero by simply increasing the transmit power. Additionally, numerical results demonstrate
an obvious advantage of the proposed IC-USS over OSS and IL-USS against eavesdropping.
