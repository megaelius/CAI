Polar codes were introduced in 2009 and proven to achieve the symmetric capacity of any binary-input
discrete memoryless channel under low-complexity successive cancellation decoding. In this
thesis, we construct cyclic polar codes based on a mixed-radix Cooley-Tukey decomposition of the
Galois field Fourier transform. The main results are: we can, for the first time, construct, encode
and decode polar codes that are cyclic, with their blocklength being arbitrary; for a given target
block erasure rate, we can achieve significantly higher code rates on the erasure channel than the
original polar codes, at comparable blocklengths; on the symmetric channel with only errors, we
can perform much better than equivalent rate Reed-Solomon codes with the same blocklength, by using
soft-decision decoding; and, since the codes are subcodes of higher rate RS codes, a RS decoder can
be used if suboptimal performance suffices for the application as a trade-off for higher decoding
speed. In 2010, it was shown that spatially-coupled low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes approach
the capacity of binary memoryless channels, asymptotically, with belief-propagation (BP) decoding.
In this thesis, we are interested in the finite length average performance of randomly coupled LDPC
ensembles on binary erasure channels with memory. The significant contributions of this work are:
tight lower bounds for the block erasure probability ($P_B$) under various scenarios for the burst
pattern; bounds focused on practical scenarios where a burst affects exactly one of the coupled
codes; expected error floor for the bit erasure probability ($P_b$) on the binary erasure channel;
and, characterization of the performance of random regular ensembles, on erasure channels, with
a single vector describing distinct types of size-$2$ stopping sets. All these results are verified
using Monte-Carlo simulations.
