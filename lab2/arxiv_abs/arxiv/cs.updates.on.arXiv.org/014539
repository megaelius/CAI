Due to its variety of applications in the real-world, the task of single image-based crowd counting
has received a lot of interest in the recent years. Recently, several approaches have been proposed
to address various problems encountered in crowd counting. These approaches are essentially based
on convolutional neural networks that require large amounts of data to train the network parameters.
Considering this, we introduce a new large scale unconstrained crowd counting dataset (JHU-CROWD++)
that contains "4,372" images with "1.51 million" annotations. In comparison to existing datasets,
the proposed dataset is collected under a variety of diverse scenarios and environmental conditions.
Specifically, the dataset includes several images with weather-based degradations and illumination
variations, making it a very challenging dataset. Additionally, the dataset consists of a rich
set of annotations at both image-level and head-level. Several recent methods are evaluated and
compared on this dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from this http URL . Furthermore, we propose
a novel crowd counting network that progressively generates crowd density maps via residual error
estimation. The proposed method uses VGG16 as the backbone network and employs density map generated
by the final layer as a coarse prediction to refine and generate finer density maps in a progressive
fashion using residual learning. Additionally, the residual learning is guided by an uncertainty-based
confidence weighting mechanism that permits the flow of only high-confidence residuals in the
refinement path. The proposed Confidence Guided Deep Residual Counting Network (CG-DRCN) is evaluated
on recent complex datasets, and it achieves significant improvements in errors.
