Machine learning algorithms based on deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results and
are being extensively used in different domains. However, the machine learning algorithms requires
access to raw data which is often privacy sensitive. To address this issue, we develop new techniques
to provide solutions for running deep neural networks over encrypted data. In this paper, we develop
new techniques to adopt deep neural networks within the practical limitation of current homomorphic
encryption schemes. More specifically, we focus on classification of the well-known convolutional
neural networks (CNN). First, we design methods for approximation of the activation functions
commonly used in CNNs (i.e. ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) with low degree polynomials which is essential
for efficient homomorphic encryption schemes. Then, we train convolutional neural networks with
the approximation polynomials instead of original activation functions and analyze the performance
of the models. Finally, we implement convolutional neural networks over encrypted data and measure
performance of the models. Our experimental results validate the soundness of our approach with
several convolutional neural networks with varying number of layers and structures. When applied
to the MNIST optical character recognition tasks, our approach achieves 99.52\% accuracy which
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions and is very close to the accuracy of
the best non-private version, 99.77\%. Also, it can make close to 164000 predictions per hour. We
also applied our approach to CIFAR-10, which is much more complex compared to MNIST, and were able
to achieve 91.5\% accuracy with approximation polynomials used as activation functions. These
results show that CryptoDL provides efficient, accurate and scalable privacy-preserving predictions.
