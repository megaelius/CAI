Software Defined Networking (SDN) offers flexibility to program a network based on a set of network
requirements. Programming the networks using SDN is not completely straightforward because a
programmer must deal with low level details. To solve the problem, researchers proposed a set of
network programming languages that provide a set of high level abstractions to hide low level hardware
details. Most of the proposed languages provide abstractions related to packet processing and
flows, and still require a programmer to specify low-level match-action fields to configure and
monitor a network. Recently, in an attempt to raise the level at which programmers work, researchers
have begun to investigate Intent-based, descriptive northbound interfaces. The work is still
in early stages, and further investigation is required before intent-based systems will be adopted
by enterprise networks. To help achieve the goal of moving to an intent-based design, we propose
an SDN-based network programming framework, the Open Software Defined Framework (OSDF). OSDF
provides a high level Application Programming Interface (API) that can be used by managers and network
administrators to express network requirements for applications and policies for multiple domains.
OSDF also provides a set of high level network operation services that handle common network configuration,
monitoring, and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning. OSDF is equipped with a policy conflict
management module to help a network administrator detect and resolve policy conflicts. The paper
shows how OSDF can be used and explains application-based policies. Finally, the paper reports
the results of both testbed measurements and simulations that are used to evaluate the framework
from multiple perspectives, including functionality and performance.
