This paper presents a new approach for the visualization and analysis of the spatial variability
of features of interest represented by critical points in ensemble data. Our framework, called
Persistence Atlas, enables the visualization of the dominant spatial patterns of critical points,
along with statistics regarding their occurrence in the ensemble. The persistence atlas represents
in the geometrical domain each dominant pattern in the form of a confidence map for the appearance
of critical points. As a by-product, our method also provides 2-dimensional layouts of the entire
ensemble, highlighting the main trends at a global level. Our approach is based on the new notion
of Persistence Map, a measure of the geometrical density in critical points which leverages the
robustness to noise of topological persistence to better emphasize salient features. We show how
to leverage spectral embedding to represent the ensemble members as points in a low-dimensional
Euclidean space, where distances between points measure the dissimilarities between critical
point layouts and where statistical tasks, such as clustering, can be easily carried out. Further,
we show how the notion of mandatory critical point can be leveraged to evaluate for each cluster confidence
regions for the appearance of critical points. Most of the steps of this framework can be trivially
parallelized and we show how to efficiently implement them. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the relevance of our approach. The accuracy of the confidence regions provided by the persistence
atlas is quantitatively evaluated and compared to a baseline strategy using an off-the-shelf clustering
approach. We illustrate the importance of the persistence atlas in a variety of real-life datasets,
where clear trends in feature layouts are identified and analyzed.
