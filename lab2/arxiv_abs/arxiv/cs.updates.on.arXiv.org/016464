A critical aspect of crowds' evacuation processes is the dynamism of individual decision making.
Here, we investigate how to favor a coordinated group dynamic through optimal exit-choice instructions
using behavioral strategy optimization. We propose and evaluate an adaptive guidance system (Cell-based
Crowd Evacuation, CellEVAC) that dynamically allocates colors to cells in a cell-based pedestrian
positioning infrastructure, to provide efficient exit-choice indications. The operational
module of CellEVAC implements an optimized discrete-choice model that integrates the influential
factors that would make evacuees adapt their exit choice. To optimize the model, we used a simulation-optimization
modeling framework that integrates microscopic pedestrian simulation based on the classical
Social Force Model. We paid particular attention to safety by using Pedestrian Fundamental Diagrams
that model the dynamics of the exit gates. CellEVAC has been tested in a simulated real scenario (Madrid
Arena) under different external pedestrian flow patterns that simulate complex pedestrian interactions.
Results showed that CellEVAC outperforms evacuation processes in which the system is not used,
with an exponential improvement as interactions become complex. We compared our system with an
existing approach based on Cartesian Genetic Programming. Our system exhibited a better overall
performance in terms of safety, evacuation time, and the number of revisions of exit-choice decisions.
Further analyses also revealed that Cartesian Genetic Programming generates less natural pedestrian
reactions and movements than CellEVAC. The fact that the decision logic module is built upon a behavioral
model seems to favor a more natural and effective response. We also found that our proposal has a positive
influence on evacuations even for a low compliance rate (40%).
