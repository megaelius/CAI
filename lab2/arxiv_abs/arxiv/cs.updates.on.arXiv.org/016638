Delineation of cancerous regions in gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) is a crucial diagnostic
procedure in digital pathology. This process is time-consuming because of the large search space
in the gigapixel WSIs, causing chances of omission and misinterpretation at indistinct tumor lesions.
To tackle this, the development of an automated cancerous region segmentation method is imperative.
We frame this issue as a modeling problem with partial label WSIs, where some cancerous regions may
be misclassified as benign and vice versa, producing patches with noisy labels. To learn from these
patches, we propose Self-similarity Student, combining teacher-student model paradigm with
similarity learning. Specifically, for each patch, we first sample its similar and dissimilar
patches according to spatial distance. A teacher-student model is then introduced, featuring
the exponential moving average on both student model weights and teacher predictions ensemble.
While our student model takes patches, teacher model takes all their corresponding similar and
dissimilar patches for learning robust representation against noisy label patches. Following
this similarity learning, our similarity ensemble merges similar patches' ensembled predictions
as the pseudo-label of a given patch to counteract its noisy label. On the CAMELYON16 dataset, our
method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art noise-aware learning methods by 5$\%$ and
the supervised-trained baseline by 10$\%$ in various degrees of noise. Moreover, our method is
superior to the baseline on our TVGH TURP dataset with 2$\%$ improvement, demonstrating the generalizability
to more clinical histopathology segmentation tasks.
