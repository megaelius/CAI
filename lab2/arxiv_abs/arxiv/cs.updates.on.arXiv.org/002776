There are different MV grid concepts with regard to mode of operation and protection system layout.
The increasing installation of DG raises the question if the currently used concepts are still optimal
for future power systems. We present a methodology that allows the automated calculation and comparison
of target grids within different concepts. Specifically, we consider radial grids, closed ring
grids and grids with switching stations. A target grid structure is optimized for each of those grid
concepts based on geographical information. To model a realistic planning process, compliance
with technical constraints for normal operation, contingency behaviour and reliability figures
are ensured in all grid concepts. We present a multiphase approach to solve the optimization problem
based on an iterated local search meta-heuristic. We then economically compare the grids with regards
to CAPEX and OPEX for primary and secondary equipment, to analyse which concept leads to the most
overall cost-efficient target grids. Since the methodology allows an automated evaluation of
a large number of grids, it can be used to draw general conclusions about the cost-efficiency of specific
concepts. The methodology is applied to 44 real MV grids spanning about 4800km of lines, for which
the results show that a radial grid structure is overall cost efficient compared to grid topologies
with switching stations or closed rings even in grid areas with a large DG penetration. The contribution
of this paper is threefold: first, a comprehensive methodology to compile automated target grid
plans under realistic premises is presented. Second, the practical applicability of the approach
is demonstrated with a large scale case study with a high degree of automation. And third, the results
of the case study allow to draw conclusions about the techno-economical differences of different
MV grid concepts.
