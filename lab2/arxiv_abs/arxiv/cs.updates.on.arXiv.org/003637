Edit distance is a fundamental measure of distance between strings and has been widely studied in
computer science. While the problem of estimating edit distance has been studied extensively,
the equally important question of actually producing an alignment (i.e., the sequence of edits)
has received far less attention. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that any algorithm to estimate
edit distance can be used in a black-box fashion to produce an approximate alignment of strings,
with modest loss in approximation factor and small loss in run time. Plugging in the result of Andoni,
Krauthgamer, and Onak, we obtain an alignment that is a $(\log n)^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ approximation
in time $\tilde{O}(n^{1 + \varepsilon})$. Closely related to the study of approximation algorithms
is the study of metric embeddings for edit distance. We show that min-hash techniques can be useful
in designing edit distance embeddings through three results: (1) An embedding from Ulam distance
(edit distance over permutations) to Hamming space that matches the best known distortion of $O(\log
n)$ and also implicitly encodes a sequence of edits between the strings; (2) In the case where the
edit distance between the input strings is known to have an upper bound $K$, we show that embeddings
of edit distance into Hamming space with distortion $f(n)$ can be modified in a black-box fashion
to give distortion $O(f(\operatorname{poly}(K)))$ for a class of periodic-free strings; (3)
A randomized dimension-reduction map with contraction $c$ and asymptotically optimal expected
distortion $O(c)$, improving on the previous $\tilde{O}(c^{1 + 2 / \log \log \log n})$ distortion
result of Batu, Ergun, and Sahinalp.
