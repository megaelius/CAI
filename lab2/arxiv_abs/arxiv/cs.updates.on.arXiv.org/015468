Protecting embedded security is becoming an increasingly challenging research problem for embedded
systems due to a number of emerging trends in hardware, software, networks, and applications. Without
fundamental advances in, and an understanding of embedded security it will be difficult for future
engineers to provide assurance for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology (OT)
in wide ranging applications, from home automation and autonomous transportation to medical devices
and factory floors. Common to such applications are cyberphysical risks and consequences stemming
from a lack of embedded security. The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held a one-day visioning
workshop to explore these issues. The workshop focused on five major application areas of embedded
systems, namely (1) medical/wearable devices, (2) autonomous systems (drones, vehicles, robots),
(3) smart homes, (4) industry and supply chain, and (5) critical infrastructure. This report synthesizes
the results of that workshop and develops a list of strategic goals for research and education over
the next 5-10 years. Embedded security in connected devices presents challenges that require a
broad look at the overall systems design, including human and societal dimensions as well as technical.
Particular issues related to embedded security are a subset of the overall security of the application
areas, which must also balance other design criteria such as cost, power, reliability, usability
and function. Recent trends are converging to make the security of embedded systems an increasingly
important and difficult objective, requiring new trans-disciplinary approaches to solve problems
on a 5-10 year horizon.
