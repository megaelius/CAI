In this paper, we propose a structured Robust Adaptive Dic-tionary Pair Learning (RA-DPL) framework
for the discrim-inative sparse representation learning. To achieve powerful representation
ability of the available samples, the setting of RA-DPL seamlessly integrates the robust projective
dictionary pair learning, locality-adaptive sparse representations and discriminative coding
coefficients learning into a unified learning framework. Specifically, RA-DPL improves existing
projective dictionary pair learning in four perspectives. First, it applies a sparse l2,1-norm
based metric to encode the recon-struction error to deliver the robust projective dictionary pairs,
and the l2,1-norm has the potential to minimize the error. Sec-ond, it imposes the robust l2,1-norm
clearly on the analysis dictionary to ensure the sparse property of the coding coeffi-cients rather
than using the costly l0/l1-norm. As such, the robustness of the data representation and the efficiency
of the learning process are jointly considered to guarantee the effi-cacy of our RA-DPL. Third,
RA-DPL conceives a structured reconstruction weight learning paradigm to preserve the local structures
of the coding coefficients within each class clearly in an adaptive manner, which encourages to
produce the locality preserving representations. Fourth, it also considers improving the discriminating
ability of coding coefficients and dictionary by incorporating a discriminating function, which
can ensure high intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in the code space. Extensive
experiments show that our RA-DPL can obtain superior performance over other state-of-the-arts.
