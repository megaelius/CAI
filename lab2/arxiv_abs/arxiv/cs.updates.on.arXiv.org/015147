Long short-term memory(LSTM) units on sequence-based models are being used in translation, question-answering
systems, classification tasks due to their capability of learning long-term dependencies. In
Natural language generation, LSTM networks are providing impressive results on text generation
models by learning language models with grammatically stable syntaxes. But the downside is that
the network does not learn about the context. The network only learns the input-output function
and generates text given a set of input words irrespective of pragmatics. As the model is trained
without any such context, there is no semantic consistency among the generated sentences. The proposed
model is trained to generate text for a given set of input words along with a context vector. A context
vector is similar to a paragraph vector that grasps the semantic meaning(context) of the sentence.
Several methods of extracting the context vectors are proposed in this work. While training a language
model, in addition to the input-output sequences, context vectors are also trained along with the
inputs. Due to this structure, the model learns the relation among the input words, context vector
and the target word. Given a set of context terms, a well trained model will generate text around the
provided context. Based on the nature of computing context vectors, the model has been tried out
with two variations (word importance and word clustering). In the word clustering method, the suitable
embeddings among various domains are also explored. The results are evaluated based on the semantic
closeness of the generated text to the given context.
