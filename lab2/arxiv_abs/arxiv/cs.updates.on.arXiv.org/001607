Homeostatic plasticity is a stabilizing mechanism commonly observed in real neural systems that
allows neurons to maintain their activity around a functional operating point. This phenomenon
can be used in neuromorphic systems to compensate for slowly changing conditions or chronic shifts
in the system configuration. However, to avoid interference with other adaptation or learning
processes active in the neuromorphic system, it is important that the homeostatic plasticity mechanism
operates on time scales that are much longer than conventional synaptic plasticity ones. In this
paper we present an ultra-low leakage circuit, integrated into an automatic gain control scheme,
that can implement the synaptic scaling homeostatic process over extremely long time scales. Synaptic
scaling consists in globally scaling the synaptic weights of all synapses impinging onto a neuron
maintaining their relative differences, to preserve the effects of learning. The scheme we propose
controls the global gain of analog log-domain synapse circuits to keep the neuron's average firing
rate constant around a set operating point, over extremely long time scales. To validate the proposed
scheme, we implemented the ultra-low leakage synaptic scaling homeostatic plasticity circuit
in a standard 0.18 $\mu$m Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process, and integrated
it in an array of dynamic synapses connected to an adaptive integrate and fire neuron. The circuit
occupies a silicon area of 84 $\mu$m x 22 $\mu$m and consumes approximately 10.8 nW with a 1.8 V supply
voltage. We present experimental results from the homeostatic circuit and demonstrate how it can
be configured to exhibit time scales of up to 100 kilo-seconds, thanks to a controllable leakage
current that can be scaled down to 0.45 atto-Amperes (2.8 electrons/s).
