Informal settlements are home to the most socially and economically vulnerable people on the planet.
In order to deliver effective economic and social aid, non-government organizations (NGOs), such
as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), require detailed maps of the locations of informal
settlements. However, data regarding informal and formal settlements is primarily unavailable
and if available is often incomplete. This is due, in part, to the cost and complexity of gathering
data on a large scale. An additional complication is that the definition of an informal settlement
is also very broad, which makes it a non-trivial task to collect data. This also makes it challenging
to teach a machine what to look for. Due to these challenges we provide three contributions in this
work. 1) A brand new machine learning data-set, purposely developed for informal settlement detection
that contains a series of low and very-high resolution imagery, with accompanying ground truth
annotations marking the locations of known informal settlements. 2) We demonstrate that it is possible
to detect informal settlements using freely available low-resolution (LR) data, in contrast to
previous studies that use very-high resolution (VHR) satellite and aerial imagery, which is typically
cost-prohibitive for NGOs. 3) We demonstrate two effective classification schemes on our curated
data set, one that is cost-efficient for NGOs and another that is cost-prohibitive for NGOs, but
has additional utility. We integrate these schemes into a semi-automated pipeline that converts
either a LR or VHR satellite image into a binary map that encodes the locations of informal settlements.
We evaluate and compare our methods.
