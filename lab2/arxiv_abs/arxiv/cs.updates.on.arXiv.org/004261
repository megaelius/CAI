Dynamic monopolies were already defined and studied for the formulation of the phenomena of the
spread of influence in social networks such as disease, opinion, adaptation of new product and etc.
The elements of the network which have been influenced (e.g. infected or adapted an opinion) are
called active vertices. It is assumed in these models that when an element is activated, it remains
active until the end of the process. But in some phenomena of the spread of influence this property
does not hold. For example in some diseases the infection lasts only a limited period of time or consider
the spread of disease or propagation of computer virus together with some quarantination or decontamination
methods. Dynamic monopolies are not useful for the study of these latter phenomena. For this purpose,
we introduce a new model for such diffusions of influence and call it weak dynamic monopoly. A social
network is represented by a graph $G$. Assume that any vertex $v$ of $G$ has a threshold $\tau(v)\in
\Bbb{N}$. Then a subset $D\subseteq V(G)$ is said to be a weak dynamic monopoly if $V(G)$ can be partitioned
into $D_0=D, D_1, \ldots, D_k$ such that for any $i$, any vertex $v$ of $D_i$ has at least $\tau(v)$
neighbors in $D_{i-1}$. In this definition, by the size and the processing time of $D$ we mean $|D|$
and $k$, respectively. We first investigate the relationships between weak dynamic monopolies
and other related concepts and then obtain some bounds for the smallest size of weak dynamic monopolies.
Next we obtain some results concerning the processing time of weak dynamic monopolies in terms of
some graph parameters. Finally, a hardness result concerning inapproximibility of the determining
the smallest size of weak dynamic monopolies in general graphs is obtained.
