An increasing number of technology enterprises are adopting cloud-native architectures to offer
their web-based products, by moving away from privately-owned data-centers and relying exclusively
on cloud service providers. As a result, cloud vendors have lately increased, along with the estimated
annual revenue they share. However, in the process of selecting a provider's cloud service over
the competition, we observe a lack of universal common ground in terms of terminology, functionality
of services and billing models. This is an important gap especially under the new reality of the industry
where each cloud provider has moved towards his own service taxonomy, while the number of specialized
services has grown exponentially. This work discusses cloud services offered by four dominant,
in terms of their current market share, cloud vendors. We provide a taxonomy of their services and
sub-services that designates major service families namely computing, storage, databases, analytics,
data pipelines, machine learning, and networking. The aim of such clustering is to indicate similarities,
common design approaches and functional differences of the offered services. The outcomes are
essential both for individual researchers, and bigger enterprises in their attempt to identify
the set of cloud services that will utterly meet their needs without compromises. While we acknowledge
the fact that this is a dynamic industry, where new services arise constantly, and old ones experience
important updates, this study paints a solid image of the current offerings and gives prominence
to the directions that cloud service providers are following.
