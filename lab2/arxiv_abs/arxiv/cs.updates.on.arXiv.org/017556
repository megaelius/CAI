Motivation: Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are critical to the function of proteins in both
normal and diseased cells, and many critical protein functions are mediated by interactions.Knowledge
of the nature of these interactions is important for the construction of networks to analyse biological
data. However, only a small percentage of PPIs captured in protein interaction databases have annotations
of function available, e.g. only 4% of PPI are functionally annotated in the IntAct database. Here,
we aim to label the function type of PPIs by extracting relationships described in PubMed abstracts.
Method: We create a weakly supervised dataset from the IntAct PPI database containing interacting
protein pairs with annotated function and associated abstracts from the PubMed database. We apply
a state-of-the-art deep learning technique for biomedical natural language processing tasks,
BioBERT, to build a model - dubbed PPI-BioBERT - for identifying the function of PPIs. In order to
extract high quality PPI functions at large scale, we use an ensemble of PPI-BioBERT models to improve
uncertainty estimation and apply an interaction type-specific threshold to counteract the effects
of variations in the number of training samples per interaction type. Results: We scan 18 million
PubMed abstracts to automatically identify 3253 new typed PPIs, including phosphorylation and
acetylation interactions, with an overall precision of 46% (87% for acetylation) based on a human-reviewed
sample. This work demonstrates that analysis of biomedical abstracts for PPI function extraction
is a feasible approach to substantially increasing the number of interactions annotated with function
captured in online databases.
