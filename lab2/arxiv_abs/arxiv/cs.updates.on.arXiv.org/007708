The new generation of 5G mobile services places stringent requirements for cellular network operators
in terms of latency and costs. The latest trend in radio access networks (RANs) is to pool the baseband
units (BBUs) of multiple radio base stations and to install them in a centralized infrastructure,
such as a cloud, for statistical multiplexing gains. The technology is known as Cloud Radio Access
Network (CRAN). Since cloud computing is gaining significant traction and virtualized data centers
are becoming popular as a cost-effective infrastructure in the telecommunication industry, CRAN
is being heralded as a candidate technology to meet the expectations of radio access networks for
5G. In CRANs, low energy base stations (BSs) are deployed over a small geographical location and
are connected to a cloud via finite capacity backhaul links. Baseband processing unit (BBU) functions
are implemented on the virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud over commodity hardware. Such functions,
built-in software, are termed as virtual functions (VFs). The optimized placement of VFs is necessary
to reduce the total delays and minimize the overall costs to operate CRANs. Our study considers the
problem of optimal VF placement over distributed virtual resources spread across multiple clouds,
creating a centralized BBU cloud. We propose a combinatorial optimization model and the use of two
heuristic approaches, which are, branch-and-bound (BnB) and simulated annealing (SA) for the
proposed optimal placement. In addition, we propose enhancements to the standard BnB heuristic
and compare the results with standard BnB and SA approaches. The proposed enhancements improve
the quality of the solution in terms of latency and cost as well as reduce the execution complexity
significantly.
