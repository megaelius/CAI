Fifth generation (5G) cellular networks will serve a wide variety of heterogeneous use cases, including
mobile broadband users, ultra-low latency services, and massively dense connectivity scenarios.
The resulting diverse communication requirements will demand networking with unprecedented
flexibility, not currently provided by the monolithic and black-box approach of 4G cellular networks.
The research community and an increasing number of standardization bodies and industry coalitions
have recognized softwarization, virtualization, and disaggregation of networking functionalities
as the key enablers of the needed shift to flexibility. Particularly, software-defined cellular
networks are heralded as the prime technology to satisfy the new application-driven traffic requirements
and to support the highly time-varying topology and interference dynamics, because of their openness
through well-defined interfaces, and programmability, for swift and responsive network optimization.
Leading the technological innovation in this direction, several 5G software-based projects and
alliances have embraced the open source approach, making new libraries and frameworks available
to the wireless community. This race to open source softwarization, however, has led to a deluge
of solutions whose interoperability and interactions are often unclear. This article provides
the first cohesive and exhaustive compendium of recent open source software and frameworks for
5G cellular networks, with a full stack and end-to-end perspective. We detail their capabilities
and functionalities focusing on how their constituting elements fit the 5G ecosystem, and unravel
the interactions among the surveyed solutions. Finally, we review platforms on which these frameworks
can run, and discuss the limitations of the state-of-the-art, and feasible directions towards
fully open source, programmable 5G networks.
