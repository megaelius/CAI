In this work we present a novel, accurate, and robust physics-informed method for solving problems
involving parametric differential equations (DEs) called the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections,
or X-TFC. The proposed method is a synergy of two recently developed frameworks for solving problems
involving parametric DEs, 1) the Theory of Functional Connections, TFC, and the Physics-Informed
Neural Networks, PINN. Although this paper focuses on the solution of exact problems involving
parametric DEs (i.e. problems where the modeling error is negligible) with known parameters, X-TFC
can also be used for data-driven solutions and data-driven discovery of parametric DEs. In the proposed
method, the latent solution of the parametric DEs is approximated by a TFC constrained expression
that uses a Neural Network (NN) as the free-function. This approximate solution form always analytically
satisfies the constraints of the DE, while maintaining a NN with unconstrained parameters, like
the Deep-TFC method. X-TFC differs from PINN and Deep-TFC; whereas PINN and Deep-TFC use a deep-NN,
X-TFC uses a single-layer NN, or more precisely, an Extreme Learning Machine, ELM. This choice is
based on the properties of the ELM algorithm. In order to numerically validate the method, it was
tested over a range of problems including the approximation of solutions to linear and non-linear
ordinary DEs (ODEs), systems of ODEs (SODEs), and partial DEs (PDEs). Furthermore, a few of these
problems are of interest in physics and engineering such as the Classic Emden-Fowler equation,
the Radiative Transfer (RT) equation, and the Heat-Transfer (HT) equation. The results show that
X-TFC achieves high accuracy with low computational time and thus it is comparable with the other
state-of-the-art methods.
