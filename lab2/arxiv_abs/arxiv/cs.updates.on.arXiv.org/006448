Consider the classical problem of information dissemination: one (or more) nodes in a network have
some information that they want to distribute to the remainder of the network. In this paper, we study
the cost of information dissemination in networks where edges have latencies, i.e., sending a message
from one node to another takes some amount of time. We first generalize the idea of conductance to
weighted graphs by defining $\phi_*$ to be the "critical conductance" and $\ell_*$ to be the "critical
latency". One goal of this paper is to argue that $\phi_*$ characterizes the connectivity of a weighted
graph with latencies in much the same way that conductance characterizes the connectivity of unweighted
graphs. We give near tight lower and upper bounds on the problem of information dissemination, up
to polylogarithmic factors. Specifically, we show that in a graph with (weighted) diameter $D$
(with latencies as weights) and maximum degree $\Delta$, any information dissemination algorithm
requires at least $\Omega(\min(D+\Delta, \ell_*/\phi_*))$ time % in the worst case. We show several
variants of the lower bound (e.g., for graphs with small diameter, graphs with small max-degree,
etc.) by reduction to a simple combinatorial game. We then give nearly matching algorithms, showing
that information dissemination can be solved in $O(\min((D+\Delta)\log^3{n}, (\ell_*/\phi_*)\log
n)$ time. This is achieved by combining two cases. We show that the classical push-pull algorithm
is (near) optimal when the diameter or the maximum degree is large. For the case where the diameter
and the maximum degree are small, we give an alternative strategy in which we first discover the latencies
and then use an algorithm for known latencies based on a weighted spanner construction. (Our algorithms
are within polylogarithmic factors of being tight both for known and unknown latencies.)
