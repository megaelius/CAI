This study focuses on category formation for individual agents and the dynamics of symbol emergence
in a multi-agent system through semiotic communication. Semiotic communication is defined, in
this study, as the generation and interpretation of signs associated with the categories formed
through the agent's own sensory experience or by exchange of signs with other agents. From the viewpoint
of language evolution and symbol emergence, organization of a symbol system in a multi-agent system
is considered as a bottom-up and dynamic process, where individual agents share the meaning of signs
and categorize sensory experience. A constructive computational model can explain the mutual
dependency of the two processes and has mathematical support that guarantees a symbol system's
emergence and sharing within the multi-agent system. In this paper, we describe a new computational
model that represents symbol emergence in a two-agent system based on a probabilistic generative
model for multimodal categorization. It models semiotic communication via a probabilistic rejection
based on the receiver's own belief. We have found that the dynamics by which cognitively independent
agents create a symbol system through their semiotic communication can be regarded as the inference
process of a hidden variable in an interpersonal multimodal categorizer, if we define the rejection
probability based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The validity of the proposed model and
algorithm for symbol emergence is also verified in an experiment with two agents observing daily
objects in the real-world environment. The experimental results demonstrate that our model reproduces
the phenomena of symbol emergence, which does not require a teacher who would know a pre-existing
symbol system. Instead, the multi-agent system can form and use a symbol system without having pre-existing
categories.
