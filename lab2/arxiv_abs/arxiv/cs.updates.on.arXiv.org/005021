Most brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
require that users perform mental tasks such as motor imagery, mental arithmetic, or music imagery
to convey a message or to answer simple yes or no questions. These cognitive tasks usually have no
direct association with the communicative intent, which makes them difficult for users to perform.
In this paper, a 3-class intuitive BCI is presented which enables users to directly answer yes or
no questions by covertly rehearsing the word 'yes' or 'no' for 15 s. The BCI also admits an equivalent
duration of unconstrained rest which constitutes the third discernable task. Twelve participants
each completed one offline block and six online blocks over the course of 2 sessions. The mean value
of the change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration during a trial was calculated for each channel
and used to train a regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) classifier. By the final online
block, 9 out of 12 participants were performing above chance (p<0.001), with a 3-class accuracy
of 83.8+9.4%. Even when considering all participants, the average online 3-class accuracy over
the last 3 blocks was 64.1+20.6%, with only 3 participants scoring below chance (p<0.001). For most
participants, channels in the left temporal and temporoparietal cortex provided the most discriminative
information. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an online fNIRS 3-class imagined speech
BCI. Our findings suggest that imagined speech can be used as a reliable activation task for selected
users for the development of more intuitive BCIs for communication.
