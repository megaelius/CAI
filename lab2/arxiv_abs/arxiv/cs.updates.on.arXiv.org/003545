HEFCE's Policy for open access in the post-2014 Research Excellence Framework states "authors'
outputs must have been deposited in an institutional or subject repository". There is no definition
of a subject repository in the policy: however, there is a footnote stating: "Individuals depositing
their outputs in a subject repository are advised to ensure that their chosen repository meets the
requirements set out in this policy." The longest standing subject repository (or repository of
any kind) is arXiv.org, established in 1991. arXiv is an open access repository of scientific research
available to authors and researchers worldwide and acts as a scholarly communications forum informed
and guided by scientists. Content held on arXiv is free to the end user and researchers can deposit
their content freely. As of April 2018, arXiv held over 1,377,000 eprints. In some disciplines arXiv
is considered essential to the sharing and publication of research. The HEFCE requirements on repositories
are defined in the Information and Audit Requirements which lists the "Accepted date", the "Version
of deposited file" and "available open access immediately after the publisher embargo" are expected
as part of the REF submission. However, while many records in arXiv have multiple versions of work,
the Author's Accepted Manuscript is not identified and there is no field to record the acceptance
date of the work. Because arXiv does not capture these two specific information points it does not
meet the technical requirements to be a compliant subject repository for the purposes of REF. This
paper is presenting the case that articles deposited to arXiv are, in general, compliant with the
requirements of the HEFCE policy. The paper summarises some work undertaken by Jisc to establish
if there are other factors that can indicate the likelihood of formal compliance to the HEFCE policy.
