There is a significantly accelerating trend in the application of the marine wave energy converters
in recent years. As a result, it is imperative to adopt a suitable point for implementing these systems.
Besides, the Caspian Sea, as one of the most important marine renewable energy sources in Asia, is
capable of supplying the coastal areas with a large amount of energy. Therefore, areas around nine
ports in the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea were selected to measure their wave energy potential.
Initially, the amount of energy on these points was measured using the irregular energy theory.
It was observed that the wave power was higher in the southwestern areas (within the Kiashahr coast
and Anzali port) than the southeastern areas. A new approach was developed to compare these points
and measure their fitnesses in supplying the maximum energy using the Grey Wolf optimizer (GWO)
algorithm and time history analysis. In this method, the optimal parameters were first extracted
from the algorithm for assessing the points within the southern areas of the Caspian Sea. These values
were regarded as the assessment indices. Then, the fitness of each point was obtained using the correlation
function and the norm vector to present the most optimal position with maximum wave energy exploitation
potential. This new approach was validated with analytical data, and its accuracy in predicting
and comparing the wave power on different points was approved. Finally, by a side-by-side comparison
of the parameters affecting the wave energy, the optimum range of significant wave height and wave
energy period was achieved.
