Public road authorities and private mobility service providers need information derived from
the current and predicted traffic states to act upon the daily urban system and its spatial and temporal
dynamics. In this research, a real-time parking area state (occupancy, in- and outflux) prediction
model (up to 60 minutes ahead) has been developed using publicly available historic and real time
data sources. Based on a case study in a real-life scenario in the city of Arnhem, a Neural Network-based
approach outperforms a Random Forest-based one on all assessed performance measures, although
the differences are small. Both are outperforming a naive seasonal random walk model. Although
the performance degrades with increasing prediction horizon, the model shows a performance gain
of over 150% at a prediction horizon of 60 minutes compared with the naive model. Furthermore, it
is shown that predicting the in- and outflux is a far more difficult task (i.e. performance gains
of 30%) which needs more training data, not based exclusively on occupancy rate. However, the performance
of predicting in- and outflux is less sensitive to the prediction horizon. In addition, it is shown
that real-time information of current occupancy rate is the independent variable with the highest
contribution to the performance, although time, traffic flow and weather variables also deliver
a significant contribution. During real-time deployment, the model performs three times better
than the naive model on average. As a result, it can provide valuable information for proactive traffic
management as well as mobility service providers.
