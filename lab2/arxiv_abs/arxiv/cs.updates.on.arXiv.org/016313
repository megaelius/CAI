Fully convolutional networks (FCNs), including UNet and VNet, are widely-used network architectures
for semantic segmentation in recent studies. However, conventional FCN is typically trained by
the cross-entropy or Dice loss, which only calculates the error between predictions and ground-truth
labels for pixels individually. This often results in non-smooth neighborhoods in the predicted
segmentation. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage framework, with the first stage to
quickly localize the prostate region, and the second stage to precisely segment the prostate by
a multi-task UNet architecture. We introduce a novel online metric learning module through voxel-wise
sampling in the multi-task network. Therefore, the proposed network has a dual-branch architecture
that tackles two tasks: 1) a segmentation sub-network aiming to generate the prostate segmentation,
and 2) a voxel-metric learning sub-network aiming to improve the quality of the learned feature
space supervised by a combination of triplet and contrast loss function. Specifically, the voxel-metric
learning sub-network sampled tuples (including triplets and pairs) in voxel-level through the
intermediate feature maps. Unlike conventional deep metric learning methods that generate triplets
or pairs in image-level before the training phase, our proposed voxel-wise tuples are sampled in
an online manner and operated in an end-to-end fashion via multi-task learning. To evaluate the
proposed method, we implement extensive experiments on a real CT image dataset consisting 339 patients.
The ablation studies show that our method can effectively learn more representative voxel-level
features compared with the conventional learning methods with cross-entropy or Dice loss. And
the comparisons show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a reasonable
margin.
