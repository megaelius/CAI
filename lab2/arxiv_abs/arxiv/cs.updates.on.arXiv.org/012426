Traffic congestion at a signalized intersection greatly reduces the travel time reliability in
urban areas. Adaptive signal control system (ASCS) is the most advanced traffic signal technology
that regulates the signal phasing and timings considering the patterns in real-time in order to
reduce congestion. Real-time prediction of queue lengths can be used to adjust the phasing and timings
for different movements at an intersection with ASCS. The accuracy of the prediction varies based
on the factors, such as the stochastic nature of the vehicle arrival rates, time of the day, weather
and driver characteristics. In addition, accurate prediction for multilane, undersaturated
and saturated traffic scenarios is challenging. Thus, the objective of this study is to develop
queue length prediction models for signalized intersections that can be leveraged by ASCS using
four variations of Grey systems: (i) the first order single variable Grey model (GM(1,1)); (ii)
GM(1,1) with Fourier error corrections; (iii) the Grey Verhulst model (GVM), and (iv) GVM with Fourier
error corrections. The efficacy of the GM is that they facilitate fast processing; as these models
do not require a large amount of data; as would be needed in artificial intelligence models; and they
are able to adapt to stochastic changes, unlike statistical models. We have conducted a case study
using queue length data from five intersections with ASCS on a calibrated roadway network in Lexington,
South Carolina. GM were compared with linear, nonlinear time series models, and long short-term
memory (LSTM) neural network. Based on our analyses, we found that EGVM reduces the prediction error
over closest competing models (i.e., LSTM and time series models) in predicting average and maximum
queue lengths by 40% and 42%, respectively, in terms of Root Mean Squared Error, and 51% and 50%, respectively,
in terms of Mean Absolute Error.
