We study the problem of selecting the top-k candidates from a pool of applicants, where each candidate
is associated with a score indicating his/her aptitude. Depending on the specific scenario, such
as job search or college admissions, these scores may be the results of standardized tests or other
predictors of future performance and utility. We consider a situation in which some groups of candidates
experience historical and present disadvantage that makes their chances of being accepted much
lower than other groups. In these circumstances, we wish to apply an affirmative action policy to
reduce acceptance rate disparities, while avoiding any large decrease in the aptitude of the candidates
that are eventually selected. Our algorithmic design is motivated by the frequently observed phenomenon
that discrimination disproportionately affects individuals who simultaneously belong to multiple
disadvantaged groups, defined along intersecting dimensions such as gender, race, sexual orientation,
socio-economic status, and disability. In short, our algorithm's objective is to simultaneously:
select candidates with high utility, and level up the representation of disadvantaged intersectional
classes. This naturally involves trade-offs and is computationally challenging due to the the
combinatorial explosion of potential subgroups as more attributes are considered. We propose
two algorithms to solve this problem, analyze them, and evaluate them experimentally using a dataset
of university application scores and admissions to bachelor degrees in an OECD country. Our conclusion
is that it is possible to significantly reduce disparities in admission rates affecting intersectional
classes with a small loss in terms of selected candidate aptitude. To the best of our knowledge, we
are the first to study fairness constraints with regards to intersectional classes in the context
of top-k selection.
