Advances in network programmability enable operators to 'slice' the physical infrastructure
into independent logical networks. By this approach, each network slice aims to accommodate the
demands of increasingly diverse services. However, precise allocation of resources to slices
across future 5G millimetre-wave backhaul networks, to optimise the total network utility, is
challenging. This is because the performance of different services often depends on conflicting
requirements, including bandwidth, sensitivity to delay, or the monetary value of the traffic
incurred. In this paper, we put forward a general rate utility framework for slicing mm-wave backhaul
links, encompassing all known types of service utilities, i.e. logarithmic, sigmoid, polynomial,
and linear. We then introduce DELMU, a deep learning solution that tackles the complexity of optimising
non-convex objective functions built upon arbitrary combinations of such utilities. Specifically,
by employing a stack of convolutional blocks, DELMU can learn correlations between traffic demands
and achievable optimal rate assignments. We further regulate the inferences made by the neural
network through a simple 'sanity check' routine, which guarantees both flow rate admissibility
within the network's capacity region and minimum service levels. The proposed method can be trained
within minutes, following which it computes rate allocations that match those obtained with state-of-the-art
global optimisation algorithms, yet orders of magnitude faster. This confirms the applicability
of DELMU to highly dynamic traffic regimes and we demonstrate up to 62% network utility gains over
a baseline greedy approach.
