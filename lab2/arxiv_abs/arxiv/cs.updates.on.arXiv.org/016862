A cyber-physical system (CPS) is expected to be resilient to more than one type of adversary. In this
paper, we consider a CPS that has to satisfy a linear temporal logic (LTL) objective in the presence
of two kinds of adversaries. The first adversary has the ability to tamper with inputs to the CPS to
influence satisfaction of the LTL objective. The interaction of the CPS with this adversary is modeled
as a stochastic game. We synthesize a controller for the CPS to maximize the probability of satisfying
the LTL objective under any policy of this adversary. The second adversary is an eavesdropper who
can observe labeled trajectories of the CPS generated from the previous step. It could then use this
information to launch other kinds of attacks. A labeled trajectory is a sequence of labels, where
a label is associated to a state and is linked to the satisfaction of the LTL objective at that state.
We use differential privacy to quantify the indistinguishability between states that are related
to each other when the eavesdropper sees a labeled trajectory. Two trajectories of equal length
will be differentially private if they are differentially private at each state along the respective
trajectories. We use a skewed Kantorovich metric to compute distances between probability distributions
over states resulting from actions chosen according to policies from related states in order to
quantify differential privacy. Moreover, we do this in a manner that does not affect the satisfaction
probability of the LTL objective. We validate our approach on a simulation of a UAV that has to satisfy
an LTL objective in an adversarial environment.
