This document is one of the deliverable reports created for the ESCAPE project. ESCAPE stands for
Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather Prediction at Exascale. The project develops
world-class, extreme-scale computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather
prediction and future climate models. This is done by identifying Weather & Climate dwarfs which
are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit of the Berkeley dwarfs).
These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware architectures (single and multi-node)
and alternative algorithms are explored. Performance portability is addressed through the use
of domain specific languages. This deliverable provides an evaluation of the work performed within
ESCAPE to port different dwarfs to accelerators, using different programming models. A key metric
of the evaluation is the performance portability of the resulting porting efforts. Portability
means that a single source code containing the numerical operators can be compiled and run in multiple
architectures, while performance portability additionally requires that the single source code
runs efficiently in all the different architectures. As results of other deliverables like D2.1,
D2.4 ESCAPE provides a collection of dwarfs ported to different computing architectures like traditional
CPUs, Intel XeonPhi and NVIDIA GPUs. Additionally D3.3 went through an optimization process to
obtain efficient and energy efficient dwarfs. In this deliverable we present a review of the different
programming models employed and their use to port various dwarfs of ESCAPE. A final evaluation of
the different approaches based on different metrics like performance portability, readability
of the numerical methods, efforts to port a dwarf and efficiency of the implementation obtained
is reported.
