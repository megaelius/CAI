Polar codes are provably capacity achieving linear block codes. The generator matrix of these codes
is specified by knowing the parameters of transmission channel, length and dimension of the used
code. On the other hand, for the cryptosystems based on general decoding problem (i.e. code based
cryptosystems), the generator matrix of the applied code should be properly hidden from the attacker.
Moreover, in the computational security, it is assumed that an attacker with restricted processing
power has unlimited access to transmission media. Thus, an attacker can construct the generator
matrix of polar codes, especially for Binary Erasure Channel on which this matrix can be efficiently
specified. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to hide the generator matrix of polar codes
in such a way that an attacker cannot construct it in polynomial time even by knowledge of the channel
parameters, dimension and length of the used code. By the help of this method, a secret key cryptosystem
based on non-systematic polar codes over Binary Erasure Channel is proposed which provides both
data security and reliability in one process simultaneously. In fact, the main goal of this research
is to achieve the acceptable level of security and reliability by taking advantage of the interesting
properties of polar codes. The proposed scheme resists against the typical attacks on the cryptosystems
based on error correcting codes. Also, by employing some efficient methods, the key length of our
scheme is decreased compared to Rao-Nam secret key cryptosystem. Moreover, our scheme benefits
from high code rate, proper error performance, faster processing and efficient implementation.
