Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies that are causing a paradigm shift in
the performance and behavior of certain algorithms, achieving previously unattainable results.
Machine learning (kernel classification) has become ubiquitous as the forefront method for pattern
recognition and has been shown to have numerous societal applications. While not yet fault-tolerant,
Quantum computing is an entirely new method of computation due to its exploitation of quantum phenomena
such as superposition and entanglement. While current machine learning classifiers like the Support
Vector Machine are seeing gradual improvements in performance, there are still severe limitations
on the efficiency and scalability of such algorithms due to a limited feature space which makes the
kernel functions computationally expensive to estimate. By integrating quantum circuits into
traditional ML, we may solve this problem through the use of quantum feature space, a technique that
improves existing Machine Learning algorithms through the use of parallelization and the reduction
of the storage space from exponential to linear. This research expands on this concept of the Hilbert
space and applies it for classical machine learning by implementing the quantum-enhanced version
of the K nearest neighbors algorithm. This paper first understands the mathematical intuition
for the implementation of quantum feature space and successfully simulates quantum properties
and algorithms like Fidelity and Grover's Algorithm via the Qiskit python library and the IBM Quantum
Experience platform. The primary experiment of this research is to build a noisy variational quantum
circuit KNN (QKNN) which mimics the classification methods of a traditional KNN classifier. The
QKNN utilizes the distance metric of Hamming Distance and is able to outperform the existing KNN
on a 10-dimensional Breast Cancer dataset.
