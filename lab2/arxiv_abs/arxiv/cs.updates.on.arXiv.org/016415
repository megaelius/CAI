The spontaneous behavioral changes of the agents during an epidemic can have significant effects
on the delay and the prevalence of its spread. In this work, we study a social distancing game among
the agents of a population, who determine their social interactions during the spread of an epidemic.
The interconnections between the agents are modeled by a network and local interactions are considered.
The payoffs of the agents depend on their benefits from their social interactions, as well as on the
costs to their health due to their possible contamination. The information available to the agents
during the decision making plays a crucial role in our model. We examine two extreme cases. In the
first case, the agents know exactly the health states of their neighbors and in the second they have
statistical information for the global prevalence of the epidemic. The Nash equilibria of the games
are studied and, interestingly, in the second case the equilibrium strategies for an agent are either
full isolation or no social distancing at all. Experimental studies are presented through simulations,
where we observe that in the first case of perfect local information the agents can affect significantly
the prevalence of the epidemic with low cost for their sociability, while in the second case they
have to pay the burden of not being well informed. Moreover, the effects of the information quality
(fake news), the health care system capacity and the network structure are discussed and relevant
simulations are provided, which indicate that these parameters affect the size, the peak and the
start of the outbreak, as well as the possibility of a second outbreak.
