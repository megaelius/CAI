In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, spatial context has demonstrated its significance
in achieving promising performance. However, conventional spatial context-based methods simply
assume that spatially neighboring pixels should correspond to the same land-cover class, so they
often fail to correctly discover the contextual relations among pixels in complex situations,
and thus leading to imperfect classification results on some irregular or inhomogeneous regions
such as class boundaries. To address this deficiency, we develop a new HSI classification method
based on the recently proposed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), as it can flexibly encode the
relations among arbitrarily structured non-Euclidean data. Different from traditional GCN,
there are two novel strategies adopted by our method to further exploit the contextual relations
for accurate HSI classification. First, since the receptive field of traditional GCN is often limited
to fairly small neighborhood, we proposed to capture long range contextual relations in HSI by performing
successive graph convolutions on a learned region-induced graph which is transformed from the
original 2D image grids. Second, we refine the graph edge weight and the connective relationships
among image regions by learning the improved adjacency matrix and the 'edge filter', so that the
graph can be gradually refined to adapt to the representations generated by each graph convolutional
layer. Such updated graph will in turn result in accurate region representations, and vice versa.
The experiments carried out on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method yields significant improvement in the classification performance when compared with some
state-of-the-art approaches.
