Flooding is among the simplest and most fundamental of all distributed network algorithms. A node
begins the process by sending a message to all its neighbours and the neighbours, in the next round
forward the message to all the neighbours they did not receive the message from and so on. We assume
that the nodes do not keep a record of the flooding event. We call this amnesiac flooding (AF). Since
the node forgets, if the message is received again in subsequent rounds, it will be forwarded again
raising the possibility that the message may be circulated infinitely even on a finite graph. As
far as we know, the question of termination for such a flooding process has not been settled - rather,
non-termination is implicitly assumed. In this paper, we show that synchronous AF always terminates
on any arbitrary finite graph and derive exact termination times which differ sharply in bipartite
and non-bipartite graphs. Let $G$ be a finite connected graph. We show that synchronous AF from a
single source node terminates on $G$ in $e$ rounds, where $e$ is the eccentricity of the source node,
if and only if $G$ is bipartite. For non-bipartite $G$, synchronous AF from a single source terminates
in $j$ rounds where $e < j \leq e+d+1$ and $d$ is the diameter of $G$. This limits termination time to
at most $d$ and at most $2d + 1$ for bipartite and non-bipartite graphs respectively. If communication/broadcast
to all nodes is the motivation, our results show that AF is asymptotically time optimal and obviates
the need for construction and maintenance of spanning structures like spanning trees. The clear
separation in the termination times of bipartite and non-bipartite graphs also suggests mechanisms
for distributed discovery of the topology/distances in arbitrary graphs. For comparison, we show
that, in asynchronous networks, an adaptive adversary can force AF to be non-terminating.
