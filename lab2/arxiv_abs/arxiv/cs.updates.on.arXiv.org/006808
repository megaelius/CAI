The biomedical literature provides a rich source of knowledge such as protein-protein interactions
(PPIs), drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and chemical-protein interactions (CPIs). Biomedical
relation extraction aims to automatically extract biomedical relations from biomedical text
for various biomedical research. State-of-the-art methods for biomedical relation extraction
are primarily based on supervised machine learning and therefore depend on (sufficient) labeled
data. However, creating large sets of training data is prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive,
especially so in biomedicine as domain knowledge is required. In contrast, there is a large amount
of unlabeled biomedical text available in PubMed. Hence, computational methods capable of employing
unlabeled data to reduce the burden of manual annotation are of particular interest in biomedical
relation extraction. We present a novel semi-supervised approach based on variational autoencoder
(VAE) for biomedical relation extraction. Our model consists of the following three parts, a classifier,
an encoder and a decoder. The classifier is implemented using multi-layer convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), and the encoder and decoder are implemented using both bidirectional long short-term
memory networks (Bi-LSTMs) and CNNs, respectively. The semi-supervised mechanism allows our
model to learn features from both the labeled and unlabeled data. We evaluate our method on multiple
public PPI, DDI and CPI corpora. Experimental results show that our method effectively exploits
the unlabeled data to improve the performance and reduce the dependence on labeled data. To our best
knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised VAE-based method for (biomedical) relation extraction.
Our results suggest that exploiting such unlabeled data can be greatly beneficial to improved performance
in various biomedical relation extraction.
