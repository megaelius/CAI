Since the inception of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology have
attracted an increasing interest from both academia and industry. Among various core components,
consensus protocol is the defining technology behind the security and performance of blockchain.
From incremental modifications of Nakamoto consensus protocol to innovative alternative consensus
mechanisms, many consensus protocols have been proposed to improve the performance of the blockchain
network itself or to accommodate other specific application needs. In this survey, we present a
comprehensive review and analysis on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. To
facilitate the discussion of our analysis, we first introduce the key definitions and relevant
results in the classic theory of fault tolerance which help to lay the foundation for further discussion.
We identify five core components of a blockchain consensus protocol, namely, block proposal, block
validation, information propagation, block finalization, and incentive mechanism. A wide spectrum
of blockchain consensus protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic abstractions
and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are analyzed using the five-component
framework and compared with respect to different performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons
provide us new insights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their suitable
application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance, scalability, drawbacks and
trade-offs. We believe this survey will provide blockchain developers and researchers a comprehensive
view on the state-of-the-art consensus protocols and facilitate the process of designing future
protocols.
