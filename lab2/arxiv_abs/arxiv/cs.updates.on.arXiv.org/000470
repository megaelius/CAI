The greedy spanner is the highest quality geometric spanner (in e.g. edge count and weight, both
in theory and practice) known to be computable in polynomial time. Unfortunately, all known algorithms
for computing it take Omega(n^2) time, limiting its applicability on large data sets. We observe
that for many point sets, the greedy spanner has many `short' edges that can be determined locally
and usually quickly, and few or no `long' edges that can usually be determined quickly using local
information and the well-separated pair decomposition. We give experimental results showing
large to massive performance increases over the state-of-the-art on nearly all tests and real-life
data sets. On the theoretical side we prove a near-linear expected time bound on uniform point sets
and a near-quadratic worst-case bound. Our bound for point sets drawn uniformly and independently
at random in a square follows from a local characterization of t-spanners we give on such point sets:
we give a geometric property that holds with high probability on such point sets. This property implies
that if an edge set on these points has t-paths between pairs of points `close' to each other, then
it has t-paths between all pairs of points. This characterization gives a O(n log^2 n log^2 log n)
expected time bound on our greedy spanner algorithm, making it the first subquadratic time algorithm
for this problem on any interesting class of points. We also use this characterization to give a O((n
+ |E|) log^2 n log log n) expected time algorithm on uniformly distributed points that determines
if E is a t-spanner, making it the first subquadratic time algorithm for this problem that does not
make assumptions on E.
