Today, many different types of scams can be found on the internet. Online criminals are always finding
new creative ways to trick internet users, be it in the form of lottery scams, downloading scam apps
for smartphones or fake gambling websites. This paper presents a large-scale study on one particular
delivery method of online scam: pop-up scam on typosquatting domains. Typosquatting describes
the concept of registering domains which are very similar to existing ones while deliberately containing
common typing errors; these domains are then used to trick online users while under the belief of
browsing the intended website. Pop-up scam uses JavaScript alert boxes to present a message which
attracts the user's attention very effectively, as they are a blocking user interface element.
Our study among typosquatting domains derived from the Majestic Million list utilising an Austrian
IP address revealed on 1219 distinct typosquatting URLs a total of 2577 pop-up messages, out of which
1538 were malicious. Approximately a third of those distinct URLs (403) were targeted and displayed
pop-up messages to one specific HTTP user agent only. Based on our scans, we present an in-depth analysis
as well as a detailed classification of different targeting parameters (user agent and language)
which triggered varying kinds of pop-up scams. Furthermore, we expound the differences of current
pop-up scam characteristics in comparison with a previous scan performed in late 2018 and examine
the use of IDN homograph attacks as well as the application of message localisation using additional
scans with IP addresses from the United States and Japan.
