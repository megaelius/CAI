Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are frequently applied for labeling and segmenting sequence data.
Morency et al. (2007) introduced hidden state variables in a labeled CRF structure in order to model
the latent dynamics within class labels, thus improving the labeling performance. Such a model
is known as Latent-Dynamic CRF (LDCRF). We present Factored LDCRF (FLDCRF), a structure that allows
multiple latent dynamics of the class labels to interact with each other. Including such latent-dynamic
interactions leads to improved labeling performance on single-label and multi-label sequence
modeling tasks. We apply our FLDCRF models on two single-label (one nested cross-validation) and
one multi-label sequence tagging (nested cross-validation) experiments across two different
datasets - UCI gesture phase data and UCI opportunity data. FLDCRF outperforms all state-of-the-art
sequence models, i.e., CRF, LDCRF, LSTM, LSTM-CRF, Factorial CRF, Coupled CRF and a multi-label
LSTM model in all our experiments. In addition, LSTM based models display inconsistent performance
across validation and test data, and pose diffculty to select models on validation data during our
experiments. FLDCRF offers easier model selection, consistency across validation and test performance
and lucid model intuition. FLDCRF is also much faster to train compared to LSTM, even without a GPU.
FLDCRF outshines the best LSTM model by ~4% on a single-label task on UCI gesture phase data and outperforms
LSTM performance by ~2% on average across nested cross-validation test sets on the multi-label
sequence tagging experiment on UCI opportunity data. The idea of FLDCRF can be extended to joint
(multi-agent interactions) and heterogeneous (discrete and continuous) state space models.
