Earth observation resources are becoming increasingly indispensable in disaster relief, damage
assessment and related domains. Many unpredicted factors, such as the change of observation task
requirements, to the occurring of bad weather and resource failures, may cause the scheduled observation
scheme to become infeasible. Therefore, it is crucial to be able to promptly and maybe frequently
develop high-quality replanned observation schemes that minimize the effects on the scheduled
tasks. A bottom-up distributed coordinated framework together with an improved contract net are
proposed to facilitate the dynamic task replanning for heterogeneous Earth observation resources.
This hierarchical framework consists of three levels, namely, neighboring resource coordination,
single planning center coordination, and multiple planning center coordination. Observation
tasks affected by unpredicted factors are assigned and treated along with a bottom-up route from
resources to planning centers. This bottom-up distributed coordinated framework transfers part
of the computing load to various nodes of the observation systems to allocate tasks more efficiently
and robustly. To support the prompt assignment of large-scale tasks to proper Earth observation
resources in dynamic environments, we propose a multiround combinatorial allocation (MCA) method.
Moreover, a new float interval-based local search algorithm is proposed to obtain the promising
planning scheme more quickly. The experiments demonstrate that the MCA method can achieve a better
task completion rate for large-scale tasks with satisfactory time efficiency. It also demonstrates
that this method can help to efficiently obtain replanning schemes based on original scheme in dynamic
environments.
