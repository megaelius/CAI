A function f : {0, 1}^n -> {0, 1} is said to be k-monotone if it flips between 0 and 1 at most k times on every
ascending chain. Such functions represent a natural generalization of (1-)monotone functions,
and have been recently studied in circuit complexity, PAC learning, and cryptography. Our work
is part of a renewed focus in understanding testability of properties characterized by freeness
of arbitrary order patterns as a generalization of monotonicity. Recently, Canonne et al. (ITCS
2017) initiate the study of k-monotone functions in the area of property testing, and Newman et al.
(SODA 2017) study testability of families characterized by freeness from order patterns on real-valued
functions over the line [n] domain. We study k-monotone functions in the more relaxed parametrized
property testing model, introduced by Parnas et al. (JCSS, 72(6), 2006). In this process we resolve
a problem left open in previous work. Specifically, our results include the following. 1. Testing
2-monotonicity on the hypercube non-adaptively with one-sided error requires an exponential
in \sqrt n number of queries. This behavior shows a stark contrast with testing (1-)monotonicity,
which only needs O(\sqrt n) queries (Khot et al. (FOCS 2015)). Furthermore, even the apparently
easier task of distinguishing 2-monotone functions from functions that are far from being n^.01
-monotone also requires an exponential number of queries. 2. On the hypercube [n]^d domain, there
exists a testing algorithm that makes a constant number of queries and distinguishes functions
that are k-monotone from functions that are far from being O(kd^2)-monotone. Such a dependency
is likely necessary, given the lower bound above for the hypercube.
