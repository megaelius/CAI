The broadcasting models on trees arise in many contexts such as discrete mathematics, statistical
physics, computer science. Here we consider the k-colouring model. A basic question here is whether
the root's assignment affects the distribution of the colourings at the vertices at distance h from
the root. This is the reconstruction/non-reconstruction problem. For the case where the underlying
tree is d-ary and d is sufficiently large, it is well known that d/ln d is a threshold function. That
is, for k=(1+eps)d/ln d we have non-reconstruction and for k=(1-eps)d/ln d we have reconstruction.
Here we consider the case where the underlying tree is a random in particular it is a Galton-Watson
tree (GW tree). This model arises naturally in many contexts eg random Constraint Satisfaction
Problems. The aforementioned study focuses on GW trees with offspring distribution binomial with
parameters n and d/n, i.e. B(n,d/n). Here we consider a broader version of the problem that includes
the binomial as a special one. We consider general offspring distribution for the tree. We relate
the corresponding bounds of k for (non)reconstruction with certain concentration properties
of the offspring distribution. Interestingly enough, our analysis allows to decouple the distributions
of the trees and the colourings. E.g. when non-reconstruction is a typical phenomenon of the tree
instances, then we provide the structural properties which imply the corresponding spatial mixing
property. For the case of GW trees with offspring B(n,d/n)$ we verify (the non-rigorous prediction)
that d/ln d is a threshold function. An interesting consequence of our analysis is that for offspring
distribution with expected offspring d, we get the threshold function d/ln d under weaker concentration
conditions compared to B(n,d/n).
