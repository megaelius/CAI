Currently, Android malware detection is mostly performed on the server side against the increasing
number of malware. Powerful computing resource provides more exhaustive protection for app markets
than maintaining detection by a single user. However, apart from the applications (apps) provided
by the official market, apps from third-party resources are always causing serious security threats
to end-users. Meanwhile, it is a time-consuming task if the app is downloaded first and then uploaded
to the server side for detection, because the network transmission has a lot of overhead. In addition,
the uploading process also suffers from the threat of attackers. Consequently, a last line of defense
on mobile devices is necessary and much-needed. In this paper, we propose an effective Android malware
detection system, MobiTive, leveraging customized deep neural networks to provide a real-time
and responsive detection environment on mobile devices. MobiTive is a pre-installed solution
rather than an app scanning and monitoring engine using after installation, which is more practical
and secure. Although a deep learning-based approach can be maintained on server side efficiently
for malware detection, original deep learning models cannot be directly deployed and executed
on mobile devices due to various performance limitations. Therefore, we evaluate and investigate
the following key points: (1) the performance of different feature extraction methods; (2) the
performance of different feature type selections for deep learning on mobile; (3) the detection
accuracy of different deep neural networks on mobile; (4) the real-time detection performance
and accuracy on mobile; (5) the potential based on the evolution trend of mobile devices' specifications;
and finally we further propose a practical solution (MobiTive) to detect Android malware on mobile.
