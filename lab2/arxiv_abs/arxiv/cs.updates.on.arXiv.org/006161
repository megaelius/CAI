Hurricanes are costly natural disasters periodically faced by households in coastal and to some
extent, inland areas. A detailed understanding of evacuation behavior is fundamental to the development
of efficient emergency plans. Once a household decides to evacuate, a key behavioral issue is the
time at which individuals depart to reach their destination. An accurate estimation of evacuation
departure time is useful to predict evacuation demand over time and develop effective evacuation
strategies. In addition, the time it takes for evacuees to reach their preferred destinations is
important. A holistic understanding of the factors that affect travel time is useful to emergency
officials in controlling road traffic and helps in preventing adverse conditions like traffic
jams. Past studies suggest that departure time and travel time can be related. Hence, an important
question arises whether there is an interdependence between evacuation departure time and travel
time? Does departing close to the landfall increases the possibility of traveling short distances?
Are people more likely to depart early when destined to longer distances? In this study, we present
a model to jointly estimate departure and travel times during hurricane evacuations. Empirical
results underscore the importance of accommodating an inter-relationship among these dimensions
of evacuation behavior. This paper also attempts to empirically investigate the influence of social
ties of individuals on joint estimation of evacuation departure and travel times. Survey data from
Hurricane Sandy is used for computing empirical results. Results indicate significant role of
social networks in addition to other key factors on evacuation departure and travel times during
hurricanes.
