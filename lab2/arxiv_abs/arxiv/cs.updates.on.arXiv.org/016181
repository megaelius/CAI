As a response to the global COVID-19 surge in 2020, many countries have implemented lockdown or stay-at-home
policies. If, however, the contact persons of every infected patient could be identified, the number
of virus transmissions could be reduced, while the more incisive measures could be softened. For
this purpose, contact tracing using smartphones is being considered as a promising technique.
Here, smartphones emit and scan for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals for detecting devices in
range. When a device is detected, its distance is estimated by evaluating its received signal strength.
The main insight that is exploited for distance estimation is that the attenuation of a signal increases
with the distance along which it has traveled. However, besides distance, there are multiple additional
factors that impact the attenuation and hence disturb distance estimation. Among them, frequency
selective hardware and signal propagation belong to the most significant ones. For example, a BLE
device transmits beacons on three different frequencies (channels), while the transmit power
and the receiver sensitivity depend on the frequency. As a result, the received signal strength
varies for each channel, even when the distance remains constant. However, the information on which
wireless channel a beacon has been received is not made available to a smartphone. Hence, this error
cannot be compensated, e.g., by calibration. In this paper, we for the first time provide a solution
to detect the wireless channel on which a packet has been received on a smartphone. We experimentally
evaluate our proposed technique on multiple different smartphone models. Our results help to make
contact tracing more robust by improving the accuracy of distance estimation.
