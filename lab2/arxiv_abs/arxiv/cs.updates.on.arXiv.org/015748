Previous studies have characterized code comments in different programming languages. However,
very few studies have focused on the analysis of the information embedded in code comments. None
of them compared the developer's practices to write the comments to the standard guidelines and
analyzed these characteristics in the Pharo Smalltalk environment. The class commenting practices
have their origins in Smalltalk-80, going back 40 years. Smalltalk offers a brief template for entering
a comment for newly-created classes. These templates have evolved over the years, particularly
in the Pharo environment. This paper reports the first empirical study investigating commenting
practices in Pharo Smalltalk. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyze class comments of the
most recent version of Pharo, to investigate the information types of Pharo comments. Finally,
we study the adherence of developer commenting practices to the class template over Pharo versions.
The results show a rapid increase in class comments in the initial three Pharo versions, while in
subsequent versions developers added comments to both new and old classes, thus maintaining a similar
ratio. Additionally, we found that 23 information types are typically embedded in class comments
and only seven of them are present in the latest Pharo class comment template. However, the information
types proposed by the standard template tend to be present more often than other types of information.
Additionally, we find that a substantial proportion of comments follow the writing style of the
template in writing these information types, but written and formatted in a non-uniform way. This
suggests the need to standardize the commenting guidelines for formatting the text to ensure a consistent
style, and to identify the information easily.
