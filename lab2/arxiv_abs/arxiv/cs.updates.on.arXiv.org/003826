Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants require specialized care in neonatal intensive care units.
In the United States (U.S.), such infants frequently are transferred between hospitals. Although
these neonatal transfer networks are important, both economically and for infant morbidity and
mortality, the national-level pattern of neonatal transfers is largely unknown. Using data from
Vermont Oxford Network on 44,753 births, 2,122 hospitals, and 9,722 inter-hospital infant transfers
from 2015, we performed the largest analysis to date on the inter-hospital transfer network for
VLBW infants in the U.S. We find that transfers are organized around regional communities, but that
despite being largely within state boundaries, most communities often contain at least two hospitals
in different states. To classify the structural variation in transfer pattern amongst these communities,
we applied a spectral measure for regionalization and found a positive correlation between a community's
degree of regionalization and their infant transfer rate, which was not utilized in detecting communities.
We also demonstrate that the established measures of network centrality and hierarchy, e.g., the
community-wide entropy in PageRank or Betweenness centrality and number of distinct `layers'
within a community, correlate weakly with our regionalization index and were not significantly
associated with metrics on infant transfer rate. Our results suggest that the regionalization
index captures novel information about the structural properties of VLBW infant transfer networks,
have the practical implication of characterizing neonatal care in the U.S., and may apply more broadly
to the role of centralizing forces in organizing complex adaptive systems.
