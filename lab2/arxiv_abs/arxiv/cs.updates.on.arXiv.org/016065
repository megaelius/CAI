Whole brain extraction, also known as skull stripping, is a process in neuroimaging in which non-brain
tissue such as skull, eyeballs, skin, etc. are removed from neuroimages. Skull striping is a preliminary
step in presurgical planning, cortical reconstruction, and automatic tumor segmentation. Despite
a plethora of skull stripping approaches in the literature, few are sufficiently accurate for processing
pathology-presenting MRIs, especially MRIs with brain tumors. In this work we propose a deep learning
approach for skull striping common MRI sequences in oncology such as T1-weighted with gadolinium
contrast (T1Gd) and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) in patients with
brain tumors. We automatically created gray matter, white matter, and CSF probability masks using
SPM12 software and merged the masks into one for a final whole-brain mask for model training. Dice
agreement, sensitivity, and specificity of the model (referred herein as DeepBrain) was tested
against manual brain masks. To assess data efficiency, we retrained our models using progressively
fewer training data examples and calculated average dice scores on the test set for the models trained
in each round. Further, we tested our model against MRI of healthy brains from the LBP40A dataset.
Overall, DeepBrain yielded an average dice score of 94.5%, sensitivity of 96.4%, and specificity
of 98.5% on brain tumor data. For healthy brains, model performance improved to a dice score of 96.2%,
sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 99.2%. The data efficiency experiment showed that, for
this specific task, comparable levels of accuracy could have been achieved with as few as 50 training
samples. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a deep learning model trained on minimally
processed automatically-generated labels can generate more accurate brain masks on MRI of brain
tumor patients within seconds.
