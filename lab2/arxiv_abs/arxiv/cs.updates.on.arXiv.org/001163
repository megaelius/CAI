Image segmentation has come a long way since the early days of computer vision, and still remains
a challenging task. Modern variations of the classical (purely bottom-up) approach, involve,
e.g., some form of user assistance (interactive segmentation) or ask for the simultaneous segmentation
of two or more images (co-segmentation). At an abstract level, all these variants can be thought
of as "constrained" versions of the original formulation, whereby the segmentation process is
guided by some external source of information. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle
this kind of problems in a unified way. Our work is based on some properties of a family of quadratic
optimization problems related to dominant sets, a well-known graph-theoretic notion of a cluster
which generalizes the concept of a maximal clique to edge-weighted graphs. In particular, we show
that by properly controlling a regularization parameter which determines the structure and the
scale of the underlying problem, we are in a position to extract groups of dominant-set clusters
that are constrained to contain predefined elements. In particular, we shall focus on interactive
segmentation and co-segmentation (in both the unsupervised and the interactive versions). The
proposed algorithm can deal naturally with several type of constraints and input modality, including
scribbles, sloppy contours, and bounding boxes, and is able to robustly handle noisy annotations
on the part of the user. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our
approach as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on a variety of natural images under several
input conditions and constraints.
