Single image rain removal is a typical inverse problem in computer vision. The deep learning technique
has been verified to be effective to this task and achieved state-of-the-art performance. However,
the method needs to pre-collect a large set of image pairs with/without rains for training, which
not only makes the method laborsome to be practically implemented, but also tends to make the trained
network bias to the training samples while less generalized to test samples with unseen rain types
in training. To this issue, this paper firstly proposes a semisupervised learning paradigm to this
task. Different from traditional deep learning methods which use only supervised image pairs with/without
rains, we put the real rainy images, without need of their clean ones, into the network training process
as well. This is realized by elaborately formulating the residual between an input rainy image and
its expected network output (clear image without rains) as a concise patch-wised Mixture of Gaussians
distribution. The entire objective function for training network is thus the combination of the
supervised data loss (least square loss between input clear image and the network output) and the
unsupervised data loss. In this way, all such unsupervised rainy images, which is much easier to
collect than supervised ones, can be rationally fed into the network training process, and thus
both the short-of-training-sample and bias-to-supervised-sample issues can be evidently alleviated.
Experiments implemented on synthetic and real data experiments verify the superiority of our model
as compared to the state-of-the-arts.
