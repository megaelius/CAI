We make improvements to the upper bounds on several popular types of distance preserving graph sketches.
These sketches are all various restrictions of the {\em additive pairwise spanner} problem, in
which one is given an undirected unweighted graph $G$, a set of node pairs $P$, and an error allowance
$+\beta$, and one must construct a sparse subgraph $H$ satisfying $\delta_H(u, v) \le \delta_G(u,
v) + \beta$ for all $(u, v) \in P$. The first part of our paper concerns {\em pairwise distance preservers},
which make the restriction $\beta=0$ (i.e. distances must be preserved {\em exactly}). Our main
result here is an upper bound of $|H| = O(n^{2/3}|P|^{2/3} + n|P|^{1/3})$ when $G$ is undirected
and unweighted. This improves on existing bounds whenever $|P| = \omega(n^{3/4})$, and it is the
first such improvement in the last ten years. We then devise a new application of distance preservers
to graph clustering algorithms, and we apply this algorithm to {\em subset spanners}, which require
$P = S \times S$ for some node subset $S$, and {\em (standard) spanners}, which require $P = V \times
V$. For both of these objects, our construction generalizes the best known bounds when the error
allowance is constant, and we obtain the strongest polynomial error/sparsity tradeoff that has
yet been reported (in fact, for subset spanners, ours is the {\em first} nontrivial construction
that enjoys improved sparsity from a polynomial error allowance). We leave open a conjecture that
$O(n^{2/3}|P|^{2/3} + n)$ pairwise distance preservers are possible for undirected unweighted
graphs. Resolving this conjecture in the affirmative would improve and simplify our upper bounds
for all the graph sketches mentioned above.
