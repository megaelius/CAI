It is commonplace to encounter nonstationary or heterogeneous data. Such a distribution shift
feature presents both challenges and opportunities for causal discovery, of which the underlying
generating process changes over time or across domains. In this paper, we develop a principled framework
for causal discovery from such data, called Constraint-based causal Discovery from NOnstationary/heterogeneous
Data (CD-NOD), which addresses two important questions. First, we propose an enhanced constraint-based
procedure to detect variables whose local mechanisms change and recover the skeleton of the causal
structure over observed variables. Second, we present a way to determine causal orientations by
making use of independent changes in the data distribution implied by the underlying causal model,
benefiting from information carried by changing distributions. After learning the causal structure,
next, we investigate how to efficiently estimate the `driving force' of the nonstationarity of
a causal mechanism. That is, we aim to extract from data a low-dimensional and interpretable representation
of changes. The proposed methods are totally nonparametric, with no restrictions on data distributions
and causal mechanisms, and do not rely on window segmentation. Furthermore, we find that nonstationarity
benefits causal structure identification with particular types of confounders. Finally, we show
the tight connection between nonstationarity/heterogeneity and soft intervention in causal
discovery. Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world data sets (task-fMRI and
stock data) are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.
