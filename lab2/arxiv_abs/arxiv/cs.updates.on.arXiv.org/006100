Web applications routinely access sensitive and confidential data of users through remote APIs,
the privacy of which is governed by different policies specified by the application developer and
implemented as checks across application code and database queries. Given the complexity of the
code, it is often the case that missing policy checks cause unauthorized information leaks. To address
this issue of policy compliance, we present ESTRELA, a framework that allows specification of privacy
policies separately from the code and enforces it on the interfaces that access the sensitive data.
One of the major concerns that this work addresses is the specification of rich and expressive stateful
policies that allow applications to function seamlessly while preventing unauthorized leaks
of data. At the same time, ESTRELA applies only selected policies based on the usage of sensitive
data, limiting the number of policies being applied. The idea is to associate policies, written
in a higher-order language, with different remote interfaces that are enforced on their outputs
instead of having a fixed set of policies for different database fields, leveraging the features
of the widely-used REST architectural style. ESTRELA is database-agnostic and does not require
any modification to the database. We implement ESTRELA in Python, on top of Django, and evaluate
its performance and effectiveness by showing its application to a social-networking application,
a healthcare system and a conference management system. ESTRELA adds reasonably low overhead to
existing applications that run without any policy checks, and almost negligible overheads to applications
running with policy checks as part of the API code.
