Results: We present an application that enables the quantitative analysis of multichannel 5-D
(x, y, z, t, channel) and large montage confocal fluorescence microscopy images. The image sequences
show stem cells together with blood vessels, enabling quantification of the dynamic behaviors
of stem cells in relation to their vascular niche, with applications in developmental and cancer
biology. Our application automatically segments, tracks, and lineages the image sequence data
and then allows the user to view and edit the results of automated algorithms in a stereoscopic 3-D
window while simultaneously viewing the stem cell lineage tree in a 2-D window. Using the GPU to store
and render the image sequence data enables a hybrid computational approach. An inference-based
approach utilizing user-provided edits to automatically correct related mistakes executes interactively
on the system CPU while the GPU handles 3-D visualization tasks. Conclusions: By exploiting commodity
computer gaming hardware, we have developed an application that can be run in the laboratory to facilitate
rapid iteration through biological experiments. There is a pressing need for visualization and
analysis tools for 5-D live cell image data. We combine accurate unsupervised processes with an
intuitive visualization of the results. Our validation interface allows for each data set to be
corrected to 100% accuracy, ensuring that downstream data analysis is accurate and verifiable.
Our tool is the first to combine all of these aspects, leveraging the synergies obtained by utilizing
validation information from stereo visualization to improve the low level image processing tasks.
