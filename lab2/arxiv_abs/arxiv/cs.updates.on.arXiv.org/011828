Online palmprint recognition and latent palmprint identification are two branches of palmprint
studies. The former uses middle-resolution images collected by a digital camera in a well-controlled
or contact-based environment with user cooperation for commercial applications and the latter
uses high-resolution latent palmprints collected in crime scenes for forensic investigation.
However, these two branches do not cover some palmprint images which have the potential for forensic
investigation. Due to the prevalence of smartphone and consumer camera, more evidence is in the
form of digital images taken in uncontrolled and uncooperative environment, e.g., child pornographic
images and terrorist images, where the criminals commonly hide or cover their face. However, their
palms can be observable. To study palmprint identification on images collected in uncontrolled
and uncooperative environment, a new palmprint database is established and an end-to-end deep
learning algorithm is proposed. The new database named NTU Palmprints from the Internet (NTU-PI-v1)
contains 7881 images from 2035 palms collected from the Internet. The proposed algorithm consists
of an alignment network and a feature extraction network and is end-to-end trainable. The proposed
algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art online palmprint recognition methods and evaluated
on three public contactless palmprint databases, IITD, CASIA, and PolyU and two new databases,
NTU-PI-v1 and NTU contactless palmprint database. The experimental results showed that the proposed
algorithm outperforms the existing palmprint recognition methods.
