We consider an agent-based model in which two types of agents interact locally over a graph and have
a common intolerance threshold $\tau$ for changing their types with exponentially distributed
waiting times. The model is equivalent to an unperturbed Schelling model of self-organized segregation,
an Asynchronous Cellular Automata (ACA) with extended Moore neighborhoods, or a zero-temperature
Ising model with Glauber dynamics, and has applications in the analysis of social and biological
networks, and spin glasses systems. Some rigorous results were recently obtained in the theoretical
computer science literature, and this work provides several extensions. We enlarge the intolerance
interval leading to the formation of large segregated regions of agents of a single type from the
known size $\epsilon>0$ to size $\approx 0.134$. Namely, we show that for $0.433 < \tau < 1/2$ (and
by symmetry $1/2<\tau<0.567$), the expected size of the largest segregated region containing
an arbitrary agent is exponential in the size of the neighborhood. We further extend the interval
leading to large segregated regions to size $\approx 0.312$ considering "almost segregated" regions,
namely regions where the ratio of the number of agents of one type and the number of agents of the other
type vanishes quickly as the size of the neighborhood grows. In this case, we show that for $0.344
< \tau \leq 0.433$ (and by symmetry for $0.567 \leq \tau<0.656$) the expected size of the largest
almost segregated region containing an arbitrary agent is exponential in the size of the neighborhood.
The exponential bounds that we provide also imply that complete segregation, where agents of a single
type cover the whole grid, does not occur with high probability for $p=1/2$ and the range of tolerance
considered.
