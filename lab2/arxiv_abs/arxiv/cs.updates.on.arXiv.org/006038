This paper makes two main contributions: The first is the construction of a near-minimum spanning
tree with constant average distortion. The second is a general equivalence theorem relating two
refined notions of distortion: scaling distortion and prioritized distortion. Minimum Spanning
Trees of weighted graphs are fundamental objects in numerous applications. In particular in distributed
networks, the minimum spanning tree of the network is often used to route messages between network
nodes. Unfortunately, while being most efficient in the total cost of connecting all nodes, minimum
spanning trees fail miserably in the desired property of approximately preserving distances between
pairs. While known lower bounds exclude the possibility of the worst case distortion of a tree being
small, it was shown in [ABN15] that there exists a spanning tree with constant average distortion.
Yet, the weight of such a tree may be significantly larger than that of the MST. In this paper, we show
that any weighted undirected graph admits a {\em spanning tree} whose weight is at most $(1+\rho)$
times that of the MST, providing {\em constant average distortion} $O(1/\rho)$. Our result exhibits
the best possible tradeoff of this type. This result makes use of a general equivalence theorem relating
two recently developed notions of distortion for metric embedding. The first is the notion of scaling
distortion, which provides improved distortion for $1-\epsilon$ fractions of the pairs, for all
$\epsilon$ simultaneously. A stronger version called coarse scaling distortion, has improved
distortion guarantees for the furthest pairs. The second notion is that of prioritized distortion,
a property allowing to prioritize the nodes whose associated distortions will be improved. We show
that prioritized distortion is essentially equivalent to coarse scaling distortion via a general
transformation.
