In this paper we present a new approach to solve the fuel-efficient powered descent guidance problem
on large planetary bodies with no atmosphere (e.g. the Moon or Mars) using the recently developed
Theory of Functional Connections. The problem is formulated using the indirect method which casts
the optimal guidance problem as a system of nonlinear two-point boundary value problems. Using
the Theory of Functional Connections, the problem constraints are analytically embedded into
a "constrained expression," which maintains a free-function that is expanded using orthogonal
polynomials with unknown coefficients. The constraints are satisfied regardless of the values
of the unknown coefficients which convert the two-point boundary value problem into an unconstrained
optimization problem. This process casts the solution into the admissible subspace of the problem
and therefore simple numerical techniques can be used (i.e. in this paper a nonlinear least-squares
method is used). In addition to the derivation of this technique, the method is validated in two scenarios
and the results are compared to those obtained by the general purpose optimal control software,
GPOPS-II. In general, the proposed technique produces solutions of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10})$.
Additionally, for the proposed test cases, it is reported that each individual TFC-based inner-loop
iteration converges within 6 iterations, each iteration exhibiting a computational time between
72 and 81 milliseconds within the MATLAB legacy implementation. Consequently, the proposed methodology
is potentially suitable for on-board generation of optimal trajectories in real-time.
