Making an informed, correct and quick decision can be life-saving. It's crucial for animals during
an escape behaviour or for autonomous cars during driving. The decision can be complex and may involve
an assessment of the amount of threats present and the nature of each threat. Thus, we should expect
early sensory processing to supply classification information fast and accurately, even before
relying the information to higher brain areas or more complex system components downstream. Today,
advanced convolutional artificial neural networks can successfully solve visual detection and
classification tasks and are commonly used to build complex decision making systems. However,
in order to perform well on these tasks they require increasingly complex, "very deep" model structure,
which is costly in inference run-time, energy consumption and number of training samples, only
trainable on cloud-computing clusters. A single spiking neuron has been shown to be able to solve
recognition tasks for homogeneous Poisson input statistics, a commonly used model for spiking
activity in the neocortex. When modeled as leaky integrate and fire with gradient decent learning
algorithm it was shown to posses a variety of complex computational capabilities. Here we improve
its implementation. We also account for more natural stimulus generated inputs that deviate from
this homogeneous Poisson spiking. The improved gradient-based local learning rule allows for
significantly better and stable generalization. We also show that with its improved capabilities
it can count weakly labeled concepts by applying our model to a problem of multiple instance learning
(MIL) with counting where labels are only available for collections of concepts. In this counting
MNIST task the neuron exploits the improved implementation and outperforms conventional ConvNet
architecture under similar condtions.
