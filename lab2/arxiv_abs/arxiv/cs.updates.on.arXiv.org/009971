In this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised person re-identification (Re-ID) case, which only
has the intra-camera (within-camera) labels but not inter-camera (cross-camera) labels. In real-world
applications, these intra-camera labels can be readily captured by tracking algorithms or few
manual annotations, when compared with cross-camera labels. In this case, it is very difficult
to explore the relationships between cross-camera persons in the training stage due to the lack
of cross-camera label information. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel Progressive Cross-camera
Soft-label Learning (PCSL) framework for the semi-supervised person Re-ID task, which can generate
cross-camera soft-labels and utilize them to optimize the network. Concretely, we calculate an
affinity matrix based on person-level features and adapt them to produce the similarities between
cross-camera persons (i.e., cross-camera soft-labels). To exploit these soft-labels to train
the network, we investigate the weighted cross-entropy loss and the weighted triplet loss from
the classification and discrimination perspectives, respectively. Particularly, the proposed
framework alternately generates progressive cross-camera soft-labels and gradually improves
feature representations in the whole learning course. Extensive experiments on five large-scale
benchmark datasets show that PCSL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised
methods that employ labeled source domains or the images generated by the GAN-based models. Furthermore,
the proposed method even has a competitive performance with respect to deep supervised Re-ID methods.
