The popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) -- and of Machine Learning (ML) as an approach to
AI, has dramatically increased in the last few years, due to its outstanding performance in various
domains, notably in image, audio, and natural language processing. In these domains, AI success-stories
are boosting the applied field. When it comes to AI/ML for data communication Networks (AI4NETS),
and despite the many attempts to turn networks into learning agents, the successful application
of AI/ML in networking is limited. There is a strong resistance against AI/ML-based solutions,
and a striking gap between the extensive academic research and the actual deployments of such AI/ML-based
systems in operational environments. The truth is, there are still many unsolved complex challenges
associated to the analysis of networking data through AI/ML, which hinders its acceptability and
adoption in the practice. In this positioning paper I elaborate on the most important show-stoppers
in AI4NETS, and present a research agenda to tackle some of these challenges, enabling a natural
adoption of AI/ML for networking. In particular, I focus the future research in AI4NETS around three
major pillars: (i) to make AI/ML immediately applicable in networking problems through the concepts
of effective learning, turning it into a useful and reliable way to deal with complex data-driven
networking problems; (ii) to boost the adoption of AI/ML at the large scale by learning from the Internet-paradigm
itself, conceiving novel distributed and hierarchical learning approaches mimicking the distributed
topological principles and operation of the Internet itself; and (iii) to exploit the softwarization
and distribution of networks to conceive AI/ML-defined Networks (AIDN), relying on the distributed
generation and re-usage of knowledge through novel Knowledge Delivery Networks (KDNs).
