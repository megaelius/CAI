We introduce a new random input model for bipartite matching which we call the Random Type Poisson
Arrival Model. Just like in the known i.i.d. model (introduced by Feldman et al. 2009), online nodes
have types in our model. In contrast to the adversarial types studied in the known i.i.d. model, following
the random graphs studied in Mastin and Jaillet 2016, in our model each type graph is generated randomly
by including each offline node in the neighborhood of an online node with probability $c/n$ independently.
In our model, nodes of the same type appear consecutively in the input and the number of times each
type node appears is distributed according to the Poisson distribution with parameter 1. We analyze
the performance of the simple greedy algorithm under this input model. The performance is controlled
by the parameter $c$ and we are able to exactly characterize the competitive ratio for the regimes
$c = o(1)$ and $c = \omega(1)$. We also provide a precise bound on the expected size of the matching
in the remaining regime of constant $c$. We compare our results to the previous work of Mastin and
Jaillet who analyzed the simple greedy algorithm in the $G_{n,n,p}$ model where each online node
type occurs exactly once. We essentially show that the approach of Mastin and Jaillet can be extended
to work for the Random Type Poisson Arrival Model, although several nontrivial technical challenges
need to be overcome. Intuitively, one can view the Random Type Poisson Arrival Model as the $G_{n,n,p}$
model with less randomness; that is, instead of each online node having a new type, each online node
has a chance of repeating the previous type.
