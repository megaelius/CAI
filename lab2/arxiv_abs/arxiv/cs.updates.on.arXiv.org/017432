This paper addresses the stability conditions of the sampled-data teleoperation systems consisting
continuous time master, slave, operator, and environment with discrete time controllers over
general communication networks. The output signals of the slave and master robots are quantized
with stochastic sampling periods which are modeled as being from a finite set. By applying an input
delay method, the probabilistic sampling system is converted into a continuous-time system including
stochastic parameters in the system matrices. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation
of the less conservative stability conditions for linear discrete teleoperation systems taking
into account the challenges such as the stochastic sampling rate, constant time delay and the possibility
of data packet dropout. The numbers of dropouts are driven by a finite state Markov chain. First,
the problem of finding a lower bound on the maximum sampling period that preserves the stability
is formulated. This problem is constructed as a convex optimization program in terms of linear matrix
inequalities (LMI). Next, Lyapunov Krasovskii based approaches are applied to propose sufficient
conditions for stochastic and exponential stability of closed-loop sampled-data bilateral teleoperation
system. The proposed criterion notifies the effect of sampling time on the stability transparency
trade-off and imposes bounds on the sampling time, control gains and the damping of robots. Neglecting
this study undermines both the stability and transparency of teleoperation systems. Numerical
simulation results are used to verify the proposed stability criteria and illustrate the effectiveness
of the sampling architecture.
