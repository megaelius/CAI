The incompressible 2D Euler equations on a sphere constitute a fundamental model in hydrodynamics.
The long-time behaviour of solutions is largely unknown; statistical mechanics predicts a steady
vorticity configuration, but detailed numerical results in the literature contradict this theory,
yielding instead persistent unsteadiness. Such numerical results were obtained using artificial
hyperviscosity to account for the cascade of enstrophy into smaller scales. Hyperviscosity, however,
destroys the underlying geometry of the phase flow (such as conservation of Casimir functions),
and therefore might affect the qualitative long-time behaviour. Here we develop an efficient numerical
method for long-time simulations that preserve the geometric features of the exact flow, in particular
conservation of Casimirs. Long-time simulations on a non-rotating sphere then reveal three possible
outcomes for generic initial conditions: the formation of either 2, 3, or 4 coherent vortex structures.
These numerical results contradict the statistical mechanics theory and show that previous numerical
results, suggesting 4 coherent vortex structures as the generic behaviour, display only a special
case. Through integrability theory for point vortex dynamics on the sphere we present a theoretical
model which describes the mechanism by which the three observed regimes appear. We show that there
is a correlation between a first integral $\gamma$ (the ratio of total angular momentum and the square
root of enstrophy) and the long-time behaviour: $\gamma$ small, intermediate, and large yields
most likely 4, 3, or 2 coherent vortex formations. Our findings thus suggest that the likely long-time
behaviour can be predicted from the first integral $\gamma$.
