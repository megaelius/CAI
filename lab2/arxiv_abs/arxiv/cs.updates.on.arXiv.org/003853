Coordinating agents to complete a set of tasks with intercoupled temporal and resource constraints
is computationally challenging, yet human domain experts can solve these difficult scheduling
problems using paradigms learned through years of apprenticeship. A process for manually codifying
this domain knowledge within a computational framework is necessary to scale beyond the ``single-expert,
single-trainee" apprenticeship model. However, human domain experts often have difficulty describing
their decision-making processes, causing the codification of this knowledge to become laborious.
We propose a new approach for capturing domain-expert heuristics through a pairwise ranking formulation.
Our approach is model-free and does not require enumerating or iterating through a large state space.
We empirically demonstrate that this approach accurately learns multifaceted heuristics on a
synthetic data set incorporating job-shop scheduling and vehicle routing problems, as well as
on two real-world data sets consisting of demonstrations of experts solving a weapon-to-target
assignment problem and a hospital resource allocation problem. We also demonstrate that policies
learned from human scheduling demonstration via apprenticeship learning can substantially improve
the efficiency of a branch-and-bound search for an optimal schedule. We employ this human-machine
collaborative optimization technique on a variant of the weapon-to-target assignment problem.
We demonstrate that this technique generates solutions substantially superior to those produced
by human domain experts at a rate up to 9.5 times faster than an optimization approach and can be applied
to optimally solve problems twice as complex as those solved by a human demonstrator.
