Sufficient training data normally is required to train deeply learned models. However, due to the
expensive manual process for labelling large number of images, the amount of available training
data is always limited. To produce more data for training a deep network, Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) can be used to generate artificial sample data. However, the generated data usually
does not have annotation labels. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a virtual label
called Multi-pseudo Regularized Label (MpRL) and assign it to the generated data. With MpRL, the
generated data will be used as the supplementary of real training data to train a deep neural network
in a semi-supervised learning fashion. To build the corresponding relationship between the real
data and generated data, MpRL assigns each generated data a proper virtual label which reflects
the likelihood of the affiliation of the generated data to pre-defined training classes in the real
data domain. Unlike the traditional label which usually is a single integral number, the virtual
label proposed in this work is a set of weight-based values each individual of which is a number in
(0,1] called multi-pseudo label and reflects the degree of relation between each generated data
to every pre-defined class of real data. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out by adopting two
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in our experiments to verify the effectiveness
of MpRL. Experiments demonstrate that by assigning MpRL to generated data, we can further improve
the person re-ID performance on five re-ID datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03,
VIPeR, and CUHK01. The proposed method obtains +6.29%, +6.30%, +5.58%, +5.84%, and +3.48% improvements
in rank-1 accuracy over a strong CNN baseline on the five datasets respectively, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.
