The current deployed multipath congestion control algorithms couple all the subflows together
to avoid bandwidth occupation aggressiveness if the subflows of multipath transmission protocol
share common bottleneck with single path TCP. The coupled congestion control algorithms can guarantee
well fairness property in common bottleneck but result in rate increase conservativeness in none-sharing
bottleneck situation. Thus, the throughput of multipath session can be further improved when combing
with effective shared bottleneck detection mechanism. This paper proposes a delay trend line regression
method to detect if flows share common bottleneck. Deduced from TCP fluid model, the packet round
trip delay signal shows linear increase property during the queue building up process of the narrowest
link and the delay trend line slopes of two flows are in close proximity if they traverse the same bottleneck
link. The proposed method is implemented on multipath QUIC golang codebase and extensive simulations
are performed to validate its effectiveness in detecting out flows traversing common bottleneck.
If the subflows are detected out via a common bottleneck, the sender would perform coupled congestion
control algorithm and perform congestion control seperately on flow level in none sharing bottleneck
case. Results show a multipath session with two subflows can obtain 74\% gain on average in throughput
compared with single path connection when Linked Increases Algorithm (LIA) is in combination with
trend line regession shared bottlenck detection algorithm in none shared bottleneck, and show
well fairness property in common bottleneck scenarios.
