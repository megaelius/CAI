Wallet may be described as container application used for configuring, accessing and analysing
data from underlying payment application(s). There are two dominant types of digital wallet applications,
proximity wallet and remote wallet. In the payment industry, one often hears about authentication
approach for proximity or remote wallets or the underlying payment applications separately, but
there is no such approach, as per our knowledge, for combined wallet, the holder application. While
Secure Element (SE) controlled by the mobile network operator (i.e., SIM card) may ensure strong
authentication, it introduces strong dependencies among business partners in payments and hence
is not getting fraction. Embedded SE in the form of trusted execution environment [3, 4, 5] or trusted
computing [24] may address this issue in future. But such devices tend to be a bit expensive and are
not abundant in the market. Meanwhile, for many years, context based authentication involving
device fingerprinting and other contextual information for conditional multi-factor authentication,
would prevail and would remain as the most dominant and strong authentication mechanism for mobile
devices from various vendors in different capability and price ranges. EMVCo payment token standard
published in 2014 tries to address security of wallet based payment in a general way. The authors
believe that it is quite likely that EMVCo payment token implementations would evolve in course
of time in such a way that token service providers would start insisting on device fingerprinting
as strong means of authentication before issuing one-time-use payment token. This paper talks
about challenges of existing authentication mechanisms used in payment and wallet applications,
and their evolution.
