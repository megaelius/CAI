When voting on a proposal one in fact chooses between two alternatives: (i) A new hypothetical social
state depicted by the proposal and (ii) the status quo (henceforth: Reality); a Yes vote favors a
transition to the proposed hypothetical state, while a No vote favors Reality. Social Choice theory
generalizes voting on one proposal to ranking multiple proposals; that Reality was forsaken during
this generalization is, in our view, inexplicable. We propose to rectify this neglect and incorporate
Reality into Social Choice, by recognizing Reality as an ever-present, always-relevant, evolving
social state that is distinguished from hypothetical social states. We explore the ramifications
of this recognition. As comparing an hypothetical social state to the Reality involves judging
the utility of the hypothetical state, the utility of the current Reality, and the cost of realizing
the hypothetical state, we put more trust in such preferences than in preferences among hypothetical
social states; these require two such independent judgments, and thus are more prone to judgment
errors. Preferences between hypothetical social states and Reality offer: (i) A natural way to
resolve the Condorcet paradox and Condorcet cycles; (ii) a resolution to the vexing ambiguity regarding
what do approval voters, in fact, approve? and (iii) a simple and practical show-of-hands agenda
that implements an approval vote in one round and Condorcet-consistent voting in multiple rounds.
Arrow's theorem was taken to show that democracy is an incoherent illusion. Reality as an always-relevant
alternative abdicates Arrow's theorem and resolves the Condorcet paradox. Hence, it may clear
this intellectual blemish on democracy; pave the way for the broad application of the Condorcet
criterion; and help restore trust in democracy by showing that it offers a coherent and hopeful vision.
