Recently, the growing demand for rich multimedia content such as Video on Demand (VoD) has made the
data transmission from content delivery networks (CDN) to end-users quite challenging. Edge networks
have been proposed as an extension to CDN networks to alleviate this excessive data transfer through
caching and to delegate the computation tasks to edge servers. To maximize the caching efficiency
in the edge networks, different Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers assist each others to effectively
select which content to store and the appropriate computation tasks to process. In this paper, we
adopt a collaborative caching and transcoding model for VoD in MEC networks. However, unlike other
models in the literature, different chunks of the same video are not fetched and cached in the same
MEC server. Instead, neighboring servers will collaborate to store and transcode different video
chunks and consequently optimize the limited resources usage. Since we are dealing with chunks
caching and processing, we propose to maximize the edge efficiency by studying the viewers watching
pattern and designing a probabilistic model where chunks popularities are evaluated. Based on
this model, popularity-aware policies, namely Proactive caching policy (PcP) and Cache replacement
Policy (CrP), are introduced to cache only highest probably requested chunks. In addition to PcP
and CrP, an online algorithm (PCCP) is proposed to schedule the collaborative caching and processing.
The evaluation results prove that our model and policies give better performance than approaches
using conventional replacement policies. This improvement reaches up to 50% in some cases.
