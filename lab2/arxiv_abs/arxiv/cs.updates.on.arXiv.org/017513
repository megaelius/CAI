Despite its paramount importance for manifold use-cases, a sufficiently valid and reliable gait
parameter measurement is still limited to the domain of high-tech gait laboratories in big clinics.
This is mainly because the majority of gold standard assessment tools are very costly and complex
in their respective setup and daily operation routines. Here, we demonstrate the excellent validity
and test-retest repeatability of a novel gait assessment system which is built upon modern convolutional
neuronal networks to extract three-dimensional skeleton joints from monocular frontal-view
videos of walking humans. The present validity study is achieved in comparison to a previously validated
pressure-sensitive walkway system (GAITRite, GS). All measured gait parameters showed excellent
level of concurrent validity. This is proven by Inter-Class-Correlations possessing values between
0.92 and 0.99 for multiple walk trials, at normal and fast gait speeds. Furthermore, the average
measure of difference between the two systems is below 5% of corresponding gait parameter mean value
across all measured parameters (0.2% - 4.5%). The percentage error values of the assessed system
in relation to GS are between 6% and 14% of corresponding gait parameter mean values, hence being
significantly below the threshold of clinical acceptability (30%). The test-retest-repeatability
yields ICC values between 0.87 and 0.95, being on the same level with the GS system. In conclusion,
we are convinced that our results can pave the way for cost, space and operation effective gait analysis
in the broad mainstream. Most sensor-based systems are costly, have to be operated by extensively
trained personnel or possess considerable complexity (e.g. wearable sensors). In contrast, a
sufficient video for the assessment method presented here can be acquired by anyone, without much
training, via a smartphone camera.
