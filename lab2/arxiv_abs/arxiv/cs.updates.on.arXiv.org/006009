Incorporating graphs in the analysis of multivariate signals is becoming a standard way to understand
the interdependency of activity recorded at different sites. The new research frontier in this
direction includes the important problem of how to assess dynamic changes of signal activity. We
address this problem in a novel way by defining the graph-variate signal alongside methods for its
analysis. Essentially, graph-variate signal analysis leverages graphs of reliable connectivity
information to filter instantaneous bivariate functions of the multivariate signal. This opens
up a new and robust approach to analyse joint signal and network dynamics at sample resolution. Furthermore,
our method can be formulated as instantaneous networks on which standard network analysis can be
implemented. When graph connectivity is estimated from the multivariate signal itself, the appropriate
consideration of instantaneous graph signal functions allows for a novel dynamic connectivity
measure-- graphvariate dynamic (GVD) connectivity-- which is robust to spurious short-term dependencies.
Particularly, we present appropriate functions for three pertinent connectivity metrics-- correlation,
coherence and the phase-lag index. We show that our approach can determine signals with a single
correlated couple against wholly uncorrelated data of up to 128 nodes in signal size (1 out of 8128
weighted edges). GVD connectivity is also shown to be more robust than i) other GSP approaches at
detecting a randomly traveling spheroid on a 3D grid and ii) standard dynamic connectivity in determining
differences in EEG restingstate and task-related activity. We also demonstrate its use in revealing
hidden depth correlations from geophysical gamma ray data. We expect that the methods and framework
presented will provide new approaches to data analysis in a variety of applied settings.
