Recent studies have shown that imbalance ratio is not the only cause of the performance loss of a classifier
in imbalanced data classification. In fact, other data factors, such as small disjuncts, noises
and overlapping, also play the roles in tandem with imbalance ratio, which makes the problem difficult.
Thus far, the empirical studies have demonstrated the relationship between the imbalance ratio
and other data factors only. To the best of our knowledge, there is no any measurement about the extent
of influence of class imbalance on the classification performance of imbalanced data. Further,
it is also unknown for a dataset which data factor is actually the main barrier for classification.
In this paper, we focus on Bayes optimal classifier and study the influence of class imbalance from
a theoretical perspective. Accordingly, we propose an instance measure called Individual Bayes
Imbalance Impact Index ($IBI^3$) and a data measure called Bayes Imbalance Impact Index ($BI^3$).
$IBI^3$ and $BI^3$ reflect the extent of influence purely by the factor of imbalance in terms of each
minority class sample and the whole dataset, respectively. Therefore, $IBI^3$ can be used as an
instance complexity measure of imbalance and $BI^3$ is a criterion to show the degree of how imbalance
deteriorates the classification. As a result, we can therefore use $BI^3$ to judge whether it is
worth using imbalance recovery methods like sampling or cost-sensitive methods to recover the
performance loss of a classifier. The experiments show that $IBI^3$ is highly consistent with the
increase of prediction score made by the imbalance recovery methods and $BI^3$ is highly consistent
with the improvement of F1 score made by the imbalance recovery methods on both synthetic and real
benchmark datasets.
