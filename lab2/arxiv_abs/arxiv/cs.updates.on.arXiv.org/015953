Supervised person re-identification (ReID) often has poor scalability and usability in real-world
deployments due to domain gaps and the lack of annotations for the target domain data. Unsupervised
person ReID through domain adaptation is attractive yet challenging. Existing unsupervised ReID
approaches often fail in correctly identifying the positive samples and negative samples through
the distance-based matching/ranking. The two distributions of distances for positive sample
pairs (Pos-distr) and negative sample pairs (Neg-distr) are often not well separated, having large
overlap. To address this problem, we introduce a global distance-distributions separation (GDS)
constraint over the two distributions to encourage the clear separation of positive and negative
samples from a global view. We model the two global distance distributions as Gaussian distributions
and push apart the two distributions while encouraging their sharpness in the unsupervised training
process. Particularly, to model the distributions from a global view and facilitate the timely
updating of the distributions and the GDS related losses, we leverage a momentum update mechanism
for building and maintaining the distribution parameters (mean and variance) and calculate the
loss on the fly during the training. Distribution-based hard mining is proposed to further promote
the separation of the two distributions. We validate the effectiveness of the GDS constraint in
unsupervised ReID networks. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmark datasets show our
method leads to significant improvement over the baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art
performance.
