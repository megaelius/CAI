A gapped repeat is a factor of the form $uvu$ where $u$ and $v$ are nonempty words. The period of the
gapped repeat is defined as $|u|+|v|$. The gapped repeat is maximal if it cannot be extended to the
left or to the right by at least one letter with preserving its period. The gapped repeat is called
$\alpha$-gapped if its period is not greater than $\alpha |v|$. A $\delta$-subrepetition is a factor
which exponent is less than 2 but is not less than $1+\delta$ (the exponent of the factor is the quotient
of the length and the minimal period of the factor). The $\delta$-subrepetition is maximal if it
cannot be extended to the left or to the right by at least one letter with preserving its minimal period.
We reveal a close relation between maximal gapped repeats and maximal subrepetitions. Moreover,
we show that in a word of length $n$ the number of maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats is bounded by $O(\alpha^2n)$
and the number of maximal $\delta$-subrepetitions is bounded by $O(n/\delta^2)$. Using the obtained
upper bounds, we propose algorithms for finding all maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats and all maximal
$\delta$-subrepetitions in a word of length $n$. The algorithm for finding all maximal $\alpha$-gapped
repeats has $O(\alpha^2n)$ time complexity for the case of constant alphabet size and $O(n\log
n + \alpha^2n)$ time complexity for the general case. For finding all maximal $\delta$-subrepetitions
we propose two algorithms. The first algorithm has $O(\frac{n\log\log n}{\delta^2})$ time complexity
for the case of constant alphabet size and $O(n\log n +\frac{n\log\log n}{\delta^2})$ time complexity
for the general case. The second algorithm has $O(n\log n+\frac{n}{\delta^2}\log \frac{1}{\delta})$
expected time complexity.
