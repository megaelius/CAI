We describe a new public-domain open-source simulator of an electronic financial exchange, and
of the traders that interact with the exchange, which is a truly distributed and cloud-native system
that been designed to run on widely available commercial cloud-computing services, and in which
various components can be placed in specified geographic regions around the world, thereby enabling
the study of planetary-scale latencies in contemporary automated trading systems. Our simulator
allows an exchange server to be launched in the cloud, specifying a particular geographic zone for
the cloud hosting service; automated-trading clients which attach to the exchange can then also
be launched in the cloud, in the same geographic zone and/or in different zones anywhere else on the
planet, and those clients are then subject to the real-world latencies introduced by planetary-scale
cloud communication interconnections. In this paper we describe the design and implementation
of our simulator, called DBSE, which is based on a previous public-domain simulator, extended in
ways that are partly inspired by the architecture of the real-world Jane Street Exchange. DBSE relies
fundamentally on UDP and TCP network communications protocols and implements a subset of the FIX
de facto standard protocol for financial information exchange. We show results from an example
in which the exchange server is remotely launched on a cloud facility located in London (UK), with
trader clients running in Ohio (USA) and Sydney (Australia). We close with discussion of how our
simulator could be further used to study planetary-scale latency arbitrage in financial markets.
