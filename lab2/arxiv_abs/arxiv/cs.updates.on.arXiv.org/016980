The application of Quantum Teleportation for control of classical dynamic systems and autonomy
is proposed in this paper. Quantum teleportation is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon, and was
first introduced by teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
channels in 1993. In this paper, we consider the possibility of applying this quantum technique
to autonomous mobile classical platforms for control and autonomy purposes for the first time in
this research. First, a review of how Quantum Entanglement and Quantum Cryptography can be integrated
into macroscopic mechanical systems for controls and autonomy applications is presented, as well
as how quantum teleportation concepts may be applied to the classical domain. In quantum teleportation,
an entangled pair of photons which are correlated in their polarizations are generated and sent
to two autonomous platforms, which we call the Alice Robot and the Bob Robot. Alice has been given
a quantum system, i.e. a photon, prepared in an unknown state, in addition to receiving an entangled
photon. Alice measures the state of her entangled photon and her unknown state jointly and sends
the information through a classical channel to Bob. Although Alice original unknown state is collapsed
in the process of measuring the state of the entangled photon (due to the quantum non-cloning phenomenon),
Bob can construct an accurate replica of Alice state by applying a unitary operator. This paper,
and the previous investigations of the applications of hybrid classical-quantum capabilities
in control of dynamical systems, are aimed to promote the adoption of quantum capabilities and its
advantages to the classical domain particularly for autonomy and control of autonomous classical
systems.
