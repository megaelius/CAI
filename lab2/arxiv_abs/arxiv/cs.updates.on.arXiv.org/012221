Stability is an important aspect of numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws and has
received much interest. However, continuity in time is often assumed and only semidiscrete stability
is studied. Thus, it is interesting to investigate the influence of explicit and implicit time integration
methods on the stability of numerical schemes. If an explicit time integration method is applied,
spacially stable numerical schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws can result in unstable fully
discrete schemes. Focusing on the explicit Euler method (and convex combinations thereof), undesired
terms in the energy balance trigger this phenomenon and introduce an erroneous growth of the energy
over time. In this work, we study the influence of artificial dissipation and modal filtering in
the context of discontinuous spectral element methods to remedy these issues. In particular, lower
bounds on the strength of both artificial dissipation and modal filtering operators are given and
an adaptive procedure to conserve the (discrete) $\mathbf{L}_2$ norm of the numerical solution
in time is derived. This might be beneficial in regions where the solution is smooth and for long time
simulations. Moreover, this approach is used to study the connections between explicit and implicit
time integration methods and the associated energy production. By adjusting the adaptive procedure,
we demonstrate that filtering in explicit time integration methods is able to mimic the dissipative
behavior inherent in implicit time integration methods. This contribution leads to a better understanding
of existing algorithms and numerical techniques, in particular the application of artificial
dissipation as well as modal filtering in the context of numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation
laws together with the selection of explicit or implicit time integration methods.
