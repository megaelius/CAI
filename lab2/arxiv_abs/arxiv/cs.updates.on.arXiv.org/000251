The ever increasing adoption of mobile technologies and ubiquitous services allows to sense human
behavior at unprecedented levels of details and scale. Wearable sensors are opening up a new window
on human mobility and proximity at the finest resolution of face-to-face proximity. As a consequence,
empirical data describing social and behavioral networks are acquiring a longitudinal dimension
that brings forth new challenges for analysis and modeling. Here we review recent work on the representation
and analysis of temporal networks of face-to-face human proximity, based on large-scale datasets
collected in the context of the SocioPatterns collaboration. We show that the raw behavioral data
can be studied at various levels of coarse-graining, which turn out to be complementary to one another,
with each level exposing different features of the underlying system. We briefly review a generative
model of temporal contact networks that reproduces some statistical observables. Then, we shift
our focus from surface statistical features to dynamical processes on empirical temporal networks.
We discuss how simple dynamical processes can be used as probes to expose important features of the
interaction patterns, such as burstiness and causal constraints. We show that simulating dynamical
processes on empirical temporal networks can unveil differences between datasets that would otherwise
look statistically similar. Moreover, we argue that, due to the temporal heterogeneity of human
dynamics, in order to investigate the temporal properties of spreading processes it may be necessary
to abandon the notion of wall-clock time in favour of an intrinsic notion of time for each individual
node, defined in terms of its activity level. We conclude highlighting several open research questions
raised by the nature of the data at hand.
