This study develops a new method to quantify neighborhood activity levels at high spatial and temporal
resolutions and test whether, and to what extent, behavioral responses to social distancing policies
vary with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We define exposure density as a measure
of both the localized volume of activity in a defined area and the proportion of activity occurring
in non-residential and outdoor land uses. We utilize this approach to capture inflows/outflows
of people as a result of the pandemic and changes in mobility behavior for those that remain. First,
we develop a generalizable method for assessing neighborhood activity levels by land use type using
smartphone geolocation data over a three-month period covering more than 12 million unique users
within the Greater New York area. Second, we measure and analyze disparities in community social
distancing by identifying patterns in neighborhood activity levels and characteristics before
and after the stay-at-home order. Finally, we evaluate the effect of social distancing in neighborhoods
on COVID-19 infection rates and outcomes associated with localized demographic, socioeconomic,
and infrastructure characteristics in order to identify disparities in health outcomes related
to exposure risk. Our findings provide insight into the timely evaluation of the effectiveness
of social distancing for individual neighborhoods and support a more equitable allocation of resources
to support vulnerable and at-risk communities. Our findings demonstrate distinct patterns of
activity pre- and post-COVID across neighborhoods. The variation in exposure density has a direct
and measurable impact on the risk of infection.
