Objective: Translational science aims at "translating" basic scientific discoveries into clinical
applications. The identification of translational science has practicality such as evaluating
the effectiveness of investments made into large programs like the Clinical and Translational
Science Awards. Despite several proposed methods that group publications---the primary unit
of research output---into some categories, we still lack a quantitative way to place papers onto
the full, continuous spectrum from basic research to clinical medicine. Methods: Here we learn
vector-representations of controlled vocabularies assigned to MEDLINE papers to obtain a Translational
Axis (TA) that points from basic science to clinical medicine. The projected position of a term on
the TA, expressed by a continuous quantity, indicates the term's "appliedness." The position of
a paper, determined by the average location over its terms, quantifies the degree of its "appliedness,"
which we term as "level score." Results: We validate our method by comparing with previous techniques,
showing excellent agreement yet uncovering significant variations of scores of papers in previously
defined categories. The measure allows us to characterize the standing of journals, disciplines,
and the entire biomedical literature along the basic-applied spectrum. Analysis on large-scale
citation network reveals two main findings. First, direct citations mainly occurred between papers
with similar scores. Second, shortest paths are more likely ended up with a paper closer to the basic
end of the spectrum, regardless of where the starting paper is on the spectrum. Conclusions: The
proposed method provides a quantitative way to identify translational science.
