Datasets are crucial when training a deep neural network. When datasets are unrepresentative,
trained models are prone to bias because they are unable to generalise to real world settings. This
is particularly problematic for models trained in specific cultural contexts, which may not represent
a wide range of races, and thus fail to generalise. This is a particular challenge for Driver drowsiness
detection, where many publicly available datasets are unrepresentative as they cover only certain
ethnicity groups. Traditional augmentation methods are unable to improve a model's performance
when tested on other groups with different facial attributes, and it is often challenging to build
new, more representative datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that boosts the
performance of detection of drowsiness for different ethnicity groups. Our framework improves
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for prediction by using Generative Adversarial networks
(GAN) for targeted data augmentation based on a population bias visualisation strategy that groups
faces with similar facial attributes and highlights where the model is failing. A sampling method
selects faces where the model is not performing well, which are used to fine-tune the CNN. Experiments
show the efficacy of our approach in improving driver drowsiness detection for under represented
ethnicity groups. Here, models trained on publicly available datasets are compared with a model
trained using the proposed data augmentation strategy. Although developed in the context of driver
drowsiness detection, the proposed framework is not limited to the driver drowsiness detection
task, but can be applied to other applications.
