Biometric authentication is getting increasingly popular due to the convenience of using unique
individual traits, such as fingerprints, palm veins, irises. Especially fingerprints are widely
used nowadays due to the availability and low cost of fingerprint scanners. To avoid identity theft
or impersonation, fingerprint data is typically stored locally, e.g., in a trusted hardware module,
in a single device that is used for user enrollment and authentication. Local storage, however,
limits the ability to implement distributed applications, in which users can enroll their fingerprint
once and use it to access multiple physical locations and mobile applications afterwards. In this
paper, we present a distributed authentication system that stores fingerprint data in a server
or cloud infrastructure in a privacy-preserving way. Multiple devices can be connected and perform
user enrollment or verification. To secure the privacy and integrity of sensitive data, we employ
a cryptographic construct called fuzzy vault. We highlight challenges in implementing fuzzy vault-based
authentication, for which we propose and compare alternative solutions. We conduct a security
analysis of our biometric cryptosystem, and as a proof of concept, we build an authentication system
for access control using resource-constrained devices (Raspberry Pis) connected to fingerprint
scanners and the Microsoft Azure cloud environment. Furthermore, we evaluate the fingerprint
matching algorithm against the well-known FVC2006 database and show that it can achieve comparable
accuracy to widely-used matching techniques that are not designed for privacy, while remaining
efficient with an authentication time of few seconds.
