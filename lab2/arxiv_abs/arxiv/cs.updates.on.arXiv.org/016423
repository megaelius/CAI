We show an $\tilde{O}(n^{p/(p+2)})$-round algorithm in the \congest model for \emph{listing}
of $K_p$ (a clique with $p$ nodes), for all $p =4, p\geq 6$. For $p = 5$, we show an $\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$-round
algorithm. For $p=4$ and $p=5$, our results improve upon the previous state-of-the-art of $O(n^{5/6+o(1)})$
and $O(n^{21/22+o(1)})$, respectively, by Eden et al. [DISC 2019]. For all $p\geq 6$, ours is the
first sub-linear round algorithm for $K_p$ listing. We leverage the recent expander decomposition
algorithm of Chang et al. [SODA 2019] to create clusters with a good mixing time. Three key novelties
in our algorithm are: (1) we carefully iterate our listing process with coupled values of min-degree
within the clusters and arboricity outside the clusters, (2) all the listing is done within the cluster,
which necessitates new techniques for bringing into the cluster the information about \emph{all}
edges that can potentially form $K_p$ instances with the cluster edges, and (3) within each cluster
we use a sparsity-aware listing algorithm, which is faster than a general listing algorithm and
which we can allow the cluster to use since we make sure to sparsify the graph as the iterations proceed.
As a byproduct of our algorithm, we show an \emph{optimal} sparsity-aware algorithm for $K_p$ listing,
which runs in $\tilde{\Theta}(1 + m/n^{1 + 2/p})$ rounds in the \clique model. Previously, Pandurangan
et al. [SPAA 2018], Chang et al. [SODA 2019], and Censor-Hillel et al. [TCS 2020] showed sparsity-aware
algorithms for the case of $p = 3$, yet ours is the first such sparsity aware algorithm for $p \geq 4$.
