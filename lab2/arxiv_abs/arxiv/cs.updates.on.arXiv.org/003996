The ubiquitous complex networks are often composed of regular and irregular components, which
makes uncovering the complexity of network structure into a fundamental challenge in network science.
Exploring the regular information and identifying the roles of microscopic elements in network
organization can help practitioners to recognize the universal principles of network formation
and facilitate network data mining.Despite many algorithms having been proposed for link prediction
and network reconstruction, estimating and regulating the reconstructability of complex networks
remains an inadequately explored problem. With the practical assumption that there has consistence
between local structures of networks and the corresponding adjacency matrices are approximately
low rank, we obtain a self-representation network model in which the organization principles of
networks are captured by representation matrix. According to the model, original networks can
be reconstructed based on observed structure. What's more, the model enables us to estimate to what
extent networks are regulable, in other words, measure the reconstructability of complex networks.
In addition, the model enables us to measure the importance of network links for network regularity
thereby allowing us to regulate the reconstructability of networks. The extensive experiments
on disparate networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and measure. Specifically,
the structural regularity reflects the reconstructability of networks, and the reconstruction
accuracy can be promoted via the deleting of irregular network links independent of specific algorithms.
