In this paper, we propose a normal estimation method for unstructured 3D point clouds. In this method,
a feature constraint mechanism called Local Plane Features Constraint (LPFC) is used and then a
multi-scale selection strategy is introduced. The LPEC can be used in a single-scale point network
architecture for a more stable normal estimation of the unstructured 3D point clouds. In particular,
it can partly overcome the influence of noise on a large sampling scale compared to the other methods
which only use regression loss for normal estimation. For more details, a subnetwork is built after
point-wise features extracted layers of the network and it gives more constraints to each point
of the local patch via a binary classifier in the end. Then we use multi-task optimization to train
the normal estimation and local plane classification tasks simultaneously.Also, to integrate
the advantages of multi-scale results, a scale selection strategy is adopted, which is a data-driven
approach for selecting the optimal scale around each point and encourages subnetwork specialization.
Specifically, we employed a subnetwork called Scale Estimation Network to extract scale weight
information from multi-scale features. More analysis is given about the relations between noise
levels, local boundary, and scales in the experiment. These relationships can be a better guide
to choosing particular scales for a particular model. Besides, the experimental result shows that
our network can distinguish the points on the fitting plane accurately and this can be used to guide
the normal estimation and our multi-scale method can improve the results well. Compared to some
state-of-the-art surface normal estimators, our method is robust to noise and can achieve competitive
results.
