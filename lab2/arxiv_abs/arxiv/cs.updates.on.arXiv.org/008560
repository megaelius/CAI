To reduce manual effort of extracting test cases from natural-language requirements, many approaches
based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been proposed in the literature. Given the large
amount of approaches in this area, and since many practitioners are eager to utilize such techniques,
it is important to synthesize and provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in this area. Our objective
is to summarize the state-of-the-art in NLP-assisted software testing which could benefit practitioners
to potentially utilize those NLP-based techniques. Moreover, this can benefit researchers in
providing an overview of the research landscape. To address the above need, we conducted a survey
in the form of a systematic literature mapping (classification) and systematic literature review
(SLR). After compiling an initial pool of 95 papers, we conducted a systematic voting, and our final
pool included 67 technical papers. This review paper provides an overview of the contribution types
presented in the papers, types of NLP approaches used to assist software testing, types of required
input requirements, and a review of tool support in this area. Some key results we have detected are:
(1) only four of the 38 tools (11%) presented in the papers are available for download; (2) a larger
ratio of the papers (30 of 67) provided a shallow exposure to the NLP aspects (almost no details).
Conclusion: This paper would benefit both practitioners and researchers by serving as an "index"
to the body of knowledge in this area. The results could help practitioners utilizing the existing
NLP-based techniques; this, in turn, reduces the cost of test-case design and decreases the amount
of human resources spent on test activities. After sharing this review with some of our industrial
collaborators, initial insights show that this review can indeed be useful and beneficial to practitioners.
