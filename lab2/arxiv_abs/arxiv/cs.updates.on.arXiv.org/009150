Recent advances in structure-from-motion techniques are enabling many scientific fields to benefit
from the routine creation of detailed 3D models. However, for a large number of applications, only
a single camera is available, due to cost or space constraints in the survey platforms. Monocular
structure-from-motion raises the issue of properly estimating the scale of the 3D models, in order
to later use those models for metrology. The scale can be determined from the presence of visible
objects of known dimensions, or from information on the magnitude of the camera motion provided
by other sensors, such as GPS. This paper addresses the problem of accurately scaling 3D models created
from monocular cameras in GPS-denied environments, such as in underwater applications. Motivated
by the common availability of underwater laser scalers, we present two novel approaches. A fully-calibrated
method enables the use of arbitrary laser setups, while a partially-calibrated method reduces
the need for calibration by only assuming parallelism on the laser beams, with no constraints on
the camera. The proposed methods have several advantages with respect to the existing methods.
The need for laser alignment with the optical axis of the camera is removed, together with the extremely
error-prone manual identification of image points on the 3D model. The performance of the methods
and their applicability was evaluated on both data generated from a realistic 3D model and data collected
during an oceanographic cruise in 2017. Three separate laser configurations have been tested,
encompassing nearly all possible laser setups, to evaluate the effects of terrain roughness, noise,
camera perspective angle and camera-scene distance. In the real scenario, the computation of 6
independent model scale estimates using our fully-calibrated approach, produced values with
standard deviation of 0.3%.
