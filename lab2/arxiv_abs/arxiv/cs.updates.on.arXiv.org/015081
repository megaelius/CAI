Rumors and conspiracy theories thrive in environments of low confidence and low trust. Consequently,
it is not surprising that ones related to the Covid-19 pandemic are proliferating given the lack
of any authoritative scientific consensus on the virus, its spread and containment, or on the long
term social and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently circulating
are ones suggesting that the 5G network activates the virus, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated
by a global cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill
Gates is using it as cover to launch a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to dismiss
these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent events including the destruction
of property, racially fueled attacks against Asian Americans, and demonstrations espousing resistance
to public health orders countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl social
media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated machine-learning methods,
discover the underlying narrative frameworks supporting the generation of these stories. We show
how the various narrative frameworks fueling rumors and conspiracy theories rely on the alignment
of otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the broader reporting
on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can be monitored in near real-time, may
be useful for identifying areas in the news that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation
by conspiracy theorists. Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative
frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be helpful for devising
methods to disrupt their spread.
