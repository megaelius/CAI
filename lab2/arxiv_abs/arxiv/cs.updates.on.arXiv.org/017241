In the CNN based object detectors, feature pyramids are widely exploited to alleviate the problem
of scale variation across object instances. These object detectors, which strengthen features
via a top-down pathway and lateral connections, are mainly to enrich the semantic information of
low-level features, but ignore the enhancement of high-level features. This can lead to an imbalance
between different levels of features, in particular a serious lack of detailed information in the
high-level features, which makes it difficult to get accurate bounding boxes. In this paper, we
introduce a novel two-pronged transductive idea to explore the relationship among different layers
in both backward and forward directions, which can enrich the semantic information of low-level
features and detailed information of high-level features at the same time. Under the guidance of
the two-pronged idea, we propose a Two-Pronged Network (TPNet) to achieve bidirectional transfer
between high-level features and low-level features, which is useful for accurately detecting
object at different scales. Furthermore, due to the distribution imbalance between the hard and
easy samples in single-stage detectors, the gradient of localization loss is always dominated
by the hard examples that have poor localization accuracy. This will enable the model to be biased
toward the hard samples. So in our TPNet, an adaptive IoU based localization loss, named Rectified
IoU (RIoU) loss, is proposed to rectify the gradients of each kind of samples. The Rectified IoU loss
increases the gradients of examples with high IoU while suppressing the gradients of examples with
low IoU, which can improve the overall localization accuracy of model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our TPNet and RIoU loss.
