When voting on a proposal one in fact chooses between two alternatives: (i) A new hypothetical social
state depicted by the proposal and (ii) the status quo (henceforth: Reality); a Yes vote favors a
transition to the proposed hypothetical state, while a No vote favors Reality. Social Choice theory
generalizes voting on one proposal to ranking multiple proposed alternatives; we remorse that
during this generalization, Reality was neglected.Here we propose to rectify this state of affairs
by incorporating Reality into Social Choice. We do so by (i) recognizing Reality as an ever-present
distinguished social state and (ii) always including Reality as one of the social states under consideration
or vote (elections in which the incumbent is not running for reelection being a special case). We
argue that incorporating Reality into Social Choice is natural and useful and that many scenarios
are not treated correctly in its absence. We show that incorporating Reality into Social Choice
necessitates revisiting its foundation, as Arrow's theorem and the Condorcet voting paradox do
not carry over. We then discuss the plethora of research directions opened by taking Reality into
consideration: New models of Social Choice (we discuss two such models); new axioms (we discuss
one such axiom); new voting rules (we mention one such rule); new types of domain restrictions; and
new game-theoretic questions related to strategic voting (we discuss one such game). Arrow's theorem
was taken to show that democracy, conceived as government by the will of the people, is an incoherent
illusion. As Reality-aware Social Choice renders Arrow's theorem vacuous and resolves the Condorcet
voting paradox, it may clear this intellectual blemish on democracy; pave the way for a broad application
of ranked voting according to the Condorcet criterion; and, more generally, may help restore trust
in democracy.
