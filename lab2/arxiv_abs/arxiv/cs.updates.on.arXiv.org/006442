Spiking neural networks (SNNs) possess energy-efficient potential due to event-based computation.
However, supervised training of SNNs remains a challenge as spike activities are non-differentiable.
Previous SNNs training methods can basically be categorized into two classes, backpropagation-like
training methods and plasticity-based learning methods. The former methods are dependent on energy-inefficient
real-valued computation and non-local transmission, as also required in artificial neural networks
(ANNs), while the latter either be considered biologically implausible or exhibit poor performance.
Hence, biologically plausible (bio-plausible) high-performance supervised learning (SL) methods
for SNNs remain deficient. In this paper, we proposed a novel bio-plausible SNN model for SL based
on the symmetric spike-timing dependent plasticity (sym-STDP) rule found in neuroscience. By
combining the sym-STDP rule with bio-plausible synaptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity of the
dynamic threshold, our SNN model implemented SL well and achieved good performance in the benchmark
recognition task (MNIST). To reveal the underlying mechanism of our SL model, we visualized both
layer-based activities and synaptic weights using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) method after training and found that they were well clustered, thereby demonstrating excellent
classification ability. As the learning rules were bio-plausible and based purely on local spike
events, our model could be easily applied to neuromorphic hardware for online training and may be
helpful for understanding SL information processing at the synaptic level in biological neural
systems.
