Previous VoIP steganalysis methods face great challenges in detecting speech signals at low embedding
rates, and they are also generally difficult to perform real-time detection, making them hard to
truly maintain cyberspace security. To solve these two challenges, in this paper, combined with
the sliding window detection algorithm and Convolution Neural Network we propose a real-time VoIP
steganalysis method which based on multi-channel convolution sliding windows. In order to analyze
the correlations between frames and different neighborhood frames in a VoIP signal, we define multi
channel sliding detection windows. Within each sliding window, we design two feature extraction
channels which contain multiple convolution layers with multiple convolution kernels each layer
to extract correlation features of the input signal. Then based on these extracted features, we
use a forward fully connected network for feature fusion. Finally, by analyzing the statistical
distribution of these features, the discriminator will determine whether the input speech signal
contains covert information or not.We designed several experiments to test the proposed model's
detection ability under various conditions, including different embedding rates, different
speech length, etc. Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperforms all the previous
methods, especially in the case of low embedding rate, which showed state-of-the-art performance.
In addition, we also tested the detection efficiency of the proposed model, and the results showed
that it can achieve almost real-time detection of VoIP speech signals.
