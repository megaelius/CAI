Industrial control systems are critical to the operation of industrial facilities, especially
for critical infrastructures, such as refineries, power grids, and transportation systems. Similar
to other information systems, a significant threat to industrial control systems is the attack
from cyberspace---the offensive maneuvers launched by "anonymous" in the digital world that target
computer-based assets with the goal of compromising a system's functions or probing for information.
Owing to the importance of industrial control systems, and the possibly devastating consequences
of being attacked, significant endeavors have been attempted to secure industrial control systems
from cyberattacks. Among them are intrusion detection systems that serve as the first line of defense
by monitoring and reporting potentially malicious activities. Classical machine-learning-based
intrusion detection methods usually generate prediction models by learning modest-sized training
samples all at once. Such approach is not always applicable to industrial control systems, as industrial
control systems must process continuous control commands with limited computational resources
in a nonstop way. To satisfy such requirements, we propose using online learning to learn prediction
models from the controlling data stream. We introduce several state-of-the-art online learning
algorithms categorically, and illustrate their efficacies on two typically used testbeds---power
system and gas pipeline. Further, we explore a new cost-sensitive online learning algorithm to
solve the class-imbalance problem that is pervasive in industrial intrusion detection systems.
Our experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an overall improvement
in the detection rate of cyberattacks in industrial control systems.
