One of the most exciting advancements in AI over the last decade is the wide adoption of ANNs, such
as DNN and CNN, in many real-world applications. However, the underlying massive amounts of computation
and storage requirement greatly challenge their applicability in resource-limited platforms
like the drone, mobile phone, and IoT devices etc. The third generation of neural network model--Spiking
Neural Network (SNN), inspired by the working mechanism and efficiency of human brain, has emerged
as a promising solution for achieving more impressive computing and power efficiency within light-weighted
devices (e.g. single chip). However, the relevant research activities have been narrowly carried
out on conventional rate-based spiking system designs for fulfilling the practical cognitive
tasks, underestimating SNN's energy efficiency, throughput, and system flexibility. Although
the time-based SNN can be more attractive conceptually, its potentials are not unleashed in realistic
applications due to lack of efficient coding and practical learning schemes. In this work, a Precise-Time-Dependent
Single Spike Neuromorphic Architecture, namely "PT-Spike", is developed to bridge this gap. Three
constituent hardware-favorable techniques: precise single-spike temporal encoding, efficient
supervised temporal learning, and fast asymmetric decoding are proposed accordingly to boost
the energy efficiency and data processing capability of the time-based SNN at a more compact neural
network model size when executing real cognitive tasks. Simulation results show that "PT-Spike"
demonstrates significant improvements in network size, processing efficiency and power consumption
with marginal classification accuracy degradation when compared with the rate-based SNN and ANN
under the similar network configuration.
