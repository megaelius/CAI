Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading causes of death around the world. One of the most common
imaging methods for diagnosing this disease is X-ray angiography. Diagnosing using these images
is usually challenging due to non-uniform illumination, low contrast, presence of other body tissues,
presence of catheter etc. These challenges make the diagnoses task of cardiologists tougher and
more prone to misdiagnosis. In this paper we propose a new automated framework for coronary arteries
segmentation, catheter detection and center-line extraction in x-ray angiography images. Our
proposed segmentation method is based on superpixels. In this method at first three different superpixel
scales are exploited and a measure for vesselness probability of each superpixel is determined.
A majority voting is used for obtaining an initial segmentation map from these three superpixel
scales. This initial segmentation is refined by finding the orthogonal line on each ridge pixel
of vessel region. In this framework we use our catheter detection and tracking method which detects
the catheter by finding its ridge in the first frame and traces in other frames by fitting a second
order polynomial on it. Also we use the image ridges for extracting the coronary arteries centerlines.
We evaluated our method qualitatively and quantitatively on two different challenging datasets
and compared it with one of the previous well-known coronary arteries segmentation methods. Our
method could detect the catheter and reduced the false positive rate in addition to achieving better
segmentation results. The evaluation results prove that our method performs better in a much shorter
time.
