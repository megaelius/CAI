In this paper, we study the optimal design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer
(SWIPT) in downlink multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. For
information transmission, we consider two types of multiple access schemes, namely, time division
multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). At the receiver
side, due to the practical limitation that circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are
not yet able to decode the carried information directly, each user applies either time switching
(TS) or power splitting (PS) to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding
(ID) processes. For the TDMA-based information transmission, we employ TS at the receivers; for
the OFDMA-based information transmission, we employ PS at the receivers. Under the above two scenarios,
we address the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate over all users by varying the time/frequency
power allocation and either TS or PS ratio, subject to a minimum harvested energy constraint on each
user as well as a peak and/or total transmission power constraint. For the TS scheme, by an appropriate
variable transformation the problem is reformulated as a convex problem, for which the optimal
power allocation and TS ratio are obtained by the Lagrange duality method. For the PS scheme, we propose
an iterative algorithm to optimize the power allocation, subcarrier (SC) allocation and the PS
ratio for each user. The performances of the two schemes are compared numerically as well as analytically
for the special case of single-user setup. It is revealed that the peak power constraint imposed
on each OFDM SC as well as the number of users in the system play a key role in the rate-energy performance
comparison by the two proposed schemes.
