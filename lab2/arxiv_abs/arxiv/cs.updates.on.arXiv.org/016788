We consider the problem of sampling connected induced $k$-node subgraphs ($k$-graphlets) uniformly
at random from a given graph $G=(V,E)$. The best algorithms known achieve $\epsilon$-uniformity
and are based on random walks or color coding. The random walk approach has a worst-case running time
of $\Delta^{\!\Theta(k)}\log\frac{n}{\epsilon}$ where $n=|V|$ and $\Delta$ is the maximum
degree of $G$, while color coding requires a preprocessing that takes time and space $2^{\Theta(k)}O(m
\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ where $m=|E|$. Our main result is an algorithm for $\epsilon$-uniform
sampling with the following guarantees. The preprocessing runs in time $k^{O(k)}O\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\,
n \log n \big)$ and space $O(n)$. After, the algorithm yields independent $\epsilon$-uniform $k$-graphlets
in $k^{{O}(k)}{O}\big((\frac{1}{\epsilon})^{10}\log \frac{1}{\epsilon} \big)$ expected
time per sample. The preprocessing phase computes in one pass an approximate ordering of $G$ that
makes rejection sampling efficient in the sampling phase, and the $\epsilon$-uniformity is based
on estimating cuts and coupling arguments. In fact, the algorithm derives from a much simpler algorithm
which has ${O}(m \log \Delta)$ preprocessing time and returns perfectly uniform $k$-graphlets
from $G$ in $k^{{O}(k)}{O}(\log \Delta)$ expected time per sample. In addition, we give an almost-tight
bound for the random walk technique. More precisely, we show that the most commonly used random walk
has mixing time $k^{{O}(k)} {O}(t(G)(\frac{\Delta}{\delta})^{k-1}\! \log n)$ where $t(G)$
is the mixing time of $G$ and $\delta$ is its minimum degree. This improves on recent results and is
tight up to a factor $k^{{O}(k)} \delta \log n$.
