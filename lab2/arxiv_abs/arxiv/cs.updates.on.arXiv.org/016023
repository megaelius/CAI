Image demosaicing and super-resolution are two important tasks in color imaging pipeline. So far
they have been mostly independently studied in the open literature of deep learning; little is known
about the potential benefit of formulating a joint demosaicing and super-resolution (JDSR) problem.
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end optimization solution to the JDSR problem and demonstrate
its practical significance in computational imaging. Our technical contributions are mainly
two-fold. On network design, we have developed a Residual-Dense Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks
(RDSEN) supported by a pre-demosaicing network (PDNet) as the pre-processing step. We address
the issue of spatio-spectral attention for color-filter-array (CFA) data and discuss how to achieve
better information flow by concatenating Residue-Dense Squeeze-and-Excitation Blocks (RDSEBs)
for JDSR. Experimental results have shown that significant PSNR/SSIM gain can be achieved by RDSEN
over previous network architectures including state-of-the-art RCAN. On perceptual optimization,
we propose to leverage the latest ideas including relativistic discriminator and pre-excitation
perceptual loss function to further improve the visual quality of textured regions in reconstructed
images. Our extensive experiment results have shown that Texture-enhanced Relativistic average
Generative Adversarial Network (TRaGAN) can produce both subjectively more pleasant images and
objectively lower perceptual distortion scores than standard GAN for JDSR. Finally, we have verified
the benefit of JDSR to high-quality image reconstruction from real-world Bayer pattern data collected
by NASA Mars Curiosity.
