Supervised machine learning was successfully used in the past to handle the vast amount of uncertainty
data in dynamic security assessment (DSA). Classifiers are offline trained on simulated operating
conditions and then used in the online operation to identify unreliable conditions in this data.
The concept is to shift time-consuming simulations from online to an offline workflow. However,
relying online solely on these classifiers requires high accuracies that are not always given.
Instead of relying on classifiers this paper focuses on using them to use traditional DSA methods
more efficiently. A probabilistic approach on the output of the classifier is explored in more detail
and used to navigate online DSA simulations across contingencies. An ensemble classifier is learned
and calibrated by using Platt' scaling to provide accurate probability estimates. Subsequently,
asymmetric learning is used to adjust a decision threshold and rank operating conditions across
contingencies. Simulations are then effectively used to reduce operational risks. At the same
time, our approach addresses the asymmetric nature of the learning problem, such as a missed alarm
is more critical than a false alarm. Through a case study on a real dataset of the French Transmission
Grid, it is showcased how the proposed approach quickly reduces inaccurate predictions and risks.
We further study the sensitivity of the approach against inaccurate estimations, such as the probabilities
of contingencies. Finally, the scalability to several contingencies and operating conditions
is showcased. This is a fundamental step forward to support the development of a full probabilistic
DSA that scales to many contingencies.
