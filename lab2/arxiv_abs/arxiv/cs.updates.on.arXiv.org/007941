Propositional dynamic logic (PDL) is presented in Sch\"{u}tte-style mode as one-sided semiformal
tree-like sequent calculus Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$ with standard cut rule and the omega-rule
with principal formulas $\left[ P^{\ast }\right] \!A$. The omega-rule-free derivations in Seq$_{\omega
}^{\text{pdl}}$ are finite (trees) and sequents deducible by these finite derivations are valid
in PDL. Moreover the cut-elimination theorem for Seq$_{\omega}^{\text{pdl}}$ is provable in
Peano Arithmetic (PA)extended by transfinite induction up to Veblen's ordinal $\varphi_\omega\left(
0\right) $. Hence (by the cutfree subformula property) such predicative extension of PA proves
that any given $\left[ P^{\ast }\right] $-free sequent is valid in PDL iff it is deducible in Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$
by a finite cut- and omega-rule-free derivation, while PDL-validity of arbitrary star-free sequents
is decidable in polynomial space. The former also implies a Herbrand-style conclusion that e.g.
a given formula $S=\left\langle P^{\ast }\right\rangle \!A\vee Z$ for star-free $A$ and $Z\ $is
valid in PDL iff there is a $k\geq 0$ and a cut- and omega-rule-free derivation of sequent $A,\left\langle
P\right\rangle ^{1}\!\!A,\cdots,\left\langle P\right\rangle ^{k}\!\!A,B$ where $\left\langle
P\right\rangle^{i}\!A$ is an abbreviation for $\underset{i\ times}{\underbrace{\left\langle
P\right\rangle \cdots \left\langle P\right\rangle }}A$. This eventually leads to PSPACE-decidability
of PDL-validity of $S$, provided that $P$ is atomic and $A$ is in a suitable \emph{basic conjunctive
normal form}. Furthermore we consider star-free formulas $A$ in dual \emph{basic disjunctive
normal form}, and corresponding expansions $S=\left\langle P^{\ast }\right\rangle \!A\vee
Z$ whose PDL-validity problem is known to be EXPTIME-complete. We show that cutfree-derivability
in Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$ (hence PDL-validity) of such $S$\ is equivalent to plain validity
of a suitable ``transparent'' quantified boolean formula $\widehat{S}$. Hence EXPTIME = PSPACE
holds true iff the validity problem for any $\widehat{S}$ involved is solvable by a polynomial-space
deterministic TM. This may reduce the former problem to a more transparent complexity problem in
quantified boolean logic. The whole proof can be formalized in PA extended by transfinite induction
along $\varphi_\omega\left( 0\right)$ -- actually in the corresponding primitive recursive
weakening, $\mathbf{PRA}_{\varphi_{\omega }\left( 0\right)}$.
