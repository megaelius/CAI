Background: An increasing volume of prostate biopsies and a world-wide shortage of uro-pathologists
puts a strain on pathology departments. Additionally, the high intra- and inter-observer variability
in grading can result in over- and undertreatment of prostate cancer. Artificial intelligence
(AI) methods may alleviate these problems by assisting pathologists to reduce workload and harmonize
grading. Methods: We digitized 6,682 needle biopsies from 976 participants in the population based
STHLM3 diagnostic study to train deep neural networks for assessing prostate biopsies. The networks
were evaluated by predicting the presence, extent, and Gleason grade of malignant tissue for an
independent test set comprising 1,631 biopsies from 245 men. We additionally evaluated grading
performance on 87 biopsies individually graded by 23 experienced urological pathologists from
the International Society of Urological Pathology. We assessed discriminatory performance by
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and tumor extent predictions by correlating predicted
millimeter cancer length against measurements by the reporting pathologist. We quantified the
concordance between grades assigned by the AI and the expert urological pathologists using Cohen's
kappa. Results: The performance of the AI to detect and grade cancer in prostate needle biopsy samples
was comparable to that of international experts in prostate pathology. The AI achieved an area under
the ROC curve of 0.997 for distinguishing between benign and malignant biopsy cores, and 0.999 for
distinguishing between men with or without prostate cancer. The correlation between millimeter
cancer predicted by the AI and assigned by the reporting pathologist was 0.96. For assigning Gleason
grades, the AI achieved an average pairwise kappa of 0.62. This was within the range of the corresponding
values for the expert pathologists (0.60 to 0.73).
