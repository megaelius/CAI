We consider the problem of distributed statistical machine learning in adversarial settings,
where some unknown and time-varying subset of working machines may be compromised and behave arbitrarily
to prevent an accurate model from being learned. This setting captures the potential adversarial
attacks faced by Federated Learning -- a modern machine learning paradigm that is proposed by Google
researchers and has been intensively studied for ensuring user privacy. Formally, we focus on a
distributed system consisting of a parameter server and $m$ working machines. Each working machine
keeps $N/m$ data samples, where $N$ is the total number of samples. The goal is to collectively learn
the underlying true model parameter of dimension $d$. In classical batch gradient descent methods,
the gradients reported to the server by the working machines are aggregated via simple averaging,
which is vulnerable to a single Byzantine failure. In this paper, we propose a Byzantine gradient
descent method based on the geometric median of means of the gradients. We show that our method can
tolerate $q \le (m-1)/2$ Byzantine failures, and the parameter estimate converges in $O(\log N)$
rounds with an estimation error of $\sqrt{d(2q+1)/N}$, hence approaching the optimal error rate
$\sqrt{d/N}$ in the centralized and failure-free setting. The total computational complexity
of our algorithm is of $O((Nd/m) \log N)$ at each working machine and $O(md + kd \log^3 N)$ at the central
server, and the total communication cost is of $O(m d \log N)$. We further provide an application
of our general results to the linear regression problem. A key challenge arises in the above problem
is that Byzantine failures create arbitrary and unspecified dependency among the iterations and
the aggregated gradients. We prove that the aggregated gradient converges uniformly to the true
gradient function.
