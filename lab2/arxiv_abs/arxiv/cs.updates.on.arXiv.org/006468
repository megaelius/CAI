Algorithms for Magnetic Resonance (MR) image reconstruction from undersampled measurements
exploit prior information to compensate for missing k-space data. Deep learning (DL) provides
a powerful framework for extracting such information from existing image datasets, through learning,
and then using it for reconstruction. Leveraging this, recent methods employed DL to learn mappings
from undersampled to fully sampled images using paired datasets, including undersampled and corresponding
fully sampled images, integrating prior knowledge implicitly. In this article, we propose an alternative
approach that learns the probability distribution of fully sampled MR images using unsupervised
DL, specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and use this as an explicit prior term in reconstruction,
completely decoupling the encoding operation from the prior. The resulting reconstruction algorithm
enjoys a powerful image prior to compensate for missing k-space data without requiring paired datasets
for training nor being prone to associated sensitivities, such as deviations in undersampling
patterns used in training and test time or coil settings. We evaluated the proposed method with T1
weighted images from a publicly available dataset, multi-coil complex images acquired from healthy
volunteers (N=8) and images with white matter lesions. The proposed algorithm, using the VAE prior,
produced visually high quality reconstructions and achieved low RMSE values, outperforming most
of the alternative methods on the same dataset. On multi-coil complex data, the algorithm yielded
accurate magnitude and phase reconstruction results. In the experiments on images with white matter
lesions, the method faithfully reconstructed the lesions. Keywords: Reconstruction, MRI, prior
