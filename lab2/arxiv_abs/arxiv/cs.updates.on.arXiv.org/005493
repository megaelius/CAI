Enhancing visual qualities of images plays very important roles in various vision and learning
applications. In the past few years, both knowledge-driven maximum a posterior (MAP) with prior
modelings and fully data-dependent convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques have been investigated
to address specific enhancement tasks. In this paper, by exploiting the advantages of these two
types of mechanisms within a complementary propagation perspective, we propose a unified framework,
named deep prior ensemble (DPE), for solving various image enhancement tasks. Specifically, we
first establish the basic propagation scheme based on the fundamental image modeling cues and then
introduce residual CNNs to help predicting the propagation direction at each stage. By designing
prior projections to perform feedback control, we theoretically prove that even with experience-inspired
CNNs, DPE is definitely converged and the output will always satisfy our fundamental task constraints.
The main advantage against conventional optimization-based MAP approaches is that our descent
directions are learned from collected training data, thus are much more robust to unwanted local
minimums. While, compared with existing CNN type networks, which are often designed in heuristic
manners without theoretical guarantees, DPE is able to gain advantages from rich task cues investigated
on the bases of domain knowledges. Therefore, DPE actually provides a generic ensemble methodology
to integrate both knowledge and data-based cues for different image enhancement tasks. More importantly,
our theoretical investigations verify that the feedforward propagations of DPE are properly controlled
toward our desired solution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DPE outperforms
state-of-the-arts on a variety of image enhancement tasks in terms of both quantitative measure
and visual perception quality.
