The ridesharing economy is experiencing rapid growth and innovation. Companies such as Uber and
Lyft are continuing to grow at a considerable pace while providing their platform as an organizing
medium for ridesharing services, increasing consumer utility as well as employing thousands in
part-time positions. However, many challenges remain in the modeling of ridesharing services,
many of which are not currently under wide consideration. In this paper, an agent-based model is
developed to simulate a ridesharing service in the Washington D.C. metropolitan region. The model
is used to examine levels of utility gained for both riders (customers) and drivers (service providers)
of a generic ridesharing service. A description of the Individual Agent Metro-Washington Area
Ridesharing Model (IAMWARM) is provided, as well as a description of a typical simulation run. We
investigate the financial gains of drivers for a 24-hour period under two scenarios and two spatial
movement behaviors. The two spatial behaviors were random movement and Voronoi movement, which
we describe. Both movement behaviors were tested under a stationary run conditions scenario and
a variable run conditions scenario. We find that Voronoi movement increased drivers' utility gained
but that emergence of this system property was only viable under variable scenario conditions.
This result provides two important insights: The first is that driver movement decisions prior
to passenger pickup can impact financial gain for the service and drivers, and consequently, rate
of successful pickup for riders. The second is that this phenomenon is only evident under experimentation
conditions where variability in passenger and driver arrival rates are administered.
