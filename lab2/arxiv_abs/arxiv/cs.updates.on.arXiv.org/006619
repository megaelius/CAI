One of the most important tasks in network management is identifying different types of traffic
flows. As a result, a type of management service, called Network Traffic Classifier (NTC), has been
introduced. One type of NTCs that has gained huge attention in recent years applies deep learning
on packets in order to classify flows. Internet is an imbalanced environment i.e., some classes
of applications are a lot more populated than others e.g., HTTP. Additionally, one of the challenges
in deep learning methods is that they do not perform well in imbalanced environments in terms of evaluation
metrics such as precision, recall, and $\mathrm{F_1}$ measure. In order to solve this problem,
we recommend the use of augmentation methods to balance the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel
data augmentation approach based on the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating
traffic flow patterns and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for replicating the numerical features
of each class. First, we use the LSTM network in order to learn and generate the sequence of packets
in a flow for classes with less population. Then, we complete the features of the sequence with generating
random values based on the distribution of a certain feature, which will be estimated using KDE.
Finally, we compare the training of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) in large-scale
imbalanced, sampled, and augmented datasets. The contribution of our augmentation scheme is then
evaluated on all of the datasets through measurements of precision, recall, and F1 measure for every
class of application. The results demonstrate that our scheme is well suited for network traffic
flow datasets and improves the performance of deep learning algorithms when it comes to above-mentioned
metrics.
