We prove several decidability and undecidability results for the satisfiability and validity
problems for languages that can express solutions to word equations with length constraints. The
atomic formulas over this language are equality over string terms (word equations), linear inequality
over the length function (length constraints), and membership in regular sets. These questions
are important in logic, program analysis, and formal verification. Variants of these questions
have been studied for many decades by mathematicians. More recently, practical satisfiability
procedures (aka SMT solvers) for these formulas have become increasingly important in the context
of security analysis for string-manipulating programs such as web applications. We prove three
main theorems. First, we give a new proof of undecidability for the validity problem for the set of
sentences written as a forall-exists quantifier alternation applied to positive word equations.
A corollary of this undecidability result is that this set is undecidable even with sentences with
at most two occurrences of a string variable. Second, we consider Boolean combinations of quantifier-free
formulas constructed out of word equations and length constraints. We show that if word equations
can be converted to a solved form, a form relevant in practice, then the satisfiability problem for
Boolean combinations of word equations and length constraints is decidable. Third, we show that
the satisfiability problem for quantifier-free formulas over word equations in regular solved
form, length constraints, and the membership predicate over regular expressions is also decidable.
