Counterfactual evaluation of novel treatment assignment functions (e.g., advertising algorithms
and recommender systems) is one of the most crucial causal inference problems for practitioners.
Traditionally, randomized controlled trials (A/B tests) are performed to evaluate treatment
assignment functions. However, such trials can be time-consuming, expensive, and even unethical
in some cases. Therefore, offline counterfactual evaluation of treatment assignment functions
becomes a pressing issue because a massive amount of observational data is available in today's
big data era. Counterfactual evaluation requires handling the hidden confounders -- the unmeasured
features which causally influence both the treatment assignment and the outcome. To deal with the
hidden confounders, most of the existing methods rely on the assumption of no hidden confounders.
However, this assumption can be untenable in the context of massive observational data. When such
data comes with network information, the later can be potentially useful to correct hidden confounding
bias. As such, we first formulate a novel problem, counterfactual evaluation of treatment assignment
functions with networked observational data. Then, we investigate the following research questions:
How can we utilize network information in counterfactual evaluation? Can network information
improve the estimates in counterfactual evaluation? Toward answering these questions, first,
we propose a novel framework, \emph{Counterfactual Network Evaluator} (CONE), which (1) learns
partial representations of latent confounders under the supervision of observed treatments and
outcomes; and (2) combines them for counterfactual evaluation. Then through extensive experiments,
we corroborate the effectiveness of CONE. The results imply that incorporating network information
mitigates hidden confounding bias in counterfactual evaluation.
