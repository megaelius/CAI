We propose a novel two-layer multi-agent architecture aimed at efficient real-time control of
large-scale and complex-dynamics systems. The proposed architecture integrates intelligent
control approaches (which have a low computation time and fit real-time applications) with model-predictive
control (which takes care of the optimality requirements of control). The bottom control layer
(intelligent-control module) includes several distributed intelligent-control agents, the
design parameters of which are tuned by the top layer (model-predictive control module). The model-predictive
control module fulfills two significant roles: looking ahead to the effects of the control decisions,
and coordinating the intelligent-control agents of the lower control layer. The resulting multi-agent
control system has a very low computation time, and provides adaptivity, control coordination,
and aims at excellent performance. Additionally, we give a general treatment of type-2 fuzzy membership
functions, and introduce two categories for them: probabilistic-fuzzy (which is a novel concept
introduced in this paper) and fuzzy-fuzzy (which is a new treatment of the existing type-2 fuzzy
membership functions). The performance of the proposed modeling and control approaches are assessed
via a case study involving a simple urban traffic network: the results show that the novel concept
of probabilistic-fuzzy membership function outperforms the type-1 and type-2 membership functions
that have already been introduced in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed two-layer integrated
multi-agent control architecture significantly outperforms a multi-agent decentralized fuzzy
control system (without coordination among the agents), while requiring a comparable computation
time.
