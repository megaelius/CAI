Person identification technology recognizes individuals by exploiting their unique, measurable
physiological and behavioral characteristics. However, the state-of-the-art person identification
systems have been shown to be vulnerable, e.g., contact lenses can trick iris recognition and fingerprint
films can deceive fingerprint sensors. EEG (Electroencephalography)-based identification,
which utilizes the users brainwave signals for identification and offers a more resilient solution,
draw a lot of attention recently. However, the accuracy still requires improvement and very little
work is focusing on the robustness and adaptability of the identification system. We propose MindID,
an EEG-based biometric identification approach, achieves higher accuracy and better characteristics.
At first, the EEG data patterns are analyzed and the results show that the Delta pattern contains
the most distinctive information for user identification. Then the decomposed Delta pattern is
fed into an attention-based Encoder-Decoder RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) structure which
assigns varies attention weights to different EEG channels based on the channels importance. The
discriminative representations learned from the attention-based RNN are used to recognize the
user identification through a boosting classifier. The proposed approach is evaluated over 3 datasets
(two local and one public). One local dataset (EID-M) is used for performance assessment and the
result illustrate that our model achieves the accuracy of 0.982 which outperforms the baselines
and the state-of-the-art. Another local dataset (EID-S) and a public dataset (EEG-S) are utilized
to demonstrate the robustness and adaptability, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed
approach has the potential to be largely deployment in practice environment.
