We propose and analyze the $\varepsilon$-Noisy Goal Prediction Game to study a fundamental privacy
versus efficiency tradeoff in dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. An agent wants to quickly
reach a final goal in a network through a sequence of actions, while the effects of these actions are
subject to random noise and perturbation. Meanwhile, an overseeing adversary observes the effects
of the agent's past actions and tries to predict the goal. We are interested in understanding the
probability that the adversary predicts the goal correctly (prediction risk) as a function of the
time it takes the agent to reach her goal (delay). Our main results characterize the prediction risk
versus delay tradeoff under various network topologies. First, we establish an asymptotically
tight characterization in complete graphs, showing that (1) intrinsic uncertainty always leads
to a strictly positive overhead for the agent, even as her delay tends to infinity, and (2) under a
carefully designed decision policy the overhead can be only additive with respect to the noise level,
and thus incur an asymptotically negligible effect on system performance. We further apply these
insights to studying network topologies generated by random graphs, and to designing private networks.
In both cases, we show how to achieve an additive overhead even for relatively sparse, non-complete
networks. Finally, for general graphs, we construct a private agent strategy that can operate under
any level of intrinsic uncertainty. Our analysis is centered around a new class of "noise-harvesting"
agent strategies which adaptively combines intrinsic uncertainty with additional artificial
randomization to achieve efficient obfuscation.
