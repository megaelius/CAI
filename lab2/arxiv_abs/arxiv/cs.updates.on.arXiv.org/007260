Knowledge extraction from database is the fundamental task in database and data mining community,
which has been applied to a wide range of real-world applications and situations. Different from
the support-based mining models, the utility-oriented mining framework integrates the utility
theory to provide more informative and useful patterns. Time-dependent sequence data is commonly
seen in real life. Sequence data has been widely utilized in many applications, such as analyzing
sequential user behavior on the Web, influence maximization, route planning, and targeted marketing.
Unfortunately, all the existing algorithms lose sight of the fact that the processed data not only
contain rich features (e.g., occur quantity, risk, profit, etc.), but also may be associated with
multi-dimensional auxiliary information, e.g., transaction sequence can be associated with
purchaser profile information. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of utility mining
across multi-dimensional sequences, and propose a novel framework named MDUS to extract Multi-Dimensional
Utility-oriented Sequential useful patterns. Two algorithms respectively named MDUS_EM and
MDUS_SD are presented to address the formulated problem. The former algorithm is based on database
transformation, and the later one performs pattern joins and a searching method to identify desired
patterns across multi-dimensional sequences. Extensive experiments are carried on five real-life
datasets and one synthetic dataset to show that the proposed algorithms can effectively and efficiently
discover the useful knowledge from multi-dimensional sequential databases. Moreover, the MDUS
framework can provide better insight, and it is more adaptable to real-life situations than the
current existing models.
