A model and expansion plan have been developed to optimally determine microgrid designs as they
evolve to dynamically react to changing conditions and to exploit energy storage capabilities.
In the wake of the highly electrified future ahead of us, the role of energy storage is crucial wherever
distributed generation is abundant, such as microgrid settings. Given the variety of storage options
that are becoming more and more economical, determining which type of storage technology to invest
in, along with the appropriate timing and capacity becomes a critical research question. From a
business perspective, these strategic frameworks aim to optimize the process of storage investment
planning by capturing the dynamic nature of problem parameters that traditional approaches are
unable to. Reinforcement learning algorithms have proven to be successful in problems where sequential
decision-making is inherent. In the operations planning area, these algorithms are already used
but mostly in short-term problems with well-defined constraints. On the contrary, we expand and
tailor these techniques to long-term planning by utilizing model-free algorithms combined with
simulation-based models. We find that certain types of energy storage units, like vanadium-redox
battery, are expected to be at the core of future microgrid applications, and therefore require
further attention. Another key finding is that the optimal storage capacity threshold for a system
depends heavily on the price movements of the available storage units in the market. By utilizing
the proposed approaches, it is possible to model inherent problem uncertainties and optimize the
whole streamline of sequential investment decision-making.
