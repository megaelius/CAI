Most SLAM algorithms are based on the assumption that the scene is static. However, in practice,
most scenes are dynamic which usually contains moving objects, these methods are not suitable.
In this paper, we introduce DymSLAM, a dynamic stereo visual SLAM system being capable of reconstructing
a 4D (3D + time) dynamic scene with rigid moving objects. The only input of DymSLAM is stereo video,
and its output includes a dense map of the static environment, 3D model of the moving objects and the
trajectories of the camera and the moving objects. We at first detect and match the interesting points
between successive frames by using traditional SLAM methods. Then the interesting points belonging
to different motion models (including ego-motion and motion models of rigid moving objects) are
segmented by a multi-model fitting approach. Based on the interesting points belonging to the ego-motion,
we are able to estimate the trajectory of the camera and reconstruct the static background. The interesting
points belonging to the motion models of rigid moving objects are then used to estimate their relative
motion models to the camera and reconstruct the 3D models of the objects. We then transform the relative
motion to the trajectories of the moving objects in the global reference frame. Finally, we then
fuse the 3D models of the moving objects into the 3D map of the environment by considering their motion
trajectories to obtain a 4D (3D+time) sequence. DymSLAM obtains information about the dynamic
objects instead of ignoring them and is suitable for unknown rigid objects. Hence, the proposed
system allows the robot to be employed for high-level tasks, such as obstacle avoidance for dynamic
objects. We conducted experiments in a real-world environment where both the camera and the objects
were moving in a wide range.
