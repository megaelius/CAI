Specialized worker profiles of crowdsourcing platforms may contain a large amount of identifying
and possibly sensitive personal information (e.g., personal preferences, skills, available
slots, available devices) raising strong privacy concerns. This led to the design of privacy-preserving
crowdsourcing platforms, that aim at enabling efficient crowd-sourcing processes while providing
strong privacy guarantees even when the platform is not fully trusted. In this paper, we propose
two contributions. First, we propose the PKD algorithm with the goal of supporting a large variety
of aggregate usages of worker profiles within a privacy-preserving crowdsourcing platform. The
PKD algorithm combines together homomorphic encryption and differential privacy for computing
(perturbed) partitions of the multi-dimensional space of skills of the actual population of workers
and a (perturbed) COUNT of workers per partition. Second, we propose to benefit from recent progresses
in Private Information Retrieval techniques in order to design a solution to task assignment that
is both private and affordable. We perform an in-depth study of the problem of using PIR techniques
for proposing tasks to workers, show that it is NP-Hard, and come up with the PKD PIR Packing heuristic
that groups tasks together according to the partitioning output by the PKD algorithm. In a nutshell,
we design the PKD algorithm and the PKD PIR Packing heuristic, we prove formally their security against
honest-but-curious workers and/or platform, we analyze their complexities, and we demonstrate
their quality and affordability in real-life scenarios through an extensive experimental evaluation
performed over both synthetic and realistic datasets.
