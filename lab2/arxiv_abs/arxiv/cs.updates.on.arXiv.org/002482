In Defective Coloring we are given a graph $G = (V, E)$ and two integers $\chi_d, \Delta^*$ and are
asked if we can partition $V$ into $\chi_d$ color classes, so that each class induces a graph of maximum
degree $\Delta^*$. We investigate the complexity of this generalization of Coloring with respect
to several well-studied graph parameters, and show that the problem is W-hard parameterized by
treewidth, pathwidth, tree-depth, or feedback vertex set, if $\chi_d = 2$. As expected, this hardness
can be extended to larger values of $\chi_d$ for most of these parameters, with one surprising exception:
we show that the problem is FPT parameterized by feedback vertex set for any $\chi_d \ge 2$, and hence
2-coloring is the only hard case for this parameter. In addition to the above, we give an ETH-based
lower bound for treewidth and pathwidth, showing that no algorithm can solve the problem in $n^{o(pw)}$,
essentially matching the complexity of an algorithm obtained with standard techniques. We complement
these results by considering the problem's approximability and show that, with respect to $\Delta^*$,
the problem admits an algorithm which for any $\epsilon > 0$ runs in time $(tw/\epsilon)^{O(tw)}$
and returns a solution with exactly the desired number of colors that approximates the optimal $\Delta^*$
within $(1 + \epsilon)$. We also give a $(tw)^{O(tw)}$ algorithm which achieves the desired $\Delta^*$
exactly while 2-approximating the minimum value of $\chi_d$. We show that this is close to optimal,
by establishing that no FPT algorithm can (under standard assumptions) achieve a better than $3/2$-approximation
to $\chi_d$, even when an extra constant additive error is also allowed.
