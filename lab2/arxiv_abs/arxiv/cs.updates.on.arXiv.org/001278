The Straightness is a measure designed to characterize a pair of vertices in a spatial graph. It is
defined as the ratio of the Euclidean distance to the graph distance between these vertices. It is
often used as an average, for instance to describe the accessibility of a single vertex relatively
to all the other vertices in the graph, or even to summarize the graph as a whole. In some cases, one
needs to process the Straightness between not only vertices, but also any other points constituting
the graph of interest. Suppose for instance that our graph represents a road network and we do not
want to limit ourselves to crossroad-to-crossroad itineraries, but allow any street number to
be a starting point or destination. In this situation, the standard approach consists in: 1) discretizing
the graph edges, 2) processing the vertex-to-vertex Straightness considering the additional
vertices resulting from this discretization, and 3) performing the appropriate average on the
obtained values. However, this discrete approximation can be computationally expensive on large
graphs, and its precision has not been clearly assessed. In this article, we adopt a continuous approach
to average the Straightness over the edges of spatial graphs. This allows us to derive 5 distinct
measures able to characterize precisely the accessibility of the whole graph, as well as individual
vertices and edges. Our method is generic and could be applied to other measures designed for spatial
graphs. We perform an experimental evaluation of our continuous average Straightness measures,
and show how they behave differently from the traditional vertex-to-vertex ones. Moreover, we
also study their discrete approximations, and show that our approach is globally less demanding
in terms of both processing time and memory usage. Our R source code is publicly available under an
