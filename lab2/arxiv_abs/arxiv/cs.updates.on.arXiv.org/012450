Accurate quantification of pulmonary nodules can greatly assist the early diagnosis of lung cancer,
which can enhance patient survival possibilities. A number of nodule segmentation techniques
have been proposed, however, all of the existing techniques rely on radiologist 3-D volume of interest
(VOI) input or use the constant region of interest (ROI) and only investigate the presence of nodule
voxels within the given VOI. Such approaches restrain the solutions to investigate the nodule presence
outside the given VOI and also include the redundant structures into VOI, which may lead to inaccurate
nodule segmentation. In this work, a novel semi-automated approach for 3-D segmentation of nodule
in volumetric computerized tomography (CT) lung scans has been proposed. The proposed technique
can be segregated into two stages, at the first stage, it takes a 2-D ROI containing the nodule as input
and it performs patch-wise investigation along the axial axis with a novel adaptive ROI strategy.
The adaptive ROI algorithm enables the solution to dynamically select the ROI for the surrounding
slices to investigate the presence of nodule using deep residual U-Net architecture. The first
stage provides the initial estimation of nodule which is further utilized to extract the VOI. At
the second stage, the extracted VOI is further investigated along the coronal and sagittal axis
with two different networks and finally, all the estimated masks are fed into the consensus module
to produce the final volumetric segmentation of nodule. The proposed approach has been rigorously
evaluated on the LIDC dataset, which is the largest publicly available dataset. The result suggests
that the approach is significantly robust and accurate as compared to the previous state of the art
techniques.
