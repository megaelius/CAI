Phylogenetic networks are leaf-labelled directed acyclic graphs that are used to describe non-treelike
evolutionary histories and are thus a generalization of phylogenetic trees. The hybridization
number of a phylogenetic network is the sum of all indegrees minus the number of nodes plus one. The
Hybridization Number problem takes as input a collection of phylogenetic trees and asks to construct
a phylogenetic network that contains an embedding of each of the input trees and has a smallest possible
hybridization number. We present an algorithm for the Hybridization Number problem on three binary
trees on $n$ leaves, which runs in time $O(c^k poly(n))$, with $k$ the hybridization number of an
optimal network and $c$ a constant. For two trees, an algorithm with running time $O(3.18^k n)$ was
proposed before whereas an algorithm with running time $O(c^k poly(n))$ for more than two trees
had prior to this article remained elusive. The algorithm for two trees uses the close connection
to acyclic agreement forests to achieve a linear exponent in the running time, while previous algorithms
for more than two trees (explicitly or implicitly) relied on a brute force search through all possible
underlying network topologies, leading to running times that are not $O(c^k poly(n))$ for any $c$.
The connection to acyclic agreement forests is much weaker for more than two trees, so even given
the right agreement forest, reconstructing the network poses major challenges. We prove novel
structural results that allow us to reconstruct a network without having to guess the underlying
topology. Our techniques generalize to more than three input trees with the exception of one key
lemma that maps nodes in the network to tree nodes and, thus, minimizes the amount of guessing involved
in constructing the network. The main open problem therefore is to establish a similar mapping for
more than three trees.
