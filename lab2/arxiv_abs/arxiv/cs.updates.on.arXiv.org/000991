We survey our work on choreographies and behavioural contracts in multiparty interactions. In
particular theories of behavioural contracts are presented which enable reasoning about correct
service composition (contract compliance) and service substitutability (contract refinement
preorder) under different assumptions concerning service communication: synchronous address
or name based communication with patient non-preemptable or impatient invocations, or asynchronous
communication. Correspondingly relations between behavioural contracts and choreographic
descriptions are considered, where a contract for each communicating party is, e.g., derived by
projection. The considered relations are induced as the maximal preoders which preserve contract
compliance and global traces: we show maximality to hold (permitting services to be discovered/substituted
independently for each party) when contract refinement preorders with all the above asymmetric
communication means are considered and, instead, not to hold if the standard symmetric CCS/pi-calculus
communication is considered (or when directly relating choreographies to behavioral contracts
via a preorder, no matter the communication mean). The obtained maximal preorders are then characterized
in terms of a new form of testing, called compliance testing, where not only tests must succeed but
also the system under test (thus relating to controllability theory), and compared with classical
preorders such as may/must testing, trace inclusion, etc. Finally, recent work about adaptable
choreographies and behavioural contracts is presented, where the theory above is extended to update
mechanisms allowing choreographies/contracts to be modified at run-time by internal (self-adaptation)
or external intervention.
