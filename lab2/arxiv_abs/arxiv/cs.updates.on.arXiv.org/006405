We present Fission, a new permissionless blockchain that achieves scalability in both terms of
system throughput and transaction confirmation time, while at the same time, retaining blockchain's
core values of equality and decentralization. Fission overcomes the system throughput bottleneck
by employing a novel Eager-Lazy pipeling model that achieves very high system throughputs via block
pipelining, an adaptive partitioning mechanism that auto-scales to transaction volumes, and
a provably secure energy-efficient consensus protocol to ensure security and robustness. Fission
applies a hybrid network which consists of a relay network, and a peer-to-peer network. The goal
of the relay network is to minimize the transaction confirmation time by minimizing the information
propagation latency. To optimize the performance on the relay network in the presence of churn,
dynamic network topologies, and network heterogeneity, we propose an ultra-fast game-theoretic
relay selection algorithm that achieves near-optimal performance in a fully distributed manner.
Fission's peer-to-peer network complements the relay network and provides a very high data availability
via enabling users to contribute their storage and bandwidth for information dissemination (with
incentive). We propose a distributed online data retrieval strategy that optimally offloads the
relay network without degrading the system performance. By re-innovating all the core elements
of the blockchain technology - computation, networking, and storage - in a holistic manner, Fission
aims to achieve the best balance among scalability, security and decentralization.
