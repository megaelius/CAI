In many scenarios, complete and incomplete information coexist. For this reason, the knowledge
representation and database communities have long shown interest in simultaneously supporting
the closed- and the open-world views when reasoning about logic theories. Here we consider the setting
of querying possibly incomplete data using logic theories, formalized as the evaluation of an ontology-mediated
query (OMQ) that pairs a query with a theory, sometimes called an ontology, expressing background
knowledge. This can be further enriched by specifying a set of closed predicates from the theory
that are to be interpreted under the closed-world assumption, while the rest are interpreted with
the open-world view. In this way we can retrieve more precise answers to queries by leveraging the
partial completeness of the data. The central goal of this paper is to understand the relative expressiveness
of OMQ languages in which the ontology is written in the expressive Description Logic (DL) ALCHOI
and includes a set of closed predicates. We consider a restricted class of conjunctive queries.
Our main result is to show that every query in this non-monotonic query language can be translated
in polynomial time into Datalog with negation under the stable model semantics. To overcome the
challenge that Datalog has no direct means to express the existential quantification present in
ALCHOI, we define a two-player game that characterizes the satisfaction of the ontology, and design
a Datalog query that can decide the existence of a winning strategy for the game. If there are no closed
predicates, that is in the case of querying a plain ALCHOI knowledge base, our translation yields
a positive disjunctive Datalog program of polynomial size. To the best of our knowledge, unlike
previous translations for related fragments with expressive (non-Horn) DLs, these are the first
polynomial time translations.
