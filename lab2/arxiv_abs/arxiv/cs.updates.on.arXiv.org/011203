Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) suffer from sensor drifts in GPS denied environments, which can
lead to potentially dangerous situations. To avoid intolerable sensor drifts in the presence of
GPS spoofing attacks, we propose a safety constrained control framework that adapts the UAV at a
path re-planning level to support resilient state estimation against GPS spoofing attacks. The
proposed framework includes an attack detector, a resilient state estimator, a robust controller,
an attacker location tracker (ALT), and an escape controller (ESC). The attack detector is used
to detect GPS spoofing attacks based on the resilient state estimation and provides a switching
criterion between the robust control mode and emergency control mode. The robust control mode is
on when the GPS is free of attacks. When the GPS spoofing attack is detected, the state estimator only
utilizes IMU signals since GPS signals do not contain legitimate information. To quantify the sensor
drift due to limited sensor availability, we use the escape time which is defined as a safe time under
which the state estimation error remains within a tolerable error with designated confidence.
ALT is developed to track the location of the attacker and estimate the output power of the spoofing
device by the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with sliding window outputs. Using the estimates from
ALT, ESC is designed based on the constrained model predictive controller (MPC) such that the UAV
escapes from the effective range of the spoofing device within the escape time. The numerical simulations
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilient safety constrained control framework.
