An undesirable side effect of reversible color space transformation, which consists of lifting
steps (LSs), is that while removing correlation it contaminates transformed components with noise
from other components. Noise affects particularly adversely the compression ratios of lossless
compression algorithms. To remove correlation without increasing noise, a reversible denoising
and lifting step (RDLS) was proposed that integrates denoising filters into LS. Applying RDLS to
color space transformation results in a new image component transformation that is perfectly reversible
despite involving the inherently irreversible denoising; the first application of such a transformation
is presented in this paper. For the JPEG-LS, JPEG 2000, and JPEG XR standard algorithms in lossless
mode, the application of RDLS to the RDgDb color space transformation with simple denoising filters
is especially effective for images in the native optical resolution of acquisition devices. It
results in improving compression ratios of all those images in cases when unmodified color space
transformation either improves or worsens ratios compared with the untransformed image. The average
improvement is 5.0-6.0\% for two out of the three sets of such images, whereas average ratios of images
from standard test-sets are improved by up to 2.2\%. For the efficient image-adaptive determination
of filters for RDLS, a couple of fast entropy-based estimators of compression effects that may be
used independently of the actual compression algorithm are investigated and an immediate filter
selection method based on the detector precision characteristic model driven by image acquisition
parameters is introduced.
