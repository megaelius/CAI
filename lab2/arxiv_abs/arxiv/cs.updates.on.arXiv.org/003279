In recent years, advances in the design of convolutional neural networks have resulted in significant
improvements on the image classification and object detection problems. One of the advances is
networks built by stacking complex cells, seen in such networks as InceptionNet and NasNet. These
cells are either constructed by hand, generated by generative networks or discovered by search.
Unlike conventional networks (where layers consist of a convolution block, sampling and non linear
unit), the new cells feature more complex designs consisting of several filters and other operators
connected in series and parallel. Recently, several cells have been proposed or generated that
are supersets of previously proposed custom or generated cells. Influenced by this, we introduce
a network construction method based on EnvelopeNets. An EnvelopeNet is a deep convolutional neural
network of stacked EnvelopeCells. EnvelopeCells are supersets (or envelopes) of previously proposed
handcrafted and generated cells. We propose a method to construct improved network architectures
by restructuring EnvelopeNets. The algorithm restructures an EnvelopeNet by rearranging blocks
in the network. It identifies blocks to be restructured using metrics derived from the featuremaps
collected during a partial training run of the EnvelopeNet. The method requires less computation
resources to generate an architecture than an optimized architecture search over the entire search
space of blocks. The restructured networks have higher accuracy on the image classification problem
on a representative dataset than both the generating EnvelopeNet and an equivalent arbitrary network.
