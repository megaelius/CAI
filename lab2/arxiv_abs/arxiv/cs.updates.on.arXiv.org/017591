Within the context of stochastic probing with commitment, we consider the online stochastic matching
problem; that is, the one-sided online bipartite matching problem where edges adjacent to an online
node must be probed to determine if they exist based on edge probabilities that become known when
an online vertex arrives. If a probed edge exists, it must be used in the matching (if possible). We
consider the competitiveness of online algorithms in the random order input model (ROM), when the
offline vertices are weighted. More specifically, we consider a bipartite stochastic graph $G
= (U,V,E)$ where $U$ is the set of offline vertices, $V$ is the set of online vertices and $G$ has edge
probabilities $(p_{e})_{e \in E}$ and vertex weights $(w_{u})_{u \in U}$. Additionally, $G$ has
patience values $(\ell_{v})_{v \in V}$, where $\ell_v$ indicates the maximum number of edges adjacent
to an online vertex $v$ which can be probed. We assume that $U$ and $(w_{u})_{u \in U}$ are known in
advance, and that the patience, adjacent edges and edge probabilities for each online vertex are
only revealed when the online vertex arrives. If any one of the following three conditions is satisfied,
then there is a conceptually simple deterministic greedy algorithm whose competitive ratio is
$1-\frac{1}{e}$. (1) When the offline vertices are unweighted. $\\$ (2) When the online vertex
probabilities are "vertex uniform"; i.e., $p_{u,v} = p_v$ for all $(u,v) \in E$. $\\$ (3) When the
patience constraint $\ell_v$ satisfies $\ell_v \in \{[1,|U|\}$ for every online vertex; i.e.,
every online vertex either has unit or full patience. Setting the probability $p_e = 1$ for all $e
\in E$, the stochastic problem becomes the classical online bipartite matching problem. Our competitive
ratios thus generalize corresponding results for the classical ROM bipartite matching setting.
