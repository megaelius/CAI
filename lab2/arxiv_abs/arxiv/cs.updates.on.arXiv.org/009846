In this paper, we propose an efficient online multi-object tracking framework based on the GMPHD
filter and occlusion group management scheme where the GMPHD filter utilizes hierarchical data
association to reduce the false negatives caused by miss detection. The hierarchical data association
consists of two steps: detection-to-track and track-to-track associations, which can recover
the lost tracks and their switched IDs. In addition, the proposed framework is equipped with an object
grouping management scheme which handles occlusion problems with two main parts. The first part
is "track merging" which can merge the false positive tracks caused by false positive detections
from occlusions, where the false positive tracks are usually occluded with a measure. The measure
is the occlusion ratio between visual objects, sum-of-intersection-over-area (SIOA) we defined
instead of the IOU metric. The second part is "occlusion group energy minimization (OGEM)" which
prevents the occluded true positive tracks from false "track merging". We define each group of the
occluded objects as an energy function and find an optimal hypothesis which makes the energy minimal.
We evaluate the proposed tracker in benchmark datasets such as MOT15 and MOT17 which are built for
multi-person tracking. An ablation study in training dataset shows that not only "track merging"
and "OGEM" complement each other but also the proposed tracking method has more robust performance
and less sensitive to parameters than baseline methods. Also, SIOA works better than IOU for various
sizes of false positives. Experimental results show that the proposed tracker efficiently handles
occlusion situations and achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art
methods. Especially, our method shows the best multi-object tracking accuracy among the online
and real-time executable methods.
