In this work, we analyze an unfitted discontinuous Galerkin discretization for the numerical solution
of the Stokes system based on equal higher-order discontinuous velocities and pressures. This
approach combines the best from both worlds, firstly the advantages of a piece-wise discontinuous
high--order accurate approximation and secondly the advantages of an unfitted to the true geometry
grid around possibly complex objects and/or geometrical deformations. Utilizing a fictitious
domain framework, the physical domain of interest is embedded in an unfitted background mesh and
the geometrically unfitted discretization is built upon symmetric interior penalty discontinuous
Galerkin formulation. A fully stabilized frame is required for equal order finite elements, both
--proper for higher-order-- pressure Poisson stabilization in the bulk of the domain, as well as
boundary zone velocity and pressure ghost penalty terms. The present contribution should prove
valuable in engineering applications where special emphasis is placed on the optimal effective
approximation attaining much smaller relative errors in coarser meshes. Inf-sup stability, the
optimal order of convergence, and the stabilization parameters dependency are investigated.
Our analysis of the stability properties of the proposed scheme reveals that a delicate scaling
of the stabilization parameters is required for the equal higher-order case. This is also supported
by numerical evidence from test experiments. Additionally, a geometrically robust estimate for
the condition number of the stiffness matrix is provided. Numerical examples illustrate the implementation
of the method and verify the theoretical findings.
