In this article, we propose a new Support Vector Machine (SVM) training algorithm based on distributed
MapReduce technique. In literature, there are a lots of research that shows us SVM has highest generalization
property among classification algorithms used in machine learning area. Also, SVM classifier
model is not affected by correlations of the features. But SVM uses quadratic optimization techniques
in its training phase. The SVM algorithm is formulated as quadratic optimization problem. Quadratic
optimization problem has $O(m^3)$ time and $O(m^2)$ space complexity, where m is the training set
size. The computation time of SVM training is quadratic in the number of training instances. In this
reason, SVM is not a suitable classification algorithm for large scale dataset classification.
To solve this training problem we developed a new distributed MapReduce method developed. Accordingly,
(i) SVM algorithm is trained in distributed dataset individually; (ii) then merge all support vectors
of classifier model in every trained node; and (iii) iterate these two steps until the classifier
model converges to the optimal classifier function. In the implementation phase, large scale social
media dataset is presented in TFxIDF matrix. The matrix is used for sentiment analysis to get polarization
value. Two and three class models are created for classification method. Confusion matrices of
each classification model are presented in tables. Social media messages corpus consists of 108
public and 66 private universities messages in Turkey. Twitter is used for source of corpus. Twitter
user messages are collected using Twitter Streaming API. Results are shown in graphics and tables.
