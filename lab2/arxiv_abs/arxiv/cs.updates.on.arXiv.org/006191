We show how to solve directed Laplacian systems in nearly-linear time. Given a linear system in an
$n \times n$ Eulerian directed Laplacian with $m$ nonzero entries, we show how to compute an $\epsilon$-approximate
solution in time $O(m \log^{O(1)} (n) \log (1/\epsilon))$. Through reductions from [Cohen et al.
FOCS'16] , this gives the first nearly-linear time algorithms for computing $\epsilon$-approximate
solutions to row or column diagonally dominant linear systems (including arbitrary directed Laplacians)
and computing $\epsilon$-approximations to various properties of random walks on directed graphs,
including stationary distributions, personalized PageRank vectors, hitting times, and escape
probabilities. These bounds improve upon the recent almost-linear algorithms of [Cohen et al.
STOC'17], which gave an algorithm to solve Eulerian Laplacian systems in time $O((m+n2^{O(\sqrt{\log
n \log \log n})})\log^{O(1)}(n \epsilon^{-1}))$. To achieve our results, we provide a structural
result that we believe is of independent interest. We show that Laplacians of all strongly connected
directed graphs have sparse approximate LU-factorizations. That is, for every such directed Laplacian
$ {\mathbf{L}}$, there is a lower triangular matrix $\boldsymbol{\mathit{{\mathfrak{L}}}}$
and an upper triangular matrix $\boldsymbol{\mathit{{\mathfrak{U}}}}$, each with at most $\tilde{O}(n)$
nonzero entries, such that their product $\boldsymbol{\mathit{{\mathfrak{L}}}} \boldsymbol{\mathit{{\mathfrak{U}}}}$
spectrally approximates $ {\mathbf{L}}$ in an appropriate norm. This claim can be viewed as an analogue
of recent work on sparse Cholesky factorizations of Laplacians of undirected graphs. We show how
to construct such factorizations in nearly-linear time and prove that, once constructed, they
yield nearly-linear time algorithms for solving directed Laplacian systems.
