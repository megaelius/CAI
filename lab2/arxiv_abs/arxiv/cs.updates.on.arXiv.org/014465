The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been declared to be a new international health emergence
and no specific drug has been yet identified. Several methods are currently being evaluated such
as protease and glycosylated spike (S) protein inhibitors, that outlines the main fusion site among
coronavirus and host cells. Notwithstanding, the Heptad Repeat 1 (HR1) domain on the glycosylated
spike (S) protein is the region with less mutability and then the most encouraging target for new
inhibitors drugs.The novelty of the proposed approach, compared to others, lies in a precise training
of a deep neural network toward the 2019-nCoV virus. Where a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been
trained to distingue the whole 2019-nCoV protein sequence amongst two different viruses family
such as HIV-1 and Ebola. In this way, the present deep learning system has precise knowledge of peptide
linkage among 2019-nCoV protein structure and differently, of other works, is not trivially trained
on public datasets that have not been provided any ligand-peptide information for 2019-nCoV. Suddenly,
the SNN shows a sensitivity of $83\%$ of peptide affinity classification, where $3027$ peptides
on SATPdb bank have been tested towards the specific region HR1 of 2019-nCoV exhibiting an affinity
of $93\%$ for the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) peptide. This affinity between
PPIase and HR1 can open new horizons of research since several scientific papers have already shown
that CsA immunosuppression drug, a main inhibitor of PPIase, suppress the reproduction of different
CoV virus included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Finally, to ensure the scientific reproducibility,
code and data have been made public at the following link: https://github.com/bionick87/2019-nCoV
