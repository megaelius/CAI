We consider the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem $\max\{c^\top x : A x \leq b,\, x \in Z^n
\}$, parameterized by a right-hand side vector $b \in Z^m$, where $A \in Z^{m \times n}$ is a matrix
of the rank $n$. Let $v$ be an optimal vertex of the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation $\max\{c^\top
x : A x \leq b\}$ and $B$ be a corresponding optimal base. We show that, for almost all $b \in Z^m$, an
optimal point of the square ILP problem $\max\{c^\top x : A_B x \leq b_B,\, x \in Z^n \}$ satisfies
the constraints $A x \leq b$ of the original problem. From works of R. Gomory it directly follows that
the square ILP problem $\max\{c^\top x : A_B x \leq b_B,\, x \in Z^n \}$ can be solved by an algorithm
of the arithmetic complexity $O(n \cdot \delta \cdot \log \delta)$, where $\delta = |\det A_B|$.
Consequently, it can be shown that, for almost all $b \in Z^m$, the original problem $\max\{c^\top
x : A x \leq b,\, x \in Z^n \}$ can be solved by an algorithm of the arithmetic complexity $O(n \cdot \Delta
\cdot \log \Delta)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum absolute value of $n \times n$ minors of $A$. By
the same technique, we give new inequalities on the integrality gap and sparsity of a solution and
slack variables. Another ingredient is a known lemma that states the equality of the maximum absolute
values of rank minors of matrices with orthogonal columns. This lemma gives us a way to transform
ILP problems of the type $\max\{c^\top x : A x = b,\, x \in Z^n_+\}$ to problems of the previous type,
here we assume that $rank(A) = m$ and all the $m \times m$ minors of $A$ are coprime. Consequently,
it follows that, for almost all $b \in Z^m$, there exists an algorithm with the arithmetic complexity
$O((n-m) \cdot \Delta \cdot \log \Delta)$ to solve the problem in the equality form. Sparsity and
integrality gap bounds are also presented.
