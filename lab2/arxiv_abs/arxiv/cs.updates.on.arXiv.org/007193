Blind delegation protocols allow a client to delegate a computation to a server so that the server
learns nothing about the input to the computation apart from its size. For the specific case of quantum
computation we know that blind delegation protocols can achieve information-theoretic security.
In this paper we prove, provided certain complexity-theoretic conjectures are true, that the power
of information-theoretically secure blind delegation protocols for quantum computation (ITS-BQC
protocols) is in a number of ways constrained. In the first part of our paper we provide some indication
that ITS-BQC protocols for delegating $\sf BQP$ computations in which the client and the server
interact only classically are unlikely to exist. We first show that having such a protocol with $O(n^d)$
bits of classical communication implies that $\mathsf{BQP} \subset \mathsf{MA/O(n^d)}$. We
conjecture that this containment is unlikely by providing an oracle relative to which $\mathsf{BQP}
\not\subset \mathsf{MA/O(n^d)}$. We then show that if an ITS-BQC protocol exists with polynomial
classical communication and which allows the client to delegate quantum sampling problems, then
there exist non-uniform circuits of size $2^{n - \mathsf{\Omega}(n/log(n))}$, making polynomially-sized
queries to an $\sf NP^{NP}$ oracle, for computing the permanent of an $n \times n$ matrix. The second
part of our paper concerns ITS-BQC protocols in which the client and the server engage in one round
of quantum communication and then exchange polynomially many classical messages. First, we provide
a complexity-theoretic upper bound on the types of functions that could be delegated in such a protocol,
namely $\mathsf{QCMA/qpoly \cap coQCMA/qpoly}$. Then, we show that having such a protocol for
delegating $\mathsf{NP}$-hard functions implies $\mathsf{coNP^{NP^{NP}}} \subseteq \mathsf{NP^{NP^{PromiseQMA}}}$.
