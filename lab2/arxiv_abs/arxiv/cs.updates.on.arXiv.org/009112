Activity recognition is the ability to identify and recognize the action or goals of the agent. The
agent can be any object or entity that performs action that has end goals. The agents can be a single
agent performing the action or group of agents performing the actions or having some interaction.
Human activity recognition has gained popularity due to its demands in many practical applications
such as entertainment, healthcare, simulations and surveillance systems. Vision based activity
recognition is gaining advantage as it does not require any human intervention or physical contact
with humans. Moreover, there are set of cameras that are networked with the intention to track and
recognize the activities of the agent. Traditional applications that were required to track or
recognize human activities made use of wearable devices. However, such applications require physical
contact of the person. To overcome such challenges, vision based activity recognition system can
be used, which uses a camera to record the video and a processor that performs the task of recognition.
The work is implemented in two stages. In the first stage, an approach for the Implementation of Activity
recognition is proposed using background subtraction of images, followed by 3D- Convolutional
Neural Networks. The impact of using Background subtraction prior to 3D-Convolutional Neural
Networks has been reported. In the second stage, the work is further extended and implemented on
Raspberry Pi, that can be used to record a stream of video, followed by recognizing the activity that
was involved in the video. Thus, a proof-of-concept for activity recognition using small, IoT based
device, is provided, which can enhance the system and extend its applications in various forms like,
increase in portability, networking, and other capabilities of the device.
