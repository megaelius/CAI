We establish the following two main results on order types of points in general position in the plane
(realizable simple planar order types, realizable uniform acyclic oriented matroids of rank~$3$):
- The number of extreme points in an $n$-point order type, chosen uniformly at random from all such
order types, is on average $4+o(1)$. For labeled order types, this number has average $4-\frac{8}{n^2-n+2}$
and variance at most $3$. - The (labeled) order types read off a set of $n$ points sampled independently
from the uniform measure on a convex planar domain, smooth or polygonal, or from a Gaussian distribution
are concentrated, i.e. such sampling typically encounters only a vanishingly small fraction of
all order types of the given size. Result~(a) generalizes to arbitrary dimension $d$ for labeled
order types with the average number of extreme points $2d+o(1)$ and constant variance. We also discuss
to what extent our methods generalize to the abstract setting of uniform acyclic oriented matroids.
Moreover, our methods allow to show the following relative of the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres theorem:
for any fixed $k$, as $n \to \infty$, a proportion $1 - O(1/n)$ of the $n$-point simple order types
contain a triangle enclosing a convex $k$-chain over an edge. For the unlabeled case in (a), we prove
that for any antipodal, finite subset of the $2$-dimensional sphere, the group of orientation preserving
bijections is cyclic, dihedral or one of $A_4$, $S_4$ or $A_5$ (and each case is possible). These
are the finite subgroups of $SO(3)$ and our proof follows the lines of their characterization by
Felix Klein.
