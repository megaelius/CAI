The primary objective of this paper is to build classification models and strategies to identify
breathing sound anomalies (wheeze, crackle) for automated diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary
diseases. In this work we propose a deep CNN-RNN model that classifies respiratory sounds based
on Mel-spectrograms. We also implement a patient specific model tuning strategy that first screens
respiratory patients and then builds patient specific classification models using limited patient
data for reliable anomaly detection. Moreover, we devise a local log quantization strategy for
model weights to reduce the memory footprint for deployment in memory constrained systems such
as wearable devices. The proposed hybrid CNN-RNN model achieves a score of 66.31% on four-class
classification of breathing cycles for ICBHI'17 scientific challenge respiratory sound database.
When the model is re-trained with patient specific data, it produces a score of 71.81% for leave-one-out
validation. The proposed weight quantization technique achieves ~4X reduction in total memory
cost without loss of performance. The main contribution of the paper is as follows: Firstly, the
proposed model is able to achieve state of the art score on the ICBHI'17 dataset. Secondly, deep learning
models are shown to successfully learn domain specific knowledge when pre-trained with breathing
data and produce significantly superior performance compared to generalized models. Finally,
local log quantization of trained weights is shown to be able to reduce the memory requirement significantly.
This type of patient-specific re-training strategy can be very useful in developing reliable long-term
automated patient monitoring systems particularly in wearable healthcare solutions.
