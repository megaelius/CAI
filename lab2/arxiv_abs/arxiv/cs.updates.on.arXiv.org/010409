Driver identification has emerged as a vital research field, where both practitioners and researchers
investigate the potential of driver identification to enable a personalized driving experience.
Within recent years, a selection of studies have reported that individuals could be perfectly identified
based on their driving behavior under controlled conditions. However, research investigating
the potential of driver identification under naturalistic conditions claim accuracies only marginally
higher than random guess. The paper at hand provides a comprehensive summary of the recent work,
highlighting the main discrepancies in the design of the machine learning approaches, primarily
the window length parameter that was considered. Key findings further indicate that the longitudinal
vehicle control information is particularly useful for driver identification, leaving the research
gap on the extent to which the lateral vehicle control can be used for reliable identification. Building
upon existing work, we provide a novel approach for the design of the window length parameter that
provides evidence that reliable driver identification can be achieved with data limited to the
steering wheel only. The results and insights in this paper are based on data collected from the largest
naturalistic driving study conducted in this field. Overall, a neural network based on GRUs was
found to provide better identification performance than traditional methods, increasing the
prediction accuracy from under 15\% to over 65\% for 15 drivers. When leveraging the full field study
dataset, comprising 72 drivers, the accuracy of identification prediction of the approach improved
a random guess approach by a factor of 25.
