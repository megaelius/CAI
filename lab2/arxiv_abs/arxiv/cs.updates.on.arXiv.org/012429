Graph processing has become an important part of various areas of computing, including machine
learning, medical applications, social network analysis, computational sciences, and others.
A growing amount of the associated graph processing workloads are dynamic, with millions of edges
added or removed per second. Graph streaming frameworks are specifically crafted to enable the
processing of such highly dynamic workloads. Recent years have seen the development of many such
frameworks. However, they differ in their general architectures (with key details such as the support
for the parallel execution of graph updates, or the incorporated graph data organization), the
types of updates and workloads allowed, and many others. To facilitate the understanding of this
growing field, we provide the first analysis and taxonomy of dynamic and streaming graph processing.
We focus on identifying the fundamental system designs and on understanding their support for concurrency
and parallelism, and for different graph updates as well as analytics workloads. We also crystallize
the meaning of different concepts associated with streaming graph processing, such as dynamic,
temporal, online, and time-evolving graphs, edge-centric processing, models for the maintenance
of updates, and graph databases. Moreover, we provide a bridge with the very rich landscape of graph
streaming theory by giving a broad overview of recent theoretical related advances, and by analyzing
which graph streaming models and settings could be helpful in developing more powerful streaming
frameworks and designs. We also outline graph streaming workloads and research challenges.
