We tackle the problem of acting in an unknown finite and discrete Markov Decision Process (MDP) for
which the expected shortest path from any state to any other state is bounded by a finite number $D$.
An MDP consists of $S$ states and $A$ possible actions per state. Upon choosing an action $a_t$ at
state $s_t$, one receives a real value reward $r_t$, then one transits to a next state $s_{t+1}$.
The reward $r_t$ is generated from a fixed reward distribution depending only on $(s_t, a_t)$ and
similarly, the next state $s_{t+1}$ is generated from a fixed transition distribution depending
only on $(s_t, a_t)$. The objective is to maximize the accumulated rewards after $T$ interactions.
In this paper, we consider the case where the reward distributions, the transitions, $T$ and $D$
are all unknown. We derive the first polynomial time Bayesian algorithm, BUCRL{} that achieves
up to logarithm factors, a regret (i.e the difference between the accumulated rewards of the optimal
policy and our algorithm) of the optimal order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{DSAT})$. Importantly,
our result holds with high probability for the worst-case (frequentist) regret and not the weaker
notion of Bayesian regret. We perform experiments in a variety of environments that demonstrate
the superiority of our algorithm over previous techniques. Our work also illustrates several results
that will be of independent interest. In particular, we derive a sharper upper bound for the KL-divergence
of Bernoulli random variables. We also derive sharper upper and lower bounds for Beta and Binomial
quantiles. All the bound are very simple and only use elementary functions.
