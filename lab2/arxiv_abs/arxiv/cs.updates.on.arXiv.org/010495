Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a technique to recover source appliances from only the
recorded mains in a household. NILM is unidentifiable and thus a challenge problem because the inferred
power value of an appliance given only the mains could not be unique. To mitigate the unidentifiable
problem, various methods incorporating domain knowledge into NILM have been proposed and shown
effective experimentally. Recently, among these methods, deep neural networks are shown performing
best. Arguably, the recently proposed sequence-to-point (seq2point) learning is promising for
NILM. However, the results were only carried out on the same data domain. It is not clear if the method
could be generalised or transferred to different domains, e.g., the test data were drawn from a different
country comparing to the training data. We address this issue in the paper, and two transfer learning
schemes are proposed, i.e., appliance transfer learning (ATL) and cross-domain transfer learning
(CTL). For ATL, our results show that the latent features learnt by a `complex' appliance, e.g.,
washing machine, can be transferred to a `simple' appliance, e.g., kettle. For CTL, our conclusion
is that the seq2point learning is transferable. Precisely, when the training and test data are in
a similar domain, seq2point learning can be directly applied to the test data without fine tuning;
when the training and test data are in different domains, seq2point learning needs fine tuning before
applying to the test data. Interestingly, we show that only the fully connected layers need fine
tuning for transfer learning. Source code can be found at https://github.com/MingjunZhong/transferNILM.
