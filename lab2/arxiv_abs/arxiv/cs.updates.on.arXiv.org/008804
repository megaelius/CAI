Datacenter systems require efficient troubleshooting and effective resource scheduling so as
to minimize downtimes and to efficiently utilize limited resources. In doing so, datacenter operators
employ streaming analytics for collecting and processing datacenter telemetry over a temporal
window. The quantile operator is key in these systems as it can summarize the typical and abnormal
behavior of the monitored system. Computing quantiles in real-time is resource-intensive as it
requires processing hundreds of millions of events in seconds while providing high quantile accuracy.
We overcome these challenges through workload-driven approximation. Our study uncovers three
insights: (i) values are dominated by a set of recurring small values, (ii) distribution of small
values is consistent across different time scales, and (iii) tail values are dominated by a small
set of large values.We propose QLOVE, an efficient and accurate quantile approximation algorithm
that capitalizes on these insights. QLOVE minimizes memory footprint of the quantile operator
via compression and frequency-based summarization of small values. While these summaries are
stored and processed at sub-window granularity for memory efficiency, they can extend to compute
quantiles on user-defined temporal windows. Low value error for tail quantiles is achieved by retaining
a few tail values per sub-window. QLOVE estimates quantiles with high throughput and less than 5%
relative value error across a wide range of use cases while state-of-the-art algorithms either
have a high relative value error (13-35%) or deliver lower throughput (15-92%).
