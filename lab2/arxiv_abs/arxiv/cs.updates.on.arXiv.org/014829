Object detection has taken advantage of the advances in deep convolutional networks to bring about
significant progress in recent years. Though promising results have been achieved in a multitude
of situations, like pedestrian detection, autonomous driving, etc, the detection of prohibited
items in X-ray images for security inspection has received less attention. Meanwhile, security
inspection often deals with baggage or suitcase where objects are randomly stacked and heavily
overlapped with each other, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in detecting prohibited
items in X-ray images due to the variety in scale, viewpoint, and style in these images. In this work,
first, we propose an attention mechanism named De-occlusion attention module (DOAM), to deal with
the problem of detecting prohibited items with some parts occluded in X-ray images. DOAM hybrids
two attention sub-modules, EAM and RAM, focusing on different information respectively. Second,
we present a well-directed dataset, of which the images in the dataset are annotated manually by
the professional inspectors from Beijing Capital International Airport. Our dataset, named Occluded
Prohibited Items X-ray (OPIXray), which focuses on the detection of occluded prohibited items
in X-ray images, consists of 8885 X-ray images of 5 categories of cutters, considering the fact that
cutters are the most common prohibited items. We evaluate our method on the OPIXray dataset and compare
it to several baselines, including popular methods for detection and attention mechanisms. As
compared to these baselines, our method enjoys a better ability to detect the objects we desire.
We also verify the ability of our method to deal with the occlusion by dividing the testing set into
three subsets according to different occlusion levels and the result shows that our method achieves
a better performance with a higher level of occlusion.
