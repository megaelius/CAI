A shortage of dermatologists causes long wait times for patients who seek dermatologic care. In
addition, the diagnostic accuracy of general practitioners has been reported to be lower than the
accuracy of artificial intelligence software. This article describes the Skincare project (H2020,
EIT Digital). Contributions include enabling technology for clinical decision support based
on interactive machine learning (IML), a reference architecture towards a Digital European Healthcare
Infrastructure (also cf. EIT MCPS), technical components for aggregating digitised patient information,
and the integration of decision support technology into clinical test-bed environments. However,
the main contribution is a diagnostic and decision support system in dermatology for patients and
doctors, an interactive deep learning system for differential diagnosis of malignant skin lesions.
In this article, we describe its functionalities and the user interfaces to facilitate machine
learning from human input. The baseline deep learning system, which delivers state-of-the-art
results and the potential to augment general practitioners and even dermatologists, was developed
and validated using de-identified cases from a dermatology image data base (ISIC), which has about
20000 cases for development and validation, provided by board-certified dermatologists defining
the reference standard for every case. ISIC allows for differential diagnosis, a ranked list of
eight diagnoses, that is used to plan treatments in the common setting of diagnostic ambiguity.
We give an overall description of the outcome of the Skincare project, and we focus on the steps to
support communication and coordination between humans and machine in IML. This is an integral part
of the development of future cognitive assistants in the medical domain, and we describe the necessary
intelligent user interfaces.
