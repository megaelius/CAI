Digitization of histopathology slides has led to several advances, from easy data sharing and collaborations
to the development of digital diagnostic tools. Deep learning (DL) methods for classification
and detection have shown great potential, but often require large amounts of training data that
are hard to collect, and annotate. For many cancer types, the scarceness of data creates barriers
for training DL models. One such scenario relates to detecting tumor metastasis in lymph node tissue,
where the low ratio of tumor to non-tumor cells makes the diagnostic task hard and time-consuming.
DL-based tools can allow faster diagnosis, with potentially increased quality. Unfortunately,
due to the sparsity of tumor cells, annotating this type of data demands a high level of effort from
pathologists. Using weak annotations from slide-level images have shown great potential, but
demand access to a substantial amount of data as well. In this study, we investigate mitigation strategies
for limited data access scenarios. Particularly, we address whether it is possible to exploit mutual
structure between tissues to develop general techniques, wherein data from one type of cancer in
a particular tissue could have diagnostic value for other cancers in other tissues. Our case is exemplified
by a DL model for metastatic colon cancer detection in lymph nodes. Could such a model be trained with
little or even no lymph node data? As alternative data sources, we investigate 1) tumor cells taken
from the primary colon tumor tissue, and 2) cancer data from a different organ (breast), either as
is or transformed to the target domain (colon) using Cycle-GANs. We show that the suggested approaches
make it possible to detect cancer metastasis with no or very little lymph node data, opening up for
the possibility that existing, annotated histopathology data could generalize to other domains.
