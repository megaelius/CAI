Motivated, in part, by the rise of permissionless systems such as Bitcoin where arbitrary nodes
(whose identities are not known apriori) can join and leave at will, we extend established research
in scalable Byzantine agreement to a more practical model where each node (initially) does not know
the identity of other nodes. A node can send to new destinations only by sending to random (or arbitrary)
nodes, or responding (if it chooses) to messages received from those destinations. We assume a synchronous
and fully-connected network, with a full-information, but static Byzantine adversary. A general
drawback of existing Byzantine protocols is that the communication cost incurred by the honest
nodes may not be proportional to those incurred by the Byzantine nodes; in fact, they can be significantly
higher. Our goal is to design Byzantine protocols for fundamental problems which are {\em resource
competitive}, i.e., the number of bits sent by honest nodes is not much more than those sent by Byzantine
nodes. We describe a randomized scalable algorithm to solve Byzantine agreement, leader election,
and committee election in this model. Our algorithm sends an expected $O((T+n)\log n)$ bits and
has latency $O(polylog(n))$, where $n$ is the number of nodes, and $T$ is the minimum of $n^2$ and
the number of bits sent by adversarially controlled nodes. The algorithm is resilient to $(1/4-\epsilon)n$
Byzantine nodes for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$, and succeeds with high probability. Our work can be
considered as a first application of resource-competitive analysis to fundamental Byzantine
problems. To complement our algorithm we also show lower bounds for resource-competitive Byzantine
agreement. We prove that, in general, one cannot hope to design Byzantine protocols that have communication
cost that is significantly smaller than the cost of the Byzantine adversary.
