We study \emph{dynamic} algorithms for maintaining spectral vertex sparsifiers of graphs with
respect to a set of terminals $T$ of our choice. Such objects preserve pairwise resistances, solutions
to systems of linear equations, and energy of electrical flows between the terminals in $T$. We give
a data structure that supports insertions and deletions of edges, and terminal additions, all in
sublinear time. Our result is then applied to the following problems. (1) A data structure for maintaining
solutions to Laplacian systems $\mathbf{L} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, where $\mathbf{L}$ is the
Laplacian matrix and $\mathbf{b}$ is a demand vector. For a bounded degree, unweighted graph, we
support modifications to both $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ while providing access to $\epsilon$-approximations
to the energy of routing an electrical flow with demand $\mathbf{b}$, as well as query access to entries
of a vector $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ such that $\left\lVert \tilde{\mathbf{x}}-\mathbf{L}^{\dagger}
\mathbf{b} \right\rVert_{\mathbf{L}} \leq \epsilon \left\lVert \mathbf{L}^{\dagger} \mathbf{b}
\right\rVert_{\mathbf{L}}$ in $\tilde{O}(n^{11/12}\epsilon^{-5})$ expected amortized update
and query time. (2) A data structure for maintaining All-Pairs Effective Resistance. For an intermixed
sequence of edge insertions, deletions, and resistance queries, our data structure returns $(1
\pm \epsilon)$-approximation to all the resistance queries against an oblivious adversary with
high probability. Its expected amortized update and query times are $\tilde{O}(\min(m^{3/4},n^{5/6}
\epsilon^{-2}) \epsilon^{-4})$ on an unweighted graph, and $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6}\epsilon^{-6})$
on weighted graphs. These results represent the first data structures for maintaining key primitives
from the Laplacian paradigm for graph algorithms in sublinear time without assumptions on the underlying
graph topologies.
