Structural dimensional inspection is vital for the process monitoring, quality control, and fault
diagnosis in the mass production of auto bodies. Comparing with the non-contact measurement, the
high-precision five-axis measuring machine with the touch-trigger probe is a preferred choice
for data collection. It can assist manufacturers in making accurate inspection quickly. As the
increase of free-form surfaces and diverse surface orientations in auto body design, existing
inspection approaches cannot capture some new critical features in the curvature of auto bodies
in an efficient way. Therefore, we need to develop new path planning methods for automated dimensional
inspection of free-form surfaces. This paper proposes an optimal path planning system for automated
programming of measuring point inspection by incorporating probe rotations and effective collision
detection. Specifically, the methodological contributions include: (i) a dynamic searching
volume-based algorithm is developed to detect potential collisions in the local path between measurement
points; (ii) a local path generation method is proposed with the integration of the probe trajectory
and the stylus rotation. Then, the inspection time matrix is proposed to quantify the measuring
time of diverse local paths; (iii) an optimization approach of the global inspection path for all
critical points on the auto body is developed to minimize the total inspection time. A case study
has been conducted on an auto body to verify the performance of the proposed method. Results show
that the collision-free path for the free-form auto body could be generated automatically with
off-line programming, and the proposed method produces about 40% fewer dummy points and needs 32%
less movement time in the auto body inspection process.
