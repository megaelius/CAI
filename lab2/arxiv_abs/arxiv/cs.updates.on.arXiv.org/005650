With the advent of pervasive cloud computing technologies, service reliability and availability
are becoming major concerns,especially as we start to integrate cyber-physical systems with the
cloud networks. A number of smart and connected community systems such as emergency response systems
utilize cloud networks to analyze real-time data streams and provide context-sensitive decision
support.Improving overall system reliability requires us to study all the aspects of the end-to-end
of this distributed system,including the backend data servers. In this paper, we describe a bi-layered
prognostic architecture for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of components of backend
servers,especially those that are subjected to degradation. We show that our architecture is especially
good at predicting the remaining useful life of hard disks. A Deep LSTM Network is used as the backbone
of this fast, data-driven decision framework and dynamically captures the pattern of the incoming
data. In the article, we discuss the architecture of the neural network and describe the mechanisms
to choose the various hyper-parameters. We describe the challenges faced in extracting effective
training sets from highly unorganized and class-imbalanced big data and establish methods for
online predictions with extensive data pre-processing, feature extraction and validation through
test sets with unknown remaining useful lives of the hard disks. Our algorithm performs especially
well in predicting RUL near the critical zone of a device approaching failure.The proposed architecture
is able to predict whether a disk is going to fail in next ten days with an average precision of 0.8435.In
future, we will extend this architecture to learn and predict the RUL of the edge devices in the end-to-end
distributed systems of smart communities, taking into consideration context-sensitive external
features such as weather.
