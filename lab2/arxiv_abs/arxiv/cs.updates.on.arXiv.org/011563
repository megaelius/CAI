Understanding urban dynamics, i.e., how the types and intensity of urban residents' activities
in the city change along with time, is of urgent demand for building an efficient and livable city.
Nonetheless, this is challenging due to the expanding urban population and the complicated spatial
distribution of residents. In this paper, to reveal urban dynamics, we propose a novel system UrbanRhythm
to reveal the urban dynamics hidden in human mobility data. UrbanRhythm addresses three questions:
1) What mobility feature should be used to present residents' high-dimensional activities in the
city? 2) What are basic components of urban dynamics? 3) What are the long-term periodicity and short-term
regularity of urban dynamics? In UrbanRhythm, we extract staying, leaving, arriving three attributes
of mobility and use a image processing method Saak transform to calculate the mobility distribution
feature. For the second question, several city states are identified by hierarchy clustering as
the basic components of urban dynamics, such as sleeping states and working states. We further characterize
the urban dynamics as the transform of city states along time axis. For the third question, we directly
observe the long-term periodicity of urban dynamics from visualization. Then for the short-term
regularity, we design a novel motif analysis method to discovery motifs as well as their hierarchy
relationships. We evaluate our proposed system on two real-life datesets and validate the results
according to App usage records. This study sheds light on urban dynamics hidden in human mobility
and can further pave the way for more complicated mobility behavior modeling and deeper urban understanding.
