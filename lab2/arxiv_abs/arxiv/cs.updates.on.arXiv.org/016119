When the COVID-19 disease pandemic infiltrated the world, there was an immediate need for accurate
information. As with any outbreak, the outbreak follows a clear trajectory, and subsequently,
the supporting information for that outbreak needs to address the needs associated with that stage
of the outbreak. At first, there was a need to inform the public of the information related to the initial
situation related to the "who" of the COVID-19 disease. However, as time continued, the "where",
"when" and "how to" related questions started to emerge in relation to the public healthcare system
themselves. Questions surrounding the health facilities including COVID-19 hospital bed capacity,
locations of designated COVID-19 facilities, and general information related to these facilities
were not easily accessible to the general public. Furthermore, the available information was found
to be outdated, fragmented across several platforms, and still had gaps in the data related to these
facilities. To rectify this problem, a group of volunteers working on the covid19za project stepped
in to assist. Each member leading a part of the project chose to focus on one of four problems related
to the challenges associated with the Hospital information including: data quality, data completeness,
data source validation and data visualisation capacity. As the project developed, so did the sophistication
of the data, visualisation and core function of the project. The future prospects of this project
relate to a Progressive Web Application that will avail this information for the public as well as
healthcare workers through comprehensive mapping and data quality.
