The spectrum of a network or graph $G=(V,E)$ with adjacency matrix $A$, consists of the eigenvalues
of the normalized Laplacian $L= I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$. This set of eigenvalues encapsulates many
aspects of the structure of the graph, including the extent to which the graph posses community structures
at multiple scales. We study the problem of approximating the spectrum $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_{|V|})$,
$0 \le \lambda_1,\le \dots, \le \lambda_{|V|}\le 2$ of $G$ in the regime where the graph is too large
to explicitly calculate the spectrum. We present a sublinear time algorithm that, given the ability
to query a random node in the graph and select a random neighbor of a given node, computes a succinct
representation of an approximation $\widetilde \lambda = (\widetilde \lambda_1,\dots,\widetilde
\lambda_{|V|})$, $0 \le \widetilde \lambda_1,\le \dots, \le \widetilde \lambda_{|V|}\le 2$
such that $\|\widetilde \lambda - \lambda\|_1 \le \epsilon |V|$. Our algorithm has query complexity
and running time $exp(O(1/\epsilon))$, independent of the size of the graph, $|V|$. We demonstrate
the practical viability of our algorithm on 15 different real-world graphs from the Stanford Large
Network Dataset Collection, including social networks, academic collaboration graphs, and road
networks. For the smallest of these graphs, we are able to validate the accuracy of our algorithm
by explicitly calculating the true spectrum; for the larger graphs, such a calculation is computationally
prohibitive. In addition we study the implications of our algorithm to property testing in the bounded
degree graph model.
