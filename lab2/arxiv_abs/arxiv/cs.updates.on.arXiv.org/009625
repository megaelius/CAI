Background: Genomic data have been collected by different institutions and companies and need
to be shared for broader use. In a cross-site genomic data sharing system, a secure and transparent
access control audit module plays an essential role in ensuring the accountability. The 2018 iDASH
competition first track provides us with an opportunity to design efficient logging and querying
system for cross-site genomic dataset access audit. We designed a blockchain-based log system
which can provide a light-weight and widely compatible module for existing blockchain platforms.
The submitted solution won the third place of the competition. In this paper, we report the technical
details in our system. Methods: We present two methods: baseline method and enhanced method. We
started with the baseline method and then adjusted our implementation based on the competition
evaluation criteria and characteristics of the log system. To overcome obstacles of indexing on
the immutable Blockchain system, we designed a hierarchical timestamp structure which supports
efficient range queries on the timestamp field. Results: We implemented our methods in Python3,
tested the scalability, and compared the performance using the test data supplied by competition
organizer. We successfully boosted the log retrieval speed for complex AND queries that contain
multiple predicates. For the range query, we boosted the speed for at least one order of magnitude.
The storage usage is reduced by 25%. Conclusion: We demonstrate that Blockchain can be used to build
a time and space efficient log and query genomic dataset audit trail. Therefore, it provides a promising
solution for sharing genomic data with accountability requirement across multiple sites.
