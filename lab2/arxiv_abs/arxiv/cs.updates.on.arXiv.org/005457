Two nonlinear stochastic complimentary filters are developed on SO(3). They guarantee that errors
in the Rodriguez vector and estimates are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in mean square,
and they converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulation results are presented to illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed filters considering high level of uncertainties in angular velocity
as well as body-frame vector measurements. Keywords: Attitude estimate, Attitude estimator,
