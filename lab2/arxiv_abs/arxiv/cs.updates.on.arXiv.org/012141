Linear regression is a fundamental building block of statistical data analysis. It amounts to estimating
the parameters of a linear model that maps input features to corresponding outputs. In the classical
setting where the precision of each data point is fixed, the famous Aitken/Gauss-Markov theorem
in statistics states that generalized least squares (GLS) is a so-called "Best Linear Unbiased
Estimator" (BLUE). In modern data science, however, one often faces strategic data sources, namely,
individuals who incur a cost for providing high-precision data. In this paper, we study a setting
in which features are public but individuals choose the precision of the outputs they reveal to an
analyst. We assume that the analyst performs linear regression on this dataset, and individuals
benefit from the outcome of this estimation. We model this scenario as a game where individuals minimize
a cost comprising two components: (a) an (agent-specific) disclosure cost for providing high-precision
data; and (b) a (global) estimation cost representing the inaccuracy in the linear model estimate.
In this game, the linear model estimate is a public good that benefits all individuals. We establish
that this game has a unique non-trivial Nash equilibrium. We study the efficiency of this equilibrium
and we prove tight bounds on the price of stability for a large class of disclosure and estimation
costs. Finally, we study the estimator accuracy achieved at equilibrium. We show that, in general,
Aitken's theorem does not hold under strategic data sources, though it does hold if individuals
have identical disclosure costs (up to a multiplicative factor). When individuals have non-identical
costs, we derive a bound on the improvement of the equilibrium estimation cost that can be achieved
by deviating from GLS, under mild assumptions on the disclosure cost functions.
