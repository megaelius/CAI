Randomized linear system solvers have become popular as they have the potential to reduce floating
point complexity while still achieving desirable convergence rates. One particularly promising
class of methods, random sketching solvers, has achieved the best known computational complexity
bounds in theory, but is blunted by two practical considerations: there is no clear way of choosing
the size of the sketching matrix apriori; and there is a nontrivial storage cost of the projected
system. In this work, we make progress towards addressing these issues by implicitly generating
the sketched system and solving it simultaneously through an iterative procedure. As a result,
we replace the question of the size of the sketching matrix with determining appropriate stopping
criteria; we also avoid the costs of explicitly representing the sketched linear system; and our
implicit representation also solves the system at the same time, which controls the per-iteration
computational costs. Additionally, our approach allows us to generate a connection between random
sketching methods and randomized iterative solvers (e.g., randomized Kaczmarz method). As a consequence,
we exploit this connection to (1) produce a stronger, more precise convergence theory for such randomized
iterative solvers under arbitrary sampling schemes (i.i.d., adaptive, permutation, dependent,
etc.), and (2) improve the rates of convergence of randomized iterative solvers at the expense of
a user-determined increases in per-iteration computational and storage costs. We demonstrate
these concepts on numerical examples on forty-nine distinct linear systems.
