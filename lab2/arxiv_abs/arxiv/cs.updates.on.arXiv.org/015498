Ambient backscatter communications (AmBackComs) have been recognized as a spectrum- and energy-efficient
technology for Internet of Things, as it allows passive backscatter devices (BDs) to modulate their
information into the legacy signals, e.g., cellular signals, and reflect them to their associated
receivers while harvesting energy from the legacy signals to power their circuit operation. {\color{black}
However, the co-channel interference between the backscatter link and the legacy link and the non-linear
behavior of energy harvesters at the BDs have largely been ignored in the performance analysis of
AmBackComs. Taking these two aspects, this paper provides a comprehensive outage performance
analysis for an AmBackCom system with multiple backscatter links}, where one of the backscatter
links is opportunistically selected to leverage the legacy signals transmitted in a given resource
block. For any selected backscatter link, we propose an adaptive reflection coefficient (RC),
which is adapted to the non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model and the location of the selected
backscatter link, to minimize the outage probability of the backscatter link. In order to study
the impact of co-channel interference on both backscatter and legacy links, for a selected backscatter
link, we derive the outage probabilities for the legacy link and the backscatter link. Furthermore,
we study the best and worst outage performances for the backscatter system where the selected backscatter
link maximizes or minimizes the signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) at the backscatter
receiver. We also study the best and worst outage performances for the legacy link where the selected
backscatter link results in the lowest and highest co-channel interference to the legacy receiver,
respectively.
