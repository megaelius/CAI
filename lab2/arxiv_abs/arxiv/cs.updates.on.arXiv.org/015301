Similarity measure, also called information measure, is a concept used to distinguish different
objects. It has been studied from different contexts by employing mathematical, psychological,
and fuzzy approaches. Image steganography is the art of hiding secret data into an image in such a
way that it cannot be detected by an intruder. In image steganography, hiding secret data in the plain
or non-edge regions of the image is significant due to the high similarity and redundancy of the pixels
in their neighborhood. However, the similarity measure of the neighboring pixels, i.e., their
proximity in color space, is perceptual rather than mathematical. This paper proposes an interval
type 2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS) to determine the similarity between the neighboring pixels by
involving an instinctive human perception through a rule-based approach. The pixels of the image
having high similarity values, calculated using the proposed IT2 FLS similarity measure, are selected
for embedding via the least significant bit (LSB) method. We term the proposed procedure of steganography
as IT2 FLS LSB method. Moreover, we have developed two more methods, namely, type 1 fuzzy logic system
based least significant bits (T1FLS LSB) and Euclidean distance based similarity measures for
least significant bit (SM LSB) steganographic methods. Experimental simulations were conducted
for a collection of images and quality index metrics, such as PSNR, UQI, and SSIM are used. All the
three steganographic methods are applied on datasets and the quality metrics are calculated. The
obtained stego images and results are shown and thoroughly compared to determine the efficacy of
the IT2 FLS LSB method. Finally, we have done a comparative analysis of the proposed approach with
the existing well-known steganographic methods to show the effectiveness of our proposed steganographic
method.
