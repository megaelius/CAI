This study introduces database expansion using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) algorithm
to expand the database for better relation extraction. Different from other previous relation
extraction researches, our method improves system performance by expanding data. The goal of database
expansion, together with a robust deep learning classifier, is to diminish wrong labels due to the
incomplete or not found nature of relation instances in the relation database (e.g., Freebase).
The study uses a deep learning method (Piecewise Convolutional Neural Network or PCNN) as the base
classifier of our proposed approach: the leveled adversarial attention neural networks (LATTADV-ATT).
In the database expansion process, the semantic entity identification is used to enlarge new instances
using the most similar itemsets of the most common patterns of the data to get its pairs of entities.
About the deep learning method, the use of attention of selective sentences in PCNN can reduce noisy
sentences. Also, the use of adversarial perturbation training is useful to improve the robustness
of system performance. The performance even further is improved using a combination of leveled
strategy and database expansion. There are two issues: 1) database expansion method: rule generation
by allowing step sizes on selected strong semantic of most similar itemsets with aims to find entity
pair for generating instances, 2) a better classifier model for relation extraction. Experimental
result has shown that the use of the database expansion is beneficial. The MDL database expansion
helps improvements in all methods compared to the unexpanded method. The LATTADV-ATT performs
as a good classifier with high precision P@100=0.842 (at no expansion). It is even better while implemented
on the expansion data with P@100=0.891 (at expansion factor k=7).
