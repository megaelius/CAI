Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are integrated circuits that implement reconfigurable
hardware. They are used in modern systems as they are well-suited for creating specialized, highly-optimized
integrated circuits without the need to design and manufacture dedicated chips. As the capacity
of FPGAs grows, it is increasingly common for designers to incorporate implementations of algorithms
and protocols from a range of third-party sources. The monolithic nature of FPGAs means that all
on-chip circuits, including third party black-box designs, must share common on-chip infrastructure,
such as routing resources. In this paper, we present a covert channel based on a previously unexplored
source of information leakage that occurs between adjacent but unconnected, so called "long wires",
on the FPGA chip. We observe that a long wire carrying a logical 1 reduces the delay of nearby wires
and that the delay decreases linearly with the length of wires used. This effect leads to a covert
channel that can be used for both covert communication between circuits, and for exfiltration of
secrets from the chip. We show that the effect is measurable for both static and dynamic signals,
and that it can be detected using very small on-board circuits. In our prototype, we are able to correctly
infer the logical state of an adjacent long wire over 99% of the time, even without error correction,
and for signals that are maintained for as little as $82\mu s$. Using a simple encoding scheme, our
covert channel bandwidth is as high as 6kbps. We characterize the covert channel in detail and show
that it can be replicated on different generations and families of devices (Virtex 5, Virtex 6, and
Artix 7), with different configurations, and is measurable even when multiple competing circuits
are present.
