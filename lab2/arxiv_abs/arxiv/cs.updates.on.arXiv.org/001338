Factor graphs are important models for succinctly representing probability distributions in
machine learning, coding theory, and statistical physics. Several computational problems, such
as computing marginals and partition functions, arise naturally when working with factor graphs.
Belief propagation is a widely deployed iterative method for solving these problems. However,
despite its significant empirical success, not much is known about the correctness and efficiency
of belief propagation. Bethe approximation is an optimization-based framework for approximating
partition functions. While it is known that the stationary points of the Bethe approximation coincide
with the fixed points of belief propagation, in general, the relation between the Bethe approximation
and the partition function is not well understood. It has been observed that for a few classes of factor
graphs, the Bethe approximation always gives a lower bound to the partition function, which distinguishes
them from the general case, where neither a lower bound, nor an upper bound holds universally. This
has been rigorously proved for permanents and for attractive graphical models. Here we consider
bipartite normal factor graphs and show that if the local constraints satisfy a certain analytic
property, the Bethe approximation is a lower bound to the partition function. We arrive at this result
by viewing factor graphs through the lens of polynomials. In this process, we reformulate the Bethe
approximation as a polynomial optimization problem. Our sufficient condition for the lower bound
property to hold is inspired by recent developments in the theory of real stable polynomials. We
believe that this way of viewing factor graphs and its connection to real stability might lead to
a better understanding of belief propagation and factor graphs in general.
