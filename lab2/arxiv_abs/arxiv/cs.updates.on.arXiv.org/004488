As an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method, principal component analysis (PCA) has been
widely considered as an efficient and effective preprocessing step for hyperspectral image (HSI)
processing and analysis tasks. It takes each band as a whole and globally extracts the most representative
bands. However, different homogeneous regions correspond to different objects, whose spectral
features are diverse. It is obviously inappropriate to carry out dimensionality reduction through
a unified projection for an entire HSI. In this paper, a simple but very effective superpixelwise
PCA approach, called SuperPCA, is proposed to learn the intrinsic low-dimensional features of
HSIs. In contrast to classical PCA models, SuperPCA has four main properties. (1) Unlike the traditional
PCA method based on a whole image, SuperPCA takes into account the diversity in different homogeneous
regions, that is, different regions should have different projections. (2) Most of the conventional
feature extraction models cannot directly use the spatial information of HSIs, while SuperPCA
is able to incorporate the spatial context information into the unsupervised dimensionality reduction
by superpixel segmentation. (3) Since the regions obtained by superpixel segmentation have homogeneity,
SuperPCA can extract potential low-dimensional features even under noise. (4) Although SuperPCA
is an unsupervised method, it can achieve competitive performance when compared with supervised
approaches. The resulting features are discriminative, compact, and noise resistant, leading
to improved HSI classification performance. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate
that the SuperPCA model significantly outperforms the conventional PCA based dimensionality
reduction baselines for HSI classification. The Matlab source code is available at https://github.com/junjun-jiang/SuperPCA.
