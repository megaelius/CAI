Pedestrian trajectory prediction in dynamic scenes remains a challenging and critical problem
in numerous applications, such as self-driving cars and socially aware robots. Challenges concentrate
on capturing pedestrians' social interactions and handling their future uncertainties. Pedestrians'
head orientations can be used as an oracle that indicates relevant pedestrians[1], thus is beneficial
to model social interactions. Moreover, latent variable distributions of pedestrians'future
trajectories can be termed as another oracle. However, few works fully utilize these oracle information
for an improved prediction performance. In this work, we propose GTPPO (Graph-based Trajectory
Predictor with Pseudo Oracle), which is a generative model-based trajectory predictor. Pedestrians'social
interactions are captured by the proposed GA2T (Graph Attention social Attention neTwork) module.
Social attention is calculated on the basis of pedestrians' moving directions, which are termed
as a pseudo oracle. Moreover, we propose a latent variable predictor to learn the latent variable
distribution from observed trajectories. Such latent variable distribution reflects pedestrians'future
trajectories, and therefore can be taken as another pseudo oracle. We compare the performance of
GTPPO with several recently proposed methods on benchmarking datasets. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that GTPPO outperforms state-of-the-art methods with lower average and final displacement
errors. Qualitative evaluations show that GTPPO successfully recognizes the sudden motion changes
since the estimated latent variable reflects the future trajectories.
