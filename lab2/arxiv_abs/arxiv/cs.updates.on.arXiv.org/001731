In vehicular cyber-physical systems (CPS), safety information, including vehicular speed and
location information, is shared among vehicles via wireless waves at specific frequency. This
helps control vehicle to alleviate traffic congestion and road accidents. However, Doppler shift
existing between vehicles with high relative speed causes an apparent frequency shift for the received
wireless wave, which consequently decreases the reliability of the recovered safety information
and jeopardizes the safety of vehicular CPS. Passive confrontation of Doppler shift at the receiver
side is not applicable due to multiple Doppler shifts at each receiver. In this paper, we provide
a proactive Doppler shift compensation algorithm based on the probabilistic graphical model.
Each vehicle pre-compensates its carrier frequency individually so that there is no frequency
shift from the desired carrier frequency between each pair of transceiver. The pre-compensated
offset for each vehicle is computed in a distributed fashion in order to be adaptive to the distributed
and dynamic topology of vehicular CPS. Besides, the updating procedure is designed in a broadcasting
fashion to reduce communication burden. It is rigorously proved that the proposed algorithm is
convergence guaranteed even for systems with packet drops and random communication delays. Simulations
based on real map and transportation data verify the accuracy and convergence property of the proposed
algorithm. It is shown that this method achieves almost the optimal frequency compensation accuracy
with an error approaching the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound.
