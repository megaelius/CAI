Online content platforms are concerned about the freshness of their content updates to their end
customers, and increasingly more platforms now invite and pay the crowd to sample real-time information
(e.g., traffic observations and sensor data) to help reduce their ages of information (AoI). How
much crowdsourced data to sample and buy over time is a critical question for a platform's AoI management,
requiring a good balance between its AoI and the incurred sampling cost. This question becomes more
interesting by considering the stage after sampling, where multiple platforms coexist in sharing
the content delivery network of limited bandwidth, and one platform's update may jam or preempt
the others' under negative network externalities. When these selfish platforms know each other's
sampling cost, we formulate their competition as a non-cooperative game and show they want to over-sample
to reduce their own AoIs, causing the price of anarchy (PoA) to be infinity. To remedy this huge efficiency
loss, we propose a trigger mechanism of non-monetary punishment in a repeated game to enforce the
platforms' cooperation to approach the social optimum. We also study the more challenging scenario
of incomplete information that some new platform hides its private sampling cost information from
the other incumbent platforms in the Bayesian game. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that even the
platform with more information may get hurt. We successfully redesign the trigger-and-punishment
mechanism to negate the platform's information advantage and ensure no cheating. Our extensive
simulations show that the mechanisms can remedy the huge efficiency loss due to platform competition,
and the performance improves as we have more incumbent platforms with known cost information.
