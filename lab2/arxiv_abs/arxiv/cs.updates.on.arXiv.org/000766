This paper studies the resource allocation algorithm design for multiuser coordinated multipoint
(CoMP) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). In particular,
remote radio heads (RRHs) are connected to a central processor (CP) via capacity-limited backhaul
links to facilitate CoMP joint transmission. Besides, the CP transfers energy to the RRHs for more
efficient network operation. The considered resource allocation algorithm design is formulated
as a non-convex optimization problem with a minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) constraint at multiple information receivers and a minimum required power transfer
constraint at the energy harvesting receivers. By optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors
at the CP and energy sharing between the CP and the RRHs, we aim at jointly minimizing the total network
transmit power and the maximum capacity consumption per backhaul link. The resulting non-convex
optimization problem is NP-hard. In light of the intractability of the problem, we reformulate
it by replacing the non-convex objective function with its convex hull, which enables the derivation
of an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, a non-convex optimization
problem is solved by semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation and the proposed iterative algorithm
converges to a local optimal solution of the original problem. Simulation results illustrate that
our proposed algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance and provides a significant reduction
in backhaul capacity consumption compared to full cooperation. Besides, the considered CoMP network
is shown to provide superior system performance as far as power consumption is concerned compared
to a traditional system with multiple antennas co-located.
