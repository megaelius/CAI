Previous studies on computer aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) in 4D breast magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) regard lesion detection, segmentation and characterization as separate tasks,
and typically require users to manually select 2D MRI slices or regions of interest as the input.
In this work, we present a breast MRI CAD system that can handle 4D multimodal breast MRI data, and
integrate lesion detection, segmentation and characterization with no user intervention. The
proposed CAD system consists of three major stages: region candidate generation, feature extraction
and region candidate classification. Breast lesions are firstly extracted as region candidates
using the novel 3D multiscale morphological sifting (MMS). The 3D MMS, which uses linear structuring
elements to extract lesion-like patterns, can segment lesions from breast images accurately and
efficiently. Analytical features are then extracted from all available 4D multimodal breast MRI
sequences, including T1-, T2-weighted and DCE sequences, to represent the signal intensity, texture,
morphological and enhancement kinetic characteristics of the region candidates. The region candidates
are lastly classified as lesion or normal tissue by the random under-sampling boost (RUSboost),
and as malignant or benign lesion by the random forest. Evaluated on a breast MRI dataset which contains
a total of 117 cases with 95 malignant and 46 benign lesions, the proposed system achieves a true positive
rate (TPR) of 0.90 at 3.19 false positives per patient (FPP) for lesion detection and a TPR of 0.91
at a FPP of 2.95 for identifying malignant lesions without any user intervention. The average dice
similarity index (DSI) is 0.72 for lesion segmentation. Compared with previously proposed systems
evaluated on the same breast MRI dataset, the proposed CAD system achieves a favourable performance
in breast lesion detection and characterization.
