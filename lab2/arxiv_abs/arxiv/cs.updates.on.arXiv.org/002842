In this research, it was used a segmentation and classification method to identify threat recognition
in human scanner images of airport security. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) in USA
has a higher false alarm, produced from theirs algorithms using today's scanners at the airports.
To repair this problem they started a new competition at Kaggle site asking the science community
to improve their detection with new algorithms. The dataset used in this research comes from DHS
at https://www.kaggle.com/c/passenger-screening-algorithm-challenge/data According to
DHS: "This dataset contains a large number of body scans acquired by a new generation of millimeter
wave scanner called the High Definition-Advanced Imaging Technology (HD-AIT) system. They are
comprised of volunteers wearing different clothing types (from light summer clothes to heavy winter
clothes), different body mass indices, different genders, different numbers of threats, and different
types of threats". Using Python as a principal language, the preprocessed of the dataset images
extracted features from 200 bodies using: intensity, intensity differences and local neighbourhood
to detect, to produce segmentation regions and label those regions to be used as a truth in a training
and test dataset. The regions are subsequently give to a CNN deep learning classifier to predict
17 classes (that represents the body zones): zone1, zone2, ... zone17 and zones with threat in a total
of 34 zones. The analysis showed the results of the classifier an accuracy of 98.2863% and a loss of
0.091319, as well as an average of 100% for recall and precision.
