Widely used loss functions for convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation, e.g., Dice or
cross-entropy, are based on integrals (summations) over the segmentation regions. Unfortunately,
it is quite common in medical image analysis to have highly unbalanced segmentations, where standard
losses contain regional terms with values that differ considerably --typically of several orders
of magnitude-- across segmentation classes, which may affect training performance and stability.
The purpose of this study is to build a boundary loss, which takes the form of a distance metric on the
space of contours, not regions. We argue that a boundary loss can mitigate the difficulties of regional
losses in the context of highly unbalanced segmentation problems because it uses integrals over
the boundary between regions instead of unbalanced integrals over regions. Furthermore, a boundary
loss provides information that is complementary to regional losses. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward
to represent the boundary points corresponding to the regional softmax outputs of a CNN. Our boundary
loss is inspired by discrete (graph-based) optimization techniques for computing gradient flows
of curve evolution. Following an integral approach for computing boundary variations, we express
a non-symmetric L2 distance on the space of shapes as a regional integral, which avoids completely
local differential computations involving contour points. Our boundary loss is the sum of linear
functions of the regional softmax probability outputs of the network. Therefore, it can easily
be combined with standard regional losses and implemented with any existing deep network architecture
for N-D segmentation. Our boundary loss has been validated on two benchmark datasets corresponding
to difficult, highly unbalanced segmentation problems: the ischemic stroke lesion (ISLES) and
white matter hyperintensities (WMH).
