Continual learning (CL) is a particular machine learning paradigm where the data distribution
and learning objective changes through time, or where all the training data and objective criteria
are never available at once. The evolution of the learning process is modeled by a sequence of learning
experiences where the goal is to be able to learn new skills all along the sequence without forgetting
what has been previously learned. Continual learning also aims at the same time at optimizing the
memory, the computation power and the speed during the learning process. An important challenge
for machine learning is not necessarily finding solutions that work in the real world but rather
finding stable algorithms that can learn in real world. Hence, the ideal approach would be tackling
the real world in a embodied platform: an autonomous agent. Continual learning would then be effective
in an autonomous agent or robot, which would learn autonomously through time about the external
world, and incrementally develop a set of complex skills and knowledge. Robotic agents have to learn
to adapt and interact with their environment using a continuous stream of observations. Some recent
approaches aim at tackling continual learning for robotics, but most recent papers on continual
learning only experiment approaches in simulation or with static datasets. Unfortunately, the
evaluation of those algorithms does not provide insights on whether their solutions may help continual
learning in the context of robotics. This paper aims at reviewing the existing state of the art of
continual learning, summarizing existing benchmarks and metrics, and proposing a framework for
presenting and evaluating both robotics and non robotics approaches in a way that makes transfer
between both fields easier.
