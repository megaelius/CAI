In this paper, we develop a novel weighted Laplacian method, which is partially inspired by the theory
of graph Laplacian, to study recent popular graph problems, such as multilevel graph partitioning
and balanced minimum cut problem, in a more convenient manner. Since the weighted Laplacian strategy
inherits the virtues of spectral methods, graph algorithms designed using weighted Laplacian
will necessarily possess more robust theoretical guarantees for algorithmic performances, comparing
with those existing algorithms that are heuristically proposed. In order to illustrate its powerful
utility both in theory and in practice, we also present two effective applications of our weighted
Laplacian method to multilevel graph partitioning and balanced minimum cut problem, respectively.
By means of variational methods and theory of partial differential equations (PDEs), we have established
the equivalence relations among the weighted cut problem, balanced minimum cut problem and the
initial clustering problem that arises in the middle stage of graph partitioning algorithms under
a multilevel structure. These equivalence relations can indeed provide solid theoretical support
for algorithms based on our proposed weighted Laplacian strategy. Moreover, from the perspective
of the application to the balanced minimum cut problem, weighted Laplacian can make it possible
for research of numerical solutions of PDEs to be a powerful tool for the algorithmic study of graph
problems. Experimental results also indicate that the algorithm embedded with our strategy indeed
outperforms other existing graph algorithms, especially in terms of accuracy, thus verifying
the efficacy of the proposed weighted Laplacian.
