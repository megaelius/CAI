Dynamic time warping distance (DTW) is a widely used distance measure between time series. The best
known algorithms for computing DTW run in near quadratic time, and conditional lower bounds prohibit
the existence of significantly faster algorithms. The lower bounds do not prevent a faster algorithm
for the special case in which the DTW is small, however. For an arbitrary metric space $\Sigma$ with
distances normalized so that the smallest non-zero distance is one, we present an algorithm which
computes $\operatorname{dtw}(x, y)$ for two strings $x$ and $y$ over $\Sigma$ in time $O(n \cdot
\operatorname{dtw}(x, y))$. We also present an approximation algorithm which computes $\operatorname{dtw}(x,
y)$ within a factor of $O(n^\epsilon)$ in time $\tilde{O}(n^{2 - \epsilon})$ for $0 < \epsilon <
1$. The algorithm allows for the strings $x$ and $y$ to be taken over an arbitrary well-separated
tree metric with logarithmic depth and at most exponential aspect ratio. Extending our techniques
further, we also obtain the first approximation algorithm for edit distance to work with characters
taken from an arbitrary metric space, providing an $n^\epsilon$-approximation in time $\tilde{O}(n^{2
- \epsilon})$, with high probability. Additionally, we present a simple reduction from computing
edit distance to computing DTW. Applying our reduction to a conditional lower bound of Bringmann
and K\"unnemann pertaining to edit distance over $\{0, 1\}$, we obtain a conditional lower bound
for computing DTW over a three letter alphabet (with distances of zero and one). This improves on
a previous result of Abboud, Backurs, and Williams. With a similar approach, we prove a reduction
from computing edit distance to computing longest LCS length. This means that one can recover conditional
lower bounds for LCS directly from those for edit distance, which was not previously thought to be
the case.
