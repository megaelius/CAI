According to the World Health Organization, the number of mental disorder patients, especially
depression patients, has grown rapidly and become a leading contributor to the global burden of
disease. However, the present common practice of depression diagnosis is based on interviews and
clinical scales carried out by doctors, which is not only labor-consuming but also time-consuming.
One important reason is due to the lack of physiological indicators for mental disorders. With the
rising of tools such as data mining and artificial intelligence, using physiological data to explore
new possible physiological indicators of mental disorder and creating new applications for mental
disorder diagnosis has become a new research hot topic. However, good quality physiological data
for mental disorder patients are hard to acquire. We present a multi-modal open dataset for mental-disorder
analysis. The dataset includes EEG and audio data from clinically depressed patients and matching
normal controls. All our patients were carefully diagnosed and selected by professional psychiatrists
in hospitals. The EEG dataset includes not only data collected using traditional 128-electrodes
mounted elastic cap, but also a novel wearable 3-electrode EEG collector for pervasive applications.
The 128-electrodes EEG signals of 53 subjects were recorded as both in resting state and under stimulation;
the 3-electrode EEG signals of 55 subjects were recorded in resting state; the audio data of 52 subjects
were recorded during interviewing, reading, and picture description. We encourage other researchers
in the field to use it for testing their methods of mental-disorder analysis.
