The present study has two goals relating to the grammar of prosody, understood as the rhythms and
melodies of speech. First, an overview is provided of the computable grammatical and phonetic approaches
to prosody analysis which use hypothetico-deductive methods and are based on learned hermeneutic
intuitions about language. Second, a proposal is presented for an inductive grounding in the physical
signal, in which prosodic structure is inferred using a language-independent method from the low-frequency
spectrum of the speech signal. The overview includes a discussion of computational aspects of standard
generative and post-generative models, and suggestions for reformulating these to form inductive
approaches. Also included is a discussion of linguistic phonetic approaches to analysis of annotations
(pairs of speech unit labels with time-stamps) of recorded spoken utterances. The proposal introduces
the inductive approach of Rhythm Formant Theory (RFT) and the associated Rhythm Formant Analysis
(RFA) method are introduced, with the aim of completing a gap in the linguistic hypothetico-deductive
cycle by grounding in a language-independent inductive procedure of speech signal analysis. The
validity of the method is demonstrated and applied to rhythm patterns in read-aloud Mandarin Chinese,
finding differences from English which are related to lexical and grammatical differences between
the languages, as well as individual variation. The overall conclusions are (1) that normative
language-to-language phonological or phonetic comparisons of rhythm, for example of Mandarin
and English, are too simplistic, in view of diverse language-internal factors due to genre and style
differences as well as utterance dynamics, and (2) that language-independent empirical grounding
of rhythm in the physical signal is called for.
