Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19, is nowadays one of the most prominent challenges of the human
species. A key factor in slowing down the virus propagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation
of infected patients. The standard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to the pandemic. Thus,
researchers have been looking for alternative screening methods and deep learning applied to chest
X-rays of patients has been showing promising results. Despite their success, the computational
cost of these methods remains high, which imposes difficulties to their accessibility and availability.
Thus, the main goal of this work is to propose an accurate yet efficient method in terms of memory and
processing time for the problem of COVID-19 screening in chest X-rays. Methods: To achieve the defined
objective we exploit and extend the EfficientNet family of deep artificial neural networks which
are known for their high accuracy and low footprints in other applications. We also exploit the underlying
taxonomy of the problem with a hierarchical classifier. A dataset of 13,569 X-ray images divided
into healthy, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients is used to train the proposed approaches
and other 5 competing architectures. Finally, 231 images of the three classes were used to assess
the quality of the methods. Results: The results show that the proposed approach was able to produce
a high-quality model, with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID-19, sensitivity of 96.8% and positive
prediction of 100%, while having from 5 to 30 times fewer parameters than other than the other tested
architectures. Larger and more heterogeneous databases are still needed for validation before
claiming that deep learning can assist physicians in the task of detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images.
