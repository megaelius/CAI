Mulmuley recently gave an explicit version of Noether's Normalization lemma for ring of invariants
of matrices under simultaneous conjugation, under the conjecture that there are deterministic
black-box algorithms for polynomial identity testing (PIT). He argued that this gives evidence
that constructing such algorithms for PIT is beyond current techniques. In this work, we show this
is not the case. That is, we improve Mulmuley's reduction and correspondingly weaken the conjecture
regarding PIT needed to give explicit Noether Normalization. We then observe that the weaker conjecture
has recently been nearly settled by the authors, who gave quasipolynomial size hitting sets for
the class of read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs (ROABPs). This gives the desired
explicit Noether Normalization unconditionally, up to quasipolynomial factors. As a consequence
of our proof we give a deterministic parallel polynomial-time algorithm for deciding if two matrix
tuples have intersecting orbit closures, under simultaneous conjugation. We also study the strength
of conjectures that Mulmuley requires to obtain similar results as ours. We prove that his conjectures
are stronger, in the sense that the computational model he needs PIT algorithms for is equivalent
to the well-known algebraic branching program (ABP) model, which is provably stronger than the
ROABP model. Finally, we consider the depth-3 diagonal circuit model as defined by Saxena, as PIT
algorithms for this model also have implications in Mulmuley's work. Previous work have given quasipolynomial
size hitting sets for this model. In this work, we give a much simpler construction of such hitting
sets, using techniques of Shpilka and Volkovich.
