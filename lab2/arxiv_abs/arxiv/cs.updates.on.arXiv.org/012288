We present a hybrid numerical-asymptotic (HNA) boundary element method (BEM) for high frequency
scattering by two-dimensional screens and apertures, whose computational cost to achieve any
prescribed accuracy remains bounded with increasing frequency. Our method is a collocation implementation
of the high order hp HNA approximation space of Hewett et al. IMA J. Numer. Anal. 35 (2015), pp.1698-
1728, where a Galerkin implementation was studied. An advantage of the current collocation scheme
is that the one-dimensional highly oscillatory singular integrals appearing in the BEM matrix
entries are significantly easier to evaluate than the two-dimensional integrals appearing in
the Galerkin case, which leads to much faster computation times. Here we compute the required integrals
at frequency-independent cost using the numerical method of steepest descent, which involves
complex contour deformation. The change from Galerkin to collocation is nontrivial because naive
collocation implementations based on square linear systems suffer from severe numerical instabilities
associated with the numerical redundancy of the HNA basis, which produces highly ill-conditioned
BEM matrices. In this paper we show how these instabilities can be removed by oversampling, and solving
the resulting overdetermined collocation system in a weighted least-squares sense using a truncated
singular value decomposition. On the basis of our numerical experiments, the amount of oversampling
required to stabilise the method is modest (around 25% typically suffices) and independent of frequency.
As an application of our method we present numerical results for high frequency scattering by prefractal
approximations to the middle-third Cantor set.
