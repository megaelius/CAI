With the development of network science, the various properties of complex networks have recently
received extensive attention. Among these properties, the vulnerability of the communities (VoCs)
is particularly important. In the conventional research, only parts of structural features of
the community rather than multiple aspects are considered in the evaluating model. However, in
reality, the impact on the VoC is multifaceted, not only its own structure property, but also the
influence of other communities. In order to better model the influence between communities, so
as to evaluate the VoCs in the social network, a gravity-based community vulnerability evaluation
model is proposed in this paper. In this proposed model, three different aspects of the factor are
considered, i.e. the number of edges inside the community, the number of edges connected neighboring
communities, and the gravity index (GI) of each community, which correspond to the interior information,
small scale interaction relationship, and large scale interaction relationship of communities.
By means of the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and log-sigmoid transition (LST) function, the
abstract distance (AD) between each pair of communities can be calculated to construct the community
network (CN). With the usage of gravity model, the GI of each community which describes the large
scale interaction relationship can be obtained. Eventually, the community vulnerability degree
and order can be calculated by this proposed model, and the sensitivity of weighting parameters
is analyzed by Sobol' indices. In particular, this proposed method can degenerate to the classical
method with the setting of weighting parameters. The effectiveness and reasonability of this proposed
model are demonstrated by several real world complex networks.
