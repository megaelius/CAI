Migration of scholars is a major driver of innovation and diffusion of knowledge. Although large-scale
bibliometric data have been used to measure international migration of scholars, our understanding
of internal migration among researchers is very limited. This is partly due to lack of data aggregated
at a suitable sub-national level. In this study, we analyze internal migration in Mexico based on
over 1.1 million authorship records from the Scopus database. We trace movements of scholars between
Mexican states and provide key demographic measures of internal migration for the period 1996-2018.
From a methodological perspective, we develop a new framework for enhancing data quality, inferring
states from affiliations, and detecting moves from modal states for the purposes of studying internal
migration between researchers. Substantively, we combine demographic and network science techniques
to improve our understanding of internal migration patterns country boundaries. Migration patterns
between states in Mexico appear to be heterogeneous in size and direction across regions. However,
while many scholars remain in their regions, there seems to be a preference for Mexico City and the
surrounding states as a destination. Over the past two decades, we observed a general decreasing
trend in the crude migration intensity. However, the migration network has become more dense, and
more diverse, including greater exchange between states along the Gulf and the Pacific Coast. Our
analysis, which is mostly empirical in nature, sets the foundations for testing and developing
theories that can rely on the analytical framework developed by migration scholars and the richness
of appropriately processed bibliometric data.
