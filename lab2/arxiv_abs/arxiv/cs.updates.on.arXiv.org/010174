To accurately analyze changes of anatomical structures in longitudinal imaging studies, consistent
segmentation across multiple time-points is required. Existing solutions often involve independent
registration and segmentation components. Registration between time-points is used either as
a prior for segmentation in a subsequent time point or to perform segmentation in a common space.
In this work, we propose a novel hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates segmentation
and registration into a single procedure. We hypothesize that the joint optimization leads to increased
performance on both tasks. The hybrid CNN is trained by minimizing an integrated loss function composed
of four different terms, measuring segmentation accuracy, similarity between registered images,
deformation field smoothness, and segmentation consistency. We applied this method to the segmentation
of white matter tracts, describing functionally grouped axonal fibers, using N=8045 longitudinal
brain MRI data of 3249 individuals. The proposed method was compared with two multistage pipelines
using two existing segmentation methods combined with a conventional deformable registration
algorithm. In addition, we assessed the added value of the joint optimization for segmentation
and registration separately. The hybrid CNN yielded significantly higher accuracy, consistency
and reproducibility of segmentation than the multistage pipelines, and was orders of magnitude
faster. Therefore, we expect it can serve as a novel tool to support clinical and epidemiological
analyses on understanding microstructural brain changes over time.
