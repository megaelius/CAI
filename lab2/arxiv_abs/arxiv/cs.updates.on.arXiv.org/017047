Dynamic discrete choice models are used to estimate the intertemporal preferences of an agent as
described by a reward function based upon observable histories of states and implemented actions.
However, in many applications, such as reliability and healthcare, the system state is partially
observable or hidden (e.g., the level of deterioration of an engine, the condition of a disease),
and the decision maker only has access to information imperfectly correlated with the true value
of the hidden state. In this paper, we consider the estimation of a dynamic discrete choice model
with state variables and system dynamics that are hidden (or partially observed) to both the agent
and the modeler, thus generalizing Rust's model to partially observable cases. We analyze the structural
properties of the model and prove that this model is still identifiable if the cardinality of the
state space, the discount factor, the distribution of random shocks, and the rewards for a given
(reference) action are given. We analyze both theoretically and numerically the potential mis-specification
errors that may be incurred when Rust's model is improperly used in partially observable settings.
We further apply the developed model to a subset of Rust's dataset for bus engine mileage and replacement
decisions. The results show that our model can improve model fit as measured by the $\log$-likelihood
function by $17.7\%$ and the $\log$-likelihood ratio test shows that our model statistically outperforms
Rust's model. Interestingly, our hidden state model also reveals an economically meaningful route
assignment behavior in the dataset which was hitherto ignored, i.e. routes with lower mileage are
assigned to buses believed to be in worse condition.
