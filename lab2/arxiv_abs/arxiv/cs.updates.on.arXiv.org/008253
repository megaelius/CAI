We study the House Allocation problem (also known as the Assignment problem), i.e., the problem
of allocating a set of objects among a set of agents, where each agent has ordinal preferences (possibly
involving ties) over a subset of the objects. We focus on truthful mechanisms without monetary transfers
for finding large Pareto optimal matchings. It is straightforward to show that no deterministic
truthful mechanism can approximate a maximum cardinality Pareto optimal matching with ratio better
than 2. We thus consider randomized mechanisms. We give a natural and explicit extension of the classical
Random Serial Dictatorship Mechanism (RSDM) specifically for the House Allocation problem where
preference lists can include ties. We thus obtain a universally truthful randomized mechanism
for finding a Pareto optimal matching and show that it achieves an approximation ratio of $\frac{e}{e-1}$.
The same bound holds even when agents have priorities (weights) and our goal is to find a maximum weight
(as opposed to maximum cardinality) Pareto optimal matching. On the other hand we give a lower bound
of $\frac{18}{13}$ on the approximation ratio of any universally truthful Pareto optimal mechanism
in settings with strict preferences. In the case that the mechanism must additionally be non-bossy,
an improved lower bound of $\frac{e}{e-1}$ holds. This lower bound is tight given that RSDM for strict
preference lists is non-bossy. We moreover interpret our problem in terms of the classical secretary
problem and prove that our mechanism provides the best randomized strategy of the administrator
who interviews the applicants.
