Resting-state brain networks represent the intrinsic state of the brain during the majority of
cognitive and sensorimotor tasks. However, no study has yet presented concise predictors of task-induced
vigilance variability from spectrospatial features of the pre-task, resting-state electroencephalograms
(EEG). We asked ten healthy volunteers (6 females, 4 males) to participate in 105-minute fixed-sequence-varying-duration
sessions of sustained attention to response task (SART). A novel and adaptive vigilance scoring
scheme was designed based on the performance and response time in consecutive trials, and demonstrated
large inter-participant variability in terms of maintaining consistent tonic performance. Multiple
linear regression using feature relevance analysis obtained significant predictors of the mean
cumulative vigilance score (CVS), mean response time, and variabilities of these scores from the
resting-state, band-power ratios of EEG signals, p<0.05. Single-layer neural networks trained
with cross-validation also captured different associations for the beta sub-bands. Increase
in the gamma (28-48 Hz) and upper beta ratios from the left central and temporal regions predicted
slower reactions and more inconsistent vigilance as explained by the increased activation of default
mode network (DMN) and differences between the high- and low-attention networks at temporal regions.
Higher ratios of parietal alpha from the Brodmann's areas 18, 19, and 37 during the eyes-open states
predicted slower responses but more consistent CVS and reactions associated with the superior
ability in vigilance maintenance. The proposed framework and these findings on the most stable
and significant attention predictors from the intrinsic EEG power ratios can be used to model attention
variations during the calibration sessions of BCI applications and vigilance monitoring systems.
