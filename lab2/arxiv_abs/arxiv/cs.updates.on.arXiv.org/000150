Existing Bayesian models, especially nonparametric Bayesian methods, rely heavily on specially
conceived priors to incorporate domain knowledge for discovering improved latent representations.
While priors can affect posterior distributions through Bayes' theorem, imposing posterior regularization
is arguably more direct and in some cases can be more natural and easier. In this paper, we present
regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes), a computational framework to perform posterior inference
with a convex regularization on the desired post-data posterior distributions. RegBayes covers
both directed Bayesian networks and undirected Markov networks whose Bayesian formulation results
in hybrid chain graph models. When the convex regularization is induced from a linear operator on
the posterior distributions, RegBayes can be solved with convex analysis theory. Furthermore,
we present two concrete examples of RegBayes, infinite latent support vector machines (iLSVM)
and multi-task infinite latent support vector machines (MT-iLSVM), which explore the large-margin
idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features
for classification and multi-task learning, respectively. We present efficient inference methods
and report empirical studies on several benchmark datasets, which appear to demonstrate the merits
inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics. Such results were not
available until now, and contribute to push forward the interface between these two important subfields,
which have been largely treated as isolated in the community.
