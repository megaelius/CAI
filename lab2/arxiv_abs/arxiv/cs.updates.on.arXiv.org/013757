Soccer scouts typically ignore the team balance and team chemistry when evaluating potential signings
for their teams. Instead, they focus on the individual qualities of the players in isolation. To
overcome this limitation of their recruitment process, this paper takes a first step towards objectively
providing insight into the question: How well does a team of soccer players gel? We address that question
in both an observational and a predictive setting. In the former setting, we observe the chemistry
between players who have actually played together, which is relevant when selecting the best possible
line-up for a match. In the latter setting, we predict the chemistry between players who have never
played together before, which is particularly relevant to assess the fit of a potential signing
with the players who are already on the team. We introduce two chemistry metrics that measure the
offensive and defensive chemistry for a pair of players, respectively. The offensive chemistry
metric measures the pair's joint performance in terms of scoring goals, whereas the defensive chemistry
metric measures their joint performance in preventing their opponents from scoring goals. We compute
our metrics for 361 seasons in 106 different competitions and present a number of concrete use cases.
For instance, we show that the partnership between Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino in Liverpool's
2017/2018 Champions League campaign exhibited the highest mutual chemistry between two players.
Furthermore, we show that Mesut \"Ozil's chemistry has rapidly started declining following Alexis
S\'anchez' departure to Manchester United in 2018.
