Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied to various applications including image classification,
text generation, audio recognition, and graph data analysis. However, recent studies have shown
that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Though there are several works studying adversarial
attack and defense strategies on domains such as images and natural language processing, it is still
difficult to directly transfer the learned knowledge to graph structure data due to its representation
challenges. Given the importance of graph analysis, an increasing number of works start to analyze
the robustness of machine learning models on graph data. Nevertheless, current studies considering
adversarial behaviors on graph data usually focus on specific types of attacks with certain assumptions.
In addition, each work proposes its own mathematical formulation which makes the comparison among
different methods difficult. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to survey existing adversarial learning
strategies on graph data and first provide a unified formulation for adversarial learning on graph
data which covers most adversarial learning studies on graph. Moreover, we also compare different
attacks and defenses on graph data and discuss their corresponding contributions and limitations.
In this work, we systemically organize the considered works based on the features of each topic.
This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community, but also brings a clear image
researchers outside this research domain. Besides, we also create an online resource and keep updating
the relevant papers during the last two years. More details of the comparisons of various studies
based on this survey are open-sourced at https://github.com/YingtongDou/graph-adversarial-learning-literature.
