In this paper, we develop a deep neural network approach to solve a lifetime expected mortality-weighted
utility-based model for optimal consumption in the decumulation phase of a defined contribution
pension system. We formulate this problem as a multi-period finite-horizon stochastic control
problem and train a deep neural network policy representing consumption decisions. The optimal
consumption policy is determined by personal information about the retiree such as age, wealth,
risk aversion and bequest motive, as well as a series of economic and financial variables including
inflation rates and asset returns jointly simulated from a proposed seven-factor economic scenario
generator calibrated from market data. We use the Australian pension system as an example, with
consideration of the government-funded means-tested Age Pension and other practical aspects
such as fund management fees. The key findings from our numerical tests are as follows. First, our
deep neural network optimal consumption policy, which adapts to changes in market conditions,
outperforms deterministic drawdown rules proposed in the literature. Moreover, the out-of-sample
outperformance ratios increase as the number of training iterations increases, eventually reaching
outperformance on all testing scenarios after less than 10 minutes of training. Second, a sensitivity
analysis is performed to reveal how risk aversion and bequest motives change the consumption over
a retiree's lifetime under this utility framework. Third, we provide the optimal consumption rate
with different starting wealth balances. We observe that optimal consumption rates are not proportional
to initial wealth due to the Age Pension payment. Forth, with the same initial wealth balance and
utility parameter settings, the optimal consumption level is different between males and females
due to gender differences in mortality.
