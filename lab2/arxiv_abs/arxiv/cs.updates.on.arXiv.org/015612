Building models are conventionally reconstructed by building roof points planar segmentation
and then using a topology graph to group the planes together. Roof edges and vertices are then mathematically
represented by intersecting segmented planes. Technically, such solution is based on sequential
local fitting, i.e., the entire data of one building are not simultaneously participating in determining
the building model. As a consequence, the solution is lack of topological integrity and geometric
rigor. Fundamentally different from this traditional approach, we propose a holistic parametric
reconstruction method which means taking into consideration the entire point clouds of one building
simultaneously. In our work, building models are reconstructed from predefined parametric (roof)
primitives. We first use a well-designed deep neural network to segment and identify primitives
in the given building point clouds. A holistic optimization strategy is then introduced to simultaneously
determine the parameters of a segmented primitive. In the last step, the optimal parameters are
used to generate a watertight building model in CityGML format. The airborne LiDAR dataset RoofN3D
with predefined roof types is used for our test. It is shown that PointNet++ applied to the entire
dataset can achieve an accuracy of 83% for primitive classification. For a subset of 910 buildings
in RoofN3D, the holistic approach is then used to determine the parameters of primitives and reconstruct
the buildings. The achieved overall quality of reconstruction is 0.08 meters for point-surface-distance
or 0.7 times RMSE of the input LiDAR points. The study demonstrates the efficiency and capability
of the proposed approach and its potential to handle large scale urban point clouds.
