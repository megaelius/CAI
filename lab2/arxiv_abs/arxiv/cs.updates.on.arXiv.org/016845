This article surveys the literature on human-robot object handovers. A handover is a collaborative
joint action where an agent, the giver, gives an object to another agent, the receiver. The physical
exchange starts when the receiver first contacts the object held by the giver and ends when the giver
fully releases the object to the receiver. However, important cognitive and physical processes
begin before the physical exchange, including initiating implicit agreement with respect to the
location and timing of the exchange. From this perspective, we structure our review into the two
main phases delimited by the aforementioned events: 1) a pre-handover phase, and 2) the physical
exchange. We focus our analysis on the two actors (giver and receiver) and report the state of the
art of robotic givers (robot-to-human handovers) and the robotic receivers (human-to-robot handovers).
We report a comprehensive list of qualitative and quantitative metrics commonly used to assess
the interaction. While focusing our review on the cognitive level (e.g., prediction, perception,
motion planning, learning) and the physical level (e.g., motion, grasping, grip release) of the
handover, we briefly discuss also the concepts of safety, social context, and ergonomics. We compare
the behaviours displayed during human-to-human handovers to the state of the art of robotic assistants,
and identify the major areas of improvement for robotic assistants to reach performance comparable
to human interactions. Finally, we propose a minimal set of metrics that should be used in order to
enable a fair comparison among the approaches.
