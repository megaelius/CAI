The emerging mobile devices in this era of internet-of-things (IoT) require a dedicated processor
to enable computationally intensive applications such as neuromorphic computing and signal processing.
Vector-by-matrix multiplication (VMM) is the most prominent operation in these applications.
Therefore, compact and power-efficient VMM blocks are required to perform resource-intensive
computations. To this end, in this work, for the first time, we propose a time-domain mixed-signal
VMM exploiting a modified configuration of 1 MOSFET-1 RRAM (1T-1R) array which overcomes the energy
inefficiency of the current-mode VMM approaches based on RRAMs. In the proposed approach, the inputs
and outputs are encoded in the digital domain as the duration of the pulses while the weights are realized
as programmable current sinks utilizing the modified 1T-1R blocks in the analog domain. We perform
a rigorous analysis of the different factors such as channel length modulation (CLM), drain-induced
barrier lowering (DIBL), capacitive coupling, etc which may degrade the compute precision of the
proposed VMM approach. We show that there exists a trade-off between the compute precision, dynamic
range and the energy efficiency in the modified 1T-1R array based VMM approach. Therefore, we also
provide the necessary design guidelines for optimizing the performance of this implementation.
The preliminary results show that an effective compute precision greater than 8-bits is achievable
owing to the inherent compensation effect with an energy efficiency of ~42 TOps/J considering the
input/output (I/O) circuitry for a 200x200 VMM utilizing the proposed approach.
