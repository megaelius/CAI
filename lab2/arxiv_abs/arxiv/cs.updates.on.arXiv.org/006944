Miles of contaminated pipe must be measured, foot by foot, as part of the decommissioning effort
at deactivated gaseous diffusion enrichment facilities. The current method requires cutting
away asbestos-lined thermal enclosures and performing repeated, elevated operations to manually
measure pipe from the outside. The RadPiper robot, part of the Pipe Crawling Activity Measurement
System (PCAMS) developed by Carnegie Mellon University and commissioned for use at the DOE Portsmouth
Gaseous Diffusion Enrichment Facility, automatically measures U-235 in pipes from the inside.
This improves certainty, increases safety, and greatly reduces measurement time. The heart of
the RadPiper robot is a sodium iodide scintillation detector in an innovative disc-collimated
assembly. By measuring from inside pipes, the robot significantly increases its count rate relative
to external through-pipe measurements. The robot also provides imagery, models interior pipe
geometry, and precisely measures distance in order to localize radiation measurements. Data collected
by this system provides insight into pipe interiors that is simply not possible from exterior measurements,
all while keeping operators safer. This paper describes the technical details of the PCAMS RadPiper
robot. Key features for this robot include precision distance measurement, in-pipe obstacle detection,
ability to transform for two pipe sizes, and robustness in autonomous operation. Test results demonstrating
the robot's functionality are presented, including deployment tolerance tests, safeguarding
tests, and localization tests. Integrated robot tests are also shown.
