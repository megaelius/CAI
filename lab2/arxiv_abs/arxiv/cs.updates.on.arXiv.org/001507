The waggle dance is one of the most popular examples of animal communication. Forager bees direct
their nestmates to profitable resources via a complex motor display. Essentially, the dance encodes
the polar coordinates to the resource in the field. Unemployed foragers follow the dancer's movements
and then search for the advertised spots in the field. Throughout the last decades, biologists have
employed different techniques to measure key characteristics of the waggle dance and decode the
information that it conveys. Early techniques involved the use of protractors and stopwatches
to measure the dance orientation and duration directly from the observation hive. Recent approaches
employ digital video recordings from which dance characteristics are extracted using digital
protractors on screen. However, manual approaches are very time-consuming. Most studies, therefore,
regard only small numbers of animals in short periods of time. We have developed a system capable
of automatically detecting, decoding and mapping communication dances in real-time. In this paper,
we describe our recording setup, the image processing steps performed for dance detection and decoding
and an algorithm to map dances to the field. The proposed system performs with an accuracy of 90.07%.
The decoded waggle orientation has an average error of -2.92{\deg} (SD = 7.37{\deg}), well within
the range of human error. To evaluate and exemplify the system's performance, a group of bees was
trained to an artificial feeder, and all dances in the colony were automatically detected, decoded
and mapped. The system presented here is the first of this kind made publicly available, including
source code and hardware specifications. We hope this will foster quantitative analyses of the
honey bee waggle dance.
