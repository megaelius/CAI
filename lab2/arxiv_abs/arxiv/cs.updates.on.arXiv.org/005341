Let ${\cal G}=(G,\lambda)$ be a labeled graph on $n$ vertices with $\lambda:E_G\to \mathbb{N}$
a locally injective mapping that assigns to every edge a unique integer label. The label is seen as
a discrete time when the edge is present. This graph is {\em temporally connected} if a path exists
with increasing labels from every vertex to every other vertex. We investigate a question by Kempe,
Kleinberg, and Kumar (JCSS 2002), asking whether {\em sparse} subsets of edges can always be found
that preserve temporal connectivity if the rest is removed. We call such subsets {\em temporal spanners}
of ${\cal G}$. Despite the simplicity of the model, no significative progress has been made so far
on this question; the only known result is that $\Omega(n)$ edges can always be removed if $G$ is a
complete graph. In this paper, we settle the question (affirmatively) for complete graphs, showing
that {\em all} edges but a sub-quadratic amount of them (namely $O(n \log n)$) can always be removed,
making the first significant progress towards the original question. This is done in several gradual
steps. First, we observe that the existing argument for removing $\Theta(n)$ edges can be generalized
to removing $\Theta(n^2)$ edges (namely, a sixth of the edges). Then, building on top of a gradual
set of techniques, we establish that a quarter of the edges can always be removed, then half of the
edges, and eventually {\em all} but $O(n \log n)$ edges. These results are robust in the sense that
they extend, with reasonable assumptions, to general graph models where the labels may not be locally
unique and every edge may have several labels. We conjecture that sparse spanners always exist in
the general case ($G$ not being complete) and we hope that some of our techniques might be used in this
perspective.
