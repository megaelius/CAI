Despite significant advances in modeling of friction-induced vibrations and brake squeal, the
majority of industrial research and design is still conducted experimentally, since many aspects
of squeal and its mechanisms involved remain unknown. We report here for the first time on novel strategies
for handling data-intensive vibration testings to gain better insights into friction brake system
vibrations and noise generation mechanisms. Machine learning-based methods to detect and characterize
vibrations, to understand sensitivities and to predict brake squeal are applied with the aim to
illustrate how interdisciplinary approaches can leverage the potential of data science techniques
for classical mechanical engineering challenges. In the first part, a deep learning brake squeal
detector is developed to identify several classes of typical friction noise recordings. The detection
method is rooted in recent computer vision techniques for object detection based on convolutional
neural networks. It allows to overcome limitations of classical approaches that solely rely on
instantaneous spectral properties of the recorded noise. Results indicate superior detection
and characterization quality when compared to a state-of-the-art brake squeal detector. In the
second part, a recurrent neural network is employed to learn the parametric patterns that determine
the dynamic stability of an operating brake system. Given a set of multivariate loading conditions,
the RNN learns to predict the noise generation of the structure. The validated RNN represents a virtual
twin model for the squeal behavior of a specific brake system. It is found that this model can predict
the occurrence and the onset of brake squeal with high accuracy and that it can identify the complicated
patterns and temporal dependencies in the loading conditions that drive the dynamical structure
into regimes of instability.
