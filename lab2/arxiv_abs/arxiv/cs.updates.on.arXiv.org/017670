Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC) is an emerging communication technology that can enable
green Internet-of-Things deployments. The widespread acceptance of this paradigm is limited
by low Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) of the signal impinging on the receiver
antenna due to the strong direct path interference and unknown ambient signal. The adverse impact
of these two factors can be mitigated by using non-coherent multi-antenna receivers, which is known
to require higher SINR to reach Bit-Error-Rate (BER) performance of coherent receivers. However,
in literature, coherent receivers for AmBC systems are little-studied because of unknown ambient
signal, unknown location of AmBC tags, and varying channel conditions. In this paper, a coherent
multi-antenna receiver, which does not require a prior information of the ambient signal, for decoding
Binary-Phase-shift-Keying (BPSK) modulated signal is presented. The performance of the proposed
receiver is compared with the ideal coherent receiver that has a perfect phase information, and
also with the performance of non-coherent receiver, which assumes distributions for ambient signal
and phase offset caused by excess length of the backscatter path. Comparative simulation results
show the designed receiver can achieve the same BER-performance of the ideal coherent receiver
with 1-dB more SINR, which corresponds to 5-dB or more gain with respect to non-coherent reception
of On-Off-Keying modulated signals. Variation of the detection performance with the tag location
shows that the coverage area is in the close vicinity of the transmitter and a larger region around
the receiver, which is consistent with the theoretical results.
