To analyze whole-genome genetic data inherited in families, the likelihood is typically obtained
from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) having a state space of 2^n hidden states where n is the number of meioses
or edges in the pedigree. There have been several attempts to speed up this calculation by reducing
the state-space of the HMM. One of these methods has been automated in a calculation that is more efficient
than the naive HMM calculation; however, that method treats a special case and the efficiency gain
is available for only those rare pedigrees containing long chains of single-child lineages. The
other existing state-space reduction method treats the general case, but the existing algorithm
has super-exponential running time. We present three formulations of the state-space reduction
problem, two dealing with groups and one with partitions. One of these problems, the maximum isometry
group problem was discussed in detail by Browning and Browning. We show that for pedigrees, all three
of these problems have identical solutions. Furthermore, we are able to prove the uniqueness of
the solution using the algorithm that we introduce. This algorithm leverages the insight provided
by the equivalence between the partition and group formulations of the problem to quickly find the
optimal state-space reduction for general pedigrees. We propose a new likelihood calculation
which is a two-stage process: find the optimal state-space, then run the HMM forward-backward algorithm
on the optimal state-space. In comparison with the one-stage HMM calculation, this new method more
quickly calculates the exact pedigree likelihood.
