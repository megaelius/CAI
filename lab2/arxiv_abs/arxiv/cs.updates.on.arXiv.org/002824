The paper considers a random access communication scenario with an unknown number of transmitters.
The collection of active transmitters remains fixed during each epoch, but neither the transmitters
nor the receiver know which subset of transmitters that is nor even the number of active transmitters.
All transmitters employ identical encoders. The channel is assumed to be defined for any number
of possible transmitters and invariant to permutations on its inputs. The decoder is tasked with
decoding from the channel output the number of active transmitters ($k$) and their messages but
not with determining which transmitter sent which message; the decoding procedure occurs at a time
$n_{\hat{k}}$ dependent on its estimate $\hat{k}$ of the number of active transmitters, thereby
achieving a rate that varies with the number of active transmitters. Sporadic single-bit feedback
at each time $n_i$, $i\leq \hat{k}$, enables all transmitters to determine the end of one coding
epoch and the start of the next. A coding environment with identical encoders, permutation-invariant
channels, and decoders charged with decoding messages but not transmitter identities was recently
introduced for the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with a fixed, known number of transmitters by Polyanskiy.
The central result of this work demonstrates the achievability of performance that is first-order
optimal for the MAC in operation during each coding epoch. Unlike prior multiple access schemes
for a fixed number of transmitters requiring $2^k - 1$ simultaneous threshold rules, the proposed
scheme uses a single threshold rule and is optimal in terms of dispersion.
