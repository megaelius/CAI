Due to the uncertainty of distributed wind generations (DWGs), a better understanding of the probability
distributions (PD) of their wind power forecast errors (WPFEs) can help market participants (MPs)
who own DWGs perform better during trading. Under the premise of an accurate PD model, considering
the correlation among DWGs and absorbing the new information carried by the latest data are two ways
to maintain an accurate PD. These two ways both require the historical and latest wind power and forecast
data of all DWGs. Each MP, however, only has access to the data of its own DWGs and may refuse to share
these data with MPs belonging to other stakeholders. Besides, because of the endless generation
of new data, the PD updating burden increases sharply. Therefore, we use the distributed strategy
to deal with the data collection problem. In addition, we further apply the incremental learning
strategy to reduce the updating burden. Finally, we propose a distributed incremental update scheme
to make each MP continually acquire the latest conditional PD of its DWGs' WPFE. Specifically, we
first use the Gaussian-mixture-model-based (GMM-based) joint PD to characterize the correlation
among DWGs. Then, we propose a distributed modified incremental GMM algorithm to enable MPs to update
the parameters of the joint PD in a distributed and incremental manner. After that, we further propose
a distributed derivation algorithm to make MPs derive their conditional PD of WPFE from the joint
one in a distributed way. Combining the two original algorithms, we finally achieve the complete
distributed incremental update scheme, by which each MP can continually obtain its latest conditional
PD of its DWGs' WPFE via neighborhood communication and local calculation with its own data. The
effectiveness, correctness, and efficiency of the proposed scheme are verified using the dataset
from the NREL.
