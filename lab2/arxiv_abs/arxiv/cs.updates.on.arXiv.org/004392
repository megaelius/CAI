Web archives, a key area of digital preservation, meet the needs of journalists, social scientists,
historians, and government organizations. The use cases for these groups often require that they
guide the archiving process themselves, selecting their own original resources, or seeds, and
creating their own web archive collections. We focus on the collections within Archive-It, a subscription
service started by the Internet Archive in 2005 for the purpose of allowing organizations to create
their own collections of archived web pages, or mementos. Understanding these collections could
be done via their user-supplied metadata or via text analysis, but the metadata is applied inconsistently
between collections and some Archive-It collections consist of hundreds of thousands of seeds,
making it costly in terms of time to download each memento. Our work proposes using structural metadata
as an additional way to understand these collections. We explore structural features currently
existing in these collections that can unveil curation and crawling behaviors. We adapt the concept
of the collection growth curve for understanding Archive-It collection curation and crawling
behavior. We also introduce several seed features and come to an understanding of the diversity
of resources that make up a collection. Finally, we use the descriptions of each collection to identify
four semantic categories of Archive-It collections. Using the identified structural features,
we reviewed the results of runs with 20 classifiers and are able to predict the semantic category
of a collection using a Random Forest classifier with a weighted average F1 score of 0.720, thus bridging
the structural to the descriptive. Our method is useful because it saves the researcher time and
bandwidth. Identifying collections by their semantic category allows further downstream processing
to be tailored to these categories.
