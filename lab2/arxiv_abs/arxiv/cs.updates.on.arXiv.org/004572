Super point is a special host in network which communicates with lots of other hosts in a certain time
period. The number of hosts contacting with a super point is called as its cardinality. Cardinality
estimating plays important roles in network management and security. All of existing works focus
on how to estimate super point's cardinality under discrete time window. But discrete time window
causes great delay and the accuracy of estimating result is subject to the starting of the window.
sliding time window, moving forwarding a small slice every time, offers a more accuracy and timely
scale to monitor super point's cardinality. On the other hand, super point's cardinality estimating
under sliding time window is more difficult because it requires an algorithm to record the cardinality
incrementally and report them immediately at the end of the sliding duration. This paper firstly
solves this problem by devising a sliding time window available algorithm SRLA. SRLA records hosts
cardinality by a novel structure which could be updated incrementally. In order to reduce the cardinality
estimating time at the end of every sliding time window, SRLA generates a super point candidate list
while scanning packets and calculates the cardinality of hosts in the candidate list only. It also
has the ability to run parallel to deal with high speed network in line speed. This paper gives the
way to deploy SRLA on a common GPU. Experiments on real world traffics which have 40 GB/s bandwidth
show that SRLA successfully estimates super point's cardinality within 100 milliseconds under
sliding time window when running on a low cost Nvidia GPU, GTX650 with 1 GB memory. The estimating
time of SRLA is much smaller than that of other algorithms which consumes more than 2000 milliseconds
under discrete time window.
