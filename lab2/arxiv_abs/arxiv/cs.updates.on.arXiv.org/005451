Sentiment polarity of tweets, blog posts or product reviews has become highly attractive and is
utilized in recommender systems, market predictions, business intelligence and more. Deep learning
techniques are becoming top performers on analyzing such texts. There are however several problems
that need to be solved for efficient use of deep neural networks on text mining and text polarity analysis.
First, deep neural networks need to be fed with data sets that are big in size as well as properly labeled.
Second, there are various uncertainties regarding the use of word embedding vectors: should they
be generated from the same data set that is used to train the model or it is better to source them from
big and popular collections? Third, to simplify model creation it is convenient to have generic
neural network architectures that are effective and can adapt to various texts, encapsulating
much of design complexity. This thesis addresses the above problems to provide methodological
and practical insights for utilizing neural networks on sentiment analysis of texts and achieving
state of the art results. Regarding the first problem, the effectiveness of various crowdsourcing
alternatives is explored and two medium-sized and emotion-labeled song data sets are created utilizing
social tags. To address the second problem, a series of experiments with large text collections
of various contents and domains were conducted, trying word embeddings of various parameters.
Regarding the third problem, a series of experiments involving convolution and max-pooling neural
layers were conducted. Combining convolutions of words, bigrams, and trigrams with regional max-pooling
layers in a couple of stacks produced the best results. The derived architecture achieves competitive
performance on sentiment polarity analysis of movie, business and product reviews.
