In this paper, we propose a method to solve a bi-objective variant of the well-studied Traveling
Thief Problem (TTP). The TTP is a multi-component problem that combines two classic combinatorial
problems: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Knapsack Problem (KP). In the TTP, a thief has to
visit each city exactly once and can pick items throughout their journey. The thief begins their
journey with an empty knapsack and travels with a speed inversely proportional to the knapsack weight.
We address the BI-TTP, a bi-objective version of the TTP, where the goal is to minimize the overall
traveling time and to maximize the profit of the collected items. Our method is based on a genetic
algorithm with customization addressing problem characteristics. We incorporate domain knowledge
through a combination of near-optimal solutions of each subproblem in the initial population and
a custom repair operation to avoid the evaluation of infeasible solutions. Moreover, the independent
variables of the TSP and KP components are unified to a real variable representation by using a biased
random-key approach. The bi-objective aspect of the problem is addressed through an elite population
extracted based on the non-dominated rank and crowding distance of each solution. Furthermore,
we provide a comprehensive study which shows the influence of hyperparameters on the performance
of our method and investigate the performance of each hyperparameter combination over time. In
addition to our experiments, we discuss the results of the BI-TTP competitions at EMO-2019 and GECCO-2019
conferences where our method has won first and second place, respectively, thus proving its ability
to find high-quality solutions consistently.
