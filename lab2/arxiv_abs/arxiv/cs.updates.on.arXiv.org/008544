The HPC community is actively researching and evaluating tools to support execution of scientific
applications in cloud-based environments. Among the various technologies, containers have recently
gained importance as they have significantly better performance compared to full-scale virtualization,
support for microservices and DevOps, and work seamlessly with workflow and orchestration tools.
Docker is currently the leader in containerization technology because it offers low overhead,
flexibility, portability of applications, and reproducibility. Singularity is another container
solution that is of interest as it is designed specifically for scientific applications. It is important
to conduct performance and feature analysis of the container technologies to understand their
applicability for each application and target execution environment. This paper presents a (1)
performance evaluation of Docker and Singularity on bare metal nodes in the Chameleon cloud (2)
mechanism by which Docker containers can be mapped with InfiniBand hardware with RDMA communication
and (3) analysis of mapping elements of parallel workloads to the containers for optimal resource
management with container-ready orchestration tools. Our experiments are targeted toward application
developers so that they can make informed decisions on choosing the container technologies and
approaches that are suitable for their HPC workloads on cloud infrastructure. Our performance
analysis shows that scientific workloads for both Docker and Singularity based containers can
achieve near-native performance. Singularity is designed specifically for HPC workloads. However,
Docker still has advantages over Singularity for use in clouds as it provides overlay networking
and an intuitive way to run MPI applications with one container per rank for fine-grained resources
allocation.
