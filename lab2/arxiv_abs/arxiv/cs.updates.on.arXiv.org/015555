Censuses around the world are key sources of data to guide government investments and public policies.
However, these sources are very expensive to obtain and are collected relatively infrequently.
Over the last decade, there has been growing interest in the use of data from social media to complement
traditional data sources. However, social media users are not representative of the general population.
Thus, analyses based on social media data require statistical adjustments, like post-stratification,
in order to remove the bias and make solid statistical claims. These adjustments are possible only
when we have information about the frequency of demographic groups using social media. These data,
when compared with official statistics, enable researchers to produce appropriate statistical
correction factors. In this paper, we leverage the Facebook advertising platform to compile the
equivalent of an aggregate-level census of Facebook users. Our compilation includes the population
distribution for seven demographic attributes such as gender and age at different geographic levels
for the US. By comparing the Facebook counts with official reports provided by the US Census and Gallup,
we found very high correlations, especially for political leaning and race. We also identified
instances where official statistics may be underestimating population counts as in the case of
immigration. We use the information collected to calculate bias correction factors for all computed
attributes in order to evaluate the extent to which different demographic groups are more or less
represented on Facebook. We provide the first comprehensive analysis for assessing biases in Facebook
users across several dimensions. This information can be used to generate bias-adjusted population
estimates and demographic counts in a timely way and at fine geographic granularity in between data
