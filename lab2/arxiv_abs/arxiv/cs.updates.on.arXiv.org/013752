Pattern similarity-based methods are widely used in classification and regression problems.
Repeated, similar-shaped cycles observed in seasonal time series encourage to apply these methods
for forecasting. In this paper we use the pattern similarity-based methods for forecasting monthly
electricity demand expressing annual seasonality. An integral part of the models is the time series
representation using patterns of time series sequences. Pattern representation ensures the input
and output data unification through trend filtering and variance equalization. Consequently,
pattern representation simplifies the forecasting problem and allows us to use models based on
pattern similarity. We consider four such models: nearest neighbor model, fuzzy neighborhood
model, kernel regression model and general regression neural network. A regression function is
constructed by aggregation output patterns with weights dependent on the similarity between input
patterns. The advantages of the proposed models are: clear principle of operation, small number
of parameters to adjust, fast optimization procedure, good generalization ability, working on
the newest data without retraining, robustness to missing input variables, and generating a vector
as an output. In the experimental part of the work the proposed models were used to forecasting the
monthly demand for 35 European countries. The model performances were compared with the performances
of the classical models such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing as well as state-of-the-art models
such as multilayer perceptron, neuro-fuzzy system and long short-term memory model. The results
show high performance of the proposed models which outperform the comparative models in accuracy,
simplicity and ease of optimization.
