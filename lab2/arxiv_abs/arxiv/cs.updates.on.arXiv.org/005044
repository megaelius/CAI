Correctly identifying sleep stages is important in diagnosing and treating sleep disorders. This
work proposes a joint classification-and-prediction framework based on CNNs for automatic sleep
staging, and, subsequently, introduces a simple yet efficient CNN architecture to power the framework.
Given a single input epoch, the novel framework jointly determines its label (classification)
and its neighboring epochs' labels (prediction) in the contextual output. While the proposed framework
is orthogonal to the widely adopted classification schemes, which take one or multiple epochs as
contextual inputs and produce a single classification decision on the target epoch, we demonstrate
its advantages in several ways. First, it leverages the dependency among consecutive sleep epochs
while surpassing the problems experienced with the common classification schemes. Second, even
with a single model, the framework has the capacity to produce multiple decisions, which are essential
in obtaining a good performance as in ensemble-of-models methods, with very little induced computational
overhead. Probabilistic aggregation techniques are then proposed to leverage the availability
of multiple decisions. We conducted experiments on two public datasets: Sleep-EDF Expanded with
20 subjects, and Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies dataset with 200 subjects. The proposed framework
yields an overall classification accuracy of 82.3% and 83.6%, respectively. We also show that the
proposed framework not only is superior to the baselines based on the common classification schemes
but also outperforms existing deep-learning approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first work
going beyond the standard single-output classification to consider multitask neural networks
for automatic sleep staging. This framework provides avenues for further studies of different
neural-network architectures for automatic sleep staging.
