Albeit, the implicit feedback based recommendation problem - when only the user history is available
but there are no ratings - is the most typical setting in real-world applications, it is much less
researched than the explicit feedback case. State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on
the explicit case cannot be straightforwardly transformed to the implicit case if scalability
should be maintained. There are few if any implicit feedback benchmark datasets, therefore new
ideas are usually experimented on explicit benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware
implicit feedback recommender algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS apply a fast, ALS-based tensor factorization
learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zero elements in the tensor. The method
also allows us to incorporate diverse context information into the model while maintaining its
computational efficiency. In particular, we present two such context-aware implementation variants
of iTALS. The first incorporates seasonality and enables to distinguish user behavior in different
time intervals. The other views the user history as sequential information and has the ability to
recognize usage pattern typical to certain group of items, e.g. to automatically tell apart product
types or categories that are typically purchased repetitively (collectibles, grocery goods)
or once (household appliances). Experiments performed on three implicit datasets (two proprietary
ones and an implicit variant of the Netflix dataset) show that by integrating context-aware information
with our factorization framework into the state-of-the-art implicit recommender algorithm the
recommendation quality improves significantly.
