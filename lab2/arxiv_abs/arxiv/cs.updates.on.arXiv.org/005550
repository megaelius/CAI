Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) can achieve promising performance on learning complex
data distributions on different types of data. In this paper, we first show a straightforward extension
of existing GAN algorithm is not applicable to point clouds, because the constraint required for
discriminators is undefined for set data. We propose a two fold modification to GAN algorithm for
learning to generate point clouds (PC-GAN). First, we combine ideas from hierarchical Bayesian
modeling and implicit generative models by learning a hierarchical and interpretable sampling
process. A key component of our method is that we train a posterior inference network for the hidden
variables. Second, instead of using only state-of-the-art Wasserstein GAN objective, we propose
a sandwiching objective, which results in a tighter Wasserstein distance estimate than the commonly
used dual form. Thereby, PC-GAN defines a generic framework that can incorporate many existing
GAN algorithms. We validate our claims on ModelNet40 benchmark dataset. Using the distance between
generated point clouds and true meshes as metric, we find that PC-GAN trained by the sandwiching
objective achieves better results on test data than the existing methods. Moreover, as a byproduct,
PC- GAN learns versatile latent representations of point clouds, which can achieve competitive
performance with other unsupervised learning algorithms on object recognition task. Lastly,
we also provide studies on generating unseen classes of objects and transforming image to point
cloud, which demonstrates the compelling generalization capability and potentials of PC-GAN.
