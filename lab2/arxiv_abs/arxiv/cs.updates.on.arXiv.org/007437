The AI problem has no solution in the environment of existing hardware stack and OS architecture.
CPU-centric model of computation has a huge number of drawbacks that originate from memory hierarchy
and obsolete architecture of the computing core. The concept of mixing memory and logic has been
around since 1960s. However, the concept of Processor-In-Memory (PIM) is unable to resolve the
critical issues of the CPU-centric computing model because of inevitable replication of von Neumann
architecture's drawbacks. The next generation of NVM/SCM memory is able to give the second birth
to the data-centric computing paradigm. This paper presents a concept of Processor in Non-Volatile
Memory (PiNVSM) architecture. The basis of PiNVSM architecture is the concept of DPU that contains
the NVM memory and dedicated PU. All necessary PU's registers can be implemented in the space of NVM
memory. NVM memory of DPU is the single space for storing and transformation of data. In the basis
of PiNVSM architecture lies the DPU array is able to overcome the limitations as Turing machine model
as von Neumann architecture. The DPU array hasn't a centralized computing core. Every data portion
has dedicated computing core that excludes the necessity to transfer data to the place of data processing.
Every DPU contains data portion that is associated with the set of keywords. Any complex data structure
can be split on elementary items that can be stored into independent DPU with dedicated computing
core(s). One DPU is able to apply the elementary transformation on one item. But the DPU array is able
to make the transformation of complex structure by means of concurrent execution of elementary
transformations in different DPUs. The PiNVSM architecture suggests a principally new architecture
of the computing core that creates a new opportunity for data self-organization, data and code synthesis.
