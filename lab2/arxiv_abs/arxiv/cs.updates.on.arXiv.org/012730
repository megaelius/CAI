The state inference problem and fault diagnosis/prediction problem are fundamental topics in
many areas. In this paper, we consider discrete-event systems (DESs) modeled by finite-state automata
(FSAs). There exist many results for decentralized versions of the latter but there is almost no
result for a decentralized version of the former. In this paper, we propose a decentralized version
of strong detectability called co-detectability which implies that once a system satisfies this
property, for each generated infinite-length event sequence, at least one local observer can determine
the current and subsequent states after a common time delay. We prove that the problem of verifying
co-detectability of FSAs is NP-hard. Moreover, we use a unified concurrent-composition method
to give PSPACE verification algorithms for co-detectability, co-diagnosability, and co-predictability
of FSAs, without any assumption or modifying the FSAs under consideration, where co-diagnosability
and co-predictability are notions that have been widely studied in the literature, but most of their
verification algorithms in the literature work under two widely-used assumptions of deadlock-freeness
and having no unobservable reachable cycle, or after modifying the FSA under consideration by adding
at each deadlock state a self-loop. Under the unified framework used in the paper, one can see that
in order to verify co-detectability, more technical difficulties will be met compared to verifying
the other two properties, because in co-detectability, generated outputs are counted, but in the
latter two properties, only occurrences of events are counted. For example, when one output was
generated, any number of unobservable events could have occurred. The PSPACE-hardness of verifying
co-diagnosability is already known in the literature. In this paper, we prove the PSPACE-hardness
of verifying co-predictability.
