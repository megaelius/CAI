With the Single-Instance Multi-Tenancy (SIMT) model for composite Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
applications, a single composite application instance can host multiple tenants, yielding the
benefits of better service and resource utilization, and reduced operational cost for the SaaS
provider. An SIMT application needs to share services and their aggregation (the application)
among its tenants while supporting variations in the functional and performance requirements
of the tenants. The SaaS provider requires a middleware environment that can deploy, enact and manage
a designed SIMT application, to achieve the varied requirements of the different tenants in a controlled
manner. This paper presents the SDSN@RT (Software-Defined Service Networks @ RunTime) middleware
environment that can meet the aforementioned requirements. SDSN@RT represents an SIMT composite
cloud application as a multi-tenant service network, where the same service network simultaneously
hosts a set of virtual service networks (VSNs), one for each tenant. A service network connects a
set of services, and coordinates the interactions between them. A VSN realizes the requirements
for a specific tenant and can be deployed, configured, and logically isolated in the service network
at runtime. SDSN@RT also supports the monitoring and runtime changes of the deployed multi-tenant
service networks. We show the feasibility of SDSN@RT with a prototype implementation, and demonstrate
its capabilities to host SIMT applications and support their changes with a case study. The performance
study of the prototype implementation shows that the runtime capabilities of our middleware incur
little overhead.
