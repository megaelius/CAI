With the development of Connected Vehicle (CV) technology, temporal variation of roadway traffic
can be captured by sharing Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) from each vehicle using the communication
between vehicles as well as with transportation roadside infrastructures (e.g., traffic signal)
and traffic management centers. However, the penetration of connected vehicles in the near future
will be limited. BSMs from limited CVs could provide an inaccurate estimation of current speed or
space headway. This inaccuracy in the estimated current average speed and average space headway
data is termed as noise. This noise in the traffic data significantly reduces the prediction accuracy
of a machine learning model, such as the accuracy of long short term memory (LSTM) model in predicting
traffic condition. To improve the real time prediction accuracy with low penetration of CVs, we
developed a traffic data prediction model that combines the LSTM with a noise reduction model (the
standard Kalman filter or Kalman filter based Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS)). The average speed and
space headway used in this study were generated from the Enhanced Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)
dataset, which contains vehicle trajectory data for every one tenth of a second. Compared to a baseline
LSTM model without any noise reduction, for 5 percent penetration of CVs, the analyses revealed
that combined LSTM\RTS model reduced the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) from 19 percent
to 5 percent for speed prediction and from 27 percent to 9 percent for space headway prediction. The
overall reduction of MAPE value ranged from 1 percent to 14 percent for speed and 2 percent to 18 percent
for space headway prediction compared to the baseline model.
