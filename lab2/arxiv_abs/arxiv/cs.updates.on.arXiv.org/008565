The evolving of Fifth Generation (5G) networks isbecoming more readily available as a major driver
of the growthof new applications and business models. Vehicular Ad hocNetworks (VANETs) and Software
Defined Networking (SDN)represent the key enablers of 5G technology with the developmentof next
generation intelligent vehicular networks and applica-tions. In recent years, researchers have
focused on the integrationof SDN and VANET, and look at different topics related to thearchitecture,
the benefits of software-defined VANET servicesand the new functionalities to adapt them. However,
securityand robustness of the complete architecture is still questionableand have been largely
negleted. Moreover, the deployment andintegration of novel entities and several architectural
componentsdrive new security threats and vulnerabilities.In this paper, first we survey the state-of-the-art
SDN basedVehicular ad-hoc Network (SDVN) architectures for their net-working infrastructure
design, functionalities, benefits, and chal-lenges. Then we discuss these SDVN architectures
against majorsecurity threats that violate the key security services such asavailability, confidentiality,
authentication, and data integrity.We also propose different countermeasures to these threats.Finally,
we discuss the lessons learned with the directions offuture research work towards provisioning
stringent security andprivacy solutions in future SDVN architectures. To the best of ourknowledge,
this is the first comprehensive work that presents sucha survey and analysis on SDVNs in the era of
future generationnetworks (e.g., 5G, and Information centric networking) andapplications (e.g.,
intelligent transportation system, and IoT-enabled advertising in VANETs).
