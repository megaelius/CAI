This paper introduces the ${\it decentralized}$ Pliable Index CODing (PICOD) problem: a variant
of the Index Coding (IC) problem, where a central transmitter serves ${\it pliable}$ users with
message side information; here, pliable refers to the fact that a user is satisfied by decoding ${\it
any}$ $t$ messages that are not in its side information set. In the decentralized PICOD, a central
transmitter with knowledge of all messages is not present, and instead users share among themselves
massages that can only depend on their local side information set. This paper characterizes the
capacity of two classes of decentralized complete--$S$ PICOD$(t)$ problems with $m$ messages
(where the set $S\subset[m]$ contains the sizes of the side information sets, and the number of users
is $n=\sum_{s\in S}\binom{m}{s}$, with no two users having the same side information set): (i)
the consecutive case: $S=[s_\min:s_\max]$ for some $0 \leq s_\min\leq s_\max \leq m-t$, and (ii)
the complement-consecutive case: $S=[0:m-t]\backslash[s_\min:s_\max]$, for some $0 < s_\min\leq
s_\max < m-t$. Interestingly, the optimal code-length for the decentralized PICOD in those cases
is the same as for the classical (centralized) PICOD counterpart, except when the problem is no longer
pliable, that is, it reduces to an IC problem where every user needs to decode all messages not in its
side information set. Although the optimal code-length may be the same in both centralized and decentralized
settings, the actual optimal codes are not. For the decentralized PICOD, sparse Maximum Distance
Separable (MDS) codes and vector linear index codes are used (as opposed to scalar linear codes).
