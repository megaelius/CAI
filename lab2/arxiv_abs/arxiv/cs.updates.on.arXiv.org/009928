Several clustering frameworks with interactive (semi-supervised) queries have been studied
in the past. Recently, clustering with same-cluster queries has become popular. An algorithm in
this setting has access to an oracle with full knowledge of an optimal clustering, and the algorithm
can ask the oracle queries of the form, "Does the optimal clustering put vertices $ u $ and $ v $ in the
same cluster?" Due to its simplicity, this querying model can easily be implemented in real crowd-sourcing
platforms and has attracted a lot of recent work. In this paper, we study the popular correlation
clustering problem (Bansal et al., 2002) under this framework. Given a complete graph $G=(V,E)$
with positive and negative edge labels, correlation clustering objective aims to compute a graph
clustering that minimizes the total number of disagreements, that is the negative intra-cluster
edges and positive inter-cluster edges. Let $ C_{OPT} $ be the number of disagreements made by the
optimal clustering. We present algorithms for correlation clustering whose error and query bounds
are parameterized by $C_{OPT}$ rather than by the number of clusters. Indeed, a good clustering
must have small $C_{OPT}$. Specifically, we present an efficient algorithm that recovers an exact
optimal clustering using at most $2C_{OPT} $ queries and an efficient algorithm that outputs a $2$-approximation
using at most $C_{OPT} $ queries. In addition, we show under a plausible complexity assumption,
there does not exist any polynomial time algorithm that has an approximation ratio better than $1+\alpha$
for an absolute constant $\alpha >0$ with $o(C_{OPT})$ queries. We extensively evaluate our methods
on several synthetic and real-world datasets using real crowd-sourced oracles. Moreover, we compare
our approach against several known correlation clustering algorithms.
