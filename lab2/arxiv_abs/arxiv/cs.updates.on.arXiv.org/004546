Decentralized Ledger Technology, popularized by the Bitcoin network, aims to keep track of a ledger
of valid transactions between agents of a virtual economy without a central institution for coordination.
In order to keep track of a faithful and accurate list of transactions, the ledger is broadcast and
replicated across machines in a peer-to-peer network. To enforce validity of transactions in the
ledger (i.e., no negative balance or double spending), the network as a whole coordinates to accept
or reject new transactions based on a set of rules aiming to detect and block operations of malicious
agents (i.e., Byzantine attacks). Consensus protocols are particularly important to coordinate
operation of the network, since they are used to reconcile potentially conflicting versions of
the ledger. Regardless of architecture and consensus mechanism used, resulting economic networks
remain largely similar, with economic agents driven by incentives under a set of rules. Due to the
intense activity in this area, proper mathematical frameworks to model and analyze behavior of
blockchain-enabled systems are essential. In this paper, we address this need and provide the following
contributions: (i) we establish a formal framework, with tools from dynamical systems theory,
to mathematically describe core concepts in blockchain-enabled networks, (ii) we apply this framework
to the Bitcoin network and recover its key properties, and (iii) we connect our modeling framework
with powerful tools from control engineering, such as Lyapunov-like functions, to properly engineer
economic systems with provable properties. Apart from the aforementioned contributions, the
mathematical framework herein proposed lays a foundation for engineering more general economic
systems built on emerging Turing complete networks, such as the Ethereum network, through which
complex alternative economic models are explored.
