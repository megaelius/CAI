Context: The success of software crowdsourcing depends on steady tasks supply and active worker
pool. Existing analysis reveals an average task failure ratio of 15.7% in software crowdsourcing
market. Goal: The objective of this study is to empirically investigate patterns and effect of task
diversity in software crowdsourcing platform in order to improve the success and efficiency of
software crowdsourcing. Method: We propose a conceptual task diversity model, and develop an approach
to measuring and analyzing task diversity.More specifically, this includes grouping similar
tasks, ranking them based on their competition level and identifying the dominant attributes that
distinguish among these levels, and then studying the impact of task diversity on task success and
worker performance in crowdsourcing platform. The empirical study is conducted on more than one
year's real-world data from TopCoder, the leading software crowdsourcing platform. Results:
We identified that monetary prize and task complexity are the dominant attributes that differentiate
among different competition levels. Based on these dominant attributes, we found three task diversity
patterns (configurations) from workers behavior perspective: responsive to prize, responsive
to prize and complexity and over responsive to prize. This study supports that1) responsive to prize
configuration provides highest level of task density and workers' reliability in a platform; 2)
responsive to prize and complexity configuration leads to attracting high level of trustworthy
workers; 3) over responsive to prize configuration results in highest task stability and the lowest
failure ratio in the platform for not high similar tasks.
