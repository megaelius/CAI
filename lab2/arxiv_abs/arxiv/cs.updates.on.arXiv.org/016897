The classical approach to non-linear regression in physics, is to take a mathematical model describing
the functional dependence of the dependent variable from a set of independent variables, and then,
using non-linear fitting algorithms, extract the parameters used in the modeling. Particularly
challenging are real systems, characterized by several additional influencing factors related
to specific components, like electronics or optical parts. In such cases, to make the model reproduce
the data, empirically determined terms are built-in the models to compensate for the impossibility
of modeling things that are, by construction, impossible to model. A new approach to solve this issue
is to use neural networks, particularly feed-forward architectures with a sufficient number of
hidden layers and an appropriate number of output neurons, each responsible for predicting the
desired variables. Unfortunately, feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) usually perform less
efficiently when applied to multi-dimensional regression problems, that is when they are required
to predict simultaneously multiple variables that depend from the input dataset in fundamentally
different ways. To address this problem, we propose multi-task learning (MTL) architectures.
These are characterized by multiple branches of task-specific layers, which have as input the output
of a common set of layers. To demonstrate the power of this approach for multi-dimensional regression,
the method is applied to luminescence sensing. Here the MTL architecture allows predicting multiple
parameters, the oxygen concentration and the temperature, from a single set of measurements.
