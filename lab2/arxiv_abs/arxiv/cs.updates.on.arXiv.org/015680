This article introduces an approach to facilitate cooperative exploration and mapping of large-scale,
near-ground, underground, or indoor spaces via a novel integration framework for locally-dense
agent map data. The effort targets limited Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) agents with an emphasis
on limiting required communications and redundant processing. The approach uses a unique organization
of batch optimization engines to enable a highly efficient two-tier optimization structure. Tier
I consist of agents that create and potentially share local maplets (local maps, limited in size)
which are generated using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) map-building software
and then marginalized to a more compact parameterization. Maplets are generated in an overlapping
manner and used to estimate the transform and uncertainty between those overlapping maplets, providing
accurate and compact odometry or delta-pose representation between maplet's local frames. The
delta poses can be shared between agents, and in cases where maplets have salient features (for loop
closures), the compact representation of the maplet can also be shared. The second optimization
tier consists of a global optimizer that seeks to optimize those maplet-to-maplet transformations,
including any loop closures identified. This can provide an accurate global "skeleton"' of the
traversed space without operating on the high-density point cloud. This compact version of the
map data allows for scalable, cooperative exploration with limited communication requirements
where most of the individual maplets, or low fidelity renderings, are only shared if desired.
