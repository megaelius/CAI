Compiler correctness is, in its simplest form, defined as the inclusion of the set of traces of the
compiled program into the set of traces of the original program, which is equivalent to the preservation
of all trace properties. Here traces collect, for instance, the externally observable events of
each execution. This definition requires, however, the set of traces of the source and target languages
to be exactly the same, which is not the case when the languages are far apart or when observations
are fine grained. To overcome this issue, we study a generalized compiler correctness definition,
which uses source and target traces drawn from potentially different sets and connected by an arbitrary
relation. We set out to understand what guarantees this generalized compiler correctness definition
gives us when instantiated with a non-trivial relation on traces. When this trace relation is not
equality, it is no longer possible to preserve the trace properties of the source program unchanged.
Instead, we provide a generic characterization of the target trace property ensured by correctly
compiling a program that satisfies a given source property, and dually, of the source trace property
one is required to show in order to obtain a certain target property for the compiled code. We show
that this view on compiler correctness can naturally account for undefined behavior, resource
exhaustion, different source and target values, side-channels, and various abstraction mismatches.
Finally, we show that the same generalization also applies to a large class of secure compilation
definitions, which characterize the protection of a compiled program against linked adversarial
code.
