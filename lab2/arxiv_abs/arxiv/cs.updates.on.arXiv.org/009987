The polynomial-time computability of the permanent over fields of characteristic 3 for k-semi-unitary
matrices in the case k = 0 or k = 1 and its #3P-completeness for any k > 1 (Ref. 9) is a result that essentially
widens our understanding of the computational complexity boundaries for the permanent modulo
3. Now we extend this result to study more closely the case k > 1 regarding the (n-k)x(n-k)-sub-permanents
(or permanent-minors) of a unitary nxn-matrix and their possible relations, because an (n-k)x(n-k)-submatrix
of a unitary nxn-matrix is generically a k-semi-unitary (n-k)x(n-k)-matrix. The following paper
offers a way to receive a variety of such equations of different sorts, in the meantime also extending
this direction of research to reviewing all the set of polynomial-time permanent-preserving reductions
and equations for the sub-permanents of a generic matrix they might yield, including a number of
generalizations and formulae (valid in an arbitrary prime characteristic) analogical to the classical
identities relating the minors of a matrix and its inverse. Moreover, the second chapter also deals
with the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial in characteristic 2 that surprisingly possesses quite a
number of properties very similar to the corresponding ones of the permanent in characteristic
3. Besides, the third chapter is devoted to the computational complexity issues of the permanent
and some related functions on a variety of Cauchy matrices and their certain generalizations, including
constructing a polynomial-time algorithm (based on them) for the permanent of an arbitrary matrix
in characteristic 5 and conjecturing the existence of a similar scheme in characteristic 3.
