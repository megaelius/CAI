In the classical Steiner tree problem, one is given an undirected, connected graph $G=(V,E)$ with
non-negative edge costs and a set $T \subseteq V$, the \emph{terminals}. The objective is to find
a minimum-cost edge set $E' \subseteq E$ that spans the terminals. The problem is APX-hard [Bern
\& Plassman, IPL 1989]; the best known approximation algorithm has a ratio of $\rho = \ln(4)+\varepsilon
< 1.39$ [Byrka et al., J. ACM 2013]. In this paper, we study a natural generalization, the \emph{multi-level
Steiner tree} (MLST) problem: given a nested sequence of terminals $T_1 \subset \dots \subset T_k
\subseteq V$, compute nested edge sets $E_1 \subseteq \dots \subseteq E_k \subseteq E$ that span
the corresponding terminal sets with minimum total cost. (Note that, for $\ell=1,\dots,k$, edges
in $E_\ell$ contribute ($k-\ell+1$)-fold to this cost). The MLST problem and variants thereof
have been studied under names such as Quality-of-Service Multicast tree, Grade-of-Service Steiner
tree, Multi-Tier tree, etc. Several approximation results are known. We first present two natural
heuristics with approximation factor~$O(k)$. Based on these, we introduce a composite algorithm
that requires $2^k$ Steiner tree computations. We determine its approximation ratio by solving
a linear program. We then present a method that guarantees the same approximation ratio and needs
at most $2k$ Steiner tree computations. We compare five algorithms experimentally on several classes
of graphs using Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi, random geometric, Watts--Strogatz, and Barab\'asi--Albert
network generation models for varying $|V|$, $k$, and terminal selection methods. We also implemented
an integer linear program for MLST to provide ground truth. Our combined algorithm outperforms
the others both in theory and in practice when the number of levels is up to $k \le 22$.
