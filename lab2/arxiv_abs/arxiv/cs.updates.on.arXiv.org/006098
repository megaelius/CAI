Detecting acoustic shadows in ultrasound images is important in many clinical and engineering
applications. Real-time feedback of acoustic shadows can guide sonographers to a standardized
diagnostic viewing plane with minimal artifacts and can provide additional information for other
automatic image analysis algorithms. However, automatically detecting shadow regions is challenging
because pixel-wise annotation of acoustic shadows is subjective and time consuming. In this paper
we propose a weakly supervised method for automatic confidence estimation of acoustic shadow regions,
which is able to generate a dense shadow-focused confidence map. During training, a multi-task
module for shadow segmentation is built to learn general shadow features according based image-level
annotations as well as a small number of coarse pixel-wise shadow annotations. A transfer function
is then established to extend the binary shadow segmentation to a reference confidence map. In addition,
a confidence estimation network is proposed to learn the mapping between input images and the reference
confidence maps. This confidence estimation network is able to predict shadow confidence maps
directly from input images during inference. We evaluate DICE, soft DICE, recall, precision, mean
squared error and inter-class correlation to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art qualitatively and quantitatively. We further demonstrate
the applicability of our method by integrating shadow confidence maps into tasks such as ultrasound
image classification, multi-view image fusion and automated biometric measurements.
