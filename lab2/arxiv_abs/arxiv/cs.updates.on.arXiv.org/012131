Differential evolution indicators are introduced for 3D spatiotemporal imaging of micromechanical
processes in complex materials where progressive variations due to manufacturing and/or aging
are housed in a highly scattering background of a-priori unknown or uncertain structure. In this
vein, a three-tier imaging platform is established where: (1) the domain is periodically (or continuously)
subject to illumination and sensing in an arbitrary configuration; (2) sequential sets of measured
data are deployed to distill segment-wise scattering signatures of the domain's internal structure
through carefully constructed, non-iterative solutions to the scattering equation; and (3) the
resulting solution sequence is then used to rigorously construct an imaging functional carrying
appropriate invariance with respect to the unknown stationary components of the background e.g.,
pre-existing interstitial boundaries and bubbles. This gives birth to differential indicators
that specifically recover the 3D support of micromechanical evolution within a network of unknown
scatterers. The direct scattering problem is formulated in the frequency domain where the background
is comprised of a random distribution of monolithic fragments. The constituents are connected
via highly heterogeneous interfaces of unknown elasticity and dissipation which are subject to
spatiotemporal evolution. The support of internal boundaries are sequentially illuminated by
a set of incident waves and thus-induced scattered fields are captured over a generic observation
surface. The performance of the proposed imaging indicator is illustrated through a set of numerical
experiments for spatiotemporal reconstruction of progressive damage zones featuring randomly
distributed cracks and bubbles.
