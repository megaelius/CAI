Land cover maps are a vital input variable to many types of environmental research and management.
While they can be produced automatically by machine learning techniques, these techniques require
substantial training data to achieve high levels of accuracy, which are not always available. One
technique researchers use when labelled training data are scarce is domain adaptation (DA) -- where
data from an alternate region, known as the source domain, are used to train a classifier and this
model is adapted to map the study region, or target domain. The scenario we address in this paper is
known as semi-supervised DA, where some labelled samples are available in the target domain. In
this paper we present Sourcerer, a Bayesian-inspired, deep learning-based, semi-supervised
DA technique for producing land cover maps from SITS data. The technique takes a convolutional neural
network trained on a source domain and then trains further on the available target domain with a novel
regularizer applied to the model weights. The regularizer adjusts the degree to which the model
is modified to fit the target data, limiting the degree of change when the target data are few in number
and increasing it as target data quantity increases. Our experiments on Sentinel-2 time series
images compare Sourcerer with two state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques
and four baseline models. We show that on two different source-target domain pairings Sourcerer
outperforms all other methods for any quantity of labelled target data available. In fact, the results
on the more difficult target domain show that the starting accuracy of Sourcerer (when no labelled
target data are available), 74.2%, is greater than the next-best state-of-the-art method trained
on 20,000 labelled target instances.
