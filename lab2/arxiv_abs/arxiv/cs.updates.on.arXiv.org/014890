Regular matching problems have a long history. In 1964, Ginsburg and Hibbard showed that on input
regular languages $L$ and $R$ it is decidable whether there is a generalized sequential machine
which maps $L$ onto $R$, and noticed that the results cannot be extended to context-free languages.
We investigate regular matching problems with respect to substitutions. Conway studied the problem
"$\exists\sigma:\sigma(L)\subseteq R$?". He showed that there are finitely many maximal solutions
which are effectively computable, that every solution is included in a maximal one, and $\sigma(x)$
is regular for all $x\in X$. We generalize this type of results to infinite trees. For a regular tree
language given by a parity NTA, we can define an equivalence of finite index which has the desired
saturation property. For languages over infinite trees, we define a notion of choice function $\gamma$
which for any tree $s$ over $\Sigma\cup X$ and position $u$ labeled by variable $x\in X$ selects at
most one tree $\gamma(u)$ in $\sigma(x)$. In this way we define $\gamma_\infty(s)$ as the limit
of a Cauchy sequence; and the union over all these $\gamma_\infty(s)$ leads to a natural notion of
$\sigma(s)$. Since or definition coincides with the classical IO substitutions, we write $\sigma_{io}(L)$
instead of $\sigma(L)$. By using choice functions, we obtain a smooth generalization of Conway's
results for infinite trees. This includes the decidability of "$\exists\sigma:\sigma_{io}(L)=R$?",
although it is not true in general that $\sigma_{io}(L)$ is regular as soon as $\sigma(x)$ is regular
for all $x\in X$. As a special case, for $L$ context-free and $R$ regular "$\exists\sigma:\sigma_{io}(L)\subseteq
R$?" is decidable, but "$\exists\sigma:\sigma_{io}(L)=R$?" is not. In this sense the decidability
of "$\exists\sigma:\sigma_{io}(L)=R$?" if both $L$ and $R$ are regular can be viewed as optimal.
