Wireless communications refer to data transmissions in unguided propagation media through the
use of wireless carriers such as radio frequency (RF) and visible light (VL) waves. The rising demand
for high data rates, especially, in indoor scenarios, overloads conventional RF technologies.
Therefore, technologies such as millimeter waves (mmWave) and cognitive radios have been adopted
as possible solutions to overcome the spectrum scarcity and capacity limitations of the conventional
RF systems. In parallel, visible light communication (VLC) has been proposed as an alternative
solution, where a light source is used for both illumination and data transmission. In comparison
to RF links, VLC links present a very high bandwidth that allows much higher data rates. VLC exhibits
also immunity to interference from electromagnetic sources, has unlicensed channels, is a very
low power consumption system, and has no health hazard. VLC is appealing for a wide range of applications
including reliable communications with low latency such as vehicle safety communication. Despite
the major advantages of VLC technology and a variety of its applications, its use has been hampered
by its cons such as its dependence on a line of sight connectivity. Recently, hybrid RF/VLC systems
were proposed to take advantage of the high capacity of VLC links and better connectivity of RF links.
Thus, hybrid RF/VLC systems are envisioned as a key enabler to improve the user rates and mobility
on the one hand and to optimize the capacity, interference, and power consumption of the overall
network on the other hand. This paper seeks to provide a detailed survey of hybrid RF/VLC systems.
This paper represents an overview of the current developments in the hybrid RF/VLC systems, their
benefits, and limitations for both newcomers and expert researchers.
