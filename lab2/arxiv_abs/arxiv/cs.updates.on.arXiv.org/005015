This paper presents the experimental study revealing weaker performance of the automatic iris
recognition methods for cataract-affected eyes when compared to healthy eyes. There is little
research on the topic, mostly incorporating scarce databases that are often deficient in images
representing more than one illness. We built our own database, acquiring 1288 eye images of 37 patients
of the Medical University of Warsaw. Those images represent several common ocular diseases, such
as cataract, along with less ordinary conditions, such as iris pattern alterations derived from
illness or eye trauma. Images were captured in near-infrared light (used in biometrics) and for
selected cases also in visible light (used in ophthalmological diagnosis). Since cataract is a
disorder that is most populated by samples in the database, in this paper we focus solely on this illness.
To assess the extent of the performance deterioration we use three iris recognition methodologies
(commercial and academic solutions) to calculate genuine match scores for healthy eyes and those
influenced by cataract. Results show a significant degradation in iris recognition reliability
manifesting by worsening the genuine scores in all three matchers used in this study (12% of genuine
score increase for an academic matcher, up to 175% of genuine score increase obtained for an example
commercial matcher). This increase in genuine scores affected the final false non-match rate in
two matchers. To our best knowledge this is the only study of such kind that employs more than one iris
matcher, and analyzes the iris image segmentation as a potential source of decreased reliability.
