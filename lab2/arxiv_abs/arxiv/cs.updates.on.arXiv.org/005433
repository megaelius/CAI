This paper is concerned with developing a novel distributed Kalman filtering algorithm over wireless
sensor networks based on randomized consensus strategy. Compared with the centralized algorithm,
distributed filtering techniques require less computation per sensor and lead to more robust estimation
since they simply use the information from the neighboring nodes in the network. However, poor local
sensor estimation caused by limited observability and network topology changes which interfere
the global consensus are challenging issues. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel
randomized gossip-based distributed Kalman filtering algorithm. Information exchange and computation
in the proposed algorithm can be carried out in an arbitrarily connected network of nodes. In addition,
the computational burden can be distributed for a sensor which communicates with a stochastically
selected neighbor at each clock step under schemes of gossip algorithm. In this case, the error covariance
matrix changes stochastically at every clock step, thus the convergence is considered in a probabilistic
sense. We provide the mean square convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm. Under a sufficient
condition, we show that the proposed algorithm is quite appealing as it achieves better mean square
error performance theoretically than the noncooperative decentralized Kalman filtering algorithm.
Besides, considering the limited computation, communication, and energy resources in the wireless
sensor networks, we propose an optimization problem which minimizes the average expected state
estimation error based on the proposed algorithm. To solve the proposed problem efficiently, we
transform it into a convex optimization problem. And a sub-optimal solution is attained. Examples
and simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.
