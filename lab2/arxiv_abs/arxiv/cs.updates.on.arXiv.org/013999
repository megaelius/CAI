By allowing users to obscure their transactions via including "mixins" (chaff coins), ring signature
schemes have been widely used to protect a sender's identity of a transaction in privacy-preserving
blockchain systems, like Monero and Bytecoin. However, recent works point out that the existing
ring signature scheme is vulnerable to the "chain-reaction" analysis (i.e., the spent coin in a
given ring signature can be deduced through elimination). Especially, when the diversity of mixins
is low, the spent coin will have a high risk to be detected. To overcome the weakness, the ring signature
should be consisted of a set of mixins with high diversity and produce observations having "similar"
distributions for any two coins. In this paper, we propose a notion, namely $\epsilon$-coin-indistinguishability
($\epsilon$-CI), to formally define the "similar" distribution guaranteed through a differential
privacy scheme. Then, we formally define the CI-aware mixins selection problem with disjoint-superset
constraint (CIA-MS-DS), which aims to find a mixin set that has maximal diversity and satisfies
the constraints of $\epsilon$-CI and the budget. In CIA-MS-DS, each ring signature is either disjoint
with or the superset of its preceding ring signatures. We prove that CIA-MS-DS is NP-hard and thus
intractable. To solve the CIA-MS-DS problem, we propose two approximation algorithms, namely
the Progressive Algorithm and the Game Theoretic Algorithm, with theoretic guarantees. Through
extensive experiments on both real data sets and synthetic data sets, we demonstrate the efficiency
and the effectiveness of our approaches.
