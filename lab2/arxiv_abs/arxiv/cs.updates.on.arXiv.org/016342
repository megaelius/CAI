We study incidence problems involving points and curves in $R^3$. The current (and in fact only viable)
approach to such problems, pioneered by Guth and Katz, requires a variety of tools from algebraic
geometry, most notably (i) the polynomial partitioning technique, and (ii) the study of algebraic
surfaces that are ruled by lines or, in more recent studies, by algebraic curves of some constant
degree. By exploiting and refining these tools, we obtain new and improved bounds for point-curve
incidence problems in $R^3$. Incidences of this kind have been considered in several previous studies,
starting with Guth and Katz's work on points and lines. Our results, which are based on the work of
Guth and Zahl concerning surfaces that are doubly ruled by curves, provide a grand generalization
of most of the previous results. We reconstruct the bound for points and lines, and improve, in certain
significant ways, recent bounds involving points and circles (in Sharir, Sheffer and Zahl), and
points and arbitrary constant-degree algebraic curves (in Sharir, Sheffer and Solomon). While
in these latter instances the bounds are not known (and are strongly suspected not) to be tight, our
bounds are, in a certain sense, the best that can be obtained with this approach, given the current
state of knowledge. As an application of our point-curve incidence bound, we show that the number
of triangles spanned by a set of $n$ points in $R^3$ and similar to a given triangle is $O(n^{15/7})$,
which improves the bound of Agarwal et al. Our results are also related to a study by Guth et al.~(work
in progress), and have been recently applied in Sharir, Solomon and Zlydenko to related incidence
problems in three dimensions.
