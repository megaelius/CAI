Trajectory prediction (TP) is of great importance for a wide range of location-based applications
in intelligent transport systems such as location-based advertising, route planning, traffic
management, and early warning systems. In the last few years, the widespread use of GPS navigation
systems and wireless communication technology enabled vehicles has resulted in huge volumes of
trajectory data. The task of utilizing this data employing spatio-temporal techniques for trajectory
prediction in an efficient and accurate manner is an ongoing research problem. Existing TP approaches
are limited to short-term predictions. Moreover, they cannot handle a large volume of trajectory
data for long-term prediction. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable clustering
and Markov chain based hybrid framework, called Traj-clusiVAT-based TP, for both short-term and
long-term trajectory prediction, which can handle a large number of overlapping trajectories
in a dense road network. In addition, Traj-clusiVAT can also determine the number of clusters, which
represent different movement behaviours in input trajectory data. In our experiments, we compare
our proposed approach with a mixed Markov model (MMM)-based scheme, and a trajectory clustering,
NETSCAN-based TP method for both short- and long-term trajectory predictions. We performed our
experiments on two real, vehicle trajectory datasets, including a large-scale trajectory dataset
consisting of 3.28 million trajectories obtained from 15,061 taxis in Singapore over a period of
one month. Experimental results on two real trajectory datasets show that our proposed approach
outperforms the existing approaches in terms of both short- and long-term prediction performances,
based on prediction accuracy and distance error (in km).
