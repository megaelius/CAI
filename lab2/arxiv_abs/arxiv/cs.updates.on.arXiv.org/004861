Integrated cyber-physical systems (CPSs), such as the smart grid, are increasingly becoming the
underpinning technology for major industries. A major concern regarding such systems are the seemingly
unexpected large-scale failures, which are often attributed to a small initial shock getting escalated
due to intricate dependencies within and across the individual counterparts of the system. In this
paper, we develop a novel interdependent system model to capture this phenomenon, also known as
cascading failures. Our framework consists of two networks that have inherently different characteristics
governing their intra-dependency: i) a cyber-network where a node is functional as long as it belongs
to the largest connected (i.e., giant) component; and ii) a physical network where nodes are given
an initial flow and a capacity, and failure of a node results with redistribution of its flow to the
remaining nodes, upon which further failures might take place due to overloading (i.e., the flow
of a node exceeding its capacity). Furthermore, it is assumed that these two networks are inter-dependent.
For simplicity, we consider a one-to-one interdependency model where every node in the cyber-network
is dependent upon and supports a single node in the physical network, and vice versa. We provide a
thorough analysis of the dynamics of cascading failures in this interdependent system initiated
with a random attack. The system robustness is quantified as the surviving fraction of nodes at the
end of cascading failures, and is derived in terms of all network parameters involved (e.g., degree
distribution, load/capacity distribution, failure size, etc.). Analytic results are supported
through an extensive numerical study. Among other things, these results demonstrate the ability
of our model to capture the unexpected nature of large-scale failures and provide insights on improving
system robustness.
