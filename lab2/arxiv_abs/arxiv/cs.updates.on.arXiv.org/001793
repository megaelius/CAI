The next generation of many-core enabled large-scale computing systems relies on thousands of
billions of heterogeneous processing cores connected to form a single computing unit. In such large-scale
computing environments, resource management is one of the most challenging, and complex issues
for efficient resource sharing and utilization, particularly as we move toward Future ManyCore
Systems (FMCS). This work proposes a novel resource management scheme for future peta-scale many-core-enabled
computing systems, based on hybrid adaptive resource discovery, called ElCore. The proposed architecture
contains a set of modules which will dynamically be instantiated on the nodes in the distributed
system on demand. Our approach provides flexibility to allocate the required set of resources for
various types of processes/applications. It can also be considered as a generic solution (with
respect to the general requirements of large scale computing environments) which brings a set of
interesting features (such as auto-scaling, multitenancy, multi-dimensional mapping, etc,.)
to facilitate its easy adaptation to any distributed technology (such as SOA, Grid and HPC many-core).
The achieved evaluation results assured the significant scalability and the high quality resource
mapping of the proposed resource discovery and management over highly heterogeneous, hierarchical
and dynamic computing environments with respect to several scalability and efficiency aspects
while supporting flexible and complex queries with guaranteed discovery results accuracy. The
simulation results prove that, using our approach, the mapping between processes and resources
can be done with high level of accuracy which potentially leads to a significant enhancement in the
overall system performance.
