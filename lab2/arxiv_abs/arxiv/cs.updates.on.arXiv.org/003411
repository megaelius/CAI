Similarity/Distance measures play a key role in many machine learning, pattern recognition, and
data mining algorithms, which leads to the emergence of metric learning field. Many metric learning
algorithms learn a global distance function from data that satisfy the constraints of the problem.
However, in many real-world datasets that the discrimination power of features varies in the different
regions of input space, a global metric is often unable to capture the complexity of the task. To address
this challenge, local metric learning methods are proposed that learn multiple metrics across
the different regions of input space. Some advantages of these methods are high flexibility and
the ability to learn a nonlinear mapping but typically achieves at the expense of higher time requirement
and overfitting problem. To overcome these challenges, this research presents an online multiple
metric learning framework. Each metric in the proposed framework is composed of a global and a local
component learned simultaneously. Adding a global component to a local metric efficiently reduce
the problem of overfitting. The proposed framework is also scalable with both sample size and the
dimension of input data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first local online similarity/distance
learning framework based on PA (Passive/Aggressive). In addition, for scalability with the dimension
of input data, DRP (Dual Random Projection) is extended for local online learning in the present
work. It enables our methods to be run efficiently on high-dimensional datasets, while maintains
their predictive performance. The proposed framework provides a straightforward local extension
to any global online similarity/distance learning algorithm based on PA.
