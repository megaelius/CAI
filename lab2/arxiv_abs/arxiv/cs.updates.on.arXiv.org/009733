We explore the collapse of "wavefunction" and the measurement of entanglement in the superpositions
of hyperspace vectors in classical physical instantaneous-noise-based logic (INBL). We find
both similarities with and major differences from the related properties of quantum systems. Two
search algorithms utilizing the observed features are introduced. For the first one we assume an
unsorted names database set up by Alice that is a superposition (unknown by Bob) of up to n=2^N strings;
those we call names. Bob has access to the superposition wave and to the 2N reference noises of the
INBL system of N noise bits. For Bob, to decide if a given name x is included in the superposition, once
the search has begun, it takes N switching operations followed by a single measurement of the superposition
wave. Thus the time and hardware complexity of the search algorithm is O[log(n)] which indicates
an exponential speedup compared to Grover's quantum algorithm in a corresponding setting. An extra
advantage is that the error probability of the search is zero. Moreover, the scheme can also check
the existence of a fraction of a string, or several separate string fractions embedded in an arbitrarily
long, arbitrary string. In the second algorithm, we expand the above scheme to a phonebook with n
names and s phone numbers. When the names and numbers have the same bit resolution, once the search
has begun, the time and hardware complexity of this search algorithm is O[log(n)]. In the case of
one-to-one correspondence between names and phone numbers (n=s), the algorithm offers inverse
phonebook search too. The error probability of this search algorithm is also zero.
