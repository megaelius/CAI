Peer-assisted content distribution networks(CDNs) have emerged to improve performance and reduce
deployment costs of traditional, infrastructure-based content delivery networks. This is done
by employing peer-to-peer data transfers to supplement the resources of the network infrastructure.
However, these hybrid systems are vulnerable to accounting attacks in which the peers, or caches,
collude with clients in order to report that content was transferred when it was not. This is a particular
issue in systems that incentivize cache participation, because malicious caches may collect rewards
from the content publishers operating the CDN without doing any useful work. In this paper, we introduce
CAPnet, the first technique that lets untrusted caches join a peer-assisted CDN while providing
a bound on the effectiveness of accounting attacks. At its heart is a lightweight cache accountability
puzzle that clients must solve before caches are given credit. This puzzle requires colocating
the data a client has requested, so its solution confirms that the content (or at least an amount of
data within a pre-configured bound) has actually been retrieved. We analyze the security and overhead
of our scheme in realistic scenarios. The results show that a modest client machine using a single
core can solve puzzles at a rate sufficient to simultaneously watch dozens of 1080p videos. The technique
is designed to be even more scalable on the server side. In our experiments, one core of a single low-end
machine is able to generate puzzles for 4.26 Tbps of bandwidth - enabling 870,000 clients to concurrently
view the same 1080p video. This demonstrates that our scheme can ensure cache accountability without
degrading system productivity.
