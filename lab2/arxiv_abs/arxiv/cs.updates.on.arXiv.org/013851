Some social networks provide explicit mechanisms to allocate social rewards such as reputation
based on user activity, while the mechanism is more opaque in other networks. Nonetheless, there
are always individuals who obtain greater rewards and reputation than their peers. An intuitive
yet important question to ask is whether these successful users employ strategic behaviors to become
influential. It might appear that the influencers have gamed the system. However, it remains difficult
to conclude the rationality of their actions due to factors like the combinatorial strategy space,
inability to determine payoffs, and resource limitations faced by individuals. The challenging
nature of this question has drawn attention from both the theory and data mining communities. Therefore,
in this paper, we are motivated to investigate if resource-limited individuals discover strategic
behaviors associated with high payoffs when producing collaborative or interactive content in
social networks. We propose a novel framework of Dynamic Dual Attention Networks or DDAN which models
content production strategies of users through a generative process, under the influence of social
interactions involved in the process. Extensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness
of our model in modeling user behavior. We make three strong empirical findings. Different strategies
give rise to different social payoffs, the best performing individuals exhibit stability in their
preference over the discovered strategies, which indicates the emergence of strategic behavior,
and the stability of strategy preference is correlated with high payoffs.
