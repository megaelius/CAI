Mobile communications have been undergoing a generational change every ten years or so. However,
the time difference between the so-called "G's" is also decreasing. While fifth-generation (5G)
systems are becoming a commercial reality, there is already significant interest in systems beyond
5G - which we refer to as the sixth-generation (6G) of wireless systems. In contrast to the many published
papers on the topic, we take a top-down approach to 6G. We present a holistic discussion of 6G systems
beginning with the lifestyle and societal changes driving the need for next generation networks,
to the technical requirements needed to enable 6G applications, through to the challenges, as well
as possibilities for practically realizable system solutions across all layers of the Open Systems
Interconnection stack. Since many of the 6G applications will need access to an order-of-magnitude
more spectrum, utilization of frequencies between 100 GHz and 1 THz becomes of paramount importance.
We comprehensively characterize the limitations that must be overcome to realize working systems
in these bands; and provide a unique perspective on the physical, as well as higher layer challenges
relating to the design of next generation core networks, new modulation and coding methods, novel
multiple access techniques, antenna arrays, wave propagation, radio-frequency transceiver
design, as well as real-time signal processing. We rigorously discuss the fundamental changes
required in the core networks of the future, such as the redesign or significant reduction of the
transport architecture that serves as a major source of latency. While evaluating the strengths
and weaknesses of key technologies, we differentiate what may be practically achievable over the
next decade, relative to what is possible in theory. For each discussed system aspect, we present
concrete research challenges.
