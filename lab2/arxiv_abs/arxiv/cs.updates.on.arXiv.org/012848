We consider the problem of assigning residents to hospitals when hospitals have upper and lower
quotas and both residents and hospitals have a preference list which is a strict ordering on a subset
of the other side. Stability is a well-known notion of optimality in this setting. Every Hospital-Residents
(HR) instance without lower quotas admits at least one stable matching. When hospitals have lower
quotas (HRLQ), there exist instances for which no matching that is simultaneously stable and feasible
exists. We investigate envy-freeness which is a relaxation of stability for such instances. Yokoi
(ISAAC 2017) gave a characterization for HRLQ instances that admit a feasible and envy-free matching.
Yokoi's algorithm gives a minimum size feasible envy-free matching, if there exists one. We investigate
the complexity of computing a maximum size envy-free matching in an HRLQ instance (MAXEFM problem)
which is equivalent to computing an envy-free matching with minimum number of unmatched residents
(MIN-UR-EFM problem). We show that both the MAXEFM and MIN-UR-EFM problems for an HRLQ instance
with arbitrary incomplete preference lists are NP-hard. We show that MAXEFM cannot be approximated
within a factor of 21/19. On the other hand we show that the MIN-UR-EFM problem cannot be approximated
for any c > 0. We present approximation algorithm for MAXEFM with guarantee 1/L1 when quotas are 0
or 1 and 1/(L1*L2) for unrestricted quotas where L1 and L2 respectively denote the length of longest
preference list of a resident and a hospital. We show that both the problems become tractable with
additional restrictions on preference lists and quotas. We investigate the parameterized complexity
of these problems and prove that they are W[1]-hard when deficiency is the parameter. On the positive
side, we show that the problems are fixed parameter tractable for several interesting parameters.
