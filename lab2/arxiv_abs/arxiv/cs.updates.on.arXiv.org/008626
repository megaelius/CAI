With the breakthroughs in deep learning, the recent years have witnessed a booming of artificial
intelligence (AI) applications and services, spanning from personal assistant to recommendation
systems to video/audio surveillance. More recently, with the proliferation of mobile computing
and Internet-of-Things (IoT), billions of mobile and IoT devices are connected to the Internet,
generating zillions Bytes of data at the network edge. Driving by this trend, there is an urgent need
to push the AI frontiers to the network edge so as to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data.
To meet this demand, edge computing, an emerging paradigm that pushes computing tasks and services
from the network core to the network edge, has been widely recognized as a promising solution. The
resulted new inter-discipline, edge AI or edge intelligence, is beginning to receive a tremendous
amount of interest. However, research on edge intelligence is still in its infancy stage, and a dedicated
venue for exchanging the recent advances of edge intelligence is highly desired by both the computer
system and artificial intelligence communities. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey
of the recent research efforts on edge intelligence. Specifically, we first review the background
and motivation for artificial intelligence running at the network edge. We then provide an overview
of the overarching architectures, frameworks and emerging key technologies for deep learning
model towards training/inference at the network edge. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities
on edge intelligence. We believe that this survey will elicit escalating attentions, stimulate
fruitful discussions and inspire further research ideas on edge intelligence.
