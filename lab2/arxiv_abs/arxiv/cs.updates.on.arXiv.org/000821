We develop the first basic Operational Risk perspective on key risk management issues associated
with the development of new forms of electronic currency in the real economy. In particular, we focus
on understanding the development of new risks types and the evolution of current risk types as new
components of financial institutions arise to cater for an increasing demand for electronic money,
micro-payment systems, Virtual money and cryptographic (Crypto) currencies. In particular,
this paper proposes a framework of risk identification and assessment applied to Virtual and Crypto
currencies from a banking regulation perspective. In doing so, it addresses the topical issues
of understanding important key Operational Risk vulnerabilities and exposure risk drivers under
the framework of the Basel II/III banking regulation, specifically associated with Virtual and
Crypto currencies. This is critical to consider should such alternative currencies continue to
grow in utilisation to the point that they enter into the banking sector, through commercial banks
and financial institutions who are beginning to contemplate their recognition in terms of deposits,
transactions and exchangeability for fiat currencies. We highlight how some of the features of
Virtual and Crypto currencies are important drivers of Operational Risk, posing both management
and regulatory challenges that must start to be considered and addressed both by regulators, central
banks and security exchanges. In this paper we focus purely on the Operational Risk perspective
of banks operating in an environment where such electronic Virtual currencies are available. Some
aspects of this discussion are directly relevant now, whilst others can be understood as discussions
to raise awareness of issues in Operational Risk that will arise as Virtual currency start to interact
more widely in the real economy.
