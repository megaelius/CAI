The study in this article seeks to find conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the satisfiability
of a Boolean function. We will use the concept of special covering of a set introduced in [9] and study
the relation of this concept with the satisfiability of Boolean functions. We show that the problem
of existence of a special covering of a set is equivalent to the Boolean satisfiability problem.
Thus, an important result is the proof of the existence of necessary and sufficient conditions for
the existence of special covering of the set. This result allows us to formulate the necessary and
sufficient conditions for Boolean satisfiability, considering the function in conjunctive normal
form as a set of clauses. To formulate the same result in term of Boolean function we introduce the
concept of proportional conjunctive normal form of a function, which is a conjunctive normal form
of a function with the condition that each clause contains a negative literal or each clause contains
a positive literal. Thus, we obtain that the satisfiability of a Boolean function represented in
conjunctive normal form is equivalent to the possibility of converting it into a function in proportional
conjunctive normal form by literal inversion.To prove these results, some algorithmic procedures
are used. As a result of these procedures, in parallel, we obtain the Boolean values for the variables
that provide the satisfiability of the function.Estimates of the complexity of these algorithmic
procedures will be presented in the next article. Generally accepted terminology on set theory,
Boolean functions, and graph theory is consistent with the terminology found in the relevant works
included in the bibliography [1],[2],[3]. The newly introduced terms are not found in use by other
authors and do not contradict to other terms.
