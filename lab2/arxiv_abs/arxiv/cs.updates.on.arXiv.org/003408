Given the significant advancement in face detection and recognition techniques for human faces
over recent years, we questioned how well would they work for cartoon faces - a domain that remains
largely unexplored yet, mainly due to the unavailability of abundant data sets and failure of traditional
methods on these. In the present article, we employ various state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
for detecting and recognizing faces of cartoon characters along with proposing a novel approach
to cartoon face recognition. For face detection, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of the
Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) architecture and contrasts it with other benchmark
methods. For face recognition, we present two feature-based techniques: (i) an Inductive transfer
approach combining the feature learning capability of the Inception v3 network and feature recognizing
capability of Support Vector Machines (SVM), (ii) a proposed Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network
(HCNN) based recognition framework trained over a fusion of pixel values and 15 manually located
facial key points. All the methods are evaluated on the Cartoon Faces in the Wild (IIIT-CFW) database.
We show a detailed analysis of the performance of the models using several metrics over a number of
input constraints. Experiments show that the MTCNN based model results in a respective gain of 3.97%,
1.19% and 2.78% on the True positive rate, False positive rate and False negative rate over the state-of-the-art
detection method while both the recognition models surpass the state-of-the-art in terms of F-score.
The Inception v3+SVM recognition model also establishes a new benchmark F-score of 0.910 on the
task of cartoon gender recognition. We also introduce a small sized database containing location
coordinates of 15 key points of the cartoon faces belonging to 50 public figures included in the IIIT-CFW
database.
