We consider simplified, monotone versions of Not-All-Equal 3-Sat and 3-Sat, variants of the famous
Satisfiability Problem where each clause is made up of exactly three distinct literals. We show
that Not-All-Equal 3-Sat remains NP-complete even if (1) each variable appears exactly four times,
(2) there are no negations in the formula, and (3) the formula is linear, i.e., each pair of distinct
clauses shares at most one variable. Concerning 3-Sat we prove several hardness results for monotone
formulas with respect to a variety of restrictions imposed on the variable appearances. Monotone
3-Sat is the restriction of 3-Sat to monotone formulas, i.e. to formulas in which each clause contains
only unnegated variables or only negated variables, respectively. In particular, we show that,
for any $k\geq 5$, Monotone 3-Sat is NP-complete even if each variable appears exactly $k$ times
unnegated and exactly once negated. In addition, we show that Monotone 3-Sat is NP-complete even
if each variable appears exactly three times unnegated and three times negated, respectively.
In fact, we provide a complete analysis of Monotone 3-Sat with exactly six appearances per variable.
Further, we prove that the problem remains NP-complete when restricted to instances in which each
variable appears either exactly once unnegated and three times negated or the other way around.
Thereby, we improve on a result by Darmann et al. [DDD18] showing NP-completeness for four appearances
per variable. Our stronger result also implies that 3-Sat remains NP-complete even if each variable
appears exactly three times unnegated and once negated, therewith complementing a result by Berman
et al. [BKS03].
