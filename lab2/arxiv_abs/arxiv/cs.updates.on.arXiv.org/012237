Entity alignment (EA) identifies entities that refer to the same real-world object but locate in
different knowledge graphs (KGs), and has been harnessed for KG construction and integration.
When generating EA results, current embedding-based solutions treat entities independently
and fail to take into account the interdependence between entities. In addition, most of embedding-based
EA methods either fuse different features on representation-level and generate unified entity
embedding for alignment, which potentially causes information loss, or aggregate features on
outcome-level with hand-tuned weights, which is not practical with increasing numbers of features.
To tackle these deficiencies, we propose a collective embedding-based EA framework with adaptive
feature fusion mechanism. We first employ three representative features, i.e., structural, semantic
and string signals, for capturing different aspects of the similarity between entities in heterogeneous
KGs. These features are then integrated at outcome-level, with dynamically assigned weights generated
by our carefully devised adaptive feature fusion strategy. Eventually, in order to make collective
EA decisions, we formulate EA as the classical stable matching problem between entities to be aligned,
with preference lists constructed using fused feature matrix. It is further effectively solved
by deferred acceptance algorithm. Our proposal is evaluated on both cross-lingual and mono-lingual
EA benchmarks against state-of-the-art solutions, and the empirical results verify its effectiveness
and superiority. We also perform ablation study to gain insights into framework modules.
