As a powerful tool to improve their efficiency and sustainability, most electricity systems worldwide
are deploying advanced metering infrastructures to collect relevant operational data. In particular,
smart meters play a key role in this transformation as they allow tracking electricity load consumption
at a very disaggregated level and at high frequency rates. This data opens the possibility of developing
new forecasting models with a potential positive impact in both electricity distribution and retailing
activities. In this work, we present a general methodology that is able to process and forecast a
large number of smart meter time series. Instead of using traditional and univariate approaches
for each time series, we develop a single but complex recurrent neural network model with long short-term
memory that is able to capture individual consumption patterns and also the cross-sectional relations
among different households. The resulting model can accurately predict future loads (short-term)
of individual consumers, even if these were not included in the original training set (out-of-sample
consumers). This entails a great potential for large scale applications (Big Data) as once the single
network is trained, accurate individual forecast for new consumers can be obtained at almost no
computational cost. The performance of the proposed model is tested under a large set of numerical
experiments by using a real world dataset with thousands of disaggregated electricity consumption
time series. Furthermore, we exploit the considered dataset to explore how geo-demographic segmentation
of consumers can improve the forecasting accuracy of the proposed model.
