Optimizing resource allocation with predicted information has shown promising gain in boosting
network performance and improving user experience. Earlier research efforts focus on optimizing
proactive policies under the assumption of knowing the future information. Recently, various
techniques have been proposed to predict the required information, and the prediction results
were then treated as the true value in the optimization, i.e., "first-predict-then-optimize".
In this paper, we introduce a proactive optimization framework for anticipatory resource allocation,
where the future information is implicitly predicted under the same objective with the policy optimization
in a single step. An optimization problem is formulated to integrate the implicit prediction and
the policy optimization, based on the conditional distribution of the future information given
the historical observations. To solve such a problem, we transform it equivalently to a problem
depending on the joint distribution of future and historical information. Then, we resort to unsupervised
learning with neural networks to learn the proactive policy as a function of the past observations
via stochastic optimization. We take proactive caching and bandwidth allocation at base stations
as a concrete example, where the objective function is the conditional expectation of successful
offloading probability taken over the future popularity given the historically observed popularity.
We use simulation to validate the proposed framework and compare it with the "first-predict-then-optimize"
strategy and a heuristic "end-to-end" optimization strategy with supervised learning.
