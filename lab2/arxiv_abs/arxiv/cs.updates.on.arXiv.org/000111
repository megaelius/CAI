A fundamental question in Computer Science is understanding when a specific class of problems go
from being computationally easy to hard. Because of its generality and applications, the problem
of Boolean Satisfiability (aka SAT) is often used as a vehicle for investigating this question.
A signal result from these studies is that the hardness of SAT problems exhibits a dramatic easy-to-hard
phase transition with respect to the problem constrainedness. Past studies have however focused
mostly on SAT instances generated using uniform random distributions, where all constraints are
independently generated, and the problem variables are all considered of equal importance. These
assumptions are unfortunately not satisfied by most real problems. Our project aims for a deeper
understanding of hardness of SAT problems that arise in practice. We study two key questions: (i)
How does easy-to-hard transition change with more realistic distributions that capture neighborhood
sensitivity and rich-get-richer aspects of real problems and (ii) Can these changes be explained
in terms of the network properties (such as node centrality and small-worldness) of the clausal
networks of the SAT problems. Our results, based on extensive empirical studies and network analyses,
provide important structural and computational insights into realistic SAT problems. Our extensive
empirical studies show that SAT instances from realistic distributions do exhibit phase transition,
but the transition occurs sooner (at lower values of constrainedness) than the instances from uniform
random distribution. We show that this behavior can be explained in terms of their clausal network
properties such as eigenvector centrality and small-worldness (measured indirectly in terms
of the clustering coefficients and average node distance).
