Many techniques for privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) have been investigated over the past
decade. Often, the entities involved in the data mining process are end-users or organizations
with limited computing and storage resources. As a result, such entities may want to refrain from
participating in the PPDM process. To overcome this issue and to take many other benefits of cloud
computing, outsourcing PPDM tasks to the cloud environment has recently gained special attention.
We consider the scenario where n entities outsource their databases (in encrypted format) to the
cloud and ask the cloud to perform the clustering task on their combined data in a privacy-preserving
manner. We term such a process as privacy-preserving and outsourced distributed clustering (PPODC).
In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient solution to the PPODC problem based on k-means clustering
algorithm. The main novelty of our solution lies in avoiding the secure division operations required
in computing cluster centers altogether through an efficient transformation technique. Our solution
builds the clusters securely in an iterative fashion and returns the final cluster centers to all
entities when a pre-determined termination condition holds. The proposed solution protects data
confidentiality of all the participating entities under the standard semi-honest model. To the
best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to discuss and propose a comprehensive solution to the
PPODC problem that incurs negligible cost on the participating entities. We theoretically estimate
both the computation and communication costs of the proposed protocol and also demonstrate its
practical value through experiments on a real dataset.
