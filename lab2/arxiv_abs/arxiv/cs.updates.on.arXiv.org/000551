Soil erosion by water is a widespread phenomenon throughout Europe and has the potentiality, with
his on-site and off-site effects, to affect water quality, food security and floods. Despite the
implementation of numerous and different models for estimating soil erosion by water in Europe,
there is still a lack of harmonization of assessment methodologies. Often, different approaches
result in soil erosion rates significantly different. Even when the same model is applied to the
same region the results may differ. This can be due to the way the model is implemented (i.e. with the
selection of different algorithms when available) and/or to the use of datasets having different
resolution or accuracy. Scientific computation is emerging as one of the central topic of the scientific
method, for overcoming these problems there is thus the necessity to develop reproducible computational
method where codes and data are available. The present study illustrates this approach. Using only
public available datasets, we applied the Revised Universal Soil loss Equation (RUSLE) to locate
the most sensitive areas to soil erosion by water in Europe. A significant effort was made for selecting
the better simplified equations to be used when a strict application of the RUSLE model is not possible.
In particular for the computation of the Rainfall Erosivity factor (R) the reproducible research
paradigm was applied. The calculation of the R factor was implemented using public datasets and
the GNU R language. An easily reproducible validation procedure based on measured precipitation
time series was applied using MATLAB language. Designing the computational modelling architecture
with the aim to ease as much as possible the future reuse of the model in analysing climate change scenarios
is also a challenging goal of the research.
