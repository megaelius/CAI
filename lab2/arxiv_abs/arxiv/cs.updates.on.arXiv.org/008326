The existing automatic fingerprint verification methods are designed to work under the assumption
that the same sensor is installed for enrollment and authentication (regular matching). There
is a remarkable decrease in efficiency when one type of contact-based sensor is employed for enrolment
and another type of contact-based sensor is used for authentication (cross-matching or fingerprint
sensor interoperability problem,). The ridge orientation patterns in a fingerprint are invariant
to sensor type. Based on this observation, we propose a robust fingerprint descriptor called the
co-occurrence of ridge orientations (Co-Ror), which encodes the spatial distribution of ridge
orientations. Employing this descriptor, we introduce an efficient automatic fingerprint verification
method for cross-matching problem. Further, to enhance the robustness of the method, we incorporate
scale based ridge orientation information through Gabor-HoG descriptor. The two descriptors
are fused with canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and the matching score between two fingerprints
is calculated using city-block distance. The proposed method is alignment-free and can handle
the matching process without the need for a registration step. The intensive experiments on two
benchmark databases (FingerPass and MOLF) show the effectiveness of the method and reveal its significant
enhancement over the state-of-the-art methods such as VeriFinger (a commercial SDK), minutia
cylinder-code (MCC), MCC with scale, and the thin-plate spline (TPS) model. The proposed research
will help security agencies, service providers and law-enforcement departments to overcome the
interoperability problem of contact sensors of different technology and interaction types.
