Rapid progress in deep learning has spurred its application to bioinformatics problems including
protein structure prediction and design. In classic machine learning problems like computer vision,
progress has been driven by standardized data sets that facilitate fair assessment of new methods
and lower the barrier to entry for non-domain experts. While data sets of protein sequence and structure
exist, they lack certain components critical for machine learning, including high-quality multiple
sequence alignments and insulated training / validation splits that account for deep but only weakly
detectable homology across protein space. We have created the ProteinNet series of data sets to
provide a standardized mechanism for training and assessing data-driven models of protein sequence-structure
relationships. ProteinNet integrates sequence, structure, and evolutionary information in
programmatically accessible file formats tailored for machine learning frameworks. Multiple
sequence alignments of all structurally characterized proteins were created using substantial
high-performance computing resources. Standardized data splits were also generated to emulate
the difficulty of past CASP (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) experiments
by resetting protein sequence and structure space to the historical states that preceded six prior
CASPs. Utilizing sensitive evolution-based distance metrics to segregate distantly related
proteins, we have additionally created validation sets distinct from the official CASP sets that
faithfully mimic their difficulty. ProteinNet thus represents a comprehensive and accessible
resource for training and assessing machine-learned models of protein structure.
