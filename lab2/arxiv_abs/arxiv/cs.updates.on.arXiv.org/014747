Pulmonary lobe segmentation in computed tomography scans is essential for regional assessment
of pulmonary diseases. Automated segmentation is still an open problem, especially for scans with
substantial abnormalities, such as in COVID-19 infection. Recent works used Convolutional Neural
Networks for automatic pulmonary lobe segmentation. Convolution kernels in these networks only
respond to local information within the scope of their effective receptive field, and this may be
insufficient to capture all necessary contextual information. We argue that contextual information
is critically important for accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes, especially when the lungs
are severely affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a contextual
two-stage U-net (CTSU-Net) that leverages global context by introducing a first stage in which
the receptive field encompasses the entire scan and by using a novel non-local neural network module.
The proposed module computes the filter response at one position as a weighted sum of feature responses
at all positions, where geometric and visual correlations between features determine weights.
With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and
validate CTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000
for evaluation). Using models pretrained COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate
CTSU-Net on 204 COVID-19 subjects (104 for retraining and 100 for evaluation). Experimental results
show that CTSU-Net outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and performs robustly on cases with
incomplete fissures and severe lung infection due to COVID-19.
