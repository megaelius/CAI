Dynamic Classifier Selection (DCS) techniques have difficulty in selecting the most competent
classifier in a pool, even when its presence is assured. Since the DCS techniques rely only on local
data to estimate a classifier's competence, the manner in which the pool is generated could affect
the choice of the best classifier for a given sample. That is, the global perspective in which pools
are generated may not help the DCS techniques in selecting a competent classifier for samples that
are likely to be mislabelled. Thus, we propose in this work an online pool generation method that
produces a locally accurate pool for test samples in difficult regions of the feature space. The
difficulty of a given area is determined by the classification difficulty of the samples in it. That
way, by using classifiers that were generated in a local scope, it could be easier for the DCS techniques
to select the best one for the difficult samples. For the query samples in easy regions, a simple nearest
neighbors rule is used. In the extended version of this work, a deep analysis on the correlation between
instance hardness and the performance of DCS techniques is presented. An instance hardness measure
that conveys the degree of local class overlap is then used to decide when the local pool is used in
the proposed scheme. The proposed method yielded significantly greater recognition rates in comparison
to a Bagging-generated pool and two other global pool generation schemes for all DCS techniques
evaluated. The proposed scheme's performance was also significantly superior to three state-of-the-art
classification models and statistically equivalent to five of them. Moreover, an extended analysis
on the computational complexity of the proposed method and of several DS techniques is presented
in this version. We also provide the implementation of the proposed technique using the DESLib library
on GitHub.
