With the increasing popularity of Android smart phones in recent years, the number of Android malware
is growing rapidly. Due to its great threat and damage to mobile phone users, Android malware detection
has become increasingly important in cyber security. Traditional methods like signature-based
ones cannot protect users from the ever increasing sophistication and rapid behavior changes of
new types of Android malware. Therefore, lots of recent efforts have been made to use machine learning
to characterize and discover the malicious behavior patterns of mobile apps for malware detection.
In this paper, we propose a novel and highly reliable machine learning algorithm for Android Malware
detection based on the use of Factorization Machine and the extensive study of Android app features.
We first extract 77 types of features that are highly relevant to malware detection from the manifest
file and source code of each mobile app, including Application Programming Interface (API) calls,
permissions, etc. We have observed that the numerical feature representation of an app usually
forms a long and highly sparse vector, and that the interactions among different features are critical
to revealing some malicious behavior patterns. Based on these observations, we propose to use factorization
machine, which fit the problem the best, as a supervised classifier for malware detection. According
to extensive performance evaluation, our proposed method achieved a test result of 99.01% detection
rate with 0.09% false positive rate on the DREBIN dataset and 99.2% detection rate with only 0.93%
false positive rate on the AMD dataset, significantly outperformed a number of state-of-the-art
machine-learning-based Android malware detection methods as well as commercial antivirus engines.
