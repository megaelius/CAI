Glaucoma is the leading cause of preventable, irreversible blindness world-wide. The disease
can remain asymptomatic until severe, and an estimated 50%-90% of people with glaucoma remain undiagnosed.
Glaucoma screening is recommended for early detection and treatment. A cost-effective tool to
detect glaucoma could expand screening access to a much larger patient population, but such a tool
is currently unavailable. We trained a deep learning algorithm using a retrospective dataset of
86,618 images, assessed for glaucomatous optic nerve head features and referable glaucomatous
optic neuropathy (GON). The algorithm was validated using 3 datasets. For referable GON, the algorithm
had an AUC of 0.945 (95% CI, 0.929-0.960) in dataset A (1205 images, 1 image/patient; 18.1% referable),
images adjudicated by panels of Glaucoma Specialists (GSs); 0.855 (95% CI, 0.841-0.870) in dataset
B (9642 images, 1 image/patient; 9.2% referable), images from Atlanta Veterans Affairs Eye Clinic
diabetic teleretinal screening program; and 0.881 (95% CI, 0.838-0.918) in dataset C (346 images,
1 image/patient; 81.7% referable), images from Dr. Shroff's Charity Eye Hospital's glaucoma clinic.
The algorithm showed significantly higher sensitivity than 7 of 10 graders not involved in determining
the reference standard, including 2 of 3 GSs, and showed higher specificity than 3 graders, while
remaining comparable to others. For both GSs and the algorithm, the most crucial features related
to referable GON were: presence of vertical cup-to-disc ratio of 0.7 or more, neuroretinal rim notching,
retinal nerve fiber layer defect, and bared circumlinear vessels. An algorithm trained on fundus
images alone can detect referable GON with higher sensitivity than and comparable specificity
to eye care providers. The algorithm maintained good performance on an independent dataset with
diagnoses based on a full glaucoma workup.
