In the framework of Granular Computing (GC), Interval type 2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2 FSs) play a prominent
role by facilitating a better representation of uncertain linguistic information. Perceptual
Computing (Per C), a well known computing with words (CWW) approach, and its various applications
have nicely exploited this advantage. This paper reports a novel Per C based approach for student
strategy evaluation. Examinations are generally oriented to test the subject knowledge of students.
The number of questions that they are able to solve accurately judges success rates of students in
the examinations. However, we feel that not only the solutions of questions, but also the strategy
adopted for finding those solutions are equally important. More marks should be awarded to a student,
who solves a question with a better strategy compared to a student, whose strategy is relatively
not that good. Furthermore, the students strategy can be taken as a measure of his or her learning
outcome as perceived by a faculty member. This can help to identify students, whose learning outcomes
are not good, and, thus, can be provided with any relevant help, for improvement. The main contribution
of this paper is to illustrate the use of CWW for student strategy evaluation and present a comparison
of the recommendations generated by different CWW approaches. CWW provides us with two major advantages.
First, it generates a numeric score for the overall evaluation of strategy adopted by a student in
the examination. This enables comparison and ranking of the students based on their performances.
Second, a linguistic evaluation describing the student strategy is also obtained from the system.
Both these numeric score and linguistic recommendation are together used to assess the quality
of a students strategy. We found that Per-C generates unique recommendations in all cases and outperforms
other CWW approaches.
