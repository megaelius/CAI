Purpose: Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) is a quantitative, non-invasive alternative to perfusion
imaging with contrast agents. Fixing values of certain model parameters in traditional ASL, which
actually vary from region to region, may introduce bias in perfusion estimates. Adopting Magnetic
Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) for ASL is an alternative where these parameters are estimated
alongside perfusion, but multiparametric estimation can degrade precision. We aim to improve
the sensitivity of ASL-MRF signals to underlying parameters to counter this problem, and provide
precise estimates. We also propose a regression based estimation framework for MRF-ASL. Methods:
To improve the sensitivity of MRF-ASL signals to underlying parameters, we optimize ASL labeling
durations using the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). This paper also proposes a neural network regression
based estimation framework trained using noisy synthetic signals generated from our ASL signal
model. Results: We test our methods in silico and in vivo, and compare with multiple post labeling
delay (multi-PLD) ASL and unoptimized MRF-ASL. We present comparisons of estimated maps for six
parameters accounted for in our signal model. Conclusions: The scan design process facilitates
precise estimates of multiple hemodynamic parameters and tissue properties from a single scan,
in regions of gray and white matter, as well as regions with anomalous perfusion activity in the brain.
The regression based estimation approach provides perfusion estimates rapidly, and bypasses
problems with quantization error. Keywords: Arterial Spin Labeling, Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting,
