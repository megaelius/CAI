A developmental disorder that severely damages communicative and social functions, the Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also presents aspects related to mental rigidity, repetitive behavior,
and difficulty in abstract reasoning. More, imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory brain
states, in addition to cortical connectivity disruptions, are at the source of the autistic behavior.
Our main goal consists in unveiling the way by which these local excitatory imbalances and/or long
brain connections disruptions are linked to the above mentioned cognitive features. We developed
a theoretical model based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), where a three-level artificial neural
network qualitatively incorporates these kinds of alterations observed in brains of patients
with ASD. Computational simulations of our model indicate that high excitatory states or long distance
under-connectivity are at the origins of cognitive alterations, as difficulty in categorization
and mental rigidity. More specifically, the enlargement of excitatory synaptic reach areas in
a cortical map development conducts to low categorization (over-selectivity) and poor concepts
formation. And, both the over-strengthening of local excitatory synapses and the long distance
under-connectivity, although through distinct mechanisms, contribute to impaired categorization
(under-selectivity) and mental rigidity. Our results indicate how, together, both local and global
brain connectivity alterations give rise to spoiled cortical structures in distinct ways and in
distinct cortical areas. These alterations would disrupt the codification of sensory stimuli,
the representation of concepts and, thus, the process of categorization - by this way imposing serious
limits to the mental flexibility and to the capacity of generalization in the autistic reasoning.
