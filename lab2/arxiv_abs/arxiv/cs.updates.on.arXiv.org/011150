Electric motors are used in many applications and their efficiency is strongly dependent on their
control. Among others, PI approaches or model predictive control methods are well-known in the
scientific literature and industrial practice. A novel approach is to use reinforcement learning
(RL) to have an agent learn electric drive control from scratch merely by interacting with a suitable
control environment. RL achieved remarkable results with super-human performance in many games
(e.g. Atari classics or Go) and also becomes more popular in control tasks like cartpole or swinging
pendulum benchmarks. In this work, the open-source Python package gym-electric-motor (GEM) is
developed for ease of training of RL-agents for electric motor control. Furthermore, this package
can be used to compare the trained agents with other state-of-the-art control approaches. It is
based on the OpenAI Gym framework that provides a widely used interface for the evaluation of RL-agents.
The initial package version covers different DC motor variants and the prevalent permanent magnet
synchronous motor as well as different power electronic converters and a mechanical load model.
Due to the modular setup of the proposed toolbox, additional motor, load, and power electronic devices
can be easily extended in the future. Furthermore, different secondary effects like controller
interlocking time or noise are considered. An intelligent controller example based on the deep
deterministic policy gradient algorithm which controls a series DC motor is presented and compared
to a cascaded PI-controller as a baseline for future research. Fellow researchers are encouraged
to use the framework in their RL investigations or to contribute to the functional scope (e.g. further
motor types) of the package.
