In this work, we initiate the research about the Gathering problem for robots with limited viewing
range in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. In the Gathering problem, a set of initially scattered
robots is required to gather at the same position. The robots' capabilities are very restricted
-- they do not agree on any coordinate system or compass, have a limited viewing range, have no memory
of the past and cannot communicate. We study the problem in two different time models, in FSYNC (fully
synchronized discrete rounds) and the continuous time model. For FSYNC, we introduce the 3D-Go-To-The-Center-strategy
and prove a runtime of $\Theta(n^2)$ that matches the currently best runtime bound for the same model
in the Euclidean plane [SPAA'11]. Our main result is the generalization of contracting strategies
(continuous time) from [Algosensors'17] to three dimensions. In contracting strategies, every
robot that is located on the global convex hull of all robots' positions moves with full speed towards
the inside of the convex hull. We prove a runtime bound of $O(\Delta \cdot n^{3/2})$ for any three-dimensional
contracting strategy, where $\Delta$ denotes the diameter of the initial configuration. This
comes up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ close to the lower bound of $\Omega (\Delta \cdot n)$ which is already
true in two dimensions. In general, it might be hard for robots with limited viewing range to decide
whether they are located on the global convex hull and which movement maintains the connectivity
of the swarm, rendering the design of concrete contracting strategies a challenging task. We prove
that the continuous variant of 3D-Go-To-The-Center is contracting and keeps the swarm connected.
Moreover, we give a simple design criterion for three-dimensional contracting strategies that
maintains the connectivity of the swarm and introduce an exemplary strategy based on this criterion.
