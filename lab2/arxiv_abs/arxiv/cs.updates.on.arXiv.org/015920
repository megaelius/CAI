It has been advocated that medical imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms should be assessed
and optimized by use of objective measures of image quality that quantify the performance of an observer
at specific diagnostic tasks. One important source of variability that can significantly limit
observer performance is variation in the objects to-be-imaged. This source of variability can
be described by stochastic object models (SOMs). A SOM is a generative model that can be employed
to establish an ensemble of to-be-imaged objects with prescribed statistical properties. In order
to accurately model variations in anatomical structures and object textures, it is desirable to
establish SOMs from experimental imaging measurements acquired by use of a well-characterized
imaging system. Deep generative neural networks, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs)
hold great potential for this task. However, conventional GANs are typically trained by use of reconstructed
images that are influenced by the effects of measurement noise and the reconstruction process.
To circumvent this, an AmbientGAN has been proposed that augments a GAN with a measurement operator.
However, the original AmbientGAN could not immediately benefit from modern training procedures,
such as progressive growing, which limited its ability to be applied to realistically sized medical
image data. To circumvent this, in this work, a new Progressive Growing AmbientGAN (ProAmGAN) strategy
is developed for establishing SOMs from medical imaging measurements. Stylized numerical studies
corresponding to common medical imaging modalities are conducted to demonstrate and validate
the proposed method for establishing SOMs.
