Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous success in variety of application domains in the past
few years. This new field of machine learning has been growing rapidly and applied in most of the application
domains with some new modalities of applications, which helps to open new opportunity. There are
different methods have been proposed on different category of learning approaches, which includes
supervised, semi-supervised and un-supervised learning. The experimental results show state-of-the-art
performance of deep learning over traditional machine learning approaches in the field of Image
Processing, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Art, Medical imaging,
Medical information processing, Robotics and control, Bio-informatics, Natural Language Processing
(NLP), Cyber security, and many more. This report presents a brief survey on development of DL approaches,
including Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN) including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Auto-Encoder (AE),
Deep Belief Network (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL). In addition, we have included recent development of proposed advanced variant DL techniques
based on the mentioned DL approaches. Furthermore, DL approaches have explored and evaluated in
different application domains are also included in this survey. We have also comprised recently
developed frameworks, SDKs, and benchmark datasets that are used for implementing and evaluating
deep learning approaches. There are some surveys have published on Deep Learning in Neural Networks
[1, 38] and a survey on RL [234]. However, those papers have not discussed the individual advanced
techniques for training large scale deep learning models and the recently developed method of generative
models [1].
