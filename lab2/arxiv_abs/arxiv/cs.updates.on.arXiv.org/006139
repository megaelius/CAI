Response of breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can be monitored using the change in
visible tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In our current workflow, seed points are manually
placed in areas of enhancement likely to contain cancer. A constrained volume growing method uses
these manually placed seed points as input and generates a tumor segmentation. This method is rigorously
validated using complete pathological embedding. In this study, we propose to exploit deep learning
for fast and automatic seed point detection, replacing manual seed point placement in our existing
and well-validated workflow. The seed point generator was developed in early breast cancer patients
with pathology-proven segmentations (N=100), operated shortly after MRI. It consisted of an ensemble
of three independently trained fully convolutional dilated neural networks that classified breast
voxels as tumor or non-tumor. Subsequently, local maxima were used as seed points for volume growing
in patients receiving NAC (N=10). The percentage of tumor volume change was evaluated against semi-automatic
segmentations. The primary cancer was localized in 95% of the tumors at the cost of 0.9 false positive
per patient. False positives included focally enhancing regions of unknown origin and parts of
the intramammary blood vessels. Volume growing from the seed points showed a median tumor volume
decrease of 70% (interquartile range: 50%-77%), comparable to the semi-automatic segmentations
(median: 70%, interquartile range 23%-76%). To conclude, a fast and automatic seed point generator
was developed, fully automating a well-validated semi-automatic workflow for response monitoring
of breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
