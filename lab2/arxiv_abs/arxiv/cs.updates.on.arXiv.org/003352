As blockchain systems proliferate, there remains an unresolved scalability problem of their underlying
distributed consensus protocols. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols offer
high transaction throughput, but can only support small networks. Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus
protocol, on the other hand, can support thousands of nodes, but at the expense of poor transaction
throughput. Two potential approaches to address these scalability barriers are by relaxing the
threat model, or employing sharding technique to deal with large networks. Nonetheless, their
effectiveness against data-intensive blockchain workloads remains to be seen. In this work, we
study the use and effectiveness of trusted hardware on scaling distributed consensus protocols,
and by their extension, blockchain systems. We first analyze existing approaches that harness
trusted hardware to enhances scalability, and identify their limitations. Drawing insights from
these results, we propose two design principles, namely scale up by scaling down and prioritize
consensus messages, that enable the consensus protocols to scale. We illustrate the two principles
by presenting optimizations that improve upon state-of-the-art solutions, and demonstrate via
our extensive evaluations that they indeed offer better scalability. In particular, integrating
our optimizations into Hyperledger Fabric achieves up to 7x higher throughput, while enabling
the system to remain operational as the network size increases. Another optimization that we introduce
to Hyperledger Sawtooth allows the system to sustain high throughput as the network grows. Finally,
our new design for sharding protocols reduces the cost of shard creation phase by upto 35x.
