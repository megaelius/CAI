A distributed secret sharing system is considered that consists of a dealer, $n$ storage nodes,
and $m$ users. Each user is given access to a certain subset of storage nodes where it can download
the data. The dealer wants to securely convey a specific secret $s_j$ to user $j$ via storage nodes,
for $j=1,2,\dots,m$, in such a way that no user gets any information about other users' secrets in
an information-theoretic sense. To this end, we propose to study protocols where the dealer encodes
secrets into several secret shares and loads them into the storage nodes. Given a certain number
of storage nodes we find the maximum number of users that can be served in such protocols and construct
schemes that achieve this. We further define two major properties for such distributed secret sharing
systems; \emph{communication complexity} is defined as the total amount of data that needs to be
downloaded by users in order to reconstruct their secrets; and \emph{storage overhead} is defined
as the total amount of data loaded by the dealer into the storage nodes normalized by the total size
of secrets. Lower bounds on minimum communication complexity and storage overhead are characterized
given any $n$ and $m$. Furthermore, we construct distributed secret sharing protocols, under certain
conditions on the system parameters, that attain these lower bounds thereby providing schemes
that are optimal in terms of both the communication complexity and storage overhead. It is shown
how to modify the proposed protocols in order to construct schemes for any set of parameters while
providing a \emph{nearly optimal} storage overhead.
