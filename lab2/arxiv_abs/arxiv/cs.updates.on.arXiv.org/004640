Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of cooperative principle on the information
quality (IQ) by making objects more relevant for consumer needs, in particular case Wikipedia articles
for students. Design/methodology/approach: The authors performed a quantitative study with
participants being invited to complete an online survey. Each rater evaluated three selected and
re-written articles from Wikipedia by four IQ dimensions (accuracy, completeness, objectivity,
and representation). Grice's maxims and submaxims were used to re-write articles and make them
more relevant for student cognitive needs. The results were analyzed with statistical methods
of mean, standard deviation, Cronbach's alpha, and ICC (two-way random model of single measure).
Findings: The study demonstrates that Wikipedia articles can be made more relevant for student
needs by using cooperative principle with increase in IQ and also achieving higher consistency
of students' scores as recent research. In particular, students in the research perceived the abstract,
constructed with cooperative principle, more objective and complete as reported in recent research.
Practical implications: The work can benefit encyclopedia editors to improve IQ of existing articles
as well as consumers that would obtain more relevant information in less reading time. Originality/value:
This is one of the first attempts to empirically investigate the application of cooperate principle
to make objects more relevant for consumer needs and impact of this on IQ. IQ improvement evidence
is provided and impacts on IQ dimensions such as objectivity, completeness, accuracy, and representation
for research community to validate and compare results.
