This work aims to identify/bridge the gap between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Healthcare
sides in Japan towards developing medical AI fitting into a clinical environment in five years.
Moreover, we attempt to confirm the clinical relevance for diagnosis of our research-proven pathology-aware
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based medical image augmentation: a data wrangling and
information conversion technique to address data paucity. We hold a clinically valuable AI-envisioning
workshop among 2 Medical Imaging experts, 2 physicians, and 3 Healthcare/Informatics generalists.
A qualitative/quantitative questionnaire survey for 3 project-related physicians and 6 project
non-related radiologists evaluates the GAN projects in terms of Data Augmentation (DA) and physician
training. The workshop reveals the intrinsic gap between AI/Healthcare sides and its preliminary
solutions on Why (i.e., clinical significance/interpretation) and How (i.e., data acquisition,
commercial deployment, and safety/feeling safe). The survey confirms our pathology-aware GANs'
clinical relevance as a clinical decision support system and non-expert physician training tool.
Radiologists generally have high expectations for AI-based diagnosis as a reliable second opinion
and abnormal candidate detection, instead of replacing them. Our findings would play a key role
in connecting inter-disciplinary research and clinical applications, not limited to the Japanese
medical context and pathology-aware GANs. We find that better DA and expert physician training
would require atypical image generation via further GAN-based extrapolation.
