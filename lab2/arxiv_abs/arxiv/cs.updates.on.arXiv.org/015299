Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is a $\text{2-D}$ modulation technique that has the potential
to overcome the challenges faced by orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in high
Doppler environments. The performance of OTFS in a multi-user scenario with orthogonal multiple
access (OMA) techniques has been impressive. Due to the requirement of massive connectivity in
5G and beyond, it is immensely essential to devise and examine the OTFS system with the existing Non-orthogonal
Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques. In this paper, we propose a multi-user OTFS system based on a
code-domain NOMA technique called Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA). This system is referred
to as the OTFS-SCMA model. The framework for OTFS-SCMA is designed for both downlink and uplink.
First, the sparse SCMA codewords are strategically placed on the delay-Doppler plane such that
the overall overloading factor of the OTFS-SCMA system is equal to that of the underlying basic SCMA
system. The receiver in downlink performs the detection in two sequential phases: first, the conventional
OTFS detection using the method of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), and then the conventional
SCMA detection. For uplink, we propose a single-phase detector based on message-passing algorithm
(MPA) to detect the multiple users' symbols. The performance of the proposed OTFS-SCMA system is
validated through extensive simulations both in downlink and uplink. We consider delay-Doppler
planes of different parameters and various SCMA systems of overloading factor up to 200$\%$. The
performance of OTFS-SCMA is compared with those of existing OTFS-OMA techniques. The comprehensive
investigation demonstrates the usefulness of OTFS-SCMA in future wireless communication standards.
