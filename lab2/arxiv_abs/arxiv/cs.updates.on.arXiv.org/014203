In this work, we present a memory-efficient fully convolutional network (FCN) incorporated with
several memory-optimized techniques to reduce the run-time GPU memory demand during training
phase. In medical image segmentation tasks, subvolume cropping has become a common preprocessing.
Subvolumes (or small patch volumes) were cropped to reduce GPU memory demand. However, small patch
volumes capture less spatial context that leads to lower accuracy. As a pilot study, the purpose
of this work is to propose a memory-efficient FCN which enables us to train the model on full size CT
image directly without subvolume cropping, while maintaining the segmentation accuracy. We optimize
our network from both architecture and implementation. With the development of computing hardware,
such as graphics processing unit (GPU) and tensor processing unit (TPU), now deep learning applications
is able to train networks with large datasets within acceptable time. Among these applications,
semantic segmentation using fully convolutional network (FCN) also has gained a significant improvement
against traditional image processing approaches in both computer vision and medical image processing
fields. However, unlike general color images used in computer vision tasks, medical images have
larger scales than color images such as 3D computed tomography (CT) images, micro CT images, and
histopathological images. For training these medical images, the large demand of computing resource
become a severe problem. In this paper, we present a memory-efficient FCN to tackle the high GPU memory
demand challenge in organ segmentation problem from clinical CT images. The experimental results
demonstrated that our GPU memory demand is about 40% of baseline architecture, parameter amount
is about 30% of the baseline.
