The University of the East Web Portal is an academic, web based system that provides educational
electronic materials and e-learning services. To fully optimize its usage, it is imperative to
determine the factors that relate to its usage. Thus, this study, to determine the computer self-efficacy
of the faculty members of the University of the East and its relationship with their web portal usage,
was conceived. Using a validated questionnaire, the profile of the respondents, their computer
self-efficacy, and web portal usage were gathered. Data showed that the respondents were relatively
young (M = 40 years old), majority had masters degree (f = 85, 72%), most had been using the web portal
for four semesters (f = 60, 51%), and the large part were intermediate web portal users (f = 69, 59%).
They were highly skilled in using the computer (M = 4.29) and skilled in using the Internet (M = 4.28).
E-learning services (M = 3.29) and online library resources (M = 3.12) were only used occasionally.
Pearson correlation revealed that age was positively correlated with online library resources
(r = 0.267, p < 0.05) and a negative relationship existed between perceived skill level in using the
portal and online library resources usage (r = -0.206, p < 0.05). A 2x2 chi square revealed that the
highest educational attainment had a significant relationship with online library resources
(chi square = 5.489, df = 1, p < 0.05). Basic computer (r = 0.196, p < 0.05) and Internet skills (r = 0.303,
p < 0.05) were significantly and positively related with e-learning services usage but not with
online library resources usage. Other individual factors such as attitudes towards the web portal
and anxiety towards using the web portal can be investigated.
