We have witnessed an exponential growth in commercial data services, which has lead to the 'big data
era'. Machine learning, as one of the most promising artificial intelligence tools of analyzing
the deluge of data, has been invoked in many research areas both in academia and industry. The aim
of this article is twin-fold. Firstly, we briefly review big data analysis and machine learning,
along with their potential applications in next-generation wireless networks. The second goal
is to invoke big data analysis to predict the requirements of mobile users and to exploit it for improving
the performance of "social network-aware wireless". More particularly, a unified big data aided
machine learning framework is proposed, which consists of feature extraction, data modeling and
prediction/online refinement. The main benefits of the proposed framework are that by relying
on big data which reflects both the spectral and other challenging requirements of the users, we
can refine the motivation, problem formulations and methodology of powerful machine learning
algorithms in the context of wireless networks. In order to characterize the efficiency of the proposed
framework, a pair of intelligent practical applications are provided as case studies: 1) To predict
the positioning of drone-mounted areal base stations (BSs) according to the specific tele-traffic
requirements by gleaning valuable data from social networks. 2) To predict the content caching
requirements of BSs according to the users' preferences by mining data from social networks. Finally,
open research opportunities are identified for motivating future investigations.
