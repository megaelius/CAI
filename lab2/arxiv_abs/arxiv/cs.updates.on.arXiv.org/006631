We consider a scenario involving computations over a massive dataset stored distributedly across
multiple workers, which is at the core of distributed learning algorithms. We propose Lagrange
Coded Computing (LCC), a new framework to simultaneously provide (1) resiliency against stragglers
that may prolong computations; (2) security against Byzantine (or malicious) workers that deliberately
modify the computation for their benefit; and (3) (information-theoretic) privacy of the dataset
amidst possible collusion of workers. LCC, which leverages the well-known Lagrange polynomial
to create computation redundancy in a novel coded form across workers, can be applied to any computation
scenario in which the function of interest is an arbitrary multivariate polynomial of the input
dataset, hence covering many computations of interest in machine learning. LCC significantly
generalizes prior works to go beyond linear computations. It also enables secure and private computing
in distributed settings, improving the computation and communication efficiency of the state-of-the-art.
Furthermore, we prove the optimality of LCC by showing that it achieves the optimal tradeoff between
resiliency, security, and privacy, i.e., in terms of tolerating the maximum number of stragglers
and adversaries, and providing data privacy against the maximum number of colluding workers. Finally,
we show via experiments on Amazon EC2 that LCC speeds up the conventional uncoded implementation
of distributed least-squares linear regression by up to $13.43\times$, and also achieves a $2.36\times$-$12.65\times$
speedup over the state-of-the-art straggler mitigation strategies.
