Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the non-invasive modality of choice for body tissue composition
analysis due to its excellent soft tissue contrast and lack of ionizing radiation. However, quantification
of body composition requires an accurate segmentation of fat, muscle and other tissues from MR images,
which remains a challenging goal due to the intensity overlap between them. In this study, we propose
a fully automated, data-driven image segmentation platform that addresses multiple difficulties
in segmenting MR images such as varying inhomogeneity, non-standardness, and noise, while producing
high-quality definition of different tissues. In contrast to most approaches in the literature,
we perform segmentation operation by combining three different MRI contrasts and a novel segmentation
tool which takes into account variability in the data. The proposed system, based on a novel affinity
definition within the fuzzy connectivity (FC) image segmentation family, prevents the need for
user intervention and reparametrization of the segmentation algorithms. In order to make the whole
system fully automated, we adapt an affinity propagation clustering algorithm to roughly identify
tissue regions and image background. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed algorithm's
individual steps as well as comparison with several approaches from the literature for the main
application of muscle/fat separation. Furthermore, whole-body tissue composition and brain
tissue delineation were conducted to show the generalization ability of the proposed system. This
new automated platform outperforms other state-of-the-art segmentation approaches both in accuracy
and efficiency.
