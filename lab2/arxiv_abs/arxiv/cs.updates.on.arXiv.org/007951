Objective: After years of research, Twitter posts are now recognized as an important source of patient-generated
data, providing unique insights into population health. A fundamental step to incorporating Twitter
data in pharmacoepidemiological research is to automatically recognize medication mentions
in tweets. Given that lexical searches for medication names may fail due to misspellings or ambiguity
with common words, we propose a more advanced method to recognize them. Methods: We present Kusuri,
an Ensemble Learning classifier, able to identify tweets mentioning drug products and dietary
supplements. Kusuri ("medication" in Japanese) is composed of two modules. First, four different
classifiers (lexicon-based, spelling-variant-based, pattern-based and one based on a weakly-trained
neural network) are applied in parallel to discover tweets potentially containing medication
names. Second, an ensemble of deep neural networks encoding morphological, semantical and long-range
dependencies of important words in the tweets discovered is used to make the final decision. Results:
On a balanced (50-50) corpus of 15,005 tweets, Kusuri demonstrated performances close to human
annotators with 93.7% F1-score, the best score achieved thus far on this corpus. On a corpus made
of all tweets posted by 113 Twitter users (98,959 tweets, with only 0.26% mentioning medications),
Kusuri obtained 76.3% F1-score. There is not a prior drug extraction system that compares running
on such an extremely unbalanced dataset. Conclusion: The system identifies tweets mentioning
drug names with performance high enough to ensure its usefulness and ready to be integrated in larger
natural language processing systems.
