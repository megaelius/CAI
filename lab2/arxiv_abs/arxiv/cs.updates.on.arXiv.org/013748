We embed a spiking cerebellar model within an adaptive real-time (RT) control loop that is able to
operate a real robotic body (iCub) when performing different vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) tasks.
The spiking neural network computation, including event- and time-driven neural dynamics, neural
activity, and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms, leads to a nondeterministic
computation time caused by the neural activity volleys encountered during cerebellar simulation.
This nondeterministic computation time motivates the integration of an RT supervisor module that
is able to ensure a well-orchestrated neural computation time and robot operation. Actually, our
neurorobotic experimental setup (VOR) benefits from the biological sensory motor delay between
the cerebellum and the body to buffer the computational overloads as well as providing flexibility
in adjusting the neural computation time and RT operation. The RT supervisor module provides for
incremental countermeasures that dynamically slow down or speed up the cerebellar simulation
by either halting the simulation or disabling certain neural computation features (i.e., STDP
mechanisms, spike propagation, and neural updates) to cope with the RT constraints imposed by the
real robot operation. This neurorobotic experimental setup is applied to different horizontal
and vertical VOR adaptive tasks that are widely used by the neuroscientific community to address
cerebellar functioning. We aim to elucidate the manner in which the combination of the cerebellar
neural substrate and the distributed plasticity shapes the cerebellar neural activity to mediate
motor adaptation. This paper underlies the need for a two-stage learning process to facilitate
VOR acquisition.
