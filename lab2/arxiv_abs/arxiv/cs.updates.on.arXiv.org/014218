Accurate segmentation of connective soft tissues is still a challenging task, which hinders the
generation of corresponding geometric models for biomechanical computations. Alternatively,
one could predict ligament insertion sites and then approximate the shapes, based on anatomical
knowledge and morphological studies. Here, we describe a corresponding integrated framework
for the automatic modelling of human musculoskeletal ligaments. We combine statistical shape
modelling with geometric algorithms to automatically identify insertion sites, based on which
geometric surface and volume meshes are created. For demonstrating a clinical use case, the framework
has been applied to generate models of the interosseous membrane in the forearm. For the adoption
to the forearm anatomy, ligament insertion sites in the statistical model were defined according
to anatomical predictions following an approach proposed in prior work. For evaluation we compared
the generated sites, as well as the ligament shapes, to data obtained from a cadaveric study, involving
five forearms with a total of 15 ligaments. Our framework permitted the creation of 3D models approximating
ligaments' shapes with good fidelity. However, we found that the statistical model trained with
the state-of-the-art prediction of the insertion sites was not always reliable. Using that model,
average mean square errors as well as Hausdorff distances of the meshes increased by more than one
order of magnitude, as compared to employing the known insertion locations of the cadaveric study.
Using the latter an average mean square error of 0.59 mm and an average Hausdorff distance of less
than 7 mm resulted, for the complete set of ligaments. In conclusion, the presented approach for
generating ligament shapes from insertion points appears to be feasible but the detection of the
insertion sites with a SSM is too inaccurate.
