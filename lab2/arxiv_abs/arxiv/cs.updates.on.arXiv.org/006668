Mobile and general-purpose robots increasingly support our everyday life, requiring dependable
robotics control software. Creating such software mainly amounts to implementing their complex
behaviors known as missions. Recognizing the need, a large number of domain-specific specification
languages has been proposed. These, in addition to traditional logical languages, allow the use
of formally specified missions for synthesis, verification, simulation, or guiding the implementation.
For instance, the logical language LTL is commonly used by experts to specify missions, as an input
for planners, which synthesize the behavior a robot should have. Unfortunately, domain-specific
languages are usually tied to specific robot models, while logical languages such as LTL are difficult
to use by non-experts. We present a catalog of 22 mission specification patterns for mobile robots,
together with tooling for instantiating, composing, and compiling the patterns to create mission
specifications. The patterns provide solutions for recurrent specification problems, each of
which detailing the usage intent, known uses, relationships to other patterns, and---most importantly---a
template mission specification in temporal logic. Our tooling produces specifications expressed
in the LTL and CTL temporal logics to be used by planners, simulators, or model checkers. The patterns
originate from 245 realistic textual mission requirements extracted from the robotics literature,
and they are evaluated upon a total of 441 real-world mission requirements and 1251 mission specifications.
Five of these reflect scenarios we defined with two well-known industrial partners developing
human-size robots. We validated our patterns' correctness with simulators and two real robots.
