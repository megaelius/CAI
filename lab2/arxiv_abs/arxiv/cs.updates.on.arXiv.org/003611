Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) is the application of optimization algorithms to problems
in software testing. In previous work, we have implemented and evaluated Interactive Search-Based
Software Testing (ISBST) tool prototypes, with a goal to successfully transfer the technique to
industry. While SBSE solutions are often validated on benchmark problems, there is a need to validate
them in an operational setting. The present paper discusses the development and deployment of SBST
tools for use in industry and reflects on the transfer of these techniques to industry. In addition
to previous work discussing the development and validation of an ISBST prototype, a new version
of the prototype ISBST system was evaluated in the laboratory and in industry. This evaluation is
based on an industrial System under Test (SUT) and was carried out with industrial practitioners.
The Technology Transfer Model is used as a framework to describe the progression of the development
and evaluation of the ISBST system. The paper presents a synthesis of previous work developing and
evaluating the ISBST prototype, as well as presenting an evaluation, in both academia and industry,
of that prototype's latest version. This paper presents an overview of the development and deployment
of the ISBST system in an industrial setting, using the framework of the Technology Transfer Model.
We conclude that the ISBST system is capable of evolving useful test cases for that setting, though
improvements in the means the system uses to communicate that information to the user are still required.
In addition, a set of lessons learned from the project are listed and discussed. Our objective is
to help other researchers that wish to validate search-based systems in industry and provide more
information about the benefits and drawbacks of these systems.
