For image recognition, an extensive number of methods have been proposed to overcome the high-dimensionality
problem of feature vectors being used. These methods vary from unsupervised to supervised, and
from statistics to graph-theory based. In this paper, the most popular and the state-of-the-art
methods for dimensionality reduction are firstly reviewed, and then a new and more efficient manifold-learning
method, named Soft Locality Preserving Map (SLPM), is presented. Furthermore, feature generation
and sample selection are proposed to achieve better manifold learning. SLPM is a graph-based subspace-learning
method, with the use of k-neighbourhood information and the class information. The key feature
of SLPM is that it aims to control the level of spread of the different classes, because the spread
of the classes in the underlying manifold is closely connected to the generalizability of the learned
subspace. Our proposed manifold-learning method can be applied to various pattern recognition
applications, and we evaluate its performances on facial expression recognition. Experiments
on databases, such as the Bahcesehir University Multilingual Affective Face Database (BAUM-2),
the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) Database, the Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) Database,
and the Taiwanese Facial Expression Image Database (TFEID), show that SLPM can effectively reduce
the dimensionality of the feature vectors and enhance the discriminative power of the extracted
features for expression recognition. Furthermore, the proposed feature-generation method can
improve the generalizability of the underlying manifolds for facial expression recognition.
