Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an emerging concept that is believed to help realise the vision of intelligent
transportation systems (ITS). IoV has become an important research area of impactful applications
in recent years due to the rapid advancements in vehicular technologies, high throughput satellite
communication, Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems. IoV enables the integration of
smart vehicles with the Internet and system components attributing to their environment such as
public infrastructures, sensors, computing nodes, pedestrians and other vehicles. By allowing
the development of a common information exchange platform between vehicles and heterogeneous
vehicular networks, this integration aims to create a better environment and public space to the
people as well as to enhance safety for all road users. Being a participatory data exchange and storage,
the underlying information exchange platform of IoV needs to be secure, transparent and immutable
in order to achieve the intended objectives of ITS. In this connection, the adoption of blockchain
as a system platform for supporting the information exchange needs of IoV has been explored. Due
to their decentralized and immutable nature, IoV applications enabled by blockchain are believed
to have a number of desirable properties such as decentralization, security, transparency, immutability,
and automation. In this paper, we present a contemporary survey on the latest advancement in blockchain
for IoV. Particularly, we highlight the different application scenarios of IoV after carefully
reviewing the recent literatures. We also identify several key challenges where blockchain is
applied in IoV, and describe the related works addressing these challenges. Furthermore, we investigate
the future opportunities and explore further research directions of IoV as a key enabler of ITS.
