We consider the problem of maximizing aggregate user utilities over a multi-hop network, subject
to link capacity constraints, maximum end-to-end delay constraints, and user throughput requirements.
A user's utility is an arbitrary function of the achieved throughput or the experienced maximum
delay. The problem is important for supporting real-time multimedia traffic, and is uniquely challenging
due to the need of simultaneously considering maximum delay constraints and throughput requirements.
We first show that it is even NP-complete (i) to construct a feasible solution meeting all constraints,
or (ii) to obtain an optimal solution that meets relaxed constraints. We then develop the first polynomial-time
approximation algorithm named PASS. Our algorithm design leverages a novel understanding between
non-convex maximum-delay-aware problems and their convex average-delay-aware counterparts,
which can be of independent interest and suggest a new avenue for solving maximum-delay-aware network
optimization problems. Under realistic conditions, theoretically PASS provides constant or
problem-dependent approximation ratios, at the cost of violating maximum delay constraints or
throughput requirements up to constant or problem-dependent ratios. PASS is practically useful
since the conditions for PASS are satisfied in many popular application scenarios. We empirically
evaluate PASS using extensive simulations of supporting video-conferencing traffic across Amazon
EC2 datacenters. Compared to existing algorithms and a conceivable baseline, PASS can obtain up
to $100\%$ improvement of utilities, meeting throughput requirements but relaxed maximum delay
constraints that are acceptable for practical video conferencing applications.
