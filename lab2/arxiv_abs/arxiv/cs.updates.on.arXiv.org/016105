Network Creation Games are a well-known approach for explaining and analyzing the structure, quality
and dynamics of real-world networks like the Internet and other infrastructure networks which
evolved via the interaction of selfish agents without a central authority. In these games selfish
agents which correspond to nodes in a network strategically buy incident edges to improve their
centrality. However, past research on these games has only considered the creation of networks
with unit-weight edges. In practice, e.g. when constructing a fiber-optic network, the choice
of which nodes to connect and also the induced price for a link crucially depends on the distance between
the involved nodes and such settings can be modeled via edge-weighted graphs. We incorporate arbitrary
edge weights by generalizing the well-known model by Fabrikant et al.[PODC'03] to edge-weighted
host graphs and focus on the geometric setting where the weights are induced by the distances in some
metric space. In stark contrast to the state-of-the-art for the unit-weight version, where the
Price of Anarchy is conjectured to be constant and where resolving this is a major open problem, we
prove a tight non-constant bound on the Price of Anarchy for the metric version and a slightly weaker
upper bound for the non-metric case. Moreover, we analyze the existence of equilibria, the computational
hardness and the game dynamics for several natural metrics. The model we propose can be seen as the
game-theoretic analogue of a variant of the classical Network Design Problem. Thus, low-cost equilibria
of our game correspond to decentralized and stable approximations of the optimum network design.
