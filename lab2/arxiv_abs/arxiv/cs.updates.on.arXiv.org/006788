Molecular Communications (MC) is a bio-inspired communication technique that uses molecules
as a means of information transfer among nanoscale devices. As discrete molecules, i.e., ligands,
are the carriers of information in MC, the distinct ligand types co-existing in the channel can be
considered to have unique carrier frequencies, governing their reaction dynamics with the ligand
receptors of the nanomachines. Sensing the dynamic molecular spectrum, i.e., multiplexed detection
of the concentration of multiple ligand types of similar properties co-existing in the MC channel,
provides opportunities for eliminating molecular interference resulting from external sources
in crowded physiological environments, and multi-user interference (MUI) in nanonetworks, and
adopting cognitive radio techniques for medium access in MC. In this paper, we develop a practical
and low-complexity spectrum sensing method that can simultaneously estimate the individual concentrations
of multiple types of ligands with single type of receptors by exploiting the amount of time the receptors
stay bound and unbound in ligand-receptor binding reaction. We analyze its performance in terms
of normalized mean squared error (NMSE) for varying number of co-existing ligand types, number
of samples, similarity between ligands, and ligand concentration distribution, and show that
it is possible to estimate the concentration of ligands up to $10$ different types with an average
NMSE far below $10^{-2}$. Additionally, for the transduction of receptor unbound and bound time
durations into intracellular molecular signals for further processing, we propose a synthetic
receptor design based on modified kinetic proofreading (KPR) scheme. Lastly, we discuss the implementation
challenges of the estimator in engineered bacteria with synthetic analog computation tools in
living cells.
