Regenerating codes are efficient methods for distributed storage in storage networks, where node
failures are common. They guarantee low cost data reconstruction and repair through accessing
only a predefined number of arbitrarily chosen storage nodes in the network. In this work we consider
two simultaneous extensions to the original regenerating codes framework introduced in [1]; i)
both data reconstruction and repair are resilient to the presence of a certain number of erroneous
nodes in the network and ii) the number of helper nodes in every repair is not fixed, but is a flexible
parameter that can be selected during the runtime. We study the fundamental limits of required total
repair bandwidth and provide an upper bound for the storage capacity of these codes under these assumptions.
We then focus on the minimum repair bandwidth (MBR) case and derive the exact storage capacity by
presenting explicit coding schemes with exact repair, which achieve the upper bound of the storage
capacity in the considered setup. To this end, we first provide a more natural extension of the well-known
Product Matrix (PM) MBR codes [2], modified to provide flexibility in the choice of number of helpers
in each repair, and simultaneously be robust to erroneous nodes in the network. This is achieved
by proving the non-singularity of family of matrices in large enough finite fields. We next provide
another extension of the PM codes, based on novel repair schemes which enable flexibility in the
number of helpers and robustness against erroneous nodes without any extra cost in field size compared
to the original PM codes.
