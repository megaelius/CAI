Frequency-domain electromagnetic instruments allow the collection of data in different configurations,
that is, varying the inter-coil spacing, the frequency, and the height above the ground. This makes
these tools very practical, also because of their handy size, for the characterization of the near
surface in many fields of applications, for example, precision agriculture, pollution assessments,
shallow geological investigations. To this end, the inversion of either the real (in-phase) or
the imaginary (quadrature) component of the signal has already been studied. Furthermore, in many
situations a regularization scheme retrieving smooth solutions is blindly applied, without taking
into account the prior available knowledge.. The present work discusses an algorithm for the inversion
of the complex signal in its entirety, as well as a regularization method promoting the sparsity
of the reconstructed electrical conductivity distribution. This regularization strategy incorporates
a minimum gradient support stabilizer into a truncated generalized singular value decomposition
scheme. The results of the implementation of this sparsity enhancing regularization at each step
of a damped Gauss--Newton inversion algorithm (based on a nonlinear forward model) are compared
against the associated solutions obtained via a standard smooth stabilizer. An approach to estimate
the depth of investigation (DOI), that is, the maximum depth that can be investigated by a chosen
instrument configuration in a particular experimental setting, is also discussed. The effectiveness
and limitations of the whole inversion algorithm are demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets.
