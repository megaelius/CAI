Meta distribution is a fine-grained unified performance metric that enables us to evaluate the
{reliability and latency} of next generation wireless networks, in addition to the conventional
coverage probability. In this paper, using stochastic geometry tools, we develop a systematic
framework to characterize the meta distributions of the downlink signal-to-interference-ratio
(SIR)/signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and data rate of a typical device in a cellular network with
coexisting sub-6GHz and millimeter wave (mm-wave) spectrums. Macro base-stations (MBSs) transmit
on sub-6GHz channels (which we term "microwave" channels), whereas small base-stations (SBSs)
communicate with devices on mm-wave channels. The SBSs are connected to MBSs via a microwave ($\mu$wave)
wireless backhaul. The $\mu$wave channels are interference limited and mm-wave channels are noise
limited; therefore, we have the meta-distribution of SIR and SNR in $\mu$wave and mm-wave channels,
respectively. To model the line-of-sight (LOS) nature of mm-wave channels, we use Nakagami-m fading
model. To derive the meta-distribution of SIR/SNR, we characterize the conditional success probability
(CSP) (or equivalently reliability) and its $b^{\mathrm{th}}$ moment for a typical device (a)
when it associates to a $\mu$wave MBS for {\em direct} transmission, and (b) when it associates to
a mm-wave SBS for {\em dual-hop} transmission (backhaul and access transmission). Performance
metrics such as the mean and variance of the local delay (network jitter), mean of the CSP (coverage
probability), and variance of the CSP are derived. Numerical results validate the analytical results.
Insights are extracted related to the reliability, coverage probability, and latency of the considered
network.
