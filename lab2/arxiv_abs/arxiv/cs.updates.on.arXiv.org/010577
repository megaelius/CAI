The stability of social relationships is important to animals living in groups, and social network
analysis provides a powerful tool to help characterize and understand their (in)stability and
the consequences at the group level. However, the use of dynamic social networks is still limited
in this context as it requires long-term social data and new analytical tools. Here, we study the
dynamic evolution of a group of 29 Guinea baboons using a dataset of automatically collected cognitive
tests comprising more than 16M records collected over 3 years. We first built a monthly aggregated
temporal network describing the baboon's co-presence in the cognitive testing booths. We then
used a null model, considering the heterogeneity in the baboons' activity, to define both positive
(association) and negative (avoidance) monthly networks. We tested social balance theory by combining
these positive and negative social networks. The results showed that the networks were structurally
balanced and that newly created edges also tended to preserve social balance. We investigated several
network metrics to gain insights into the individual level and group level social networks long-term
temporal evolution. A measure of similarity between successive monthly networks was able to pinpoint
periods of stability and instability and to show how some baboons' ego-networks remained stable
while others changed radically. Our study confirms the prediction of social balance theory but
also shows that large fluctuations in the numbers of triads may limit its applicability to study
the dynamic evolution of animal social networks. In contrast, the use of the similarity measure
proved to be very versatile and sensitive in detecting relationships' (in)stabilities at different
levels. The changes we identified can be linked, at least in some cases, to females changing primary
male, as observed in the wild.
