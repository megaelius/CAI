Voluntary employee turnover incurs significant direct and indirect financial costs to organizations
of all sizes. A large proportion of voluntary turnover includes people who frequently move from
job to job, known as job-hopping. The ability to discover an applicant's likelihood towards job-hopping
can help organizations make informed hiring decisions benefiting both parties. In this work, we
show that the language one uses when responding to interview questions related to situational judgment
and past behaviour is predictive of their likelihood to job hop. We used responses from over 45,000
job applicants who completed an online chat interview and also self-rated themselves on a job-hopping
motive scale to analyse the correlation between the two. We evaluated five different methods of
text representation, namely four open-vocabulary approaches (TF-IDF, LDA, Glove word embeddings
and Doc2Vec document embeddings) and one closed-vocabulary approach (LIWC). The Glove embeddings
provided the best results with a positive correlation of r=0.35 between sequences of words used
and the job-hopping likelihood. With further analysis, we also found that there is a positive correlation
of r=0.25 between job-hopping likelihood and the HEXACO personality trait Openness to experience.
In other words, the more open a candidate is to new experiences, the more likely they are to job hop.
The ability to objectively infer a candidate's likelihood towards job hopping presents significant
opportunities, especially when assessing candidates with no prior work history. On the other hand,
experienced candidates who come across as job hoppers, based purely on their resume, get an opportunity
to indicate otherwise.
