While deep learning is successful in a number of applications, it is not yet well understood theoretically.
A satisfactory theoretical characterization of deep learning however, is beginning to emerge.
It covers the following questions: 1) representation power of deep networks 2) optimization of
the empirical risk 3) generalization properties of gradient descent techniques --- why the expected
error does not suffer, despite the absence of explicit regularization, when the networks are overparametrized?
In this review we discuss recent advances in the three areas. In approximation theory both shallow
and deep networks have been shown to approximate any continuous functions on a bounded domain at
the expense of an exponential number of parameters (exponential in the dimensionality of the function).
However, for a subset of compositional functions, deep networks of the convolutional type can have
a linear dependence on dimensionality, unlike shallow networks. In optimization we discuss the
loss landscape for the exponential loss function and show that stochastic gradient descent will
find with high probability the global minima. To address the question of generalization for classification
tasks, we use classical uniform convergence results to justify minimizing a surrogate exponential-type
loss function under a unit norm constraint on the weight matrix at each layer -- since the interesting
variables for classification are the weight directions rather than the weights. Our approach,
which is supported by several independent new results, offers a solution to the puzzle about generalization
performance of deep overparametrized ReLU networks, uncovering the origin of the underlying hidden
complexity control.
