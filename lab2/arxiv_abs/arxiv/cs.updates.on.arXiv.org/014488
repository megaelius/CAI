Motivation: Many researchers with domain expertise are unable to easily apply machine learning
to their bioinformatics data due to a lack of machine learning and/or coding expertise. Methods
that have been proposed thus far to automate machine learning mostly require programming experience
as well as expert knowledge to tune and apply the algorithms correctly. Here, we study a method of
automating biomedical data science using a web-based platform that uses AI to recommend model choices
and conduct experiments. We have two goals in mind: first, to make it easy to construct sophisticated
models of biomedical processes; and second, to provide a fully automated AI agent that can choose
and conduct promising experiments for the user, based on the user's experiments as well as prior
knowledge. To validate this framework, we experiment with hundreds of classification problems,
comparing to state-of-the-art, automated approaches. Finally, we use this tool to develop predictive
models of septic shock in critical care patients. Results: We find that matrix factorization-based
recommendation systems outperform meta-learning methods for automating machine learning. This
result mirrors the results of earlier recommender systems research in other domains. The proposed
AI is competitive with state-of-the-art automated machine learning methods in terms of choosing
optimal algorithm configurations for datasets. In our application to prediction of septic shock,
the AI-driven analysis produces a competent machine learning model (AUROC 0.85 +/- 0.02) that performs
on par with state-of-the-art deep learning results for this task, with much less computational
effort.
