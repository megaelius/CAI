In multi-agent domains (MADs), an agent's action may not just change the world and the agent's knowledge
and beliefs about the world, but also may change other agents' knowledge and beliefs about the world
and their knowledge and beliefs about other agents' knowledge and beliefs about the world. The goals
of an agent in a multi-agent world may involve manipulating the knowledge and beliefs of other agents'
and again, not just their knowledge/belief about the world, but also their knowledge about other
agents' knowledge about the world. Our goal is to present an action language (mA+) that has the necessary
features to address the above aspects in representing and RAC in MADs. mA+ allows the representation
of and reasoning about different types of actions that an agent can perform in a domain where many
other agents might be present -- such as world-altering actions, sensing actions, and announcement/communication
actions. It also allows the specification of agents' dynamic awareness of action occurrences which
has future implications on what agents' know about the world and other agents' knowledge about the
world. mA+ considers three different types of awareness: full-, partial- awareness, and complete
oblivion of an action occurrence and its effects. This keeps the language simple, yet powerful enough
to address a large variety of knowledge manipulation scenarios in MADs. The semantics of mA+ relies
on the notion of state, which is described by a pointed Kripke model and is used to encode the agent's
knowledge and the real state of the world. It is defined by a transition function that maps pairs of
actions and states into sets of states. We illustrate properties of the action theories, including
properties that guarantee finiteness of the set of initial states and their practical implementability.
Finally, we relate mA+ to other related formalisms that contribute to RAC in MADs.
