Modern 3D Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) systems use mainly two types of geometric models. Classically,
objects are defined by a Boundary Representation (B-Rep), where only the objects' surfaces with
their corresponding edges and nodes are stored. One disadvantage concerning a numerical simulation
is that B-Rep models are not necessarily watertight. These 'dirty geometries' cause major difficulties
in computational analysis because even basic geometric operations such as point-in-membership
tests fail, not to mention meshing as required by classical boundary conforming finite element
methods. Alternatively, objects may be represented by Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), which
is strongly related to Procedural Modeling (PM). In this context, the model is created using Boolean
operations on primitives. The modeling process is then either stored as a sequence (PM), or as a construction
tree (CSG). In contrast to B-Rep models, CSG models are intrinsically water-tight. To run a finite
element simulation on a water-tight CSG model, two alternatives are possible: (i) it can either
be converted to a B-Rep-model to obtain a finite element mesh or (ii) its implicit description can
be used directly by applying an embedded domain approach, like the Finite Cell Method (FCM). In this
contribution, we present a design-through analysis methodology using CSG and FCM. A crucial point
in FCM is a fast and reliable point-in-membership test which can be directly derived from the CSG
model. We present the outline of the modeling approach, the realization of the point-in-membership
test as a sequence of CSG-operations, and discuss advantages and limitations on complex models
of relevance in mechanical engineering.
