The Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction is the primary auction used for monetizing the use of
the Internet. It is well-known that truthtelling is not a dominant strategy in this auction and that
inefficient equilibria can arise. In this paper we study the space of equilibria in GSP, and quantify
the efficiency loss that can arise in equilibria under a wide range of sources of uncertainty, as
well as in the full information setting. The traditional Bayesian game models uncertainty in the
valuations (types) of the participants. The Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction gives rise
to a further form of uncertainty: the selection of quality factors resulting in uncertainty about
the behavior of the underlying ad allocation algorithm. The bounds we obtain apply to both forms
of uncertainty, and are robust in the sense that they apply under various perturbations of the solution
concept, extending to models with information asymmetries and bounded rationality in the form
of learning strategies. We present a constant bound (2.927) on the factor of the efficiency loss
(\emph{price of anarchy}) of the corresponding game for the Bayesian model of partial information
about other participants and about ad quality factors. For the full information setting, we prove
a surprisingly low upper bound of 1.282 on the price of anarchy over pure Nash equilibria, nearly
matching a lower bound of 1.259 for the case of three advertisers. Further, we do not require that
the system reaches equilibrium, and give similarly low bounds also on the quality degradation for
any no-regret learning outcome. Our conclusion is that the number of advertisers in the auction
has almost no impact on the price of anarchy, and that the efficiency of GSP is very robust with respect
to the belief and rationality assumptions imposed on the participants.
