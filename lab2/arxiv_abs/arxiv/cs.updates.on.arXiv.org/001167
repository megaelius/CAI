With the popularity of Linked Open Data (LOD) and the associated rise in freely accessible knowledge
that can be accessed via LOD, exploiting LOD for recommender systems has been widely studied based
on various approaches such as graph-based or using different machine learning models with LOD-enabled
features. Many of the previous approaches require construction of an additional graph to run graph-based
algorithms or to extract path-based features by combining user- item interactions (e.g., likes,
dislikes) and background knowledge from LOD. In this paper, we investigate Factorization Machines
(FMs) based on particularly lightweight LOD-enabled features which can be directly obtained via
a public SPARQL Endpoint without any additional effort to construct a graph. Firstly, we aim to study
whether using FM with these lightweight LOD-enabled features can provide competitive performance
compared to a learning-to-rank approach leveraging LOD as well as other well-established approaches
such as kNN-item and BPRMF. Secondly, we are interested in finding out to what extent each set of LOD-enabled
features contributes to the recommendation performance. Experimental evaluation on a standard
dataset shows that our proposed approach using FM with lightweight LOD-enabled features provides
the best performance compared to other approaches in terms of five evaluation metrics. In addition,
the study of the recommendation performance based on different sets of LOD-enabled features indicate
that property-object lists and PageRank scores of items are useful for improving the performance,
and can provide the best performance through using them together for FM. We observe that subject-property
lists of items does not contribute to the recommendation performance but rather decreases the performance.
