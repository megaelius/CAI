With smartphone technologies enhanced way of interacting with the world around us, it has also been
paving the way for easier access to our private and personal information. This has been amplified
by the existence of numerous embedded sensors utilized by millions of apps to users. While mobile
apps have positively transformed many aspects of our lives with new functionalities, many of these
applications are taking advantage of vast amounts of data, privacy apps, a form of Privacy Enhancing
Technology can be an effective privacy management tool for smartphones. To protect against vulnerabilities
related to the collection, storage, and sharing of sensitive data, developers are building numerous
privacy apps. However, there has been a lack of discretion in this particular area which calls for
a proper assessment to understand the far-reaching utilization of these apps among users. During
this process we have conducted an evaluation of the most popular privacy apps from our total collection
of five hundred and twelve to demonstrate their functionality specific data protections they are
claiming to offer, both technologically and conventionally, measuring up to standards. Taking
their offered security functionalities as a scale, we conducted forensic experiments to indicate
where they are failing to be consistent in maintaining protection. For legitimate validation of
security gaps in assessed privacy apps, we have also utilized NIST and OWASP guidelines. We believe
this study will be efficacious for continuous improvement and can be considered as a foundation
towards a common standard for privacy and security measures for an app's development stage.
