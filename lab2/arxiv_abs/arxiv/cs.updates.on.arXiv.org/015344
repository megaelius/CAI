The Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of Internet connected devices capable of interacting
with the physical world and computer systems. It is estimated that the IoT will consist of approximately
fifty billion devices by the year 2020. In addition to the sheer numbers, the need for IoT security
is exacerbated by the fact that many of the edge devices employ weak to no encryption of the communication
link. It has been estimated that almost 70% of IoT devices use no form of encryption. Previous research
has suggested the use of Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), a physical layer technique, as
a means of augmenting bit-level security mechanism such as encryption. The work presented here
integrates a Nelder-Mead based approach for estimating the Rayleigh fading channel coefficients
prior to the SEI approach known as RF-DNA fingerprinting. The performance of this estimator is assessed
for degrading signal-to-noise ratio and compared with least square and minimum mean squared error
channel estimators. Additionally, this work presents classification results using RF-DNA fingerprints
that were extracted from received signals that have undergone Rayleigh fading channel correction
using Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) equalization. This work also performs radio discrimination
using RF-DNA fingerprints generated from the normalized magnitude-squared and phase response
of Gabor coefficients as well as two classifiers. Discrimination of four 802.11a Wi-Fi radios achieves
an average percent correct classification of 90% or better for signal-to-noise ratios of 18 and
21 dB or greater using a Rayleigh fading channel comprised of two and five paths, respectively.
