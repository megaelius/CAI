Watermarking inserts invisible data into content to protect copyright. The embedded information
provides proof of authorship and facilitates tracking illegal distribution, etc. Current robust
watermarking techniques have been proposed to preserve inserted copyright information from various
attacks, such as content modification and watermark removal attack. However, since the watermark
is inserted in the form of noise, there is an inevitable effect of reducing content visual quality.
In general, more robust watermarking techniques tend to have larger effect on the quality, and content
creators and users are often reluctant to insert watermarks. Thus, there is a demand for a watermark
that maintains maximum image quality, even if the watermark performance is slightly inferior.
Therefore, we propose a watermarking technique that maximizes invisibility while maintaining
sufficient robustness and data capacity enough to be applied for real situations. The proposed
method minimizes watermarking energy by adopting curvelet domain multi-directional decomposition
to maximize invisibility, and maximizes robustness against signal processing attack by watermarking
pattern suitable for curvelet transformation. The method is also robust against geometric attack
by employing watermark detection method utilizing curvelet characteristics. The proposed method
showed very good results of 57.65 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio in fidelity tests, and mean opinion
score showed that images treated with the proposed method were hardly distinguishable from the
originals. The proposed technique also showed good robustness against signal processing and geometric
attacks compared with existing techniques.
