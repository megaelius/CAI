Motivated by streaming multi-view video coding and wireless sensor networks, we consider the problem
of blockwise streaming compression of a pair of correlated sources, which we term streaming Slepian-Wolf
coding. We study the moderate deviations regime in which the rate pairs of a sequence of codes converge,
along a straight line, to various points on the boundary of the Slepian-Wolf region at a speed slower
than the inverse square root of the blocklength $n$, while the error probability decays subexponentially
fast in $n$. Our main result focuses on directions of approaches to corner points of the Slepian-Wolf
region. It states that for each correlated source and all corner points, there exists a non-empty
subset of directions of approaches such that the moderate deviations constant (the constant of
proportionality for the subexponential decay of the error probability) is enhanced (over the non-streaming
case) by at least a factor of $T$, the block delay of decoding source block pairs. We specialize our
main result to the setting of streaming lossless source coding and generalize this result to the
setting where we have different delay requirements for each of the two source blocks. The proof of
our main result involves the use of various analytical tools and amalgamates several ideas from
the recent information-theoretic streaming literature. We adapt the so-called truncated memory
encoding idea from Draper and Khisti (2011) and Lee, Tan, and Khisti (2016) to ensure that the effect
of error accumulation is nullified in the limit of large blocklengths. We also adapt the use of the
so-called minimum weighted empirical suffix entropy decoder which was used by Draper, Chang, and
Sahai (2014) to derive achievable error exponents for symbolwise streaming Slepian-Wolf coding.
