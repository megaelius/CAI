The prevalence of accessible depth sensing and 3D laser scanning techniques has enabled the convenient
acquisition of 3D dynamic point clouds, which provide efficient representation of arbitrarily-shaped
objects in motion. Nevertheless, dynamic point clouds are often perturbed by noise due to hardware,
software or other causes. While a plethora of methods have been proposed for static point cloud denoising,
few efforts are made for the denoising of dynamic point clouds with varying number of irregularly-sampled
points in each frame. In this paper, we represent dynamic point clouds naturally on graphs and address
the denoising problem by inferring the underlying graph via spatio-temporal graph learning, exploiting
both the intra-frame similarity and inter-frame consistency. Firstly, assuming the availability
of a relevant feature vector per node, we pose spatial-temporal graph learning as optimizing a Mahalanobis
distance metric $\mathbf{M}$, which is formulated as the minimization of graph Laplacian regularizer.
Secondly, to ease the optimization of the symmetric and positive definite metric matrix $\mathbf{M}$,
we decompose it into $\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{R}^{\top}\mathbf{R}$ and solve $\mathbf{R}$ instead
via proximal gradient. Finally, based on the spatial-temporal graph learning, we formulate dynamic
point cloud denoising as the joint optimization of the desired point cloud and underlying spatio-temporal
graph, which leverages both intra-frame affinities and inter-frame consistency and is solved
via alternating minimization. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly
outperforms independent denoising of each frame from state-of-the-art static point cloud denoising
approaches.
