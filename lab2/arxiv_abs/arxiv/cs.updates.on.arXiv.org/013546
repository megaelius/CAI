This paper presents Emosaic, a tool for visualizing the emotional tone of text documents, considering
multiple dimensions of emotion and varying levels of semantic granularity. Emosaic is grounded
in psychological research on the relationship between language, affect, and color perception.
We capitalize on an established three-dimensional model of human emotion: valence (good, nice
vs. bad, awful), arousal (calm, passive vs. exciting, active) and dominance (weak, controlled
vs. strong, in control). Previously, multi-dimensional models of emotion have been used rarely
in visualizations of textual data, due to the perceptual challenges involved. Furthermore, until
recently most text visualizations remained at a high level, precluding closer engagement with
the deep semantic content of the text. Informed by empirical studies, we introduce a color mapping
that translates any point in three-dimensional affective space into a unique color. Emosaic uses
affective dictionaries of words annotated with the three emotional parameters of the valence-arousal-dominance
model to extract emotional meanings from texts and then assigns to them corresponding color parameters
of the hue-saturation-brightness color space. This approach of mapping emotion to color is aimed
at helping readers to more easily grasp the emotional tone of the text. Several features of Emosaic
allow readers to interactively explore the affective content of the text in more detail; e.g., in
aggregated form as histograms, in sequential form following the order of text, and in detail embedded
into the text display itself. Interaction techniques have been included to allow for filtering
and navigating of text and visualizations.
