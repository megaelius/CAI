Bug-fix data sets are important for building various software engineering support tools, such
as program repair or Application Programming Interface (API) misuse detection. These data sets
are typically constructed from mining commit history in version-control systems. In this paper,
we investigate whether Stack Overflow can be used as an additional source for bug-fix or code improvement
data sets. Comments on Stack Overflow provide an effective way for developers to point out problems
with existing answers, alternative solutions, or pitfalls. Given its crowd-sourced nature, answers
are often updated to incorporate these suggestions. In this paper, we mine comment-edit pairs from
Stack Overflow and investigate their potential usefulness for constructing the above data sets.
These comment-edit pairs have the added benefit of having concrete descriptions/explanations
of why the change is needed as well as potentially having less tangled changes to deal with. We first
design a technique to extract related comment-edit pairs and then qualitatively and quantitatively
investigate the nature of these pairs. We find that the majority of comment-edit pairs are not tangled,
but find that only 27% of the studied pairs are potentially useful for the above applications. We
categorize the types of mined pairs and find that the highest ratio of useful pairs come from those
categorized as Correction, Flaw, and Obsolete. Our work is the first to investigate Stack Overflow
comment-edit pairs and opens the door for future work in this direction. Based on our findings and
observations, we provide concrete suggestions on how to potentially identify a larger set of useful
comment-edit pairs, which can also be facilitated by our shared data.
