Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) arose as systems that merge computing systems with the human brain
to facilitate recording, stimulation, and inhibition of neural activity. Over the years, the development
of BCI technologies has shifted towards miniaturization of devices that can be seamlessly embedded
into the brain and can target single neuron or small population sensing and control. We present a
motivating example highlighting vulnerabilities of two promising micron-scale BCI technologies,
demonstrating the lack of security and privacy principles in existing solutions. This situation
opens the door to a novel family of cyberattacks, called neuronal cyberattacks, affecting neuronal
signaling. This paper defines the first two neural cyberattacks, Neuronal Flooding (FLO) and Neuronal
Scanning (SCA), where each threat can affect the natural activity of neurons. This work implements
these attacks in a neuronal simulator to determine their impact over the spontaneous neuronal behavior,
defining three metrics: number of spikes, percentage of shifts, and dispersion of spikes. Several
experiments demonstrate that both cyberattacks produce a reduction of spikes compared to spontaneous
behavior, generating a rise in temporal shifts and a dispersion increase. Mainly, SCA presents
a higher impact than FLO in the metrics focused on the number of spikes and dispersion, where FLO is
slightly more damaging, considering the percentage of shifts. Nevertheless, the intrinsic behavior
of each attack generates a differentiation on how they alter neuronal signaling. FLO is adequate
to generate an immediate impact on the neuronal activity, whereas SCA presents higher effectiveness
for damages to the neural signaling in the long-term.
