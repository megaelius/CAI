This dissertation investigates the use of one-sided classification algorithms in the application
of separating hazardous chlorinated solvents from other materials, based on their Raman spectra.
The experimentation is carried out using a new one-sided classification toolkit that was designed
and developed from the ground up. In the one-sided classification paradigm, the objective is to
separate elements of the target class from all outliers. These one-sided classifiers are generally
chosen, in practice, when there is a deficiency of some sort in the training examples. Sometimes
outlier examples can be rare, expensive to label, or even entirely absent. However, this author
would like to note that they can be equally applicable when outlier examples are plentiful but nonetheless
not statistically representative of the complete outlier concept. It is this scenario that is explicitly
dealt with in this research work. In these circumstances, one-sided classifiers have been found
to be more robust that conventional multi-class classifiers. The term "unexpected" outliers is
introduced to represent outlier examples, encountered in the test set, that have been taken from
a different distribution to the training set examples. These are examples that are a result of an
inadequate representation of all possible outliers in the training set. It can often be impossible
to fully characterise outlier examples given the fact that they can represent the immeasurable
quantity of "everything else" that is not a target. The findings from this research have shown the
potential drawbacks of using conventional multi-class classification algorithms when the test
data come from a completely different distribution to that of the training samples.
