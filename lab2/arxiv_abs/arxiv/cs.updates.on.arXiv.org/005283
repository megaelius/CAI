Given a Boolean function $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \{-1,1\}$, the Fourier distribution assigns probability
$\widehat{f}(S)^2$ to $S\subseteq [n]$. The Fourier Entropy-Influence (FEI) conjecture of Friedgut
and Kalai asks if there exist a universal constant C>0 such that $H(\hat{f}^2)\leq C Inf(f)$, where
$H(\hat{f}^2)$ is the Shannon entropy of the Fourier distribution of $f$ and $Inf(f)$ is the total
influence of $f$. 1) We consider the weaker Fourier Min-entropy-Influence (FMEI) conjecture.
This asks if $H_{\infty}(\hat{f}^2)\leq C Inf(f)$, where $H_{\infty}(\hat{f}^2)$ is the min-entropy
of the Fourier distribution. We show $H_{\infty}(\hat{f}^2)\leq 2C_{\min}^\oplus(f)$, where
$C_{\min}^\oplus(f)$ is the minimum parity certificate complexity of $f$. We also show that for
every $\epsilon\geq 0$, we have $H_{\infty}(\hat{f}^2)\leq 2\log (\|\hat{f}\|_{1,\epsilon}/(1-\epsilon))$,
where $\|\hat{f}\|_{1,\epsilon}$ is the approximate spectral norm of $f$. As a corollary, we verify
the FMEI conjecture for the class of read-$k$ $DNF$s (for constant $k$). 2) We show that $H(\hat{f}^2)\leq
2 aUC^\oplus(f)$, where $aUC^\oplus(f)$ is the average unambiguous parity certificate complexity
of $f$. This improves upon Chakraborty et al. An important consequence of the FEI conjecture is the
long-standing Mansour's conjecture. We show that a weaker version of FEI already implies Mansour's
conjecture: is $H(\hat{f}^2)\leq C \min\{C^0(f),C^1(f)\}$?, where $C^0(f), C^1(f)$ are the
0- and 1-certificate complexities of $f$, respectively. 3) We study what FEI implies about the structure
of polynomials that 1/3-approximate a Boolean function. We pose a conjecture (which is implied
by FEI): no "flat" degree-$d$ polynomial of sparsity $2^{\omega(d)}$ can 1/3-approximate a Boolean
function. We prove this conjecture unconditionally for a particular class of polynomials.
