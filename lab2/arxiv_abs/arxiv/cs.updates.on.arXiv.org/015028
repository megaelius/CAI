During the last years our society was often exposed to the coherent information waves of high amplitudes.
These are waves of huge social energy. Often they are of the destructive character, a kind of information
tsunami. But, they can carry as well positive improvements in the human society, as waves of decision
making matching rational recommendations of societal institutes. The main distinguishing features
of these waves are their high amplitude, coherence (homogeneous character of social actions generated
by them), and short time needed for their generation and relaxation. Such waves can be treated as
large scale exhibition of the Bandwagon effect. We show that this socio-psychic phenomenon can
be modeled on the basis of the recently developed {\it social laser theory}. This theory can be used
to model {\it stimulated amplification of coherent social actions}. "Actions" are treated very
generally, from mass protests to votes and other collective decisions, as, e.g., acceptance (often
unconscious) of some societal recommendations. In this paper, we concentrate on theory of laser
resonators, physical vs. social. For the latter, we analyze in very detail functioning of the internet
based Echo-Chambers. Their main purpose is increasing of the power of the quantum information field
as well as its coherence. Of course, the Bandwagon effect is well known and well studied in social
psychology. However, the social laser theory gives the possibility to model it by using the general
formalism of quantum field theory. The paper contains minimum of mathematics and it can be readable
by researchers working in psychology, cognitive, social, and political sciences; it might also
be interesting for experts in information theory and artificial intelligence.
