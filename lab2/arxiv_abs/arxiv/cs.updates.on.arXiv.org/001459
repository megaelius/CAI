In large networks, using the length of shortest paths as the distance measure has shortcomings.
A well-studied shortcoming is that extending it to disconnected graphs and directed graphs is controversial.
The second shortcoming is that a huge number of vertices may have exactly the same score. The third
shortcoming is that in many applications, the distance between two vertices not only depends on
the length of shortest paths, but also on the number of shortest paths. In this paper, first we develop
a new distance measure between vertices of a graph that yields discriminative distance-based centrality
indices. This measure is proportional to the length of shortest paths and inversely proportional
to the number of shortest paths. We present algorithms for exact computation of the proposed discriminative
indices. Second, we develop randomized algorithms that precisely estimate average discriminative
path length and average discriminative eccentricity and show that they give $(\epsilon,\delta)$-approximations
of these indices. Third, we perform extensive experiments over several real-world networks from
different domains. In our experiments, we first show that compared to the traditional indices,
discriminative indices have usually much more discriminability. Then, we show that our randomized
algorithms can very precisely estimate average discriminative path length and average discriminative
eccentricity, using only few samples. Then, we show that real-world networks have usually a tiny
average discriminative path length, bounded by a constant (e.g., 2). Fourth, in order to better
motivate the usefulness of our proposed distance measure, we present a novel link prediction method,
that uses discriminative distance to decide which vertices are more likely to form a link in future,
and show its superior performance compared to the well-known existing measures.
