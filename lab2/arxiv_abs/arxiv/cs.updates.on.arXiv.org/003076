Product recommendation systems are important for major movie studios during the movie greenlight
process and as part of machine learning personalization pipelines. Collaborative Filtering (CF)
models have proved to be effective at powering recommender systems for online streaming services
with explicit customer feedback data. CF models do not perform well in scenarios in which feedback
data is not available, in cold start situations like new product launches, and situations with markedly
different customer tiers (e.g., high frequency customers vs. casual customers). Generative natural
language models that create useful theme-based representations of an underlying corpus of documents
can be used to represent new product descriptions, like new movie plots. When combined with CF, they
have shown to increase the performance in cold start situations. Outside of those cases though in
which explicit customer feedback is available, recommender engines must rely on binary purchase
data, which materially degrades performance. Fortunately, purchase data can be combined with
product descriptions to generate meaningful representations of products and customer trajectories
in a convenient product space in which proximity represents similarity. Learning to measure the
distance between points in this space can be accomplished with a deep neural network that trains
on customer histories and on dense vectorizations of product descriptions. We developed a system
based on Collaborative (Deep) Metric Learning (CML) to predict the purchase probabilities of new
theatrical releases. We trained and evaluated the model using a large dataset of customer histories,
and tested the model for a set of movies that were released outside of the training window. Initial
experiments show gains relative to models that do not train on collaborative preferences.
