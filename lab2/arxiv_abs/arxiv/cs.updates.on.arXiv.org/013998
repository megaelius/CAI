With the goal of recovering high-quality image content from its degraded version, image restoration
enjoys numerous applications, such as in surveillance, computational photography, medical imaging,
and remote sensing. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved dramatic improvements
over conventional approaches for image restoration task. Existing CNN-based methods typically
operate either on full-resolution or on progressively low-resolution representations. In the
former case, spatially precise but contextually less robust results are achieved, while in the
latter case, semantically reliable but spatially less accurate outputs are generated. In this
paper, we present a novel architecture with the collective goals of maintaining spatially-precise
high-resolution representations through the entire network, and receiving strong contextual
information from the low-resolution representations. The core of our approach is a multi-scale
residual block containing several key elements: (a) parallel multi-resolution convolution streams
for extracting multi-scale features, (b) information exchange across the multi-resolution streams,
(c) spatial and channel attention mechanisms for capturing contextual information, and (d) attention
based multi-scale feature aggregation. In the nutshell, our approach learns an enriched set of
features that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while simultaneously preserving
the high-resolution spatial details. Extensive experiments on five real image benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method, named as MIRNet, achieves state-of-the-art results for a variety
of image processing tasks, including image denoising, super-resolution and image enhancement.
