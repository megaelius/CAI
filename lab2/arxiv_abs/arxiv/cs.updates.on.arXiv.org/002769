Regular maintenance of all the assets is pivotal for proper functioning of railway. Manual maintenance
can be very cumbersome and leave room for errors. Track anomalies like vegetation overgrowth, sun
kinks affect the track construct and result in unequal load transfer, imbalanced lateral forces
on tracks which causes further deterioration of tracks and can ultimately result in derailment
of locomotive. Hence there is a need to continuously monitor rail track health. Track anomalies
are rare with the skew as high as one anomaly in millions of good images. We propose a method to build
training data that will make our algorithms more robust and help us detect real world track issues.
The data augmentation will have a direct effect in making us detect better anomalies and hence improve
time for railroads that is spent in manual inspection. This paper talks about a real world use case
of detecting railway track defects from a camera mounted on a moving locomotive and tracking their
locations. The camera is engineered to withstand the environment factors on a moving train and provide
a consistent steady image at around 30 frames per second. An image simulation pipeline of track detection,
region of interest selection, augmenting image for anomalies is implemented. Training images
are simulated for sun kink and vegetation overgrowth. Inception V3 model pretrained on Imagenet
dataset is finetuned for a 2 class classification. For the case of vegetation overgrowth, the model
generalizes well on actual vegetation images, though it was trained and validated solely on simulated
images which might have different distribution than the actual vegetation. Sun kink classifier
can classify professionally simulated sun kink videos with a precision of 97.5%.
