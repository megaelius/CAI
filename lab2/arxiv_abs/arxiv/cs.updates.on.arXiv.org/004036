A counter braid (CB) is a novel counter architecture introduced by Lu et al. in 2007 for per-flow measurements
on high-speed links which can be decoded with low complexity using message passing (MP). CBs achieve
an asymptotic compression rate (under optimal decoding) that matches the entropy lower bound of
the flow size distribution. In this paper, we apply the concept of spatial coupling to CBs to improve
the performance of the original CBs and analyze the performance of the resulting spatially-coupled
CBs (SC-CBs). We introduce an equivalent bipartite graph representation of CBs with identical
iteration-by-iteration finite-length and asymptotic performance. Based on this equivalent
representation, we then analyze the asymptotic performance of single-layer CBs and SC-CBs under
the MP decoding algorithm proposed by Lu et al.. In particular, we derive the potential threshold
of the uncoupled system and show that it is equal to the area threshold. We also derive the Maxwell
decoder for CBs and prove that the potential threshold is an upper bound on the Maxwell decoding threshold.
We show that the area under the extended MP extrinsic information transfer curve is equal to zero
precisely at the area threshold. This, combined with the analysis of the Maxwell decoder and simulation
results, leads us to the conjecture that the potential threshold is equal to the Maxwell decoding
threshold and hence a lower bound on the maximum a posteriori decoding threshold. Interestingly,
SC-CBs do not show the well-known phenomenon of threshold saturation of the MP decoding threshold
to the potential threshold characteristic of spatially-coupled low-density parity-check codes
and other coupled systems. However, SC-CBs yield better MP decoding thresholds than their uncoupled
counterparts. Finally, we also consider SC-CBs as a compressed sensing scheme and show that low
undersampling factors can be achieved.
