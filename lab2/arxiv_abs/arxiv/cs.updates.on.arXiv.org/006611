We study the distributed message-passing model in which a communication network is represented
by a graph G=(V,E). Usually, the measure of complexity that is considered in this model is the worst-case
complexity, which is the largest number of rounds performed by a vertex v\in V. While often this is
a reasonable measure, in some occasions it does not express sufficiently well the actual performance
of the algorithm. For example, an execution in which one processor performs r rounds, and all the
rest perform significantly less rounds than r, has the same running time as an execution in which
all processors perform the same number of rounds r. On the other hand, the latter execution is less
efficient in several respects, such as energy efficiency, task execution efficiency, local-neighborhood
efficiency and simulation efficiency. Consequently, a more appropriate measure is required in
these cases. Recently, the vertex-averaged complexity was proposed by \cite{Feuilloley2017}.
In this measure, the running time is the worst-case sum of rounds of communication performed by all
of the graph's vertices, averaged over the number of vertices. Feuilloley \cite{Feuilloley2017}
showed that leader-election admits an algorithm with a vertex-averaged complexity significantly
better than its worst-case complexity. On the other hand, for O(1)-coloring of rings, the worst-case
and vertex-averaged complexities are the same. This complexity is O\left(\log^{*}n\right) [12].
It remained open whether the vertex-averaged complexity of symmetry-breaking in general graphs
can be better than the worst-case complexity. We answer this question in the affirmative, by showing
a number of results with improved vertex-averaged complexity.
