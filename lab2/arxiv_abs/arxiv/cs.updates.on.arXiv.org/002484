In observing interactive processes, conversion of observed uncertainty to observer certainty
is natural phenomenon creating Yes-No actions of information Bit and its information observer.
Observer emerges from interacting random field of Kolmogorov probabilities which link Kolmogorov
0-1 law probabilities and Bayesian probabilities observing Markov diffusion process by probabilistic
0-1 impulses. Each No-0 action cuts maximum of impulse minimal entropy while following Yes-1 action
transfers maxim between impulses performing dual principle of converting process entropy to information.
Merging Yes-No actions generate microprocess within bordered impulse producing Bit with free
information when the microprocess probability approaches 1. Interacting bits memorizes each
impulse free information which attracts multiple Bits moving macroprocess that self-joins triplet
macrounits. Each memorized information binds reversible microprocess within impulse with irreversible
macroprocess. The observation automatically converts cutting entropy to information macrounits.
Macrounits logically self-organize information networks IN encoding the units in geometrical
structures enclosing triplet code. Multiple IN binds their ending triplets which encloses observer
information cognition and intelligence. The observer cognition assembles common units through
multiple attraction and resonances at forming IN triplet hierarchy which accept only units that
recognizes each IN node. Maximal number of accepted triplet levels in multiple IN measures the observer
maximum comparative information intelligence. The observation process carries probabilistic
and certain wave function which self-organizes the space hierarchical structures.These information
regularities create integral logic and intelligence self-operating multiple IN up to physical
reality matter.
