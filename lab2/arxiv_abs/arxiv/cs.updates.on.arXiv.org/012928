We proposed a precision medicine approach to determine the optimal treatment regime for participants
in an exercise (E), dietary weight loss (D), and D+E trial for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) that would
have maximized their expected outcomes. Using data from 343 participants of the Intensive Diet
and Exercise for Arthritis (IDEA) trial, we applied 24 machine-learning models to develop individualized
treatment rules on seven outcomes: SF-36 physical component score, weight loss, WOMAC pain/function/stiffness
scores, compressive force, and IL-6. The optimal model was selected based on jackknife value function
estimates that indicate improvement in the outcome(s) if future participants follow the estimated
decision rule compared against the optimal single, fixed treatment model. Multiple outcome random
forest was the optimal model for the WOMAC outcomes. For the other outcomes, list-based models were
optimal. For example, the estimated optimal decision rule for weight loss assigns the D+E intervention
to participants with baseline weight not exceeding 109.35 kg and waist circumference above 90.25
cm, and assigns D to all other participants except those with history of a heart attack. If applied
to future participants, the optimal rule for weight loss is estimated to increase average weight
loss to 11.2 kg at 18 months, contrasted with 9.8 kg if all received D+E (p = 0.01). The precision medicine
models supported the overall findings from IDEA that the D+E intervention was optimal for most participants,
but there was evidence that a subgroup of participants would likely benefit more from diet alone
for two outcomes.
