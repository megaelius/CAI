Text analytics has become an important part of business intelligence as enterprises increasingly
seek to extract insights for decision making from text data sets. Processing large text data sets
can be computationally expensive, however, especially if it involves sophisticated algorithms.
This challenge is exacerbated when it is desirable to run different types of queries against a data
set, making it expensive to build multiple indices to speed up query processing. In this paper, we
propose and evaluate a framework called EmApprox that uses approximation to speed up the processing
of a wide range of queries over large text data sets. The key insight is that different types of queries
can be approximated by processing subsets of data that are most similar to the queries. EmApprox
builds a general index for a data set by learning a natural language processing model, producing
a set of highly compressed vectors representing words and subcollections of documents. Then, at
query processing time, EmApprox uses the index to guide sampling of the data set, with the probability
of selecting each subcollection of documents being proportional to its {\em similarity} to the
query as computed using the vector representations. We have implemented a prototype of EmApprox
as an extension of the Apache Spark system, and used it to approximate three types of queries: aggregation,
information retrieval, and recommendation. Experimental results show that EmApprox's similarity-guided
sampling achieves much better accuracy than random sampling. Further, EmApprox can achieve significant
speedups if users can tolerate small amounts of inaccuracies. For example, when sampling at 10\%,
EmApprox speeds up a set of queries counting phrase occurrences by almost 10x while achieving estimated
relative errors of less than 22\% for 90\% of the queries.
