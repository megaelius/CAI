Many real-world applications can be modelled as complex networks, and such networks include the
Internet, epidemic disease networks, transport networks, power grids, protein-folding structures
and others. Network integrity and robustness are important to ensure that crucial networks are
protected and undesired harmful networks can be dismantled. Network structure and integrity can
be controlled by a set of key nodes, and to find the optimal combination of nodes in a network to ensure
network structure and integrity can be an NP-complete problem. Despite extensive studies, existing
methods have many limitations and there are still many unresolved problems. This paper presents
a probabilistic approach based on neighborhood information and node importance, namely, neighborhood
information-based probabilistic algorithm (NIPA). We also define a new centrality-based importance
measure (IM), which combines the contribution ratios of the neighbor nodes of each target node and
two-hop node information. Our proposed NIPA has been tested for different network benchmarks and
compared with three other methods: optimal attack strategy (OAS), high betweenness first (HBF)
and high degree first (HDF). Experiments suggest that the proposed NIPA is most effective among
all four methods. In general, NIPA can identify the most crucial node combination with higher effectiveness,
and the set of optimal key nodes found by our proposed NIPA is much smaller than that by heuristic centrality
prediction. In addition, many previously neglected weakly connected nodes are identified, which
become a crucial part of the newly identified optimal nodes. Thus, revised strategies for protection
are recommended to ensure the safeguard of network integrity. Further key issues and future research
topics are also discussed.
