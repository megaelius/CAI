Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in skin
lesion analysis. Compared with single CNN classifier, combining the results of multiple classifiers
via fusion approaches shows to be more effective and robust. Since the skin lesion datasets are usually
limited and statistically biased, while designing an effective fusion approach, it is important
to consider not only the performance of each classifier on the training/validation dataset, but
also the relative discriminative power (e.g., confidence) of each classifier regarding an individual
sample in the testing phase, which calls for an active fusion approach. Furthermore, in skin lesion
analysis, the data of certain classes is usually abundant making them an over-represented majority
(e.g., benign lesions), while the data of some other classes is deficient, making them an underrepresented
minority (e.g., cancerous lesions). It is more crucial to precisely identify the samples from an
underrepresented (i.e., in terms of the amount of data) but more important (e.g., the cancerous
lesions) minority class. In other words, misclassifying a more severe lesion to a benign or less
severe lesion should have relative more cost (e.g., money, time and even lives). To address such
challenges, we present CS-AF, a cost-sensitive multi-classifier active fusion framework for
skin lesion classification. In the experimental evaluation, we prepared 60 base classifiers (of
10 CNN architectures) on the ISIC research datasets. Our experimental results show that our framework
consistently outperforms the static fusion competitors.
