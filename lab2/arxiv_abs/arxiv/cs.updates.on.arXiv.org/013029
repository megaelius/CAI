A set $S \subseteq V$ is a \textit{dominating set} in $G$ if for every $u \in V \setminus S$, there exists
$v \in S$ such that $(u,v) \in E$, i.e., $N[S] = V$. A dominating set $S$ is an \emph{Isolate Dominating
Set} (\textit{IDS}) if the induced subgraph $G[S]$ has at least one isolated vertex. It is known
that Isolate Domination Decision problem (IDOM) is NP-complete for bipartite graphs. In this paper,
we extend this by showing that the IDOM is NP-complete for split graphs and perfect elimination bipartite
graphs, a subclass of bipartite graphs. A set $S \subseteq V$ is an \textit{independent set} if $G[S]$
has no edge. A set $S \subseteq V$ is a \textit{secure dominating set} of $G$ if, for each vertex $u
\in V \setminus S$, there exists a vertex $v \in S$ such that $ (u,v) \in E $ and $(S \setminus \{v\})
\cup \{u\}$ is a dominating set of $G$. In addition, we initiate the study of a new domination parameter
called, \textit{independent secure domination}. A set $S\subseteq V$ is an \textit{Independent
Secure Dominating Set} (\textit{InSDS}) if $S$ is an independent set and a secure dominating set
of $G$. The minimum size of an InSDS in $G$ is called the \textit{independent secure domination number}
of $G$ and is denoted by $\gamma_{is}(G)$. Given a graph $ G$ and a positive integer $ k,$ the InSDM
problem is to check whether $ G $ has an independent secure dominating set of size at most $ k.$ We prove
that InSDM is NP-complete for bipartite graphs and linear time solvable for bounded tree-width
graphs and threshold graphs, a subclass of split graphs. The MInSDS problem is to find an independent
secure dominating set of minimum size, in the input graph. Finally, we prove that the MInSDS problem
is APX-hard for graphs with maximum degree $5.$
