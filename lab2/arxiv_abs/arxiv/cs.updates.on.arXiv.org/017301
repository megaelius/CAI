As the COVID-19 outbreak evolves, accurate forecasting continues to play an extremely important
role in informing policy decisions. In this paper, we present our continuous curation of a large
data repository containing COVID-19 information from a range of sources. We use this data to develop
predictions and corresponding prediction intervals for the short-term trajectory of COVID-19
cumulative death counts at the county-level in the United States up to two weeks ahead. Using data
from January 22 to June 20, 2020, we develop and combine multiple forecasts using ensembling techniques,
resulting in an ensemble we refer to as Combined Linear and Exponential Predictors (CLEP). Our individual
predictors include county-specific exponential and linear predictors, a shared exponential
predictor that pools data together across counties, an expanded shared exponential predictor
that uses data from neighboring counties, and a demographics-based shared exponential predictor.
We use prediction errors from the past five days to assess the uncertainty of our death predictions,
resulting in generally-applicable prediction intervals, Maximum (absolute) Error Prediction
Intervals (MEPI). MEPI achieves a coverage rate of more than 94% when averaged across counties for
predicting cumulative recorded death counts two weeks in the future. Our forecasts are currently
being used by the non-profit organization, Response4Life, to determine the medical supply need
for individual hospitals and have directly contributed to the distribution of medical supplies
across the country. We hope that our forecasts and data repository at https://covidseverity.com
can help guide necessary county-specific decision-making and help counties prepare for their
continued fight against COVID-19.
