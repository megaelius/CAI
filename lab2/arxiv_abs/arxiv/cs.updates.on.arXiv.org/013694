Intrusion detection system (IDS) plays an essential role in computer networks protecting computing
resources and data from outside attacks. Recent IDS faces challenges improving flexibility and
efficiency of the IDS for unexpected and unpredictable attacks. Deep neural network (DNN) is considered
popularly for complex systems to abstract features and learn as a machine learning technique. In
this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for developing the efficient and flexible IDS using
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN). Two-dimensional CNN methods have shown
remarkable performance in detecting objects of images in computer vision area. Meanwhile, the
1D-CNN can be used for supervised learning on time-series data. We establish a machine learning
model based on the 1D-CNN by serializing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
packets in a predetermined time range as an invasion Internet traffic model for the IDS, where normal
and abnormal network traffics are categorized and labeled for supervised learning in the 1D-CNN.
We evaluated our model on UNSW\_NB15 IDS dataset to show the effectiveness of our method. For comparison
study in performance, machine learning-based Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
models in addition to the 1D-CNN with various network parameters and architecture are exploited.
In each experiment, the models are run up to 200 epochs with a learning rate in 0.0001 on imbalanced
and balanced data. 1D-CNN and its variant architectures have outperformed compared to the classical
machine learning classifiers. This is mainly due to the reason that CNN has the capability to extract
high-level feature representations that represent the abstract form of low-level feature sets
of network traffic connections.
