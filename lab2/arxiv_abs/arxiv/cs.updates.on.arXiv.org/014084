This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which utilizes the spectral correlation
function (SCF) for wireless radio access technology identification without any prior information
about bandwidth and/or the center frequency. The sensing and classification methods are applied
to the baseband equivalent signals. Two different approaches are elaborated. The proposed method
is implemented in two different settings; in the first setting, signals are jointly sensed and classified.
Sensing and classification are conducted in a sequential manner in the second setting. The performance
of both approaches is discussed in detail. The proposed method eliminates the threshold estimation
processes of classical estimators. It also eliminates the need to know the distinct features of
signals beforehand. Over-the-air real-world measurements are used to show the robustness and
the validity of the proposed method and various wireless signals are successfully distinguished
from each other without any a priori knowledge. The over-the-air real-world measurements are also
shared in the format of SCF. The performance of SCF-based identification is compared with the cases
when fast Fourier transform and amplitude-phase representation are used as the training inputs
for CNN. The comparative performance of the proposed method is quantified by precision, recall,
and F1-score metrics. Moreover, a setup to compare the performance of the proposed approach with
classical cyclostationary features detection (CFD) is prepared. Measurement results indicate
the superiority of the proposed method against CFD, especially at the low signal-to-noise ratio
regime.
