Future Internet of Things (IoT) applications will require that billions of wireless devices transmit
data to the cloud frequently. However, the wireless medium access is pointed as a problem for the
next generations of wireless networks; hence, the number of data transmissions in Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSNs) can quickly become a bottleneck, disrupting the exponential growth in the number
of interconnected devices, sensors, and amount of produced data. Therefore, keeping a low number
of data transmissions is critical to incorporate new sensor nodes and measure a great variety of
parameters in future generations of WSNs. Thanks to the high accuracy and low complexity of state-of-the-art
forecasting algorithms, Dual Prediction Schemes (DPSs) are potential candidates to optimize
the data transmissions in WSNs at the finest level because they facilitate for sensor nodes to avoid
unnecessary transmissions without affecting the quality of their measurements. In this work,
we present a sensor network model that uses statistical theorems to describe the expected impact
of DPSs and data aggregation in WSNs. We aim to provide a foundation for future works by characterizing
the theoretical gains of processing data in sensors and conditioning its transmission to the predictions'
accuracy. Our simulation results show that the number of transmissions can be reduced by almost
98% in the sensor nodes with the highest workload. We also detail the impact of predicting and aggregating
transmissions according to the parameters that can be observed in common scenarios, such as sensor
nodes' transmission ranges, the correlation between measurements of different sensors, and the
period between two consecutive measurements in a sensor.
