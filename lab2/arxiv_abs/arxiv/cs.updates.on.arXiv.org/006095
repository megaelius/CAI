Improving patient care safety is an ultimate objective for medical cyber-physical systems. A recent
study shows that the patients' death rate is significantly reduced by computerizing medical best
practice guidelines. Recent data also show that some morbidity and mortality in emergency care
are directly caused by delayed or interrupted treatment due to lack of medical resources. However,
medical guidelines usually do not provide guidance on medical resource demands and how to manage
potential unexpected delays in resource availability. If medical resources are temporarily unavailable,
safety properties in existing executable medical guideline models may fail which may cause increased
risk to patients under care. The paper presents a separately model and jointly verify (SMJV) architecture
to separately model medical resource available times and relationships and jointly verify safety
properties of existing medical best practice guideline models with resource models being integrated
in. The SMJV architecture allows medical staff to effectively manage medical resource demands
and unexpected resource availability delays during emergency care. The separated modeling approach
also allows different domain professionals to make independent model modifications, facilitates
the management of frequent resource availability changes, and enables resource statechart reuse
in multiple medical guideline models. A simplified stroke scenario is used as a case study to investigate
the effectiveness and validity of the SMJV architecture. The case study indicates that the SMJV
architecture is able to identify unsafe properties caused by unexpected resource delays.
