Limited capture range and the requirement to provide high quality initializations for optimization-based
2D/3D image registration methods can significantly degrade the per- formance of 3D image reconstruction
and motion compensation pipelines. Challenging clinical imaging scenarios, that contain sig-
nificant subject motion such as fetal in-utero imaging, complicate the 3D image and volume reconstruction
process. In this paper we present a learning based image registra- tion method capable of predicting
3D rigid transformations of arbitrarily oriented 2D image slices, with respect to a learned canonical
atlas co-ordinate system. Only image slice intensity information is used to perform registration
and canonical align- ment, no spatial transform initialization is required. To find image transformations
we utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to learn the regression function
capable of mapping 2D image slices to the 3D canonical atlas space. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness
of our approach quantitatively on simulated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), fetal brain imagery
with synthetic motion and further demon- strate qualitative results on real fetal MRI data where
our method is integrated into a full reconstruction and motion compensation pipeline. Our learning
based registration achieves an average spatial prediction error of 7 mm on simulated data and produces
qualitatively improved reconstructions for heavily moving fetuses with gestational ages of approximately
20 weeks. Our model provides a general and computationally efficient solution to the 2D-3D registration
initialization problem and is suitable for real- time scenarios.
