This paper establishes some of the fundamental barriers in the theory of computations and finally
settles the long-standing computational spectral problem. That is to determine the existence
of algorithms that can compute spectra $\mathrm{sp}(A)$ of classes of bounded operators $A = \{a_{ij}\}_{i,j
\in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{B}(l^2(\mathbb{N}))$, given the matrix elements $\{a_{ij}\}_{i,j
\in \mathbb{N}}$, that are sharp in the sense that they achieve the boundary of what a digital computer
can achieve. Similarly, for a Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\triangle+V$, determine the existence
of algorithms that can compute the spectrum $\mathrm{sp}(H)$ given point samples of the potential
function $V$. In order to solve these problems, we establish the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI)
hierarchy and provide a collection of new algorithms that allow for problems that were previously
out of reach. The SCI is the smallest number of limits needed in the computation, yielding a classification
hierarchy for all types of problems in computational mathematics that determines the boundaries
of what computers can achieve in scientific computing. In addition, the SCI hierarchy provides
classifications of computational problems that can be used in computer-assisted proofs. The SCI
hierarchy captures many key computational issues in the history of mathematics including the insolvability
of the quintic, Smale's problem on the existence of iterative generally convergent algorithm for
polynomial root finding, the computational spectral problem, inverse problems, optimisation
etc., and even mathematical logic (although this is not a paper on logic and computer science).
