We introduce a game-theoretic model to investigate the strategic interaction between a cyber insurance
policyholder whose premium depends on her self-reported security level and an insurer with the
power to audit the security level upon receiving an indemnity claim. Audits can reveal fraudulent
(or simply careless) policyholders not following reported security procedures, in which case
the insurer can refuse to indemnify the policyholder. However, the insurer has to bear an audit cost
even when the policyholders have followed the prescribed security procedures. As audits can be
expensive, a key problem insurers face is to devise an auditing strategy to deter policyholders
from misrepresenting their security levels to gain a premium discount. This decision-making problem
was motivated by conducting interviews with underwriters and reviewing regulatory filings in
the U.S.; we discovered that premiums are determined by security posture, yet this is often self-reported
and insurers are concerned by whether security procedures are practised as reported by the policyholders.
To address this problem, we model this interaction as a Bayesian game of incomplete information
and devise optimal auditing strategies for the insurers considering the possibility that the policyholder
may misrepresent her security level. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first theoretical
consideration of post-incident claims management in cyber security. Our model captures the trade-off
between the incentive to exaggerate security posture during the application process and the possibility
of punishment for non-compliance with reported security policies. Simulations demonstrate that
common sense techniques are not as efficient at providing effective cyber insurance audit decisions
as the ones computed using game theory.
