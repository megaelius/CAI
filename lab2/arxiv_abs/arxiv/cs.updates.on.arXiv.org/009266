We consider a class of distributed non-convex optimization problems often arise in modern signal
and information processing applications, in which a number of agents connected by a network $\mathcal{G}$
collectively optimize a sum of smooth (possibly non-convex) local objective functions. We address
the following question: for a class of unconstrained problems, what is the fastest rate that any
distributed algorithm can achieve when the agents only use local gradient information and interacting
with their immediate neighbors, and how to achieve those rates. First, for a class of problems with
Lipschitz continuous gradients for all local functions, and for a class of undirected and unweighted
graphs, we develop a lower bound analysis that identifies difficult problem instances for a class
of properly defined distributed first-order methods. We show that for this class of algorithms,
in the worst-case it takes at least $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\xi(\mathcal{G})} \times \bar{L} /{\epsilon})$
iterations to achieve certain $\epsilon$-solution, where $\xi(\mathcal{G})$ represents the
spectral gap of the graph Laplacian matrix, and $\bar{L}$ is the averaged Lipschitz constants of
the gradients of local functions. Second, we propose optimal methods whose rates precisely match
the lower bounds (up to a ploylog factor). The key to our algorithm design is to properly leverage
the classical polynomial filtering methods with modern first-order optimization techniques.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that lower rate bounds and optimal methods have
been developed for distributed non-convex optimization problems. Our results provide guidelines
for the future design of distributed optimization algorithms, convex and non-convex alike.
