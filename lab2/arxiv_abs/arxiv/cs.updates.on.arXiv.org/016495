The spreading of virus infection is here simulated over artificial human networks. The real-space
urban life of people is modeled as a modified scale-free network with constraints. A scale-free
network has been adopted in several studies for modeling on-line communities so far but is modified
here for the aim to represent peoples' social behaviors where the generated communities are restricted
reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the real life. Furthermore, the networks have been
extended by introducing multiple cliques in the initial step of network construction and enabling
people to zero-degree people as well as popular (large degree) people. As a result, four findings
and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the "second waves" occur without external influence
or constraints on contacts or the releasing of the constraints. These second waves, mostly lower
than the first wave, implies the bridges between infected and fresh clusters may trigger new expansions
of spreading. Second, if the network changes the structure on the way of infection spreading or after
its suppression, the peak of the second wave can be larger than the first. Third, the peak height in
the time series depends on the difference between the upper bound of the number of people each member
accepts to meet and the number of people one chooses to meet. This tendency is observed for two kinds
of artificial networks and implies the impact of the bridges between communities on the virus spreading.
Fourth, the release of once given constraint may trigger a second wave higher than the peak of the
time series without introducing any constraint from the beginning, if the release is introduced
at a time close to the peak. Thus, both governments and individuals should be careful in returning
to human society with inter-community contacts.
