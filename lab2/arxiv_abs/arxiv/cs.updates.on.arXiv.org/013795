We consider the information extraction framework known as document spanners, and study the problem
of efficiently computing the results of the extraction from an input document, where the extraction
task is described as a sequential variable-set automaton (VA). We pose this problem in the setting
of enumeration algorithms, where we can first run a preprocessing phase and must then produce the
results with a small delay between any two consecutive results. Our goal is to have an algorithm which
is tractable in combined complexity, i.e., in the sizes of the input document and the VA; while ensuring
the best possible data complexity bounds in the input document size, i.e., constant delay in the
document size. Several recent works at PODS'18 proposed such algorithms but with linear delay in
the document size or with an exponential dependency in size of the (generally nondeterministic)
input VA. In particular, Florenzano et al. suggest that our desired runtime guarantees cannot be
met for general sequential VAs. We refute this and show that, given a nondeterministic sequential
VA and an input document, we can enumerate the mappings of the VA on the document with the following
bounds: the preprocessing is linear in the document size and polynomial in the size of the VA, and
the delay is independent of the document and polynomial in the size of the VA. The resulting algorithm
thus achieves tractability in combined complexity and the best possible data complexity bounds.
Moreover, it is rather easy to describe, in particular for the restricted case of so-called extended
VAs. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm empirically using a prototype implementation.
