One aim of data mining is the identification of interesting structures in data. Basic properties
of the empirical distribution, such as skewness and an eventual clipping, i.e., hard limits in value
ranges, need to be assessed. Of particular interest is the question, whether the data originates
from one process, or contains subsets related to different states of the data producing process.
Data visualization tools should deliver a sensitive picture of the univariate probability density
distribution (PDF) for each feature. Visualization tools for PDFs are typically kernel density
estimates and range from the classical histogram to modern tools like bean or violin plots. Conventional
methods have difficulties in visualizing the pdf in case of uniform, multimodal, skewed and clipped
data if density estimation parameters remain in a default setting. As a consequence, a new visualization
tool called Mirrored Density plot (MD plot) is proposed which is particularly designed to discover
interesting structures in continuous features. The MD plot does not require any adjustments of
parameters of density estimation which makes the usage compelling for non-experts. The visualization
tools are evaluated in comparison to statistical tests for the typical challenges of explorative
distribution analysis. The results are presented on bimodal Gaussian and skewed distributions
as well as several features with published pdfs. In exploratory data analysis of 12 features describing
the quarterly financial statements, when statistical testing becomes a demanding task, only the
MD plots can identify the structure of their pdfs. Overall, the MD plot can outperform the methods
mentioned above.
