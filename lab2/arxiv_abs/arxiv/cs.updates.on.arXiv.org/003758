In this work, we analyze the performance of the uplink (UL) of a massive MIMO network considering
an asymptotically large number of antennas at base stations (BSs). We model the locations of BSs
as a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) and assume that their service regions are limited to
their respective Poisson-Voronoi cells (PVCs). Further, for each PVC, based on a threshold radius,
we model the cell center (CC) region as the Johnson-Mehl (JM) cell of its BS while rest of the PVC is
deemed as the cell edge (CE) region. The CC and CE users are located uniformly at random independently
of each other in the JM cell and CE region, respectively. In addition, we consider a fractional pilot
reuse (FPR) scheme where two different sets of pilot sequences are used for CC and CE users with the
objective of reducing the interference due to pilot contamination for CE users. Based on the above
system model, we derive analytical expressions for the UL signal-to-interference-and-noise
ratio (SINR) coverage probability and average spectral efficiency (SE) for randomly selected
CC and CE users. In addition, we present an approximate expression for the average cell SE. One of
the key intermediate results in our analysis is the approximate but accurate characterization
of the distributions of the CC and CE areas of a typical cell. Another key intermediate step is the
accurate characterization of the pair correlation functions of the point processes formed by the
interfering CC and CE users that subsequently enables the coverage probability analysis. From
our system analysis, we present a partitioning rule for the number of pilot sequences to be used for
CC and CE users as a function of threshold radius that improves the average CE user SE while achieving
similar CC user SE with respect to unity pilot reuse.
