Motivation: Seed location filtering is critical in DNA read mapping, a process where billions of
DNA fragments (reads) sampled from a donor are mapped onto a reference genome to identify genomic
variants of the donor. State-of-the-art read mappers 1) quickly generate possible mapping locations
for seeds (i.e., smaller segments) within each read, 2) extract reference sequences at each of the
mapping locations, and 3) check similarity between each read and its associated reference sequences
with a computationally-expensive algorithm (i.e., sequence alignment) to determine the origin
of the read. A seed location filter comes into play before alignment, discarding seed locations
that alignment would deem a poor match. The ideal seed location filter would discard all poor match
locations prior to alignment such that there is no wasted computation on unnecessary alignments.
Results: We propose a novel seed location filtering algorithm, GRIM-Filter, optimized to exploit
3D-stacked memory systems that integrate computation within a logic layer stacked under memory
layers, to perform processing-in-memory (PIM). GRIM-Filter quickly filters seed locations by
1) introducing a new representation of coarse-grained segments of the reference genome, and 2)
using massively-parallel in-memory operations to identify read presence within each coarse-grained
segment. Our evaluations show that for a sequence alignment error tolerance of 0.05, GRIM-Filter
1) reduces the false negative rate of filtering by 5.59x--6.41x, and 2) provides an end-to-end read
mapper speedup of 1.81x--3.65x, compared to a state-of-the-art read mapper employing the best
previous seed location filtering algorithm. Availability: The code is available online at: https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/GRIM
