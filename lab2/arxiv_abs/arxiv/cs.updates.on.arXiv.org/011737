Context. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the go-to method for fast
object detection and classification on natural images. This opens the door for astrophysical parameter
inference on the exponentially increasing amount of sky survey data. Until now, star cluster analysis
was based on integral or resolved stellar photometry, which limits the amount of information that
can be extracted from individual pixels of cluster images. Aims. We aim to create a CNN capable of
inferring star cluster evolutionary, structural, and environmental parameters from multi-band
images, as well to demonstrate its capabilities in discriminating genuine clusters from galactic
stellar backgrounds. Methods. A CNN based on the deep residual network (ResNet) architecture was
created and trained to infer cluster ages, masses, sizes, and extinctions, with respect to the degeneracies
between them. Mock clusters placed on M83 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images utilizing three photometric
passbands (F336W, F438W, and F814W) were used. The CNN is also capable of predicting the likelihood
of a cluster's presence in an image, as well as quantifying its visibility (signal-to-noise). Results.
The CNN was tested on mock images of artificial clusters and has demonstrated reliable inference
results for clusters of ages $\lesssim$100 Myr, extinctions $A_V$ between 0 and 3 mag, masses between
$3\times10^3$ and $3\times10^5$ ${\rm M_\odot}$, and sizes between 0.04 and 0.4 arcsec at the distance
of the M83 galaxy. Real M83 galaxy cluster parameter inference tests were performed with objects
taken from previous studies and have demonstrated consistent results.
