Datacenters are the main infrastructure on top of which cloud computing services are offered. Such
infrastructure may be shared by a large number of tenants and applications generating a spectrum
of datacenter traffic. Delay sensitive applications and applications with specific Service Level
Agreements (SLAs), generate deadline constrained flows, while other applications initiate flows
that are desired to be delivered as early as possible. As a result, datacenter traffic is a mix of two
types of flows: deadline and regular. There are several scheduling policies for either traffic
type with focus on minimizing completion times or deadline miss rate. In this report, we apply several
scheduling policies to mix traffic scenario while varying the ratio of regular to deadline traffic.
We consider FCFS (First Come First Serve), SRPT (Shortest Remaining Processing Time) and Fair Sharing
as deadline agnostic approaches and a combination of Earliest Deadline First (EDF) with either
FCFS or SRPT as deadline-aware schemes. In addition, for the latter, we consider both cases of prioritizing
deadline traffic (Deadline First) and prioritizing regular traffic (Deadline Last). We study
both light-tailed and heavy-tailed flow size distributions and measure mean, median and tail flow
completion times (FCT) for regular flows along with Deadline Miss Rate (DMR) and average lateness
for deadline flows. We also consider two operation regimes of lightly-loaded (low utilization)
and heavily-loaded (high utilization). We find that performance of deadline-aware schemes is
highly dependent on fraction of deadline traffic. With light-tailed flow sizes, we find that FCFS
performs better in terms of tail times and average lateness while SRPT performs better in average
times and deadline miss rate. For heavy-tailed flow sizes, except for tail times, SRPT performs
better in all other metrics.
