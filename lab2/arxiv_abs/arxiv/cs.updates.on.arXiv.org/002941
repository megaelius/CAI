We develop a framework for goal oriented optimal design of experiments (GOODE) for large-scale
Bayesian linear inverse problems governed by PDEs. This framework differs from classical Bayesian
optimal design of experiments (ODE) in the following sense: we seek experimental designs that minimize
the posterior uncertainty in a predicted quantity of interest (QoI) rather than the estimated parameter
itself. This is suitable for scenarios in which the solution of an inverse problem is an intermediate
step and the estimated parameter is then used to compute a prediction QoI. In such problems, a GOODE
approach has two benefits: the designs can avoid wastage of experimental resources by a targeted
collection of data, and the resulting design criteria are computationally easier to evaluate due
to the often low dimensionality of prediction QoIs. We present two modified design criteria, A-GOODE
and D-GOODE, which are natural analogues of classical Bayesian A- and D-optimal criteria. We analyze
the connections to other ODE criteria, and provide interpretations for the GOODE criteria by using
tools from information theory. Then, we develop an efficient gradient-based optimization framework
for solving the GOODE optimization problems. Additionally, we present comprehensive numerical
experiments testing the various aspects of the presented approach. The driving application is
the optimal placement of sensors to identify the source of contaminants in a diffusion and transport
problem. We enforce sparsity of the sensor placements using an $\ell_1$-norm penalty approach,
and propose a practical strategy for specifying the associated penalty parameter.
