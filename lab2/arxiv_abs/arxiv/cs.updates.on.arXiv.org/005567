Effective data analytics on data collected from the real world usually begins with a notoriously
expensive pre-processing step of data transformation and wrangling. Programming By Example (PBE)
systems have been proposed to automatically infer transformations using simple examples that
users provide as hints. However, an important usability issue - verification - limits the effective
use of such PBE data transformation systems, since the verification process is often effort-consuming
and unreliable. We propose a data transformation paradigm design CLX (pronounced "clicks") with
a focus on facilitating verification for end users in a PBE-like data transformation. CLX performs
pattern clustering in both input and output data, which allows the user to verify at the pattern level,
rather than the data instance level, without having to write any regular expressions, thereby significantly
reducing user verification effort. Thereafter, CLX automatically generates transformation
programs as regular-expression replace operations that are easy for average users to verify. We
experimentally compared the CLX prototype with both FlashFill, a state-of-the-art PBE data transformation
tool, and Trifacta, an influential system supporting interactive data transformation. The results
show improvements over the state of the art tools in saving user verification effort, without loss
of efficiency or expressive power. In a user effort study on data sets of various sizes, when the data
size grew by a factor of 30, the user verification time required by the CLX prototype grew by 1.3x whereas
that required by FlashFill grew by 11.4x. In another test assessing the users' understanding of
the transformation logic - a key ingredient in effective verification - CLX users achieved a success
rate about twice that of FlashFill users.
