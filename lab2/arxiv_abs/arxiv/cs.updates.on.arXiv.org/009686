We consider the Generalized Trust Region Subproblem (GTRS) of minimizing a nonconvex quadratic
objective over a nonconvex quadratic constraint. A lifting of this problem recasts the GTRS as minimizing
a linear objective subject to two nonconvex quadratic constraints. Our first main contribution
is structural: we give an explicit description of the convex hull of this nonconvex set in terms of
the generalized eigenvalues of an associated matrix pencil. This result may be of interest in building
relaxations for nonconvex quadratic programs. Moreover, this result allows us to reformulate
the GTRS as the minimization of two convex quadratic functions in the original space. Our next set
of contributions is algorithmic: we present an algorithm for solving the GTRS up to an epsilon additive
error based on this reformulation. We carefully handle numerical issues that arise from inexact
generalized eigenvalue and eigenvector computations and establish explicit running time guarantees
for these algorithms. Notably, our algorithms run in linear (in the size of the input) time. Furthermore,
our algorithm for computing an epsilon-optimal solution has a slightly-improved running time
dependence on epsilon over the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our analysis shows that the dominant
cost in solving the GTRS lies in solving a generalized eigenvalue problem -- establishing a natural
connection between these problems. Finally, generalizations of our convex hull results allow
us to apply our algorithms and their theoretical guarantees directly to equality-, interval-,
and hollow- constrained variants of the GTRS. This gives the first linear-time algorithm in the
literature for these variants of the GTRS.
