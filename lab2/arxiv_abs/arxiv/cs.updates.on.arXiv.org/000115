Improving energy efficiency is key to network providers maintaining profit levels and an acceptable
carbon footprint in the face of rapidly increasing data traffic in cellular networks in the coming
years. The energy-saving concept studied in this paper is the adaptation of a base station's (BS's)
transmit power levels and coverage area according to channel conditions and traffic load. The traffic
load in cellular networks exhibits significant fluctuations in both space and time, which can be
exploited, through cell range adaptation, for energy saving. In this paper, we design short- and
long-term BS power control (STPC and LTPC respectively) policies for the OFDMA-based downlink
of a single-cell system, where bandwidth is dynamically and equally shared among a random number
of mobile users (MUs). STPC is a function of all MUs' channel gains that maintains the required user-level
quality of service (QoS), while LTPC (including BS on-off control) is a function of traffic density
that minimizes the long-term energy consumption at the BS under a minimum throughput constraint.
We first develop a power scaling law that relates the (short-term) average transmit power at BS with
the given cell range and MU density. Based on this result, we derive the optimal (long-term) transmit
adaptation policy by considering a joint range adaptation and LTPC problem. By identifying the
fact that energy saving at BS essentially comes from two major energy saving mechanisms (ESMs),
i.e. range adaptation and BS on-off power control, we propose low-complexity suboptimal schemes
with various combinations of the two ESMs to investigate their impacts on system energy consumption.
It is shown that when the network throughput is low, BS on-off power control is the most effective
ESM, while when the network throughput is higher, range adaptation becomes more effective.
