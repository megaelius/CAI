Ultrasound imaging makes use of backscattering of waves during their interaction with scatterers
present in biological tissues. Simulation of synthetic ultrasound images is a challenging problem
on account of inability to completely model various factors of which some include intra-/inter
scanline interference, transducer to surface coupling, artifacts on transducer elements, inhomogeneous
shadowing and nonlinear attenuation. While various approaches to ultrasound simulation has been
developed, approaches that produce patho-realistic images typically solve wave space equations
making it computationally expensive and slow to operate. We propose a generative adversarial network
(GAN) inspired approach for fast simulation of patho-realistic ultrasound images. We apply the
framework to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) simulation. A stage 0 simulation is done from the
echogenicity map of the tissue obtained from the ground truth label of ultrasound image using an
off the shelf pseudo B-mode ultrasound image simulator . The images obtained are adversarially
refined using stacked GAN. The stage I GAN generates low resolution images from the images generated
by the initial simulation. The stage II GAN further refines the output of the stage I GAN and generates
high resolution images which are patho-realistic. We demonstrate that the network generates realistic
appearing images evaluated with a visual Turing test indicating an equivocal confusion in discriminating
simulated from real. We also quantify the shift in tissue specific intensity distributions of the
real and simulated images to prove their similarity.
