The study of vertex centrality measures is a key aspect of network analysis. Naturally, such centrality
measures have been generalized to groups of vertices; for popular measures it was shown that the
problem of finding the most central group is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard. As a result, approximation algorithms
to maximize group centralities were introduced recently. Despite a nearly-linear running time,
approximation algorithms for group betweenness and (to a lesser extent) group closeness are rather
slow on large networks due to high constant overheads. That is why we introduce GED-Walk centrality,
a new submodular group centrality measure inspired by Katz centrality. In contrast to closeness
and betweenness, it considers walks of any length rather than shortest paths, with shorter walks
having a higher contribution. We define algorithms that (i) efficiently approximate the GED-Walk
score of a given group and (ii) efficiently approximate the (proved to be $\mathcal{NP}$-hard)
problem of finding a group with highest GED-Walk score. Experiments on several real-world datasets
show that scores obtained by GED-Walk improve performance on common graph mining tasks such as collective
classification and graph-level classification. An evaluation of empirical running times demonstrates
that maximizing GED-Walk (in approximation) is two orders of magnitude faster compared to group
betweenness approximation and for group sizes $\leq 100$ one to two orders faster than group closeness
approximation. For graphs with tens of millions of edges, approximate GED-Walk maximization typically
needs less than one minute. Furthermore, our experiments suggest that the maximization algorithms
scale linearly with the size of the input graph and the size of the group.
