The failure of a complex and safety critical industrial asset can have extremely high consequences.
Close monitoring for early detection of abnormal system conditions is therefore required. Data-driven
solutions to this problem have been limited for two reasons: First, safety critical assets are designed
and maintained to be highly reliable and faults are rare. Fault detection can thus not be supervised.
Second, complex industrial systems usually have long lifetime and face very different operating
conditions. Collecting a representative training dataset would require long observation periods,
and delay the monitoring of the system. In this paper, we propose a methodology to monitor the systems
in their early life. To do so, we enhance the training dataset with other units from a fleet, for which
longer observations are available. Since each unit has its own specificity, we propose to extract
features made independent of their origin by three unsupervised feature alignment techniques.
First, using a variational encoder, we impose a shared latent space for both units. Second, we introduce
a new loss designed to conserve inter-point spacial relationships between the input and the latent
spaces. Last, we propose to train in an adversarial manner a discriminator on the origin of the features.
Once aligned, the features are fed to a one-class classifier to monitor the health of the system.
By exploring the different combinations of the proposed alignment strategies, and by testing them
on a real case study, a fleet composed of 112 power plants operated in different geographical locations
and under very different operating regimes, we demonstrate that this alignment is necessary and
beneficial.
