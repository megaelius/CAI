We formulate the abnormal event detection problem as an outlier detection task and we propose a two-stage
algorithm based on k-means clustering and one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) to eliminate
outliers. After extracting motion features from the training video containing only normal events,
we apply k-means clustering to find clusters representing different types of motion. In the first
stage, we consider that clusters with fewer samples (with respect to a given threshold) contain
only outliers and we eliminate these clusters altogether. In the second stage, we shrink the borders
of the remaining clusters by training a one-class SVM model on each cluster. To detected abnormal
events in the test video, we analyze each test sample and consider its maximum normality score provided
by the trained one-class SVM models, based on the intuition that a test sample can belong to only one
cluster of normal motion. If the test sample does not fit well in any narrowed cluster, than it is labeled
as abnormal. We also combine our approach based on motion features with a recent approach based on
deep appearance features extracted with pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN). We
combine our two-stage algorithm with the deep framework using a late fusion strategy, keeping the
pipelines of the two approaches independent. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art
supervised and unsupervised methods on four benchmark data sets. The empirical results indicate
that our abnormal event detection framework can achieve better results in most cases, while processing
the test video in real-time at 30 frames per second on CPU.
