A book's success/popularity depends on various parameters - extrinsic and intrinsic. In this paper,
we study how the book reading characteristics might influence the popularity of a book. Towards
this objective, we perform a cross-platform study of Goodreads entities and attempt to establish
the connection between various Goodreads entities and the popular books ("Amazon best sellers").
We analyze the collective reading behavior on Goodreads platform and quantify various characteristic
features of the Goodreads entities to identify differences between these Amazon best sellers (ABS)
and the other non-best selling books. We then develop a prediction model using the characteristic
features to predict if a book shall become a best seller after one month (15 days) since its publication.
On a balanced set, we are able to achieve a very high average accuracy of 88.72% (85.66%) for the prediction
where the other competitive class contains books which are randomly selected from the Goodreads
dataset. Our method primarily based on features derived from user posts and genre related characteristic
properties achieves an improvement of 16.4% over the traditional popularity factors (ratings,
reviews) based baseline methods. We also evaluate our model with two more competitive set of books
a) that are both highly rated and have received a large number of reviews (but are not best sellers)
(HRHR) and b) Goodreads Choice Awards Nominated books which are non-best sellers (GCAN). We are
able to achieve quite good results with very high average accuracy of 87.1% and as well a high ROC for
ABS vs GCAN. For ABS vs HRHR, our model yields a high average accuracy of 86.22%.
