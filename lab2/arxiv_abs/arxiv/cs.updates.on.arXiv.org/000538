The existing combinatorial methods for iso-surface computation are efficient for pure visualization
purposes, but it is known that the resulting iso-surfaces can have holes, and topological problems
like missing or wrong connectivity can appear. To avoid such problems, we introduce a graph-theoretical
method for the computation of iso-surfaces on cuboid meshes in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The method for the
generation of iso-surfaces employs labeled cuboid graphs $G(V,E,\mathcal{F})$ such that $V$
is the set of vertices of a cuboid $C\subset\mathbb{R}^3$, $E$ is the set of edges of $C$ and $\mathcal{F}\,:\,V\rightarrow
[0,1]$. The nodes of $G$ are weighted by the values of $\mathcal{F}$ which represents the volumetric
information, e.g.\ from a Volume of Fluid method. Using a given iso-level $c\in (0,1)$, we first
obtain all iso-points, i.e.\ points where the value $c$ is attained by the edge-interpolated $\mathcal{F}$-field.
The iso-surface is then built from iso-elements which are composed of triangles and are such that
their polygonal boundary has only iso-points as vertices. All vertices lie on the faces of a single
mesh cell. We give a proof that the generated iso-surface is connected up to the boundary of the domain
and it can be decomposed into different oriented components. Two different components may have
discrete points or line segments in common. The graph-theoretical method for the computation of
iso-surfaces developed in this paper enables to recover local information of the iso-surface that
can be used e.g.\ to compute discrete mean curvature and to solve surface PDEs. Concerning the computational
effort, the resulting algorithm is as efficient as existing combinatorial methods.
