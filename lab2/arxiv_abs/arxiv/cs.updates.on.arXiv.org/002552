The explosive availability of remote sensing images has challenged supervised classification
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), as training samples tend to be highly limited
due to the expensive and laborious task of ground truthing. The temporal correlation and spectral
similarity between multitemporal images have opened up an opportunity to alleviate this problem.
In this study, a SVM-based Sequential Classifier Training (SCT-SVM) approach is proposed for multitemporal
remote sensing image classification. The approach leverages the classifiers of previous images
to reduce the required number of training samples for the classifier training of an incoming image.
For each incoming image, a rough classifier is firstly predicted based on the temporal trend of a
set of previous classifiers. The predicted classifier is then fine-tuned into a more accurate position
with current training samples. This approach can be applied progressively to sequential image
data, with only a small number of training samples being required from each image. Experiments were
conducted with Sentinel-2A multitemporal data over an agricultural area in Australia. Results
showed that the proposed SCT-SVM achieved better classification accuracies compared with two
state-of-the-art model transfer algorithms. When training data are insufficient, the overall
classification accuracy of the incoming image was improved from 76.18% to 94.02% with the proposed
SCT-SVM, compared with those obtained without the assistance from previous images. These results
demonstrate that the leverage of a priori information from previous images can provide advantageous
assistance for later images in multitemporal image classification.
