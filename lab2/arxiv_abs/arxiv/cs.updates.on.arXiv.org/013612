We consider the influence maximization problem (selecting $k$ seeds in a network maximizing the
expected total influence) on undirected graphs under the linear threshold model. On the one hand,
we prove that the greedy algorithm always achieves a $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k + \Omega(1/k^3))$-approximation,
showing that the greedy algorithm does slightly better on undirected graphs than the generic $(1-
(1 - 1/k)^k)$ bound which also applies to directed graphs. On the other hand, we show that substantial
improvement on this bound is impossible by presenting an example where the greedy algorithm can
obtain at most a $(1- (1 - 1/k)^k + O(1/k^{0.2}))$ approximation. This result stands in contrast
to the previous work on the independent cascade model. Like the linear threshold model, the greedy
algorithm obtains a $(1-(1-1/k)^k)$-approximation on directed graphs in the independent cascade
model. However, Khanna and Lucier showed that, in undirected graphs, the greedy algorithm performs
substantially better: a $(1-(1-1/k)^k + c)$ approximation for constant $c > 0$. Our results show
that, surprisingly, no such improvement occurs in the linear threshold model. Finally, we show
that, under the linear threshold model, the approximation ratio $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k)$ is tight if 1)
the graph is directed or 2) the vertices are weighted. In other words, under either of these two settings,
the greedy algorithm cannot achieve a $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k + f(k))$-approximation for any positive function
$f(k)$. The result in setting 2) is again in a sharp contrast to Khanna and Lucier's $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k
+ c)$-approximation result for the independent cascade model, where the $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k + c)$ approximation
guarantee can be extended to the setting where vertices are weighted. We also discuss extensions
to more generalized settings including those with edge-weighted graphs.
