Nowadays, the demand for optimized services in urban environments to provide better society wellness
is increasing. In this sense, ground transportation in dense urban environments has been facing
challenges for many years (e.g., congestion and resilience). One import outcome of the effort made
toward the creation of new concepts for enhancing urban transportation is the Urban Air Mobility
(UAM) concept. UAM aims at enhancing city transportation services using manned and unmanned vehicles.
However, these operations bring many challenges to be faced, e.g., the interaction between the
controller agent and autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, trajectory planning is not a simple task
due to several factors. Firstly, the trajectories must consider a reduced minimum separation as
eVTOL vehicle are expected to operate in complex urban environments. This leads the trajectory
planning process to observe safety primitives more restrictively once the airspace is expected
to comport many vehicles that follow small minimum separation standards. Thereupon, the main goal
of the Trajectory-Based UAM Operations Simulator (TUS) is to simulate the Trajectory-Based UAM
operations in urban environments considering the presence of both manned and unmanned eVTOL vehicles.
For this, a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) approach is adopted, which considers an input (i.e.,
the eVTOL vehicles, their origin and destination, and their respective trajectories) and produces
an output (which describes if the trajectories are safe and the elapsed operation time). The main
contribution of this simulation tool is to provide a simulated environment for testing and measuring
the effectiveness (e.g., flight duration) of trajectories planned for eVTOL vehicles.
