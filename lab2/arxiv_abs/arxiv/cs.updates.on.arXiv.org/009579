Tens of millions of people live blind, and their number is ever increasing. Visual-to-auditory
sensory substitution (SS) encompasses a family of cheap, generic solutions to assist the visually
impaired by conveying visual information through sound. The required SS training is lengthy: months
of effort is necessary to reach a practical level of adaptation. There are two reasons for the tedious
training process: the elongated substituting audio signal, and the disregard for the compressive
characteristics of the human hearing system. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a novel
class of SS methods, by training deep recurrent autoencoders for image-to-sound conversion. We
successfully trained deep learning models on different datasets to execute visual-to-auditory
stimulus conversion. By constraining the visual space, we demonstrated the viability of shortened
substituting audio signals, while proposing mechanisms, such as the integration of computational
hearing models, to optimally convey visual features in the substituting stimulus as perceptually
discernible auditory components. We tested our approach in two separate cases. In the first experiment,
the author went blindfolded for 5 days, while performing SS training on hand posture discrimination.
The second experiment assessed the accuracy of reaching movements towards objects on a table. In
both test cases, above-chance-level accuracy was attained after a few hours of training. Our novel
SS architecture broadens the horizon of rehabilitation methods engineered for the visually impaired.
Further improvements on the proposed model shall yield hastened rehabilitation of the blind and
a wider adaptation of SS devices as a consequence.
