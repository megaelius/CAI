Adversarial examples are inputs with imperceptible perturbations that easily misleading deep
neural networks(DNNs). Recently, adversarial patch, with noise confined to a small and localized
patch, has emerged for its easy feasibility in real-world scenarios. However, existing strategies
failed to generate adversarial patches with strong generalization ability. In other words, the
adversarial patches were input-specific and failed to attack images from all classes, especially
unseen ones during training. To address the problem, this paper proposes a bias-based framework
to generate class-agnostic universal adversarial patches with strong generalization ability,
which exploits both the perceptual and semantic bias of models. Regarding the perceptual bias,
since DNNs are strongly biased towards textures, we exploit the hard examples which convey strong
model uncertainties and extract a textural patch prior from them by adopting the style similarities.
The patch prior is more close to decision boundaries and would promote attacks. To further alleviate
the heavy dependency on large amounts of data in training universal attacks, we further exploit
the semantic bias. As the class-wise preference, prototypes are introduced and pursued by maximizing
the multi-class margin to help universal training. Taking AutomaticCheck-out (ACO) as the typical
scenario, extensive experiments including white-box and black-box settings in both digital-world(RPC,
the largest ACO related dataset) and physical-world scenario(Taobao and JD, the world' s largest
online shopping platforms) are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
framework outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial patch attack methods.
