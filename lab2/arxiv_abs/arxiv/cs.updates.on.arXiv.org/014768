This paper describes the application of machine learning techniques to develop a state-of-the-art
detection and prediction system for spatiotemporal events found within remote sensing data; specifically,
Harmful Algal Bloom events (HABs). We propose an HAB detection system based on: a ground truth historical
record of HAB events, a novel spatiotemporal datacube representation of each event (from MODIS
and GEBCO bathymetry data) and a variety of machine learning architectures utilising state-of-the-art
spatial and temporal analysis methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) components together with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification
methods. This work has focused specifically on the case study of the detection of Karenia Brevis
Algae (K. brevis) HAB events within the coastal waters of Florida (over 2850 events from 2003 to 2018;
an order of magnitude larger than any previous machine learning detection study into HAB events).
The development of multimodal spatiotemporal datacube data structures and associated novel machine
learning methods give a unique architecture for the automatic detection of environmental events.
Specifically, when applied to the detection of HAB events it gives a maximum detection accuracy
of 91% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.81 for the Florida data considered. A HAB forecast system was also
developed where a temporal subset of each datacube was used to predict the presence of a HAB in the
future. This system was not significantly less accurate than the detection system being able to
predict with 86% accuracy up to 8 days in the future.
