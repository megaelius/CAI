Most networks tend to show complex and multiple relationships between entities. Networks are usually
modeled by graphs or hypergraphs; nonetheless a given entity can occur many times in a relationship:
this brings the need to deal with multisets instead of sets or simple edges. Diffusion processes
are useful to highlight interesting parts of a network: they usually start with a stroke at one vertex
and diffuse throughout the network to reach a uniform distribution. Several iterations of the process
are required prior to reaching a stable solution. We propose an alternative solution to highlighting
the main components of a network using a diffusion process based on exchanges: it is an iterative
two-phase step exchange process. This process allows to evaluate the importance not only of the
vertices but also of the regrouping level. To model the diffusion process, we extend the concept
of hypergraphs that are families of sets to families of multisets, that we call hb-graphs. This version
is an extended version of arXiv:1809.00190v1: the overlaps with the v1 are in black, the new content
is in blue. The contributions of this extended version are: the proofs of conservation and convergence
of the extracted sequences of the diffusion process, as well as the illustration of the speed of convergence
and comparison to classical and modified random walks; the algorithms of the exchange-based diffusion
and the modified random walk; the application to a use case based on Arxiv publications. All the figures
except one have been either modified or added in this extended version to take into account the new
developments.
