Faulty communication between team members is one of the most important factors preventing substantial
improvement in patient safety. Aviation, nuclear power and defense have been able to improve their
safety record by adopting theory and model based solutions. In contrast, healthcare's thrust towards
modern communication devices is largely devoid of theoretical foundation. The objective of this
scoping review is to compile communication theories, frameworks, and models used by high risk organizations
outside healthcare to study and resolve workplace communication issues. The healthcare databases
searched included Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycInfo. In addition, we searched engineering
and science literature to include articles in the fields of information sciences, computer sciences,
nuclear power generation, aviation, the military and other domains such as sociology that address
the science and theory of communication. Comprehensive searching was also done in the communication
studies literature. We also reviewed conference proceedings and grey literature and conducted
citation tracking. Our initial systematic search yielded 15,365 articles. Hand searching and
reviewing references resulted in a set of 181 articles. 144 full text articles were read and 40 of
them were selected to be included in the review. We were able to identify 14 theories and 12 models
which could be applied in hospital communication research. However, it must be noted that most of
them have not yet been applied in biomedical research in hospital communication and as such their
applicability can only be suggested-a gap which future research may be able to address. Formulation
of a custom model representing the unique features and complexities of communication within hospitals
is recommended.
