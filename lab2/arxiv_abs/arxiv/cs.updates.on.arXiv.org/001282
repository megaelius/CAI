Sustainability of the global environment is dependent on the accurate land cover information over
large areas. Even with the increased number of satellite systems and sensors acquiring data with
improved spectral, spatial, radiometric and temporal characteristics and the new data distribution
policy, most existing land cover datasets were derived from a pixel-based single-date multi-spectral
remotely sensed image with low accuracy. To improve the accuracy, the bottleneck is how to develop
an accurate and effective image classification technique. By incorporating and utilizing the
complete multi-spectral, multi-temporal and spatial information in remote sensing images and
considering their inherit spatial and sequential interdependence, we propose a new patch-based
RNN (PB-RNN) system tailored for multi-temporal remote sensing data. The system is designed by
incorporating distinctive characteristics in multi-temporal remote sensing data. In particular,
it uses multi-temporal-spectral-spatial samples and deals with pixels contaminated by clouds/shadow
present in the multi-temporal data series. Using a Florida Everglades ecosystem study site covering
an area of 771 square kilo-meters, the proposed PB-RNN system has achieved a significant improvement
in the classification accuracy over pixel-based RNN system, pixel-based single-imagery NN system,
pixel-based multi-images NN system, patch-based single-imagery NN system and patch-based multi-images
NN system. For example, the proposed system achieves 97.21% classification accuracy while a pixel-based
single-imagery NN system achieves 64.74%. By utilizing methods like the proposed PB-RNN one, we
believe that much more accurate land cover datasets can be produced over large areas efficiently.
