Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality that has been widely adopted for visualizing
corneal, retinal and limbal tissue structure with micron resolution. It can be used to diagnose
pathological conditions of the eye, and for developing pre-operative surgical plans. In contrast
to the posterior retina, imaging the anterior tissue structures, such as the limbus and cornea,
results in B-scans that exhibit increased speckle noise patterns and imaging artifacts. These
artifacts, such as shadowing and specularity, pose a challenge during the analysis of the acquired
volumes as they substantially obfuscate the location of tissue interfaces. To deal with the artifacts
and speckle noise patterns and accurately segment the shallowest tissue interface, we propose
a cascaded neural network framework, which comprises of a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (cGAN) and a Tissue Interface Segmentation Network (TISN). The cGAN pre-segments OCT B-scans
by removing undesired specular artifacts and speckle noise patterns just above the shallowest
tissue interface, and the TISN combines the original OCT image with the pre-segmentation to segment
the shallowest interface. We show the applicability of the cascaded framework to corneal datasets,
demonstrate that it precisely segments the shallowest corneal interface, and also show its generalization
capacity to limbal datasets. We also propose a hybrid framework, wherein the cGAN pre-segmentation
is passed to a traditional image analysis-based segmentation algorithm, and describe the improved
segmentation performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to remove severe
specular artifacts and speckle noise patterns (prior to the shallowest interface) that affects
the interpretation of anterior segment OCT datasets, thereby resulting in the accurate segmentation
of the shallowest tissue interface.
