Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) can be employed for device identification, authentication,
secret key storage, and other security tasks. However, PUFs are susceptible to modeling attacks
if a number of PUFs' challenge-response pairs (CRPs) are exposed to the adversary. Furthermore,
many of the embedded devices requiring authentication have stringent resource constraints and
thus require a lightweight authentication mechanism. We propose PUF-RLA, a PUF-based lightweight,
highly reliable authentication scheme employing binary string shuffling. The proposed scheme
enhances the reliability of PUF as well as alleviates the resource constraints by employing error
correction in the server instead of the device without compromising the security. The proposed
PUF-RLA is robust against brute force, replay, and modeling attacks. In PUF-RLA, we introduce an
inexpensive yet secure stream authentication scheme inside the device which authenticates the
server before the underlying PUF can be invoked. This prevents an adversary from brute forcing the
device's PUF to acquire CRPs essentially locking out the device from unauthorized model generation.
Additionally, we also introduce a lightweight CRP obfuscation mechanism involving XOR and shuffle
operations. Results and security analysis verify that the PUF-RLA is secure against brute force,
replay, and modeling attacks, and provides ~99% reliable authentication. In addition, PUF-RLA
provides a reduction of 63% and 74% for look-up tables (LUTs) and register count, respectively,
in FPGA compared to a recently proposed approach while providing additional authentication advantages.
