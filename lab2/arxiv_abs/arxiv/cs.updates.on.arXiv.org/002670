This deliverable reports the results of white-box methodologies and early results of the first
prototype of libraries and programming abstractions as available by project month 18 by Work Package
2 (WP2). It reports i) the latest results of Task 2.2 on white-box methodologies, programming abstractions
and libraries for developing energy-efficient data structures and algorithms and ii) the improved
results of Task 2.1 on investigating and modeling the trade-off between energy and performance
of concurrent data structures and algorithms. The work has been conducted on two main EXCESS platforms:
Intel platforms with recent Intel multicore CPUs and Movidius Myriad1 platform. Regarding white-box
methodologies, we have devised new relaxed cache-oblivious models and proposed a new power model
for Myriad1 platform and an energy model for lock-free queues on CPU platforms. For Myriad1 platform,
the im- proved model now considers both computation and data movement cost as well as architecture
and application properties. The model has been evaluated with a set of micro-benchmarks and application
benchmarks. For Intel platforms, we have generalized the model for concurrent queues on CPU platforms
to offer more flexibility according to the workers calling the data structure (parallel section
sizes of enqueuers and dequeuers are decoupled). Regarding programming abstractions and libraries,
we have continued investigat- ing the trade-offs between energy consumption and performance of
data structures such as concurrent queues and concurrent search trees based on the early results
of Task 2.1.The preliminary results show that our concurrent trees are faster and more energy efficient
than the state-of-the-art on commodity HPC and embedded platforms.
