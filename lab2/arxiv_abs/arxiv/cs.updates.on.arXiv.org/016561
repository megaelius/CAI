The problem of optimizing social welfare objectives on multi sided ride hailing platforms such
as Uber, Lyft, etc., is challenging, due to misalignment of objectives between drivers, passengers,
and the platform itself. An ideal solution aims to minimize the response time for each hyper local
passenger ride request, while simultaneously maintaining high demand satisfaction and supply
utilization across the entire city. Economists tend to rely on dynamic pricing mechanisms that
stifle price sensitive excess demand and resolve the supply demand imbalances emerging in specific
neighborhoods. In contrast, computer scientists primarily view it as a demand prediction problem
with the goal of preemptively repositioning supply to such neighborhoods using black box coordinated
multi agent deep reinforcement learning based approaches. Here, we introduce explainability
in the existing supply repositioning approaches by establishing the need for coordination between
the drivers at specific locations and times. Explicit need based coordination allows our framework
to use a simpler non deep reinforcement learning based approach, thereby enabling it to explain
its recommendations ex post. Moreover, it provides envy free recommendations i.e., drivers at
the same location and time do not envy one another's future earnings. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness, the robustness, and the generalizability of our framework. Finally,
in contrast to previous works, we make available a reinforcement learning environment for end to
end reproducibility of our work and to encourage future comparative studies.
