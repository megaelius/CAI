Traditional authentication in radio-frequency (RF) systems enable secure data communication
within a network through techniques such as digital signatures and hash-based message authentication
codes (HMAC), which suffer from key recovery attacks. State-of-the-art IoT networks such as Nest
also use Open Authentication (OAuth 2.0) protocols that are vulnerable to cross-site-recovery
forgery (CSRF), which shows that these techniques may not prevent an adversary from copying or modeling
the secret IDs or encryption keys using invasive, side channel, learning or software attacks. Physical
unclonable functions (PUF), on the other hand, can exploit manufacturing process variations to
uniquely identify silicon chips which makes a PUF-based system extremely robust and secure at low
cost, as it is practically impossible to replicate the same silicon characteristics across dies.
Taking inspiration from human communication, which utilizes inherent variations in the voice
signatures to identify a certain speaker, we present RF- PUF: a deep neural network-based framework
that allows real-time authentication of wireless nodes, using the effects of inherent process
variation on RF properties of the wireless transmitters (Tx), detected through in-situ machine
learning at the receiver (Rx) end. The proposed method utilizes the already-existing asymmetric
RF communication framework and does not require any additional circuitry for PUF generation or
feature extraction. Simulation results involving the process variations in a standard 65 nm technology
node, and features such as LO offset and I-Q imbalance detected with a neural network having 50 neurons
in the hidden layer indicate that the framework can distinguish up to 4800 transmitters with an accuracy
of 99.9% (~ 99% for 10,000 transmitters) under varying channel conditions, and without the need
for traditional preambles.
