Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) techniques aim to select locally competent classifiers for the
classification of each new test sample. Most DES techniques estimate the competence of classifiers
using a given criterion over the region of competence of the test sample (its the nearest neighbors
in the validation set). The K-Nearest Oracles Eliminate (KNORA-E) DES selects all classifiers
that correctly classify all samples in the region of competence of the test sample, if such classifier
exists, otherwise, it removes from the region of competence the sample that is furthest from the
test sample, and the process repeats. When the region of competence has samples of different classes,
KNORA-E can reduce the region of competence in such a way that only samples of a single class remain
in the region of competence, leading to the selection of locally incompetent classifiers that classify
all samples in the region of competence as being from the same class. In this paper, we propose two
DES techniques: K-Nearest Oracles Borderline (KNORA-B) and K-Nearest Oracles Borderline Imbalanced
(KNORA-BI). KNORA-B is a DES technique based on KNORA-E that reduces the region of competence but
maintains at least one sample from each class that is in the original region of competence. KNORA-BI
is a variation of KNORA-B for imbalance datasets that reduces the region of competence but maintains
at least one minority class sample if there is any in the original region of competence. Experiments
are conducted comparing the proposed techniques with 19 DES techniques from the literature using
40 datasets. The results show that the proposed techniques achieved interesting results, with
KNORA-BI outperforming state-of-art techniques.
