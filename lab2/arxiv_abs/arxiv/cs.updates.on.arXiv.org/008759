We present a computational model based on the CRISP theory (Content Representation, Intrinsic
Sequences, and Pattern completion) of the hippocampus that allows to continuously store pattern
sequences online in a one-shot fashion. Rather than storing a sequence in CA3, CA3 provides a pre-trained
sequence that is hetero-associated with the input sequence, which allows the system to perform
one-shot learning. Plasticity on a short time scale therefore only happens in the incoming and outgoing
connections of CA3. Stored sequences can later be recalled from a single cue pattern. We identify
the pattern separation performed by subregion DG to be necessary for storing sequences that contain
correlated patterns. A design principle of the model is that we use a single learning rule named Hebbiand-escent
to train all parts of the system. Hebbian-descent has an inherent forgetting mechanism that allows
the system to continuously memorize new patterns while forgetting early stored ones. The model
shows a plausible behavior when noisy and new patterns are presented and has a rather high capacity
of about 40% in terms of the number of neurons in CA3. One notable property of our model is that it is
capable of `boot-strapping' (improving) itself without external input in a process we refer to
as `dreaming'. Besides artificially generated input sequences we also show that the model works
with sequences of encoded handwritten digits or natural images. To our knowledge this is the first
model of the hippocampus that allows to store correlated pattern sequences online in a one-shot
fashion without a consolidation process, which can instantaneously be recalled later.
