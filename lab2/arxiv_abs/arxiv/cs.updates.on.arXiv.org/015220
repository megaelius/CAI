This paper provides a compositional scheme based on dissipativity approaches for constructing
finite abstractions of continuous-time continuous-space stochastic control systems. The proposed
framework enjoys the structure of the interconnection topology and employs a notion of stochastic
storage functions, that describe joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems and their
abstractions. By utilizing those stochastic storage functions, one can establish a relation between
continuous-time continuous-space stochastic systems and their finite counterparts while quantifying
probabilistic distances between their output trajectories. Consequently, one can employ the
finite system as a suitable substitution of the continuous-time one in the controller design process
with a guaranteed error bound. In this respect, we first leverage dissipativity-type compositional
conditions for the compositional quantification of the distance between the interconnection
of continuous-time continuous-space stochastic systems and that of their discrete-time (finite
or infinite) abstractions. We then consider a specific class of stochastic affine systems and construct
their finite abstractions together with their corresponding stochastic storage functions. The
effectiveness of the proposed results is demonstrated by applying them to a temperature regulation
in a circular network containing 100 rooms and compositionally constructing a discrete-time abstraction
from its original continuous-time dynamic. The constructed discrete-time abstraction is then
utilized as a substitute to compositionally synthesize policies keeping the temperature of each
room in a comfort zone.
