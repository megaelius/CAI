Current developments in nanotechnology make electromagnetic communication (EC) possible at
the nanoscale for applications involving Wireless [Body] Sensor Networks (W[B]SNs). This specialized
branch of WSN has emerged as an important research area contributing to medical treatment, social
welfare, and sports. The concept is based on the interaction of integrated nanoscale machines by
means of wireless communications. One key hurdle for advancing nanocommunications is the lack
of an apposite networking protocol to address the upcoming needs of the nanonetworks. Recently,
some key challenges have been identified, such as nanonodes with extreme energy constraints, limited
computational capabilities, Terahertz frequency bands with limited transmission range, etc.,
in designing protocols for wireless nanosensor networks (WNN). This work proposes an improved
performance scheme of nanocommunication over Terahertz bands for wireless BSNs making it suitable
for smart e-health applications. The scheme contains -- a new energy-efficient forwarding routine
for EC in WNN consisting of hybrid clusters with centralized scheduling, a model designed for channel
behavior taking into account the aggregated impact of molecular absorption, spreading loss, and
shadowing, and an energy model for energy harvesting and consumption. The outage probability is
derived for both single and multilinks and extended to determine the outage capacity. The outage
probability for a multilink is derived using a cooperative fusion technique at a predefined fusion
node. Simulated using a Nano-Sim simulator, performance of the proposed model has been evaluated
for energy efficiency, outage capacity, and outage probability. The results demonstrate the efficiency
of the proposed scheme through maximized energy utilization in both single and multihop communication,
multisensor fusion enhances the link quality of the transmission.
