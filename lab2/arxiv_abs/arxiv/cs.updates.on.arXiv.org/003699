Visualization of the massive data is a challenging endeavor. Extracting data and providing graphical
representations can aid in its effective utilization in terms of interpretation and knowledge
discovery. Publishing research articles has become a way of life for academicians. The scholarly
publications can shape-up the professional growth of authors and also expand the research and technological
growth of a country, continent and other demographic regions. Scholarly articles have grown in
gigantic numbers that are published in different domains by various journals. Information related
to articles, authors, their affiliations, number of citations, country, publisher, references
and other information is like a gold mine for statisticians and data analysts. This data when used
skillfully, via visual analysis tool, can provide valuable understanding and can aid in deeper
exposition for researchers working in domains like scientometrics and bibliometrics. Since the
data is not readily available, we used Google scholar, a comprehensive and free repository of scholarly
articles, as data source for our study. Data was scraped from Google scholar and stored as a graph
and later visualized in the form of nodes and its relationships, which offered discerning and concealed
information of growing impact of articles, journals and authors in their domains. Not only this,
evident domain shift of an author, various research domains spread for an author, predicting emerging
domain and subdomains, detecting cartel behavior at Journal and author-level was also depicted
by graphical analysis. Neo4j graph database was used in the background to help store the data in structured
manner.
