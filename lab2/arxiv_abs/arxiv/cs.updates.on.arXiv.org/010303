The problem of online matching with stochastic rewards is a generalization of the online bipartite
matching problem where each edge has a probability of success. When a match is made it succeeds with
the probability of the corresponding edge. Introducing this model, Mehta and Panigrahi (FOCS 2012)
focused on the special case of identical and vanishingly small edge probabilities and gave an online
algorithm which is 0.567 competitive against a deterministic offline LP. For the case of vanishingly
small but heterogeneous probabilities Mehta et al.\ (SODA 2015), gave a 0.534 competitive algorithm
against the same LP benchmark. We study a generalization of the problem to vertex-weighted graphs.
To the best of our knowledge, no results beating $1/2$ were previously known for this setting, even
for identical probabilities. We improve on this in two ways. First, we show that a natural generalization
of the \textbf{Perturbed-Greedy} algorithm achieves the best possible competitive ratio of $(1-1/e)$,
when probabilities decompose as a product of two factors, one corresponding to each vertex of the
edge. Second, we give a deterministic $0.596$ competitive algorithm for the case of fully heterogeneous
but vanishingly small edge probabilities. A key contribution of our approach is the use of novel
path-based formulations. These allow us to compare against the natural benchmark of clairvoyant
(offline) algorithms that know the sequence of arrivals and the edge probabilities in advance,
but not the outcomes of potential matches. The idea of a path-based program to compare against clairvoyant
algorithms may be of independent interest in other online settings.
