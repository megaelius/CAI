The concept of Industry 4.0 brings a disruption into the processing industry. It is characterised
by a high degree of intercommunication, embedded computation, resulting in a decentralised and
distributed handling of data. Additionally, cloud-storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
approaches enhance a centralised storage and handling of data. This often takes place in third-party
networks. Furthermore, Industry 4.0 is driven by novel business cases. Lot sizes of one, customer
individual production, observation of process state and progress in real-time and remote maintenance,
just to name a few. All of these new business cases make use of the novel technologies. However, cyber
security has not been an issue in industry. Industrial networks have been considered physically
separated from public networks. Additionally, the high level of uniqueness of any industrial network
was said to prevent attackers from exploiting flaws. Those assumptions are inherently broken by
the concept of Industry 4.0. As a result, an abundance of attack vectors is created. In the past, attackers
have used those attack vectors in spectacular fashions. Especially Small and Mediumsized Enterprises
(SMEs) in Germany struggle to adapt to these challenges. Reasons are the cost required for technical
solutions and security professionals. In order to enable SMEs to cope with the growing threat in
the cyberspace, the research project IUNO Insec aims at providing and improving security solutions
that can be used without specialised security knowledge. The project IUNO Insec is briefly introduced
in this work. Furthermore, contributions in the field of intrusion detection, especially machine
learning-based solutions, for industrial environments provided by the authors are presented
and set into context.
