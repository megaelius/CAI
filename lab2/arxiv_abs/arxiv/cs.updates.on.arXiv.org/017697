In an organization, tasks called projects that require several skills, are generally assigned
to teams rather than individuals. The problem of choosing a right team for a given task with minimal
communication cost is known as team formation problem and many algorithms have been proposed in
the literature. We propose an algorithm that exploits the community structure of the social network
and forms a team by choosing a leader along with its neighbours from within a community. This algorithm
is different from the skill-centric algorithms in the literature which start by searching for each
skill, the suitable experts and do not explicitly consider the structure of the underlying social
network. The strategy of community-based team formation called TFC leads to a scalable approach
that obtains teams within reasonable time over very large networks. Further, for one task our algorithms
TFC-R and TFC-N generate multiple teams from the communities which is show-cased as a case-study
in the paper. The experimentation is carried out on the well-known DBLP data set where the task is
considered as writing a research paper and the words of the title are considered as skills. Team formation
problem is translated to finding possible authors for the given paper, who have the required skills
and having least communication cost. In the process, we build a much larger bench-mark data set from
DBLP for team formation for experimentation. Even though the benchmark algorithm Rarestfirst
takes least time, our algorithms TFC-N and TFC-R give much better communication cost. They also
outperform the standard algorithms like MinLD and MinSD with respect to the time taken in finding
a team. The time taken by our algorithms on communities are several orders faster than the time taken
on the larger network without compromising too much on the communication cost.
