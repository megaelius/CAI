We study the problem of recovering an unknown signal $\boldsymbol x$ given measurements obtained
from a generalized linear model with a Gaussian sensing matrix. Two popular solutions are based
on a linear estimator $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}$ and a spectral estimator $\hat{\boldsymbol
x}^{\rm s}$. The former is a data-dependent linear combination of the columns of the measurement
matrix, and its analysis is quite simple. The latter is the principal eigenvector of a data-dependent
matrix, and a recent line of work has studied its performance. In this paper, we show how to optimally
combine $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$. At the heart of our analysis
is the exact characterization of the joint empirical distribution of $(\boldsymbol x, \hat{\boldsymbol
x}^{\rm L}, \hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s})$ in the high-dimensional limit. This allows us to compute
the Bayes-optimal combination of $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm
s}$, given the limiting distribution of the signal $\boldsymbol x$. When the distribution of the
signal is Gaussian, then the Bayes-optimal combination has the form $\theta\hat{\boldsymbol
x}^{\rm L}+\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$ and we derive the optimal combination coefficient. In
order to establish the limiting distribution of $(\boldsymbol x, \hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L},
\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s})$, we design and analyze an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm
whose iterates give $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}$ and approach $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the improvement of the proposed combination with respect to
the two methods considered separately.
