Principle Equation of Motion (for walkers) is derived that later results in introducing two piecewise-continuous
dynamical systems namely Simplified Walking Model (SWM) and Complete Walking Model (CWM) which
both describe the behavior of walker with emphasis on the motion in horizontal plane. By making some
realistic assumptions based on human natural walking, a simplified equation of motion named Step-to-Step
Equation of Walking is formulated. By imposing repetition condition on this equation, we reach
to a significant finding named Simple and Compound Motion Cycles as general solutions of steady
walking. Among motion cycles, Simple Forward Motion Cycle represents normal walking pattern.
These cycles have marginal stability that in practice cause the motion to diverge exponentially
even under slight disturbance. By defining stabilization of walking as guidance of a motion initiated
from arbitrary initial states to a desired motion cycle and controlling the motion about it, two
major strategies are presented for stability control of the walkers; 1) Continuous altering of
Center of Pressure (CoP) within support polygon, and 2) Continual planning of the step length and
duration. Using these two strategies and based on Simplified Walking Model (SWM), four methods
of stability control named generally as Motion Cycle Stabilizers are proposed and their theoretical
aspects are inspected. To consider the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed stabilizers on
Complete Model of Walking (CWM), some simulations are performed on a physical model with realistic
constraints. to overcome the deficiencies of the Stabilizers, method of Optimal Stability Control
is proposed to complete the solution. Simulations show that the proposed approach for stabilization
of biped walkers provides us with a more robust solution compared to traditional approaches and
maximally guarantee the stability of walkers.
