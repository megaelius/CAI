This paper introduces a new mobile sensor scheduling problem, involving a single robot tasked with
monitoring several events of interest that occur at different locations. Of particular interest
is the monitoring of transient events that can not be easily forecast. Application areas range from
natural phenomena ({\em e.g.}, monitoring abnormal seismic activity around a volcano using a ground
robot) to urban activities ({\em e.g.}, monitoring early formations of traffic congestion using
an aerial robot). Motivated by those and many other examples, this paper focuses on problems in which
the precise occurrence times of the events are unknown {\em a priori}, but statistics for their inter-arrival
times are available. The robot's task is to monitor the events to optimize the following two objectives:
{\em (i)} maximize the number of events observed and {\em (ii)} minimize the delay between two consecutive
observations of events occurring at the same location. The paper considers the case when a robot
is tasked with optimizing the event observations in a balanced manner, following a cyclic patrolling
route. First, assuming the cyclic ordering of stations is known, we prove the existence and uniqueness
of the optimal solution, and show that the optimal solution has desirable convergence and robustness
properties. Our constructive proof also produces an efficient algorithm for computing the unique
optimal solution with $O(n)$ time complexity, in which $n$ is the number of stations, with $O(\log
n)$ time complexity for incrementally adding or removing stations. Except for the algorithm, most
of the analysis remains valid when the cyclic order is unknown. We then provide a polynomial-time
approximation scheme that gives a $(1+\epsilon)$-optimal solution for this more general, NP-hard
problem.
