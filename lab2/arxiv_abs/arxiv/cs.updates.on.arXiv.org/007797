Energy storage units (ESUs) enable several attractive features of modern smart grids such as enhanced
grid resilience, effective demand response, and reduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging
of ESUs stresses the power system and can lead to a blackout. On the other hand, existing charging
coordination mechanisms suffer from several limitations. First, the need for a central charging
coordinator (CC) presents a single point of failure that jeopardizes the effectiveness of the charging
coordination. Second, a transparent charging coordination mechanism does not exist where users
are not aware whether the CC is honest or not in coordination charging requests among them in a fair
way. Third, existing mechanisms overlook the privacy concerns of the involved customers. To address
these limitations, in this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized
charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First
ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU
sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC)
and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract
will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with
the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority
ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules
are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed
blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption
while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability,
and privacy preserving.
