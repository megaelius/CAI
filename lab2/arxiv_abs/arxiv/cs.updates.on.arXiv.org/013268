The desire to train complex machine learning algorithms and to increase the statistical power in
association studies drives neuroimaging research to use ever-larger datasets. The most obvious
way to increase sample size is by pooling scans from independent studies. However, simple pooling
is often ill-advised as selection, measurement, and confounding biases may creep in and yield spurious
correlations. In this work, we combine 35,320 magnetic resonance images of the brain from 17 studies
to examine bias in neuroimaging. In the first experiment, Name That Dataset, we provide empirical
evidence for the presence of bias by showing that scans can be correctly assigned to their respective
dataset with 71.5% accuracy. Given such evidence, we take a closer look at confounding bias, which
is often viewed as the main shortcoming in observational studies. In practice, we neither know all
potential confounders nor do we have data on them. Hence, we model confounders as unknown, latent
variables. Kolmogorov complexity is then used to decide whether the confounded or the causal model
provides the simplest factorization of the graphical model. Finally, we present methods for dataset
harmonization and study their ability to remove bias in imaging features. In particular, we propose
an extension of the recently introduced ComBat algorithm to control for global variation across
image features, inspired by adjusting for population stratification in genetics. Our results
demonstrate that harmonization can reduce dataset-specific information in image features. Further,
confounding bias can be reduced and even turned into a causal relationship. However, harmonziation
also requires caution as it can easily remove relevant subject-specific information.
