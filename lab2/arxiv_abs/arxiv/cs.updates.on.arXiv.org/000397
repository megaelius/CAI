Research on untethered micro-swimming robots is growing fast owing to their potential impact on
minimally invasive medical procedures. Candidate propulsion mechanisms of robots are based on
flagellar mechanisms of micro organisms such as rotating rigid helices and traveling plane-waves
on flexible rods. For design and control of swimming robots, accurate real-time models are necessary
to compute trajectories, velocities and hydrodynamic forces acting on robots. Resistive force
theory (RFT) provides an excellent framework for the development of real-time six degrees-of-freedom
surrogate models for design optimization and control. However the accuracy of RFT-based models
depends strongly on hydrodynamic interactions. Here, we introduce interaction coefficients
that only multiply body resistance coefficients with no modification to local resistance coefficients
on the tail. Interaction coefficients are obtained for a single specimen of Vibrio Algino reported
in literature, and used in the RFT model for comparisons of forward velocities and body rotation
rates against other specimens. Furthermore, CFD simulations are used to obtain forward and lateral
velocities and body rotation rates of bio-inspired swimmers with helical tails and traveling-plane
waves for a range of amplitudes and wavelengths. Interaction coefficients are obtained from the
CFD simulation for the helical tail with the specified amplitude and wavelength, and used in the
RFT model for comparisons of velocities and body rotation rates for other designs. Comparisons
indicate that hydrodynamic models that employ interaction coefficients prove to be viable surrogates
for computationally intensive three-dimensional time-dependent CFD models. Lastly, hydrodynamic
models of bio-inspired swimmers are used to obtain optimal amplitudes and wavelengths of flagellar
mechanisms, as a demonstration of the approach.
