Background: Deep learning techniques have achieved high accuracy in image classification tasks,
and there is interest in applicability to neuroimaging critical findings. This study evaluates
the efficacy of 2D deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for detecting basal ganglia (BG)
hemorrhage on noncontrast head CT. Materials and Methods: 170 unique de-identified HIPAA-compliant
noncontrast head CTs were obtained, those with and without BG hemorrhage. 110 cases were held-out
for test, and 60 were split into training (45) and validation (15), consisting of 20 right, 20 left,
and 20 no BG hemorrhage. Data augmentation was performed to increase size and variation of the training
dataset by 48-fold. Two DCNNs were used to classify the images-AlexNet and GoogLeNet-using untrained
networks and those pre-trained on ImageNet. Area under the curves (AUC) for the receiver-operator
characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated, using the DeLong method for statistical comparison
of ROCs. Results: The best performing model was the pre-trained augmented GoogLeNet, which had
an AUC of 1.00 in classification of hemorrhage. Preprocessing augmentation increased accuracy
for all networks (p<0.001), and pretrained networks outperformed untrained ones (p<0.001) for
the unaugmented models. The best performing GoogLeNet model (AUC 1.00) outperformed the best performing
AlexNet model (AUC 0.95)(p=0.01). Conclusion: For this dataset, the best performing DCNN identified
BG hemorrhage on noncontrast head CT with an AUC of 1.00. Pretrained networks and data augmentation
increased classifier accuracy. Future prospective research would be important to determine if
the accuracy can be maintained on a larger cohort of patients and for very small hemorrhages.
