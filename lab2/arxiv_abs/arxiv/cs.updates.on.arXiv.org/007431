Interactive-proof games model the scenario where an honest party interacts with powerful but strategic
provers, to elicit from them the correct answer to a computational question. Interactive proofs
are increasingly used as a framework to design protocols for computation outsourcing. Interactive-proof
games largely fall into two categories: either as games of cooperation such as multi-prover interactive
proofs and cooperative rational proofs, where the provers work together as a team; or as games of
conflict such as refereed games, where the provers directly compete with each other in a zero-sum
game. Neither of these extremes truly capture the strategic nature of service providers in outsourcing
applications. How to design and analyze non-cooperative interactive proofs is an important open
problem. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism-design approach to define a multi-prover interactive-proof
model in which the provers are rational and non-cooperative---they act to maximize their expected
utility given others' strategies. We define a strong notion of backwards induction as our solution
concept to analyze the resulting extensive-form game with imperfect information. Our protocols
provide utility gap guarantees, which are analogous to soundness gap in classic interactive proofs.
At a high level, a utility gap of u means that the protocol is robust against provers that may not care
about a utility loss of 1/u. We fully characterize the complexity of our proof system under different
utility gap guarantees. For example, we show that with a polynomial utility gap, the power of non-cooperative
rational interactive proofs is exactly P^NEXP.
