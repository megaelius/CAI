The well-known $k$-disjoint path problem ($k$-DPP) asks for pairwise vertex-disjoint paths between
$k$ specified pairs of vertices $(s_i, t_i)$ in a given graph, if they exist. The decision version
of the shortest $k$-DPP asks for the length of the shortest (in terms of total length) such paths.
Similarly the search and counting versions ask for one such and the number of such shortest set of
paths, respectively. We restrict attention to the shortest $k$-DPP instances on undirected planar
graphs where all sources and sinks lie on a single face or on a pair of faces. We provide efficient sequential
and parallel algorithms for the search versions of the problem answering one of the main open questions
raised by Colin de Verdiere and Schrijver for the general one-face problem. We do so by providing
a randomised $NC^2$ algorithm along with an $O(n^{\omega})$ time randomised sequential algorithm.
We also obtain deterministic algorithms with similar resource bounds for the counting and search
versions. In contrast, previously, only the sequential complexity of decision and search versions
of the "well-ordered" case has been studied. For the one-face case, sequential versions of our routines
have better running times for constantly many terminals. In addition, the earlier best known sequential
algorithms (e.g. Borradaile et al.) were randomised while ours are also deterministic. The algorithms
are based on a bijection between a shortest $k$-tuple of disjoint paths in the given graph and cycle
covers in a related digraph. This allows us to non-trivially modify established techniques relating
counting cycle covers to the determinant. We further need to do a controlled inclusion-exclusion
to produce a polynomial sum of determinants such that all "bad" cycle covers cancel out in the sum
allowing us to count "good" cycle covers.
