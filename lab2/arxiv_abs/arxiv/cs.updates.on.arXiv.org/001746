Sketch portrait generation benefits a wide range of applications such as digital entertainment
and law enforcement. Although plenty of efforts have been dedicated to this task, several issues
still remain unsolved for generating vivid and detail-preserving personal sketch portraits.
For example, quite a few artifacts may exist in synthesizing hairpins and glasses, and textural
details may be lost in the regions of hair or mustache. Moreover, the generalization ability of current
systems is somewhat limited since they usually require elaborately collecting a dictionary of
examples or carefully tuning features/components. In this paper, we present a novel representation
learning framework that generates an end-to-end photo-sketch mapping through structure and texture
decomposition. In the training stage, we first decompose the input face photo into different components
according to their representational contents (i.e., structural and textural parts) by using a
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then, we utilize a Branched Fully Convolutional
Neural Network (BFCN) for learning structural and textural representations, respectively. In
addition, we design a Sorted Matching Mean Square Error (SM-MSE) metric to measure texture patterns
in the loss function. In the stage of sketch rendering, our approach automatically generates structural
and textural representations for the input photo and produces the final result via a probabilistic
fusion scheme. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks suggest that our approach
outperforms example-based synthesis algorithms in terms of both perceptual and objective metrics.
In addition, the proposed method also has better generalization ability across dataset without
additional training.
