Extracting genetic information from a full range of sequencing data is important for understanding
diseases. We propose a novel method to effectively explore the landscape of genetic mutations and
aggregate them to predict cancer type. We used multinomial logistic regression, nonsmooth non-negative
matrix factorization (nsNMF), and support vector machine (SVM) to utilize the full range of sequencing
data, aiming at better aggregating genetic mutations and improving their power in predicting cancer
types. Specifically, we introduced a classifier to distinguish cancer types using somatic mutations
obtained from whole-exome sequencing data. Mutations were identified from multiple cancers and
scored using SIFT, PP2, and CADD, and grouped at the individual gene level. The nsNMF was then applied
to reduce dimensionality and to obtain coefficient and basis matrices. A feature matrix was derived
from the obtained matrices to train a classifier for cancer type classification with the SVM model.
We have demonstrated that the classifier was able to distinguish the cancer types with reasonable
accuracy. In five-fold cross-validations using mutation counts as features, the average prediction
accuracy was 77.1% (SEM=0.1%), significantly outperforming baselines and outperforming models
using mutation scores as features. Using the factor matrices derived from the nsNMF, we identified
multiple genes and pathways that are significantly associated with each cancer type. This study
presents a generic and complete pipeline to study the associations between somatic mutations and
cancers. The discovered genes and pathways associated with each cancer type can lead to biological
insights. The proposed method can be adapted to other studies for disease classification and pathway
discovery.
