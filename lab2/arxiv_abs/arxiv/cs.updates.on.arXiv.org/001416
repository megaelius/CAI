In today's cyber-enabled smart grids, high penetration of uncertain renewables, purposeful manipulation
of meter readings, and the need for wide-area situational awareness, call for fast, accurate, and
robust power system state estimation. The least-absolute-value (LAV) estimator is known for its
robustness relative to the weighted least-squares (WLS) one. However, due to nonconvexity and
nonsmoothness, existing LAV solvers based on linear programming are typically slow, hence inadequate
for real-time system monitoring. This paper develops two novel algorithms for efficient LAV estimation,
which draw from recent advances in composite optimization. The first is a deterministic linear
proximal scheme that handles a sequence of convex quadratic problems, each efficiently solvable
either via off-the-shelf algorithms or through the alternating direction method of multipliers.
Leveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to power networks, the second scheme is stochastic,
and updates only \emph{a few} entries of the complex voltage state vector per iteration. In particular,
when voltage magnitude and (re)active power flow measurements are used only, this number reduces
to one or two, \emph{regardless of} the number of buses in the network. This computational complexity
evidently scales well to large-size power systems. Furthermore, by carefully \emph{mini-batching}
the voltage and power flow measurements, accelerated implementation of the stochastic iterations
becomes possible. The developed algorithms are numerically evaluated using a variety of benchmark
power networks. Simulated tests corroborate that improved robustness can be attained at comparable
or markedly reduced computation times for medium- or large-size networks relative to the "workhorse"
WLS-based Gauss-Newton iterations.
