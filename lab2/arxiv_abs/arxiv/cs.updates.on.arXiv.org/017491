Coronaviruses constitute a family of virus that gives rise to respiratory diseases. Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus also
termed as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to its rapid spread,
WHO has declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on 11th March 2020. Reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is popularly used worldwide for the detection of COVID-19. However,
due to the high false-negative rate of RT-PCR test, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is emerging as a feasible
alternative for the detection of COVID-19. In this work, we propose a multiclass classification
model COV-ELM, based on the extreme learning machine which classifies the CXR images into one of
the three classes, namely COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. The choice of ELM in this work has been
motivated by its significantly short training time as compared to conventional gradient-based
learning algorithms. After some preprocessing, we extract a pool of features based on texture and
frequency. This pool of features serves as an input to the ELM and a 10-fold cross-validation method
is employed to evaluate the proposed model. For experimentation, we use chest X-ray (CXR) images
from three publicly available sources. The results of applying COV-ELM on test data are quite promising.
The COV-ELM achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95 and the overall sensitivity of ${0.94 \pm 0.02}$
at 95% confidence interval. When compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the
COV-ELM is found to outperform in a three-class classification scenario. The main advantage of
COV-ELM is that its training time being quite low, as bigger and diverse datasets become available,
it can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based competitor models.
