Wireless Sensor Network WSN is consisted of nodes with different sizes and a specific goal. Tracking
applications are very important in WSNs. This study proposes a method for reducing energy consumption
in WSNs, considering target tracking. A prediction method is also presented with the help of MAC
Medium Access Control layer in which a few number of nodes are in active mode to track the target while
the rest of the nodes are switched into sleeping mode. Energy consumption was reduced by decreasing
the number of nodes involved in target tracking and activating merely a limited number of necessary
nodes. The conducted experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm has a much better performance
compared to similar algorithms in different conditions, including energy consumption in different
communication ranges, effect of the number of nodes on energy consumption, the number of nodes involved
in tracking in terms of communication range, and losing the target. This means the proposed method
is superior and more efficient. When the target enters the simulation area, nodes of the network
identify the target node through the proposed method (which is the optimum method) and track it as
long as it is inside the simulation area. Performance criteria, including energy, other nodes,
and throughput were used in simulation. The results showed that the proposed method has the optimum
performance and reduces energy consumption of the network during tracking. The results of the simulation
showed that the proposed method reduces energy consumption to an acceptable extent, compared to
previous methods, in addition to increasing the accuracy of target tracking. Keywords: Active
