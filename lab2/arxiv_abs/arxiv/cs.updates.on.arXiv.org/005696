In this work, we present a new web based HPC-cloud platform for automatic virtual towing tank analysis.
It is well known that the design project of a new hull requires a continuous integration of shape hypothesis
and hydrodynamics verifications using analytical tools, 3D computational methods, experimental
facilities and sea keeping trial tests. The complexity and the cost of such design tools increase
considerably moving from analytical tools to sea keeping trials. In order to perform a meaningful
trade-off between costs and high quality data acquiring during the last decade the usage of 3D computational
models has grown pushed also by well-known technological factors. Nevertheless, in the past, there
were several limiting factors on the wide diffusion of 3D computational models to perform virtual
towing tank data acquiring, from hardware and software costs to the specific technological skills
needed. In this work we propose an innovative high-level approach which is embodied in the so-called
LincoSim web application in which a hypothetical designer user can carry out the simulation only
starting from its own geometry and a set of meaningful physical parameters. LincoSim automatically
manages and hides to the user all the necessary details of CFD modelling and of HPC infrastructure
usage allowing them to access, visualize and analyze the outputs from the same single access point
made up from the web browser. In addition to the web interface, the platform includes a back-end server
which implements a Cloud logic and can be connected to multiple HPC machines for computing. LincoSim
is currently set up with finite volume Open-FOAM CFD engine. A preliminary validation campaign
has been performed to assess the robustness and the reliability of the tool and is proposed as a novel
approach for the development of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) applications.
