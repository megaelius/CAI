Graph convolutional neural network (GCN) has effectively boosted the multi-label image recognition
task by introducing label dependencies based on statistical label co-occurrence of data. However,
in previous methods, label correlation is computed based on statistical information of data and
therefore the same for all samples, and this makes graph inference on labels insufficient to handle
huge variations among numerous image instances. In this paper, we propose an instance-aware graph
convolutional neural network (IA-GCN) framework for multi-label classification. As a whole,
two fused branches of sub-networks are involved in the framework: a global branch modeling the whole
image and a region-based branch exploring dependencies among regions of interests (ROIs). For
label diffusion of instance-awareness in graph convolution, rather than using the statistical
label correlation alone, an image-dependent label correlation matrix (LCM), fusing both the statistical
LCM and an individual one of each image instance, is constructed for graph inference on labels to
inject adaptive information of label-awareness into the learned features of the model. Specifically,
the individual LCM of each image is obtained by mining the label dependencies based on the scores
of labels about detected ROIs. In this process, considering the contribution differences of ROIs
to multi-label classification, variational inference is introduced to learn adaptive scaling
factors for those ROIs by considering their complex distribution. Finally, extensive experiments
on MS-COCO and VOC datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods.
