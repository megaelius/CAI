Object classification is one of the many holy grails in computer vision and as such has resulted in
a very large number of algorithms being proposed already. Specifically in recent years there has
been considerable progress in this area primarily due to the increased efficiency and accessibility
of deep learning techniques. In fact, for single-label object classification [i.e. only one object
present in the image] the state-of-the-art techniques employ deep neural networks and are reporting
very close to human-like performance. There are specialized applications in which single-label
object-level classification will not suffice; for example in cases where the image contains multiple
intertwined objects of different labels. In this paper, we address the complex problem of multi-label
pixelwise classification. We present our distinct solution based on a convolutional neural network
(CNN) for performing multi-label pixelwise classification and its application to large-scale
urban reconstruction. A supervised learning approach is followed for training a 13-layer CNN using
both LiDAR and satellite images. An empirical study has been conducted to determine the hyperparameters
which result in the optimal performance of the CNN. Scale invariance is introduced by training the
network on five different scales of the input and labeled data. This results in six pixelwise classifications
for each different scale. An SVM is then trained to map the six pixelwise classifications into a single-label.
Lastly, we refine boundary pixel labels using graph-cuts for maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation
with Markov Random Field (MRF) priors. The resulting pixelwise classification is then used to accurately
extract and reconstruct the buildings in large-scale urban areas. The proposed approach has been
extensively tested and the results are reported.
