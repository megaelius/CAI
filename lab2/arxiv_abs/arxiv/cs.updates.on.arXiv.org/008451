Online knowledge libraries refer to the online data warehouses that systematically organize and
categorize the knowledge-based information about different kinds of concepts and entities. In
the era of big data, the setup of online knowledge libraries is an extremely challenging and laborious
task, in terms of efforts, time and expense required in the completion of knowledge entities. Especially
nowadays, a large number of new knowledge entities, like movies, are keeping on being produced and
coming out at a continuously accelerating speed, which renders the knowledge library setup and
completion problem more difficult to resolve manually. In this paper, we will take the online movie
knowledge libraries as an example, and study the "Multiple aligned ISomeric Online Knowledge LIbraries
Completion problem" (Miso-Klic) problem across multiple online knowledge libraries. Miso-Klic
aims at identifying the missing entities for multiple knowledge libraries synergistically and
ranking them for editing based on certain ranking criteria. To solve the problem, a thorough investigation
of two isomeric online knowledge libraries, Douban and IMDB, have been carried out in this paper.
Based on analyses results, a novel deep online knowledge library completion framework "Integrated
Deep alignEd Auto-encoder" (IDEA) is introduced to solve the problem. By projecting the entities
from multiple isomeric knowledge libraries to a shared feature space, IDEA solves the Miso-Klic
problem via three steps: (1) entity feature space unification via embedding, (2) knowledge library
fusion based missing entity identification, and (3) missing entity ranking. Extensive experiments
done on the real-world online knowledge library dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of
IDEA in addressing the problem.
