Tornadoes are the most violent of all atmospheric storms. In a typical year, the United States experiences
hundreds of tornadoes with associated damages on the order of one billion dollars. Community preparation
and resilience would benefit from accurate predictions of these economic losses, particularly
as populations in tornado-prone areas increase in density and extent. Here, we use a zero-inflated
modeling approach and artificial neural networks to predict tornado-induced property damage
using publicly available data. We developed a neural network that predicts whether a tornado will
cause property damage (out-of-sample accuracy = 0.821 and area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve, AUROC, = 0.872). Conditional on a tornado causing damage, another neural network predicts
the amount of damage (out-of-sample mean squared error = 0.0918 and R2 = 0.432). When used together,
these two models function as a zero-inflated log-normal regression with hidden layers. From the
best-performing models, we provide static and interactive gridded maps of monthly predicted probabilities
of damage and property damages for the year 2019. Two primary weaknesses include (1) model fitting
requires log-scale data which leads to large natural-scale residuals and (2) beginning tornado
coordinates were utilized rather than tornado paths. Ultimately, this is the first known study
to directly model tornado-induced property damages, and all data, code, and tools are publicly
available. The predictive capacity of this model along with an interactive interface may provide
an opportunity for science-informed tornado disaster planning.
