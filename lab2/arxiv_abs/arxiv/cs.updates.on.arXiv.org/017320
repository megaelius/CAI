Purpose: The research is to develop a novel CNN-based adversarial deep learning method to improve
and expedite the multi-organ semantic segmentation of CT images, and to generate accurate contours
on pelvic CT images. Methods: Planning CT and structure datasets for 110 patients with intact prostate
cancer were retrospectively selected and divided for 10-fold cross-validation. The proposed
adversarial multi-residual multi-scale pooling Markov Random Field (MRF) enhanced network (ARPM-net)
implements an adversarial training scheme. A segmentation network and a discriminator network
were trained jointly, and only the segmentation network was used for prediction. The segmentation
network integrates a newly designed MRF block into a variation of multi-residual U-net. The discriminator
takes the product of the original CT and the prediction/ground-truth as input and classifies the
input into fake/real. The segmentation network and discriminator network can be trained jointly
as a whole, or the discriminator can be used for fine-tuning after the segmentation network is coarsely
trained. Multi-scale pooling layers were introduced to preserve spatial resolution during pooling
using less memory compared to atrous convolution layers. An adaptive loss function was proposed
to enhance the training on small or low contrast organs. The accuracy of modeled contours was measured
with the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD), Average Surface
Hausdorff Distance (ASHD), and relative Volume Difference (VD) using clinical contours as references
to the ground-truth. The proposed ARPM-net method was compared to several stateof-the-art deep
learning methods.
