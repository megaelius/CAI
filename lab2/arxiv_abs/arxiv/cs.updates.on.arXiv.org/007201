Developing knowledge-driven contemporaneous health index (CHI) that can precisely reflect the
underlying patient across the course of the condition's progression holds a unique value, like
facilitating a range of clinical decision-making opportunities. This is particularly important
for monitoring degenerative condition such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), where the condition of
the patient will decay over time. Detecting early symptoms and progression sign, and continuous
severity evaluation, are all essential for disease management. While a few methods have been developed
in the literature, uncertainty quantification of those health index models has been largely neglected.
To ensure the continuity of the care, we should be more explicit about the level of confidence in model
outputs. Ideally, decision-makers should be provided with recommendations that are robust in
the face of substantial uncertainty about future outcomes. In this paper, we aim at filling this
gap by developing an uncertainty quantification based contemporaneous longitudinal index, named
UQ-CHI, with a particular focus on continuous patient monitoring of degenerative conditions.
Our method is to combine convex optimization and Bayesian learning using the maximum entropy learning
(MEL) framework, integrating uncertainty on labels as well. Our methodology also provides closed-form
solutions in some important decision making tasks, e.g., such as predicting the label of a new sample.
Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the propose UQ-CHI method in prediction accuracy,
monitoring efficacy, and unique advantages if uncertainty quantification is enabled practice.
