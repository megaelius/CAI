The emerging fields of genetic engineering, synthetic biology, DNA computing, DNA nanotechnology,
and molecular programming herald the birth of a new information technology that acquires information
by directly sensing molecules within a chemical environment, stores information in molecules
such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, processes that information by means of chemical and biochemical
transformations, and uses that information to direct the manipulation of matter at the nanometer
scale. To scale up beyond current proof-of-principle demonstrations, new methods for managing
the complexity of designed molecular systems will need to be developed. Here we focus on the challenge
of verifying the correctness of molecular implementations of abstract chemical reaction networks,
where operation in a well-mixed "soup" of molecules is stochastic, asynchronous, concurrent,
and often involves multiple intermediate steps in the implementation, parallel pathways, and
side reactions. This problem relates to the verification of Petri Nets, but existing approaches
are not sufficient for certain situations that commonly arise in molecular implementations, such
as what we call "delayed choice." We formulate a new theory of pathway decomposition that provides
an elegant formal basis for comparing chemical reaction network implementations, and we present
an algorithm that computes this basis. We further show how pathway decomposition can be combined
with weak bisimulation to handle a wider class that includes all currently known enzyme-free DNA
implementation techniques. We anticipate that our notion of logical equivalence between chemical
reaction network implementations will be valuable for other molecular implementations such as
biochemical enzyme systems, and perhaps even more broadly in concurrency theory.
