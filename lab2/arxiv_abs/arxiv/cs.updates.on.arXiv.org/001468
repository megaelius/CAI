In this paper, we propose a device to device (D2D) communication scenario underlaying a cellular
network where both D2D and cellular users (CUs) are discrete power-rate systems with limited feedback
from the receivers. It is assumed that there exists an adversary which wants to eavesdrop on the information
transmission from the base station (BS) to CUs. Since D2D communication shares the same spectrum
with cellular network, cross interference must be considered. However, when secrecy capacity
is considered, the interference caused by D2D communication can help to improve the secrecy communications
by confusing the eavesdroppers. Since both systems share the same spectrum, cross interference
must be considered. We formulate the proposed resource allocation into an optimization problem
whose objective is to maximize the average transmission rate of D2D pair in the presence of the cellular
communications under average transmission power constraint. For the cellular network, we require
a minimum average achievable secrecy rate in the absence of D2D communication as well as a maximum
secrecy outage probability in the presence of D2D communication which should be satisfied. Due
to high complexity convex optimization methods, to solve the proposed optimization problem, we
apply Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is an evolutionary approach. Moreover, we model
and study the error in the feedback channel and the imperfectness of channel distribution information
(CDI) using parametric and nonparametric methods. Finally, the impact of different system parameters
on the performance of the proposed scheme is investigated through simulations. The performance
of the proposed scheme is evaluated using numerical results for different scenarios.
