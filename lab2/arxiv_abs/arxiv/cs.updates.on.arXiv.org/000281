A while ago, I developed what I called an encryption method. The most favorable of reviews did not
see a method but a collection of techniques. Be that as it may, the process used, is described in the
paper, Windtalking Computers. This paper is about the steganographic method described, the cryptanalysis
efforts of that method and; a real world application of that method as an answer to the increasing
problem of password file hacking. The premise is that the technique is a variant of one time pad, using
a novel way to produce one time pad output for digital input. There is no record in the literature of
such a method being used for encryption at all. Digital encryption generally treats the letters
of the plaintext as a binary number and does some mathematical computation to produce ciphertext.
The idea of inserting bits with a random generated key is new. Therefore (because a uniquely random
generated key is used), the encryption is cryptanalytically unbreakable and/or computationally
secure and/or information theoretic. An academic version was made. Challenges for decryption
have not produced to-date a decryption. Advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed.
Hackers are constantly penetrating networks and stealing password files. Which, once in possession
of a password file, hackers individually or collectively with distributed processing over the
Internet, decrypt the values of the hash passwords. Thereby gaining access to systems. This problem
has become sufficiently significant for CAESAR (Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security,
Applicability, and Robustness) to make calls for papers for solutions. Herein is one proposed solution.
While one time pad presents a problem being computationally intensive, for the relatively short
length of passwords, the cost of computation may be cost effective for the security provided.
