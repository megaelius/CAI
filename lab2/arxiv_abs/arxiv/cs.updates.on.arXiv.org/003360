With the widespread use of GPS-enabled mobile devices, an unprecedented amount of trajectory data
is becoming available from various sources such as Bikely, GPS-wayPoints, and Uber. The rise of
innovative transportation services and recent break-throughs in autonomous vehicles will lead
to the continued growth of trajectory data and related applications. Supporting these services
in emerging platforms will require more efficient query processing in trajectory databases. In
this paper, we propose two new coverage queries for trajectory databases: (i) k Maximizing Reverse
Range Search on Trajectories (kMaxRRST); and (ii) a Maximum k Coverage Range Search on Trajectories
(MaxkCovRST). We propose a novel index structure, the Trajectory Quadtree (TQ-tree) that utilizes
a quadtree to hierarchically organize trajectories into different quadtree nodes, and then applies
a z-ordering to further organize the trajectories by spatial locality inside each node. This structure
is highly effective in pruning the trajectory search space, which is of independent interest. By
exploiting the TQ-tree data structure, we develop a divide-and-conquer approach to compute the
trajectory "service value", and a best-first strategy to explore the trajectories using the appropriate
upper bound on the service value to efficiently process a kMaxRRST query. Moreover, to solve the
MaxkCovRST, which is a non-submodular NP-hard problem, we propose a greedy approximation which
also exploits the TQ-tree. We evaluate our algorithms through an extensive experimental study
on several real datasets, and demonstrate that our TQ-tree based algorithms outperform common
baselines by two to three orders of magnitude.
