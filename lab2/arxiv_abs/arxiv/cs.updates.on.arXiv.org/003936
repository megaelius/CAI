Network science provides valuable insights across numerous disciplines including sociology,
biology, neuroscience and engineering. A task of major practical importance in these application
domains is inferring the network structure from noisy observations at a subset of nodes. Available
methods for topology inference typically assume that the process over the network is observed at
all nodes. However, application-specific constraints may prevent acquiring network-wide observations.
Alleviating the limited flexibility of existing approaches, this work advocates structural models
for graph processes and develops novel algorithms for joint inference of the network topology and
processes from partial nodal observations. Structural equation models (SEMs) and structural
vector autoregressive models (SVARMs) have well-documented merits in identifying even directed
topologies of complex graphs; while SEMs capture contemporaneous causal dependencies among nodes,
SVARMs further account for time-lagged influences. This paper develops algorithms that iterate
between inferring directed graphs that "best" fit the data, and estimating the network processes
at reduced computational complexity by leveraging tools related to Kalman smoothing. To further
accommodate delay-sensitive applications, an online joint inference approach is put forth that
even tracks time-evolving topologies. Furthermore, conditions for identifying the network topology
given partial observations are specified. It is proved that the required number of observations
for unique identification reduces significantly when the network structure is sparse. Numerical
tests with synthetic as well as real datasets corroborate the effectiveness of the novel approach.
