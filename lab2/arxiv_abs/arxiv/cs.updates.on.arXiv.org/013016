With the increase in acceptance of open source platforms for knowledge sharing, Question and Answer
(Q\&A) websites such as Stack Overflow have become increasingly popular in the programming domain.
Many novice programmers visit Stack Overflow for reasons that include posing questions, finding
answers for issues they come across in the process of programming. Practitioners voluntarily answer
questions on Stack Overflow based on their experience or prior knowledge. Most of these answers
are also accompanied by comments from users of Stack Overflow. Questions, answers and comments
on Stack Overflow also include sentiments of users, which when analysed and presented could motivate
users in reading and contributing to the posts. However, the sentiment of these posts is not being
depicted in the current Stack Overflow platform. There is extensive research on analysing sentiments
on social networking platforms such as twitter. Representing sentiment of a post might motivate
users to follow or answer certain posts. While there exist several tools that augment or annotate
Stack Overflow platform for developers, we are not aware of tools that deal with sentiment of the
posts. In this paper, we propose StackEmo as a Google Chrome plugin to augment comments on Stack Overflow
with emojis, based on the sentiment of the comments posted, with the aim to provide users with visual
cues that could motivate the users to review and contribute to available comments. We evaluated
StackEmo through an in-user likert scale based survey with 30 university students. The results
of the survey provided us insights on improving StackEmo, with 83% participants having recommended
the plugin to their peers.
