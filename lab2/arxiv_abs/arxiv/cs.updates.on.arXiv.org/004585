Objective: To develop an automatic image normalization algorithm for intensity correction of
images from breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) acquired
by different MRI scanners with various imaging parameters, using only image information. Methods:
DCE-MR images of 460 subjects with breast cancer acquired by different scanners were used in this
study. Each subject had one T1-weighted pre-contrast image and three T1-weighted post-contrast
images available. Our normalization algorithm operated under the assumption that the same type
of tissue in different patients should be represented by the same voxel value. We used four tissue/material
types as the anchors for the normalization: 1) air, 2) fat tissue, 3) dense tissue, and 4) heart. The
algorithm proceeded in the following two steps: First, a state-of-the-art deep learning-based
algorithm was applied to perform tissue segmentation accurately and efficiently. Then, based
on the segmentation results, a subject-specific piecewise linear mapping function was applied
between the anchor points to normalize the same type of tissue in different patients into the same
intensity ranges. We evaluated the algorithm with 300 subjects used for training and the rest used
for testing. Results: The application of our algorithm to images with different scanning parameters
resulted in highly improved consistency in pixel values and extracted radiomics features. Conclusion:
The proposed image normalization strategy based on tissue segmentation can perform intensity
correction fully automatically, without the knowledge of the scanner parameters. Significance:
We have thoroughly tested our algorithm and showed that it successfully normalizes the intensity
of DCE-MR images. We made our software publicly available for others to apply in their analyses.
