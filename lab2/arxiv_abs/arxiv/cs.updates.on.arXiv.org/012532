The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) is an NP-hard routing problem in which a fleet of identical vehicles
aims at collecting rewards (prizes) available at given locations, while satisfying restrictions
on the travel times. In TOP, each location can be visited by at most one vehicle, and the goal is to maximize
the total sum of rewards collected by the vehicles within a given time limit. In this paper, we propose
a generalization of TOP, namely the Steiner Team Orienteering Problem (STOP). In STOP, we provide,
additionally, a subset of mandatory locations. In this sense, STOP also aims at maximizing the total
sum of rewards collected within the time limit, but, now, every mandatory location must be visited.
In this work, we propose a new commodity-based formulation for STOP and use it within a cutting-plane
scheme. The algorithm benefits from the compactness and strength of the proposed formulation and
works by separating three families of valid inequalities, which consist of some general connectivity
constraints, classical lifted cover inequalities based on dual bounds and a class of conflict cuts.
To our knowledge, the last class of inequalities is also introduced in this work. A state-of-the-art
branch-and-cut algorithm from the literature of TOP is adapted to STOP and used as baseline to evaluate
the performance of the cutting-plane. Extensive computational experiments show the competitiveness
of the new algorithm while solving several STOP and TOP instances. In particular, it is able to solve,
in total, 14 more TOP instances than any other previous exact algorithm and finds eight new optimality
certificates. With respect to the new STOP instances introduced in this work, our algorithm solves
30 more instances than the baseline.
