In this paper, utilizing techniques in compressed sensing, parallel optimization and deep learning,
we propose a model-driven approach to jointly design the common measurement matrix and GROUP LASSO-based
jointly sparse signal recovery method for complex sparse signals, based on the standard auto-encoder
structure for real numbers. The encoder achieves noisy linear compression for jointly sparse signals,
with a common measurement matrix. The GROUP LASSO-based decoder realizes jointly sparse signal
recovery based on an iterative parallel-coordinate descent (PCD) algorithm which is proposed
to solve GROUP LASSO in a parallel manner. In particular, the decoder consists of an approximation
part which unfolds (several iterations of) the proposed iterative algorithm to obtain an approximate
solution of GROUP LASSO and a correction part which reduces the difference between the approximate
solution and the actual jointly sparse signals. The proposed model-driven approach achieves higher
recovery accuracy with less computation time than the classic GROUP LASSO method, and the gain significantly
increases in the presence of extra structures in sparse patterns. The common measurement matrix
obtained by the proposed model-driven approach is also suitable for the classic GROUP LASSO method.
We consider an application example, i.e., channel estimation in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
(MIMO)-based grant-free random access which is proposed to support massive machine-type communications
(mMTC) for Internet of Things (IoT). By numerical results, we demonstrate the substantial gains
of the proposed model-driven approach over GROUP LASSO and AMP when the number of jointly sparse
signals is not very large.
