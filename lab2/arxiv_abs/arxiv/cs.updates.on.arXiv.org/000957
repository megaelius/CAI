Currents represent generalized surfaces studied in geometric measure theory. They range from
relatively tame integral currents that represent oriented manifolds with integer multiplicities
and finite volume as well as boundary, to arbitrary elements of the dual space of differential forms.
The flat norm provides a natural distance in the space of currents, and works by decomposing a $d$-dimensional
current into $d$- and (the boundary of) $(d+1)$-dimensional pieces. A natural question about currents
is the following. If the input is an integral current, can its flat norm decomposition be integral
as well? The answer is not known in general, except in the case of $d$-currents that are boundaries
of $(d+1)$-currents in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. Following correspondences between the flat norm
and $L^1$ total variation ($L^1$TV) of functionals, the answer is affirmative in this case. On the
other hand, for the discretization of the flat norm on a finite simplicial complex, the analogous
statement remains true even when the inputs are not boundaries. This result is implied by the boundary
matrix of the simplicial complex being totally unimodular -- a result distinct from the $L^1$TV
approach. We develop an analysis framework that extends the result in the simplicial setting to
that for $d$-currents in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, provided a suitable triangulation result holds.
Following results of Shewchuk on triangulating planar straight line graphs while bounding both
the size and location of small angles, our framework shows that the discrete result implies the continuous
result for the case of $1$-currents in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
