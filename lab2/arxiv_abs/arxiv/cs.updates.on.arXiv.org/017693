Cell-based crowd evacuation systems provide adaptive or static exit-choice indications that
favor a coordinated group dynamic, improving evacuation time and safety. While a great effort has
been made to modeling its control logic by assuming an ideal communication and positioning infrastructure,
the architectural dimension and the influence of pedestrian positioning uncertainty have been
largely overlooked. In our previous research, a Cell-based crowd evacuation system (CellEVAC)
was proposed that dynamically allocates exit gates to pedestrians in a cell-based pedestrian positioning
infrastructure. This system provides optimal exit-choice indications through color-based indications
and a control logic module built upon an optimized discrete-choice model. Here, we investigate
how location-aware technologies and wearable devices can be used for a realistic deployment of
CellEVAC. We consider a simulated real evacuation scenario (Madrid Arena) and propose a system
architecture for CellEVAC that includes: a controller node, a radio-controlled LED wristband
subsystem, and a cell-node network equipped with active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
devices. These subsystems coordinate to provide control, display and positioning capabilities.
We quantitatively study the sensitivity of evacuation time and safety to uncertainty in the positioning
system. Results showed that CellEVAC was operational within a limited range of positioning uncertainty.
Further analyses revealed that reprogramming the control logic module through a simulation-optimization
process, simulating the positioning system's expected uncertainty level, improved the CellEVAC
performance in scenarios with poor positioning systems.
