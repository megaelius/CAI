In future Internet-of-Things networks, sensors or even access points can be mounted on ground/aerial
vehicles for smart-city surveillance or environment monitoring. To support the high-mobility
sensing with low network latency, a technique called over-the-air-computation (AirComp) was
recently developed which enables an access-point to receive a desired function of sensing-data
from concurrent-transmissions by exploiting the superposition property of a multi-access-channel.
This work aims at further developing AirComp for next-generation multi-antenna multi-modal sensor
networks. Specifically, we design beamforming and channel-feedback techniques for multi-function
AirComp. Given the objective of minimizing sum-mean-squared-error of computed functions, the
optimization of receive-beamforming for multi-function AirComp is a NP-hard problem. The approximate
problem based on tightening transmission-power constraints, however, is shown to be solvable
using differential-geometry. The solution is proved to be the weighted-centroid of points on a
Grassmann-manifold, where each point represents the subspace spanned by the channel matrix of
a sensor. As a by-product, the beamforming problem is found to have the same form as the classic problem
of multicast-beamforming, establishing the AirComp-multicasting-duality. Its significance
lies in making the said Grassmannian-centroid solution transferable to the latter problem which
otherwise is solved using the computation-intensive semidefinite-relaxation-technique. Last,
building on the AirComp-beamforming solution, an efficient channel-feedback technique is designed
for an access-point to receive the beamformer from distributed sensor transmissions of designed
signals that are functions of local channel-state-information.
