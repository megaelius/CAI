Demand-Side Management (DSM) is a vital tool that can be used to ensure power system reliability
and stability. In future smart grids, certain portions of a customers load usage could be under automatic
control with a cyber-enabled DSM program which selectively schedules loads as a function of electricity
prices to improve power balance and grid stability. In such a case, the security of DSM cyberinfrastructure
will be critical as advanced metering infrastructure, and communication systems are susceptible
to hacking, cyber-attacks. Such attacks, in the form of data injection, can manipulate customer
load profiles and cause metering chaos and energy losses in the grid. These attacks are also exacerbated
by the feedback mechanism between load management on the consumer side and dynamic price schemes
by independent system operators. This work provides a novel methodology for modeling and simulating
the nonlinear relationship between load management and real-time pricing. We then investigate
the behavior of such a feedback loop under intentional cyber-attacks using our feedback model.
We simulate and examine load-price data under different levels of DSM participation with three
types of additive attacks: ramp, sudden, and point attacks. We apply change point and supervised
learning methods for detection of DSM attacks. Results conclude that while higher levels of DSM
participation can exacerbate attacks they also lead to better detection of such attacks. Further
analysis of results shows that point attacks are the hardest to detect and supervised learning methods
produce results on par or better than sequential detectors.
