We present an arbitrarily high-order, conditionally stable, partitioned spectral deferred correction
(SDC) method for solving multiphysics problems using a sequence of pre-existing single-physics
solvers. This method extends the work in [1, 2], which used implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods
(IMEX) to build high-order, partitioned multiphysics solvers. We consider a generic multiphysics
problem modeled as a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), coupled through
coupling terms that can depend on the state of each subsystem; therefore the method applies to both
a semi-discretized system of partial differential equations (PDEs) or problems naturally modeled
as coupled systems of ODEs. The sufficient conditions to build arbitrarily high-order partitioned
SDC schemes are derived. Based on these conditions, various of partitioned SDC schemes are designed.
The stability of the first-order partitioned SDC scheme is analyzed in detail on a coupled, linear
model problem. We show that the scheme is conditionally stable, and under conditions on the coupling
strength, the scheme can be unconditionally stable. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed
partitioned solvers on several classes of multiphysics problems including a simple linear system
of ODEs, advection-diffusion-reaction systems, and fluid-structure interaction problems with
both incompressible and compressible flows, where we verify the design order of the SDC schemes
and study various stability properties. We also directly compare the accuracy, stability, and
cost of the proposed partitioned SDC solver with the partitioned IMEX method in [1, 2] on this suite
of test problems. The results suggest that the high-order partitioned SDC solvers are more robust
than the partitioned IMEX solvers for the numerical examples considered in this work, while the
IMEX methods require fewer implicit solves.
