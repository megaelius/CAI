The approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in data base and data mining.
A scalable ANNS algorithm should be both memory-saving and search-efficient. Some early graph-based
approaches have shown attractive theoretical guarantees on search time complexity, but they all
suffer from the problem of high indexing time complexity. Recently, some practical graph-based
methods are proposed to reduce the indexing complexity by approximating the traditional graphs
and have achieved revolutionary performance on public datasets. However, these works are mainly
based on intuitions and lack of rigorous theoretical support. They fail to maximize the potential
of graph-based search. In our observation, an ideal graph for ANNS should consider four aspects,
(1) ensuring the connectivity of the graph; (2) lowering the average out-degree of the graph for
fast traversing; (3) shortening the search path; and (4) avoiding additional index structures
to reduce the index size. In this paper, we introduce a new graph structure called Monotonic Relative
Neighborhood Graph (MRNG) which takes the four aspects into account simultaneously and guarantees
very low search complexity (close to logarithmic time). To further lower the indexing complexity,
we propose a novel graph structure named Navigating Spreading-out Graph (NSG) for practical large-scale
ANNS problems by approximating the MRNG. Extensive experiments show that NSG outperforms all the
existing algorithms significantly. What's more, NSG shows superior performance in the e-commercial
search scenario of Taobao (Alibaba Group) and has been integrated into their search engine for billion-scale
search.
