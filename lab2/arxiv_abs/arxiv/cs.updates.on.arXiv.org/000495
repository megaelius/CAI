We develop a technique that we call Conflict Packing in the context of kernelization, obtaining
(and improving) several polynomial kernels for editing problems on dense instances. We apply this
technique on several well-studied problems: Feedback Arc Set in (Bipartite) Tournaments, Dense
Rooted Triplet Inconsistency and Betweenness in Tournaments. For the former, one is given a (bipartite)
tournament $T = (V,A)$ and seeks a set of at most $k$ arcs whose reversal in $T$ results in an acyclic
(bipartite) tournament. While a linear vertex-kernel is already known for the first problem, using
the Conflict Packing allows us to find a so-called safe partition, the central tool of the kernelization
algorithm in, with simpler arguments. For the case of bipartite tournaments, the same technique
allows us to obtain a quadratic vertex-kernel. Again, such a kernel was already known to exist, using
the concept of so-called bimodules. We believe however that providing an unifying technique to
cope with such problems is interesting. Regarding Dense Rooted Triplet Inconsistency, one is given
a set of vertices $V$ and a dense collection $\mathcal{R}$ of rooted binary trees over three vertices
of $V$ and seeks a rooted tree over $V$ containing all but at most $k$ triplets from $\mathcal{R}$.
As a main consequence of our technique, we prove that the Dense Rooted Triplet Inconsistency problem
admits a linear vertex-kernel. This result improves the best known bound of $O(k^2)$ vertices for
this problem. Finally, we use this technique to obtain a linear vertex-kernel for Betweenness in
Tournaments, where one is given a set of vertices $V$ and a dense collection $\mathcal{R}$ of so-called
betweenness triplets and seeks a linear ordering of the vertices containing all but at most $k$ triplets
from $\mathcal{R}$.
