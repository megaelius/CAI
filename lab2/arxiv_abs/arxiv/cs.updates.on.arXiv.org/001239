This paper proposes a new method which approximates a classification function separating a $d$
dimensional compact set into two parts. The approach starts by estimating the intersection between
the classification boundary and the edges of a regular grid covering the compact set. Then it builds
a classification surface made of recursive simplex stars (resistars) defined in the grid cubes
containing such boundary points. A first variant, the simple resistar (s-resistar) defines a single
star of simplices which share the barycentre of the cube boundary points and include stars of simplices
defined similarly in cube facets, and so on recursively until a face boundary points define a single
simplex. This definition is simple and easy to apply when the dimensionality increases. However,
s-resistars sometimes "glue" together surfaces that should be separated and this deteriorates
the local classification performance. The second variant, the multi-boundary resistar (or m-resistar)
addresses this problem by defining several simplex stars in a cube or in its faces when necessary,
which is shown to increase the local classification performance. With both s-resistars and m-resistars,
classifying a point requires only a small number of simple tests without explicitly computing the
simplices. It is thus possible to use resistar classification in spaces of relatively high dimensionality
(up to 9 in our tests) and for resistar surfaces including a large number of simplices (up to several
trillions in our tests). The paper provides a theoretical argument and empirical evidence suggesting
that, when the surface to approximate is smooth enough, the error of resistar classification decreases
as $\mathcal{O}(n_G^{-2})$ for a grid of size $n_G^d$ in $d$ dimensions, whereas this error decreases
as $\mathcal{O}(n_G^{-1})$ when classifying with the sign of the nearest vertex of the grid.
