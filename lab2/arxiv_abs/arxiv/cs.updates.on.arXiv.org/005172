L1 adaptive controller has been recognized for having a structure that allows decoupling between
robustness and adaption owing to the introduction of a low pass filter with adjustable gain in the
feedback loop. The trade-off between performance, fast adaptation and robustness, is the main
criteria when selecting the structure or the coefficients of the filter. Several off-line methods
with varying levels of complexity exist to help finding bounds or initial values for these coefficients.
Such values may require further refinement using trial-and-error procedures upon implementation.
Subsequently, these approaches suggest that once implemented these values are kept fixed leading
to sub-optimal performance in both speed of adaptation and robustness. In this paper, a new practical
approach based on fuzzy rules for online continuous tuning of these coefficients is proposed. The
fuzzy controller is optimally tuned using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) taking into accounts
both the tracking error and the controller output signal range. The simulation of several examples
of systems with moderate to severe nonlinearities demonstrate that the proposed approach offers
improved control performance. Keywords: Fuzzy logic control, single-objective, multi-objective
