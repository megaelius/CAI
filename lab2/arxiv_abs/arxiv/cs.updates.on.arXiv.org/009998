This document is one of the deliverable reports created for the ESCAPE project. ESCAPE stands for
Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather Prediction at Exascale. The project develops
world-class, extreme-scale computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather
prediction and future climate models. This is done by identifying Weather & Climate dwarfs which
are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit of the Berkeley dwarfs).
These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware architectures (single and multi-node)
and alternative algorithms are explored. Performance portability is addressed through the use
of domain specific languages. Here we summarize the work performed on optimizations of the dwarfs
focusing on CPU multi-nodes and multi-GPUs. We limit ourselves to a subset of the dwarf configurations
chosen by the consortium. Intra-node optimizations of the dwarfs and energy-specific optimizations
have been described in Deliverable D3.3. To cover the important algorithmic motifs we picked dwarfs
related to the dynamical core as well as column physics. Specifically, we focused on the formulation
relevant to spectral codes like ECMWF's IFS code. The main findings of this report are: (a) Up-to
30% performance gain with CPU based multi-node systems compared to optimized version of dwarfs
from task 3.3 (see D3.3), (b) up to 10X performance gain on multiple GPUs from optimizations to keep
data resident on the GPU and enable fast inter-GPU communication mechanisms, and (c) multi-GPU
systems which feature a high-bandwidth all-to-all interconnect topology with NVLink/NVSwitch
hardware are particularly well suited to the algorithms.
