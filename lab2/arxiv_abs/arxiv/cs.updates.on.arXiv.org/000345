The concept of deploying a large number of antennas at the base station, often called massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO), has drawn considerable interest because of its potential ability to revolutionize
current wireless communication systems. Most literature on massive MIMO systems assumes time
division duplexing (TDD), although frequency division duplexing (FDD) dominates current cellular
systems. Due to the large number of transmit antennas at the base station, currently standardized
approaches would require a large percentage of the precious downlink and uplink resources in FDD
massive MIMO be used for training signal transmissions and channel state information (CSI) feedback.
To reduce the overhead of the downlink training phase, we propose practical open-loop and closed-loop
training frameworks in this paper. We assume the base station and the user share a common set of training
signals in advance. In open-loop training, the base station transmits training signals in a round-robin
manner, and the user successively estimates the current channel using long-term channel statistics
such as temporal and spatial correlations and previous channel estimates. In closed-loop training,
the user feeds back the best training signal to be sent based on channel prediction and the previously
received training signals. With a small amount of feedback from the user to the base station, closed-loop
training offers better performance in the data communication phase, especially when the signal-to-noise
ratio is low, the number of transmit antennas is large, or prior channel estimates are not accurate
at the beginning of the communication setup, all of which would be mostly beneficial for massive
MIMO systems.
