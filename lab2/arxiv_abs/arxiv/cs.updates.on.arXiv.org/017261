Maritime images captured under low-light imaging condition easily suffer from low visibility
and unexpected noise, leading to negative effects on maritime traffic supervision and management.
To promote imaging performance, it is necessary to restore the important visual information from
degraded low-light images. In this paper, we propose to enhance the low-light images through regularized
illumination optimization and deep noise suppression. In particular, a hybrid regularized variational
model, which combines L0-norm gradient sparsity prior with structure-aware regularization,
is presented to refine the coarse illumination map originally estimated using Max-RGB. The adaptive
gamma correction method is then introduced to adjust the refined illumination map. Based on the
assumption of Retinex theory, a guided filter-based detail boosting method is introduced to optimize
the reflection map. The adjusted illumination and optimized reflection maps are finally combined
to generate the enhanced maritime images. To suppress the effect of unwanted noise on imaging performance,
a deep learning-based blind denoising framework is further introduced to promote the visual quality
of enhanced image. In particular, this framework is composed of two sub-networks, i.e., E-Net and
D-Net adopted for noise level estimation and non-blind noise reduction, respectively. The main
benefit of our image enhancement method is that it takes full advantage of the regularized illumination
optimization and deep blind denoising. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on both
synthetic and realistic maritime images to compare our proposed method with several state-of-the-art
imaging methods. Experimental results have illustrated its superior performance in terms of both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
