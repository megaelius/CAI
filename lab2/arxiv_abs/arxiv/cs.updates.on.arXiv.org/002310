According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the main cause of cancer death among
adult women in the world. Although breast cancer occurs indiscriminately in countries with several
degrees of social and economic development, among developing and underdevelopment countries
mortality rates are still high, due to low availability of early detection technologies. From the
clinical point of view, mammography is still the most effective diagnostic technology, given the
wide diffusion of the use and interpretation of these images. Herein this work we propose a method
to detect and classify mammographic lesions using the regions of interest of images. Our proposal
consists in decomposing each image using multi-resolution wavelets. Zernike moments are extracted
from each wavelet component. Using this approach we can combine both texture and shape features,
which can be applied both to the detection and classification of mammary lesions. We used 355 images
of fatty breast tissue of IRMA database, with 233 normal instances (no lesion), 72 benign, and 83
malignant cases. Classification was performed by using SVM and ELM networks with modified kernels,
in order to optimize accuracy rates, reaching 94.11%. Considering both accuracy rates and training
times, we defined the ration between average percentage accuracy and average training time in a
reverse order. Our proposal was 50 times higher than the ratio obtained using the best method of the
state-of-the-art. As our proposed model can combine high accuracy rate with low learning time,
whenever a new data is received, our work will be able to save a lot of time, hours, in learning process
in relation to the best method of the state-of-the-art.
