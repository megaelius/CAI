Intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration is a key enabler of autonomous lifelong learning
in human children. It enables the discovery and acquisition of large repertoires of skills through
self-generation, self-selection, self-ordering and self-experimentation of learning goals.
We present an algorithmic approach called Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes
(IMGEP) to enable similar properties of autonomous or self-supervised learning in machines. The
IMGEP algorithmic architecture relies on several principles: 1) self-generation of goals, generalized
as fitness functions; 2) selection of goals based on intrinsic rewards; 3) exploration with incremental
goal-parameterized policy search and exploitation of the gathered data with a batch learning algorithm;
4) systematic reuse of information acquired when targeting a goal for improving towards other goals.
We present a particularly efficient form of IMGEP, called Modular Population-Based IMGEP, that
uses a population-based policy and an object-centered modularity in goals and mutations. We provide
several implementations of this architecture and demonstrate their ability to automatically
generate a learning curriculum within several experimental setups including a real humanoid robot
that can explore multiple spaces of goals with several hundred continuous dimensions. While no
particular target goal is provided to the system, this curriculum allows the discovery of skills
that act as stepping stone for learning more complex skills, e.g. nested tool use. We show that learning
diverse spaces of goals with intrinsic motivations is more efficient for learning complex skills
than only trying to directly learn these complex skills.
