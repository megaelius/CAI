Studying networks to predict the emerging interactions is a common research problem for both fields
of network science and machine learning. The problem of predicting future or missing relationships
in networks is called link prediction. Machine learning studies have mostly approached to this
problem as a clustering or a classification task. A few obstacles might be involved in approaching
network datasets through machine learning models, including undefined euclidean distance, extracting
proper features, unbalanced data classes due to the sparsity of real networks, or embedding graphs
to a low dimensional vector space while preserving the structure to study networks. Extensive studies
have examined these problems from different aspects and proposed methods some of which might work
very well for a specific application but not as a global solution. In this survey, we review the general-purpose
techniques at the heart of link prediction problem, which can be combined with domain-specific
heuristic methods in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive
study which considers all of the mentioned challenges about studying networks and approaching
them through machine learning models. We provide a diverse study on feature extraction techniques
for network datasets based on similarity metrics, maximum likelihood methods, probabilistic
methods and graph representation learning. Our other contributions include proposing a taxonomy
to classify link prediction methods and continue with introducing valuable network dataset collections
to study the problem of link prediction. Our final contribution is discussing and proposing a few
models, including a multi-stream feature learning model to exploit the benefits of local and quasi-local
network extraction techniques combined with graph representation learning.
