We consider the modified Moran process on graphs to study the spread of genetic and cultural mutations
on structured populations. An initial mutant arises either spontaneously (aka \emph{uniform
initialization}), or during reproduction (aka \emph{temperature initialization}) in a population
of $n$ individuals, and has a fixed fitness advantage $r>1$ over the residents of the population.
The fixation probability is the probability that the mutant takes over the entire population. Graphs
that ensure fixation probability of~1 in the limit of infinite populations are called \emph{strong
amplifiers}. Previously, only a few examples of strong amplifiers were known for uniform initialization,
whereas no strong amplifiers were known for temperature initialization. In this work, we study
necessary and sufficient conditions for strong amplification, and prove negative and positive
results. We show that for temperature initialization, graphs that are unweighted and/or self-loop-free
have fixation probability upper-bounded by $1-1/f(r)$, where $f(r)$ is a function linear in $r$.
Similarly, we show that for uniform initialization, bounded-degree graphs that are unweighted
and/or self-loop-free have fixation probability upper-bounded by $1-1/g(r,c)$, where $c$ is
the degree bound and $g(r,c)$ a function linear in $r$. Our main positive result complements these
negative results, and is as follows: every family of undirected graphs with (i)~self loops and (ii)~diameter
bounded by $n^{1-\epsilon}$, for some fixed $\epsilon>0$, can be assigned weights that makes it
a strong amplifier, both for uniform and temperature initialization.
