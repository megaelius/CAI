Markov switching models (MSMs) are probabilistic models that employ multiple sets of parameters
to describe different dynamic regimes that a time series may exhibit at different periods of time.
The switching mechanism between regimes is controlled by unobserved random variables that form
a first-order Markov chain. Explicit-duration MSMs contain additional variables that explicitly
model the distribution of time spent in each regime. This allows to define duration distributions
of any form, but also to impose complex dependence between the observations and to reset the dynamics
to initial conditions. Models that focus on the first two properties are most commonly known as hidden
semi-Markov models or segment models, whilst models that focus on the third property are most commonly
known as changepoint models or reset models. In this monograph, we provide a description of explicit-duration
modelling by categorizing the different approaches into three groups, which differ in encoding
in the explicit-duration variables different information about regime change/reset boundaries.
The approaches are described using the formalism of graphical models, which allows to graphically
represent and assess statistical dependence and therefore to easily describe the structure of
complex models and derive inference routines. The presentation is intended to be pedagogical,
focusing on providing a characterization of the three groups in terms of model structure constraints
and inference properties. The monograph is supplemented with a software package that contains
most of the models and examples described. The material presented should be useful to both researchers
wishing to learn about these models and researchers wishing to develop them further.
