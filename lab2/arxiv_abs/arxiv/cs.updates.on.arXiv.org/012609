The emerging mobile devices in this era of internet-of-things (IoT) require a dedicated processor
to enable computationally intensive applications such as neuromorphic computing and signal processing.
Vector-by-matrix multiplication (VMM) is the most prominent operation in these applications.
Therefore, there is a critical need for compact and ultralow-power VMM blocks to perform resource-intensive
low-to-moderate precision computations. To this end, in this work, for the first time, we propose
a time-domain mixed-signal VMM exploiting a modified configuration of 1MOSFET-1RRAM (1T-1R)
array. The proposed VMM overcomes the energy inefficiency of the current-mode VMM approaches based
on RRAMs. A rigorous analysis of the different non-ideal factors affecting the computational precision
indicates that the non-negligible minimum cell currents, channel length modulation (CLM) and
drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) are the dominant mechanisms degrading the precision of
the proposed VMM. Our results also indicate that there exists a trade-off between the computational
precision, dynamic range, and the area- and energy-efficiency of the proposed VMM approach. Therefore,
we provide the necessary design guidelines for optimizing the performance. Our preliminary results
show that an effective computational precision of 6-bits is achievable owing to an inherent compensation
effect in the modified 1T-1R blocks. Furthermore, a 4-bit 200x200 VMM utilizing the proposed approach
exhibits a significantly high energy efficiency of ~1.5 POps/J and a throughput of 2.5 TOps/s including
the contribution from the input/output (I/O) circuitry.
