Wave propagation and scattering problems in acoustics are often solved with boundary element methods.
They lead to a discretization matrix that is typically dense and large: its size and condition number
grow with increasing frequency. Yet, high frequency scattering problems are intrinsically local
in nature, which is well represented by highly localized rays bouncing around. Asymptotic methods
can be used to reduce the size of the linear system, even making it frequency independent, by explicitly
extracting the oscillatory properties from the solution using ray tracing or analogous techniques.
However, ray tracing becomes expensive or even intractable in the presence of (multiple) scattering
obstacles with complicated geometries. In this paper, we start from the same discretization that
constructs the fully resolved large and dense matrix, and achieve asymptotic compression by explicitly
localizing the Green's function instead. This results in a large but sparse matrix, with a faster
associated matrix-vector product and, as numerical experiments indicate, a much improved condition
number. Though an appropriate localisation of the Green's function also depends on asymptotic
information unavailable for general geometries, we can construct it adaptively in a frequency
sweep from small to large frequencies in a way which automatically takes into account a general incident
wave. We show that the approach is robust with respect to non-convex, multiple and even near-trapping
domains, though the compression rate is clearly lower in the latter case. Furthermore, in spite
of its asymptotic nature, the method is robust with respect to low-order discretizations such as
piecewise constants, linears or cubics, commonly used in applications. On the other hand, we do
not decrease the total number of degrees of freedom compared to a conventional classical discretization.
