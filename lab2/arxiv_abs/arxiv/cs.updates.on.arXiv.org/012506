Mobile edge computing seeks to provide resources to different delay-sensitive applications.
This is a challenging problem as an edge cloud-service provider may not have sufficient resources
to satisfy all resource requests. Furthermore, allocating available resources optimally to different
applications is also challenging. Resource sharing among different edge cloud-service providers
can address the aforementioned limitation as certain service providers may have resources available
that can be ``rented'' by other service providers. However, edge cloud service providers can have
different objectives or \emph{utilities}. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and effective
mechanism to share resources among service providers, while considering the different objectives
of various providers. We model resource sharing as a multi-objective optimization problem and
present a solution framework based on \emph{Cooperative Game Theory} (CGT). We consider the strategy
where each service provider allocates resources to its native applications first and shares the
remaining resources with applications from other service providers. We prove that for a monotonic,
non-decreasing utility function, the game is canonical and convex. Hence, the \emph{core} is not
empty and the grand coalition is stable. We propose two algorithms \emph{Game-theoretic Pareto
optimal allocation} (GPOA) and \emph{Polyandrous-Polygamous Matching based Pareto Optimal
Allocation} (PPMPOA) that provide allocations from the core. Hence the obtained allocations are
\emph{Pareto} optimal and the grand coalition of all the service providers is stable. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed resource sharing framework improves utilities of edge cloud-service
providers and application request satisfaction.
