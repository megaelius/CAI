Police agencies across the globe are increasingly using Online Social Media (OSM) to acquire intelligence
and connect with citizens. Developed nations have well thought of strategies to use OSM for policing.
However, developing nations like India are exploring and evolving OSM as a policing solution. India,
in recent years, experienced many events where rumors and fake content on OSM instigated communal
violence. In contrast to traditional media (e.g. television and print media) used by Indian police
departments, OSM offers velocity, variety, veracity and large volume of information. These introduce
new challenges for police like platforms selection, secure usage strategy, developing trust,
handling offensive comments, and security / privacy implication of information shared through
OSM. Success of police initiatives on OSM to maintain law and order depends both on their understanding
of OSM and citizen's acceptance / participation on these platforms. This study provides multidimensional
understanding of behavior, perceptions, interactions, and expectation regarding policing through
OSM. First, we examined recent updates from four different police pages- Delhi, Bangalore, Uttar
Pradesh and Chennai to comprehend various dimensions of police interaction with citizens on OSM.
Second, we conducted 20 interviews with IPS officers (Indian Police Service) and 17 interviews
with citizens to understand decision rationales and expectation gaps between two stakeholders
(police and citizens); this was followed up with 445 policemen surveys and 204 citizen surveys.
We also present differences between police expectations of Indian and police departments in developed
countries.
