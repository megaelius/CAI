5G networks rely on infrastructure-centric cellular solutions to address data traffic and service
demands. Continuously scaling infrastructure-centric cellular networks is not exempt of challenges,
and beyond 5G networks should consider the active coexistence and coordination of infrastructure-centric
and device-centric wireless networks. Device-centric wireless networks will build from device-to-device
(D2D) and multi-hop cellular networks (MCNs) technologies, and will allow exploiting the mobile
computing, storage and connectivity resources of smart devices (including smartphones, vehicles,
machines and robots). Such resources can be more efficiently utilized using demand-driven opportunistic
networking that establishes the connections between devices and nodes not just based on their presence,
but also on their capacity to support the requested demand and services. This paper presents results
from experimental field tests that demonstrate the cellular spectral efficiency gains that can
be achieved from the combined use of device-centric wireless communications and demand-driven
opportunistic networking. The field trials demonstrate that these technologies can improve the
cellular spectral efficiency of conventional cellular communications under the evaluated scenarios
and conditions by up to a factor of 4.7 in outdoor pedestrian scenarios and a factor of 12 in vehicular
scenarios. These results provide empirical evidences that further motivate progressing towards
a Beyond 5G vision where smart mobile devices become part of the network fabric, and can opportunistically
and locally integrate network management functions to ensure that sufficient resources are placed
where the demand arises.
