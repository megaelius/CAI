A tree decomposition of a graph facilitates computations by grouping vertices into bags that are
interconnected in an acyclic structure, hence their importance in a plethora of problems such as
query evaluation over databases and inference over probabilistic graphical models. The relative
benefit from different tree decompositions is measured by diverse (sometime complex) cost functions
that vary from one application to another. For generic cost functions like width and fill-in, an
optimal tree decomposition can be efficiently computed in some cases, notably when the number of
minimal separators is bounded by a polynomial (due to Bouchitte and Todinca), we refer to this assumption
as "poly-MS." To cover the variety of cost functions in need, it has recently been proposed to devise
algorithms for enumerating many decomposition candidates for applications to choose from using
specialized, or even machine-learned, cost functions. We explore the ability to produce a large
collection of "high quality" tree decompositions. We present the first algorithm for ranked enumeration
of the proper (non-redundant) tree decompositions, or equivalently minimal triangulations,
under a wide class of cost functions that substantially generalizes the above generic ones. On the
theoretical side, we establish the guarantee of polynomial delay if poly-MS is assumed, or if we
are interested in tree decompositions of a width bounded by a constant. We describe an experimental
evaluation on graphs of various domains (including join queries, Bayesian networks, treewidth
benchmarks and random), and explore both the applicability of the poly-MS assumption and the performance
of our algorithm relative to the state of the art.
