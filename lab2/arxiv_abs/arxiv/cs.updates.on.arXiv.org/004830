We analyze optimal strategies for the allocation of a finite budget that can be invested in different
advertising channels over time with the objective of influencing social opinions in a network of
individuals. In our analysis, we consider both exogenous influence mechanisms, such as advertising
campaigns, as well as endogenous mechanisms of social influence, such as word-of-mouth and peer-pressure,
which are modeled using diffusion dynamics. We show that for a broad family of objective functions,
the optimal influence strategy at every time uses all channels at either their maximum rate or not
at all, i.e., a bang-bang strategy. Furthermore, we prove that the number of switches between these
extremes is bounded above by a term that is typically much smaller than the number of agents. This
means that the optimal influence strategy is to exert maximum effort in waves for every channel,
and then cease effort and let the effects propagate. We also show that, at the beginning of the campaign,
the total cost-adjusted reach of an exogenous advertising channel determines its relative value.
In contrast, as we approach our investment horizon (e.g., election day), the optimal strategy is
to invest in channels able to target individuals instead of broad-reaching channels. We demonstrate
that the optimal influence strategies are easily computable in several practical cases, and explicitly
characterize the optimal controls for the case of linear objective functions in closed form. Finally,
we see that, in the canonical example of designing an election campaign, identifying late-deciders
is a critical component in the optimal design.
