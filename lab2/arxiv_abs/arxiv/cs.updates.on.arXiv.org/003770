The augmented scale and complexity of urban transportation networks have significantly increased
the execution time and resource requirements of vehicular network simulations, exceeding the
capabilities of sequential simulators. The need for a parallel and distributed simulation environment
is inevitable from a smart city perspective, especially when the entire city-wide information
system is expected to be integrated with numerous services and ITS applications. In this paper,
we present a conceptual model of an Integrated Distributed Connected Vehicle Simulator (IDCVS)
that can emulate real-time traffic in a large metro area by incorporating hardware-in-the-loop
simulation together with the closed-loop coupling of SUMO and OMNET++. We also discuss the challenges,
issues, and solution approaches for implementing such a parallel closed-loop transportation
network simulator by addressing transportation network partitioning problems, synchronization,
and scalability issues. One unique feature of the envisioned integrated simulation tool is that
it utilizes the vehicle traces collected through multiple roadway sensors-DSRC onboard unit,
magnetometer, loop detector, and video detector. Another major feature of the proposed model is
the incorporation of hybrid parallelism in both transportation and communication simulation
platforms. We identify the challenges and issues involved in IDCVS to incorporate this multi-level
parallelism. We also discuss the approaches for integrating hardware-in-the-loop simulation,
addressing the steps involved in preprocessing sensor data, filtering, and extrapolating missing
data, managing large real-time traffic data, and handling different data formats.
