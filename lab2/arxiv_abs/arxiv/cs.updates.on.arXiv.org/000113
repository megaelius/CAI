We consider multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications over multi-mode fibers (MMFs). Current
MMF standards, such as OM3 and OM4, use fibers with core radii of 50 \mu m, allowing hundreds of modes
to propagate. Unfortunately, due to physical and computational complexity limitations, we cannot
couple and detect hundreds of data streams into and out of the fiber. In order to circumvent this issue,
we present input-output coupling schemes that allow the user to couple and extract a reasonable
number of signals from a fiber with many modes. This approach is particularly attractive as it is
scalable; i.e., the fibers do not have to be replaced every time the number of transmitters or receivers
is increased, a phenomenon that is likely to happen in the near future. We present a statistical channel
model that incorporates intermodal dispersion, chromatic dispersion, mode dependent losses,
mode coupling, and input-output coupling. We show that the statistics of the fiber's frequency
response are independent of frequency. This simplifies the computation of the average Shannon
capacity of the fiber. We also provide an input-output coupling strategy that leads to an increase
in the overall capacity. This strategy can be used whenever channel state information (CSI) is available
at the transmitter. We show that the capacity of an Nt by Nt MIMO system over a fiber with M>>Nt
modes can approach the capacity of an Nt-mode fiber with no mode-dependent losses. We finally present
a statistical input-output coupling model in order to quantify the loss in capacity when CSI is not
available at the transmitter. It turns out that the loss, relative to Nt-mode fibers, is minimal
(less than 0.5 dB) for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and a reasonable range of MDLs.
