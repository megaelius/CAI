Successful engineering requires environmentally adapted procedural and architectural approaches.
While dealing with complicated issues has become an engineering standard mastering uncertainties
in complex environment is still a major issue. Global trends, such as an increasing rate of disruptive
technology changes or merging of technology fields, however, enforce the importance of this complex
habitat. Missing experience in unknown technological territory faces engineers with two questions
of paramount importance: 1) How can the best architectural solution within the space of potential
alternatives be identified? 2) How can a proof-of-concept for considered solutions prior implementation
be provided? Mastering lack of knowledge related risks and uncertainties states one of the most
prominent tasks in according projects. The paper presents a novel methodology of system design
in complex environment called Hyper Space Exploration (HSE). The HSE approach combines methods
of virtual prototyping with those of design of virtual experiments based studies for statistical
learning. Virtual prototyping allows an early feedback on system behavior with a proof-of-concept
prior implementation. Statistical learning enables system architects to systematically build
up the space of potential solution alternatives, model the effects of design and use-case variables
on target indicators in complex territory, quantify target indicator trade-offs and finally identify
Pareto-optimal system solutions. The first part of the paper characterizes engineering challenges
in complex environment. Section two presents the HSE methodology with its two major constituents
work flow and tool chain. Section three outlines first successful HSE applications that already
proved its capabilities and universality. Final section four gives an outlook to further HSE applications
as well as methodological future HSE extensions.
