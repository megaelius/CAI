In developing countries like India agriculture plays an extremely important role in the lives of
the population. In India, around 80\% of the population depend on agriculture or its by-products
as the primary means for employment. Given large population dependency on agriculture, it becomes
extremely important for the government to estimate market factors in advance and prepare for any
deviation from those estimates. Commodity arrivals to market is an extremely important factor
which is captured at district level throughout the country. Historical data and short-term prediction
of important variables such as arrivals, prices, crop quality etc. for commodities are used by the
government to take proactive steps and decide various policy measures. In this paper, we present
a framework to work with short timeseries in conjunction with remote sensing data to predict future
commodity arrivals. We deal with extremely high dimensional data which exceed the observation
sizes by multiple orders of magnitude. We use cascaded layers of dimensionality reduction techniques
combined with regularized regression models for prediction. We present results to predict arrivals
to major markets and state wide prices for `Tur' (red gram) crop in Karnataka, India. Our model consistently
beats popular ML techniques on many instances. Our model is scalable, time efficient and can be generalized
to many other crops and regions. We draw multiple insights from the regression parameters, some
of which are important aspects to consider when predicting more complex quantities such as prices
in the future. We also combine the insights to generate important recommendations for different
government organizations.
