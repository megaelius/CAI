In communication networks, network virtualization can usually provide better capacity utilization
and quality of service (QoS) than what can be achieved otherwise. However, conventional resource
allocation for virtualized networks would still follow a fixed pattern based on the predicted capacity
needs of the users, even though, in reality, the actual traffic demand of a user will always tend to
fluctuate. The mismatch between the fixed capacity allocation and the actual fluctuating traffic
would lead to degradation of provisioned network services and inefficiency in the assigned network
capacity. To overcome this, we propose a new spectrum trading (ST) scheme between virtual optical
networks (VONs) in the context of an elastic optical network (EON). The key idea here is to allow different
VONs to trade their spectrum resources according to the actual capacity they need at different time
instants. A VON with unused spectra can then trade away its unused spectra to other VONs that are short
of spectrum resources at that time. In exchange, it is rewarded with a certain amount of credit for
its contribution to the ST community, which it can then use later to get extra bandwidth, if needed.
The trust-worthiness of the trading records between the VONs is ensured in a distributed fashion
through a blockchain-assisted account book that is updated whenever a new trade occurs. For this,
we develop a software-defined control plane to enable spectrum trading in an EON. The performance
of the ST scheme is evaluated and compared with a scenario without such trading. Our results show
that the proposed ST scheme is effective in improving the QoS of each VON and significantly improves
the overall network capacity utilization.
