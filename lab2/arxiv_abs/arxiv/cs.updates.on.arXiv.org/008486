The paper studies the problem of reaching agreement in a distributed message-passing system prone
to crash failures. Crashes are generated by \constrained\ adversaries - a \wadapt\ adversary,
who has to fix in advance the set of $f$ crash-prone processes, or a \chainadapt\ adversary, who orders
all the processes into $k$ disjoint chains and has to follow this pattern when crashing them. Apart
from these constraints, both of them may crash processes in an adaptive way at any time. While commonly
used \sadapt\ adversaries model attacks and \noadapt\ ones -- pre-defined faults, the constrained
adversaries model more realistic scenarios when there are fault-prone dependent processes, e.g.,
in hierarchical or dependable software/hardware systems. We propose time-efficient consensus
algorithms against such adversaries and also show how to improve the message complexity of proposed
solutions. Finally, we show how to reach consensus against a \kthick\ adversary, limited by an arbitrary
partial order \dk{with a maximal anti-chain of length $k$}. We complement our algorithmic results
with (almost) tight lower bounds, and extend the one for \wadapt\ adversaries to hold also for (syntactically)
weaker \noadapt\ adversaries. Together with the consensus algorithm against \wadapt\ adversaries
(which automatically translates to \noadapt\ adversaries), these results extend the state-of-the-art
of the popular class of \noadapt\ adversaries, in particular the result of Chor, Meritt and Shmoys~\cite{CMS},
and prove general separation between \sadapt\ and the constrained adversaries (including \noadapt)
analyzed by Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or~\cite{BB} and others.
