Consensus and Broadcast are two fundamental problems in distributed computing, whose solutions
have several applications. Intuitively, Consensus should be no harder than Broadcast, and this
can be rigorously established in several models. Can Consensus be easier than Broadcast? In models
that allow noiseless communication, we prove a reduction of (a suitable variant of) Broadcast to
binary Consensus, that preserves the communication model and all complexity parameters such as
randomness, number of rounds, communication per round, etc., while there is a loss in the success
probability of the protocol. Using this reduction, we get, among other applications, the first
logarithmic lower bound on the number of rounds needed to achieve Consensus in the uniform GOSSIP
model on the complete graph. The lower bound is tight and, in this model, Consensus and Broadcast
are equivalent. We then turn to distributed models with noisy communication channels that have
been studied in the context of some bio-inspired systems. In such models, only one noisy bit is exchanged
when a communication channel is established between two nodes, and so one cannot easily simulate
a noiseless protocol by using error-correcting codes. An $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2} n)$ lower bound
on the number of rounds needed for Broadcast is proved by Boczkowski et al. [PLOS Comp. Bio. 2018]
in one such model (noisy uniform PULL, where $\epsilon$ is a parameter that measures the amount of
noise). In such model, we prove a new $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2} n \log n)$ bound for Broadcast and a $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2}
\log n)$ bound for binary Consensus, thus establishing an exponential gap between the number of
rounds necessary for Consensus versus Broadcast.
