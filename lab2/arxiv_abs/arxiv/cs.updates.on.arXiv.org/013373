As an integral component of blind image deblurring, non-blind deconvolution removes image blur
with a given blur kernel, which is essential but difficult due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse
problem. The predominant approach is based on optimization subject to regularization functions
that are either manually designed, or learned from examples. Existing learning based methods have
shown superior restoration quality but are not practical enough due to their restricted and static
model design. They solely focus on learning a prior and require to know the noise level for deconvolution.
We address the gap between the optimization-based and learning-based approaches by learning a
universal gradient descent optimizer. We propose a Recurrent Gradient Descent Network (RGDN)
by systematically incorporating deep neural networks into a fully parameterized gradient descent
scheme. A hyper-parameter-free update unit shared across steps is used to generate updates from
the current estimates, based on a convolutional neural network. By training on diverse examples,
the Recurrent Gradient Descent Network learns an implicit image prior and a universal update rule
through recursive supervision. The learned optimizer can be repeatedly used to improve the quality
of diverse degenerated observations. The proposed method possesses strong interpretability
and high generalization. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and challenging real-world
images demonstrate that the proposed deep optimization method is effective and robust to produce
favorable results as well as practical for real-world image deblurring applications.
