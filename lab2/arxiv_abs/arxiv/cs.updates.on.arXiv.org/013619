Land cover mapping is essential for monitoring the environment and understanding the effects of
human activities on it. The automatic approaches to land cover mapping (i.e., image segmentation)
mostly used traditional machine learning. On the natural images, deep learning has outperformed
traditional machine learning on a range of tasks, including the image segmentation. On remote sensing
images, recent studies are demonstrating successful application of specific deep learning models
or their adaptations to particular small-scale mapping tasks (e.g., to classify wetland complexes).
However, it is not readily clear which of the existing models for natural images are the best candidates
to be taken for the particular remote sensing task and data. In this study, we answer that question
for mapping the fundamental land cover classes using the satellite imaging radar data. We took ESA
Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images available at no cost to users as representative data. CORINE land cover
map was used as a reference, and the models were trained to distinguish between the 5 Level-1 CORINE
classes. We selected seven among the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models so that they
cover a diverse set of approaches. We used 14 ESA Sentinel-1 scenes acquired during the summer season
in Finland, which are representative of the land cover in the country. Upon the benchmarking, all
the models demonstrated solid performance. The best model, FC-DenseNet (Fully Convolutional
DenseNets), achieved the overall accuracy of 90.7%. Overall, our results indicate that the semantic
segmentation models are suitable for efficient wide-area mapping using satellite SAR imagery.
Our results also provide baseline accuracy against which the newly proposed models should be evaluated
and suggest the DenseNet-based models are the first candidate for this task.
