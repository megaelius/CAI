This paper considers the secrecy transmission in a large-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled
wireless network, in which a set of UAVs in the sky transmit confidential information to their respective
legitimate receivers on the ground, in the presence of another set of randomly distributed suspicious
ground eavesdroppers. We assume that the horizontal locations of legitimate receivers and eavesdroppers
are distributed as two independent homogeneous Possion point processes (PPPs), and each of the
UAVs is positioned exactly above its corresponding legitimate receiver for efficient secrecy
communication. Furthermore, we consider an elevation-angle-dependent line-of-sight (LoS)/non-LoS
(NLoS) path-loss model for air-to-ground (A2G) wireless channels and employ the wiretap code for
secrecy transmission. Under such setups, we first characterize the secrecy communication performance
(in terms of the connection probability, secrecy outage probability, and secrecy transmission
capacity) in mathematically tractable forms, and accordingly optimize the system configurations
(i.e., the wiretap code rates and UAV positioning altitude) to maximize the secrecy transmission
capacity, subject to a maximum secrecy outage probability constraint. Next, we propose to use the
secrecy guard zone technique for further secrecy protection, and analyze the correspondingly
achieved secrecy communication performance. Finally, we present numerical results to validate
the theoretical analysis. It is shown that the employment of secrecy guard zone significantly improves
the secrecy transmission capacity of this network, and the desirable guard zone radius generally
decreases monotonically as the UAVs' and/or the eavesdroppers' densities increase.
