In the influence maximization (IM) problem, we are given a social network and a budget $k$, and we
look for a set of $k$ nodes in the network, called seeds, that maximize the expected number of nodes
that are reached by an influence cascade generated by the seeds, according to some stochastic model
for influence diffusion. In this paper, we study the adaptive IM, where the nodes are selected sequentially
one by one, and the decision on the $i$th seed can be based on the observed cascade produced by the first
$i-1$ seeds. We focus on the full-adoption feedback in which we can observe the entire cascade of
each previously selected seed and on the independent cascade model where each edge is associated
with an independent probability of diffusing influence. Our main result is the first sub-linear
upper bound that holds for any graph. Specifically, we show that the adaptivity gap is upper-bounded
by $\lceil n^{1/3}\rceil $, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. Moreover, we improve over
the known upper bound for in-arborescences from $\frac{2e}{e-1}\approx 3.16$ to $\frac{2e^2}{e^2-1}\approx
2.31$. Finally, we study $\alpha$-bounded graphs, a class of undirected graphs in which the sum
of node degrees higher than two is at most $\alpha$, and show that the adaptivity gap is upper-bounded
by $\sqrt{\alpha}+O(1)$. Moreover, we show that in 0-bounded graphs, i.e. undirected graphs in
which each connected component is a path or a cycle, the adaptivity gap is at most $\frac{3e^3}{e^3-1}\approx
3.16$. To prove our bounds, we introduce new techniques to relate adaptive policies with non-adaptive
ones that might be of their own interest.
