The recent line of research into topology design focuses on lowering network diameter. Many low-diameter
topologies such as Slim Fly or Jellyfish that substantially reduce cost, power consumption, and
latency have been proposed. A key challenge in realizing the benefits of these topologies is routing.
On one hand, these networks provide shorter path lengths than established topologies such as Clos
or torus, leading to performance improvements. On the other hand, the number of shortest paths between
each pair of endpoints is much smaller than in Clos, but there is a large number of non-minimal paths
between router pairs. This hampers or even makes it impossible to use established multipath routing
schemes such as ECMP. In this work, to facilitate high-performance routing in modern networks,
we analyze existing routing protocols and architectures, focusing on how well they exploit the
diversity of minimal and non-minimal paths. We first develop a taxonomy of different forms of support
for multipathing and overall path diversity. Then, we analyze how existing routing schemes support
this diversity. Among others, we consider multipathing with both shortest and non-shortest paths,
support for disjoint paths, or enabling adaptivity. To address the ongoing convergence of HPC and
"Big Data" domains, we consider routing protocols developed for both traditional HPC systems and
supercomputers, and for data centers and general clusters. Thus, we cover architectures and protocols
based on Ethernet, InfiniBand, and other HPC networks such as Myrinet. Our review will foster developing
future high-performance multipathing routing protocols in supercomputers and data centers.
