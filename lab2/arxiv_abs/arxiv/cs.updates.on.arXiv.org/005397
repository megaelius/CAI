Once self-driving car becomes a reality and passengers are no longer worry about it, they will need
to find new ways of entertainment. However, retrieving entertainment contents at the Data Center
(DC) can hinder content delivery service due to high delay of car-to-DC communication. To address
these challenges, we propose a deep learning based caching for self-driving car, by using Deep Learning
approaches deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) structure. First, at DC, Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) is used to predict the probabilities of contents to be requested in specific areas.
To reduce the car-DC delay, MLP outputs are logged into MEC servers attached to roadside units. Second,
in order to cache entertainment contents stylized for car passengers' features such as age and gender,
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to predict age and gender of passengers. Third, each
car requests MLP output from MEC server and compares its CNN and MLP outputs by using k-means and binary
classification. Through this, the self-driving car can identify the contents need to be downloaded
from the MEC server and cached. Finally, we formulate deep learning based caching in the self-driving
car that enhances entertainment services as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize content
downloading delay. To solve the formulated problem, a Block Successive Majorization-Minimization
(BS-MM) technique is applied. The simulation results show that the accuracy of our prediction for
the contents need to be cached in the areas of the self-driving car is achieved at 98.04% and our approach
can minimize delay.
