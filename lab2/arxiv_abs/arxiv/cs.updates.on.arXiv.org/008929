Human activity recognition based on mobile device sensor data has been an active research area in
mobile and pervasive computing for several years. While the majority of the proposed techniques
are based on supervised learning, semi-supervised approaches are being considered to significantly
reduce the size of the training set required to initialize the recognition model. These approaches
usually apply self-training or active learning to incrementally refine the model, but their effectiveness
seems to be limited to a restricted set of physical activities. We claim that the context which surrounds
the user (e.g., semantic location, proximity to transportation routes, time of the day) combined
with common knowledge about the relationship between this context and human activities could be
effective in significantly increasing the set of recognized activities including those that are
difficult to discriminate only considering inertial sensors, and the ones that are highly context-dependent.
In this paper, we propose CAVIAR, a novel hybrid semi-supervised and knowledge-based system for
real-time activity recognition. Our method applies semantic reasoning to context data to refine
the prediction of a semi-supervised classifier. The context-refined predictions are used as new
labeled samples to update the classifier combining self-training and active learning techniques.
Results on a real dataset obtained from 26 subjects show the effectiveness of the context-aware
approach both on the recognition rates and on the number of queries to the subjects generated by the
active learning module. In order to evaluate the impact of context reasoning, we also compare CAVIAR
with a purely statistical version, considering features computed on context data as part of the
machine learning process.
