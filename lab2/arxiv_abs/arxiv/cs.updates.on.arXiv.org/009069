A dataset of measurements of ETSI ITS-G5 Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) is presented.
Our dataset consists of network interactions happening between two On-Board Units (OBUs) and four
Road Side Units (RSUs). Each OBU was fitted onto a vehicle driven across the FLOURISH Test Track in
Bristol, UK. Each RSU and OBU was equipped with two transceivers operating at different frequencies.
During our experiments, each transceiver broadcasts Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) over
the licensed DSRC band, and over the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical radio (ISM)
bands 2.4GHz-2.5GHz and 5.725GHz-5.875GHz. Each transmitted and received CAM is logged along
with its Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value and accurate positioning information.
The Media Access Control layer (MAC) layer Packet Delivery Rates (PDRs) and RSSI values are also
empirically calculated across the whole length of the track for any transceiver. The dataset can
be used to derive realistic approximations of the PDR as a function of RSSI values under urban environments
and for both the DSRC and ISM bands -- thus, the dataset is suitable to calibrate (simplified) physical
layers of full-stack vehicular simulators where the MAC layer PDR is a direct function of the RSSI.
The dataset is not intended to be used for signal propagation modelling.} The dataset can be found
at https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.eupowp7h3jl525yxhm3521f57 , and it has been analyzed in the
following paper: I. Mavromatis, A. Tassi, and R. J. Piechocki, "Operating ITS-G5 DSRC over Unlicensed
Bands: A City-Scale Performance Evaluation," IEEE PIMRC 2019. [Online]. Available: arXiv:1904.00464.
