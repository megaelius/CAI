In wireless networks, consisting of battery-powered devices, energy is a costly resource and most
of it is spent on transmitting and receiving messages. Broadcast is a problem where a message needs
to be transmitted from one node to all other nodes of the network. We study algorithms that can work
under limited energy measured as the maximum number of transmissions by a single station. The goal
of the paper is to study tradeoffs between time and energy complexity of broadcast problem in multi-hop
radio networks. We consider a model where the topology of the network is unknown and if two neighbors
of a station are transmitting in the same discrete time slot, then the signals collide and the receiver
cannot distinguish the collided signals from silence. We observe that existing, time efficient,
algorithms are not optimized with respect to energy expenditure. We then propose and analyse two
new randomized energy-efficient algorithms. Our first algorithm works in time $O((D+\varphi)\cdot
n^{1/\varphi}\cdot \varphi)$ with high probability and uses $O(\varphi)$ energy per station
for any $\varphi \leq \log n/(2\log\log n)$ for any graph with $n$ nodes and diameter $D$. Our second
algorithm works in time $O((D+\log n)\log n)$ with high probability and uses $O(\log n/\log\log
n)$ energy. We prove that our algorithms are almost time-optimal for given energy limits for graphs
with constant diameters by constructing lower bound on time of $\Omega(n^{1/\varphi} \cdot \varphi)$.
The lower bound shows also that any algorithm working in polylogaritmic time in $n$ for all graphs
needs energy $\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$.
