In silico Drug-target Interaction (DTI) prediction is an important and challenging problem in
medicinal chemistry with a huge potential benefit to the pharmaceutical industry and patients.
Most existing methods for DTI prediction generally have binary endpoints, which could be an oversimplification
of the problem. With the advent of deep learning, some deep learning models were devised to solve
the DTI prediction problem, but most of them still use binary endpoints, and they are generally unable
to handle cold-target problems, i.e., problems involving target protein that never appeared in
the training set. We contrived PADME (Protein And Drug Molecule interaction prEdiction), a framework
based on Deep Neural Networks, to predict real-valued interaction strength between compounds
and proteins. PADME inputs both compound and protein information into the model, so it is applicable
to cold-target problems. To our knowledge, we are also the first to incorporate Molecular Graph
Convolution (MGC) into the model for compound featurization. We used different Cross-Validation
split schemes and different metrics to measure the performance of PADME on multiple datasets (in
which we are the first to use ToxCast for such problems), and PADME consistently dominates baseline
methods. We also conducted a case study, predicting the interaction between compounds and androgen
receptor (AR) and compared the prediction results with growth inhibition activity of the compounds
in NCI60, which also gave us satisfactory results, suggesting PADME's potential in drug development.
We expect different variants of PADME to be proposed and experimented on in the future, and we believe
Deep Learning will transform the field of cheminformatics.
