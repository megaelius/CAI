In this paper, we propose an analysis mechanism based structured Analysis Discriminative Dictionary
Learning (ADDL) framework. ADDL seamlessly integrates the analysis discriminative dictionary
learning, analysis representation and analysis classifier training into a unified model. The
applied analysis mechanism can make sure that the learnt dictionaries, representations and linear
classifiers over different classes are independent and discriminating as much as possible. The
dictionary is obtained by minimizing a reconstruction error and an analytical incoherence promoting
term that encourages the sub-dictionaries associated with different classes to be independent.
To obtain the representation coefficients, ADDL imposes a sparse l2,1-norm constraint on the coding
coefficients instead of using l0 or l1-norm, since the l0 or l1-norm constraint applied in most existing
DL criteria makes the training phase time consuming. The codes-extraction projection that bridges
data with the sparse codes by extracting special features from the given samples is calculated via
minimizing a sparse codes approximation term. Then we compute a linear classifier based on the approximated
sparse codes by an analysis mechanism to simultaneously consider the classification and representation
powers. Thus, the classification approach of our model is very efficient, because it can avoid the
extra time-consuming sparse reconstruction process with trained dictionary for each new test
data as most existing DL algorithms. Simulations on real image databases demonstrate that our ADDL
model can obtain superior performance over other state-of-the-arts.
