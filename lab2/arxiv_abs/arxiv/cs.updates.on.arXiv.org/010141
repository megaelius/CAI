The concept of low-congestion shortcuts is initiated by Ghaffari and Haeupler [SODA2016] for addressing
the design of CONGEST algorithms running fast in restricted network topologies. Specifically,
given a specific graph class $X$, an $f$-round algorithm of constructing shortcuts of quality $q$
for any instance in $X$ results in $\tilde{O}(q + f)$-round algorithms of solving several fundamental
graph problems such as minimum spanning tree and minimum cut, for $X$. In this paper, we consider
the relationship between the quality of low-congestion shortcuts and three major graph parameters,
chordality, diameter, and clique-width. The main contribution of the paper is threefold: (1) We
show an $O(1)$-round algorithm which constructs a low-congestion shortcut with quality $O(kD)$
for any $k$-chordal graph, and prove that the quality and running time of this construction is nearly
optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. (2) We present two algorithms, each of which constructs
a low-congestion shortcut with quality $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ in $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ rounds
for graphs of $D=3$, and that with quality $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ in $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ rounds
for graphs of $D=4$ respectively. These results obviously deduce two MST algorithms running in
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ and $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ rounds for $D=3$ and $4$ respectively, which
almost close the long-standing complexity gap of the MST construction in small-diameter graphs
originally posed by Lotker et al. [Distributed Computing 2006]. (3) We show that bounding clique-width
does not help the construction of good shortcuts by presenting a network topology of clique-width
six where the construction of MST is as expensive as the general case.
