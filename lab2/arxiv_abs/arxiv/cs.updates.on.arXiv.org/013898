To leverage data and computation capabilities of mobile devices, machine learning algorithms
are deployed at the network edge for training artificial intelligence (AI) models, resulting in
the new paradigm of edge learning. In this paper, we consider the framework of partitioned edge learning
for iteratively training a large-scale model using many resource-constrained devices (called
workers). To this end, in each iteration, the model is dynamically partitioned into parametric
blocks, which are downloaded to worker groups for updating using data subsets. Then, the local updates
are uploaded to and cascaded by the server for updating a global model. To reduce resource usage by
minimizing the total learning-and-communication latency, this work focuses on the novel j.pdfoint
design of parameter (computation load) allocation and bandwidth allocation (for downloading
and uploading). Two design approaches are adopted. First, a practical sequential approach, called
partially integrated parameter-and-bandwidth allocation (PABA), yields two schemes, namely
bandwidth aware parameter allocation and parameter aware bandwidth allocation. The former minimizes
the load for the slowest (in computing) of worker groups, each training a same parametric block.
The latter allocates the largest bandwidth to the worker being the latency bottleneck. Second,
PABA are jointly optimized. Despite its being a nonconvex problem, an efficient and optimal solution
algorithm is derived by intelligently nesting a bisection search and solving a convex problem.
Experimental results using real data demonstrate that integrating PABA can substantially improve
the performance of partitioned edge learning in terms of latency (by e.g., 46%) and accuracy (by
e.g., 4%).
