In this paper, we apply the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique to improve the massive
channel access of a wireless IoT network where solar-powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) relay
data from IoT devices to remote servers. Specifically, IoT devices contend for accessing the shared
wireless channel using an adaptive $p$-persistent slotted Aloha protocol; and the solar-powered
UAVs adopt Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to decode multiple received data from IoT
devices to improve access efficiency. To enable an energy-sustainable capacity-optimal network,
we study the joint problem of dynamic multi-UAV altitude control and multi-cell wireless channel
access management of IoT devices as a stochastic control problem with multiple energy constraints.
To learn an optimal control policy, we first formulate this problem as a Constrained Markov Decision
Process (CMDP), and propose an online model-free Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL)
algorithm based on Lagrangian primal-dual policy optimization to solve the CMDP. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our proposed algorithm learns a cooperative policy among UAVs in which the altitude
of UAVs and channel access probability of IoT devices are dynamically and jointly controlled to
attain the maximal long-term network capacity while maintaining energy sustainability of UAVs.
The proposed algorithm outperforms Deep RL based solutions with reward shaping to account for energy
costs, and achieves a temporal average system capacity which is $82.4\%$ higher than that of a feasible
DRL based solution, and only $6.47\%$ lower compared to that of the energy-constraint-free system.
