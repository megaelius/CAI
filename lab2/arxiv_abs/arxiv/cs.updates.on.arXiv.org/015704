Ad and tracking blocking extensions are popular tools for improving web performance, privacy and
aesthetics. Content blocking extensions typically rely on filter lists to decide whether a web
request is associated with tracking or advertising, and so should be blocked. Millions of web users
rely on filter lists to protect their privacy and improve their browsing experience. Despite their
importance, the growth and health of filter lists are poorly understood. Filter lists are maintained
by a small number of contributors, who use a variety of undocumented heuristics to determine what
rules should be included. Lists quickly accumulate rules, and rules are rarely removed. As a result,
users' browsing experiences are degraded as the number of stale, dead or otherwise not useful rules
increasingly dwarf the number of useful rules, with no attenuating benefit. An accumulation of
"dead weight" rules also makes it difficult to apply filter lists on resource-limited mobile devices.
This paper improves the understanding of crowdsourced filter lists by studying EasyList, the most
popular filter list. We find that EasyList has grown from several hundred rules, to well over 60,000
rules, during its 9-year history. We measure how EasyList affects web browsing by applying EasyList
to a sample of 10,000 websites. We find that 90.16% of the resource blocking rules in EasyList provide
no benefit to users in common browsing scenarios. We further use our changes in EasyList application
rates to provide a taxonomy of the ways advertisers evade EasyList rules. Finally, we propose optimizations
for popular ad-blocking tools, that allow EasyList to be applied on performance constrained mobile
devices, and improve desktop performance by 62.5%, while preserving over 99% of blocking coverage.
