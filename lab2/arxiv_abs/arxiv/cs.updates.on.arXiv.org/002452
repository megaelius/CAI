Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are used to identify statistically significant genetic
variants in case-control studies. GWAS typically use a p-value threshold of 5 x 10-8 to identify
highly ranked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, evidence has shown that many of
these are, in fact, false positives. Using lower p-values it is possible to to investigate the joint
epistatic interactions between SNPs and provide better insights into phenotype expression. However,
computational complexity is increased exponentially as a function of higher-order combinations.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework, based on nonlinear transformations of combinatorically
large SNP data, using stacked autoencoders, to identify higher-order SNP interactions. We focus
on the challenging problem of classifying preterm births. Evidence suggests that this complex
condition has a strong genetic component with unexplained heritability reportedly between 20%-40%.
This claim is substantiated using a GWAS data set, obtained from dbGap, which contains predominantly
urban low-income African-American women who had normal deliveries (between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation)
and preterm deliveries (less than 37 weeks of gestation). Latent representations from original
SNP sequences are used to initialize a deep learning classifier before it is fine-tuned for classification
tasks (term and preterm births). The complete network models the epistatic effects of major and
minor SNP perturbations. All models are evaluated using standard binary classifier performance
metrics. The findings show that important information pertaining to SNPs and epistasis can be extracted
from 4666 raw SNPs generated using logistic regression (p-value=5 x 10-3) and used to fit a deep learning
model and obtain results (Sen=0.9289, Spec=0.9591, Gini=0.9651, Logloss=0.3080, AUC=0.9825,
MSE=0.0942) using 500 hidden nodes.
