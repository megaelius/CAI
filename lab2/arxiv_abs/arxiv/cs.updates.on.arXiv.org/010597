The integration of Internet-of-Things and pervasive computing in medical devices have made the
modern healthcare system "smart". Today, the function of the healthcare system is not limited to
treat the patients only. With the help of implantable medical devices and wearables, Smart Healthcare
System (SHS) can continuously monitor different vital signs of a patient and automatically detect
and prevent critical medical conditions. However, these increasing functionalities of SHS raise
several security concerns and attackers can exploit the SHS in numerous ways: they can impede normal
function of the SHS, inject false data to change vital signs, and tamper a medical device to change
the outcome of a medical emergency. In this paper, we propose HealthGuard, a novel machine learning-based
security framework to detect malicious activities in a SHS. HealthGuard observes the vital signs
of different connected devices of a SHS and correlates the vitals to understand the changes in body
functions of the patient to distinguish benign and malicious activities. HealthGuard utilizes
four different machine learning-based detection techniques (Artificial Neural Network, Decision
Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor) to detect malicious activities in a SHS. We trained HealthGuard
with data collected for eight different smart medical devices for twelve benign events including
seven normal user activities and five disease-affected events. Furthermore, we evaluated the
performance of HealthGuard against three different malicious threats. Our extensive evaluation
shows that HealthGuard is an effective security framework for SHS with an accuracy of 91% and an F-1
score of 90%.
