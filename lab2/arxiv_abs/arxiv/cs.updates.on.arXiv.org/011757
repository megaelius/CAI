Purpose: Segmentation of organs-at-risk (OARs) is a bottleneck in current radiation oncology
pipelines and is often time consuming and labor intensive. In this paper, we propose an atlas-based
semi-supervised registration algorithm to generate accurate segmentations of OARs for which
there are ground truth contours and rough segmentations of all other OARs in the atlas. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to use learning-based registration methods for the segmentation
of head and neck patients and demonstrate its utility in clinical applications. Methods: Our algorithm
cascades rigid and deformable deformation blocks, and takes on an atlas image (M), set of atlas-space
segmentations (S_A), and a patient image (F) as inputs, while outputting patient-space segmentations
of all OARs defined on the atlas. We train our model on 475 CT images taken from public archives and
Stanford RadOnc Clinic (SROC), validate on 5 CT images from SROC, and test our model on 20 CT images
from SROC. Results: Our method outperforms current state of the art learning-based registration
algorithms and achieves an overall dice score of 0.789 on our test set. Moreover, our method yields
a performance comparable to manual segmentation and supervised segmentation, while solving a
much more complex registration problem. Whereas supervised segmentation methods only automate
the segmentation process for a select few number of OARs, we demonstrate that our methods can achieve
similar performance for OARs of interest, while also providing segmentations for every other OAR
on the provided atlas. Conclusions: Our proposed algorithm has significant clinical applications
and could help reduce the bottleneck for segmentation of head and neck OARs. Further, our results
demonstrate that semi-supervised diffeomorphic registration can be accurately applied to both
registration and segmentation problems.
