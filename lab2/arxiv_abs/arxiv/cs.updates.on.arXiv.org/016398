Non-rigid cortical registration is an important and challenging task due to the geometric complexity
of the human cortex and the high degree of inter-subject variability. A conventional solution is
to use a spherical representation of surface properties and perform registration by aligning cortical
folding patterns in that space. This strategy produces accurate spatial alignment but often requires
a high computational cost. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated
the potential to dramatically speed up volumetric registration. However, due to distortions introduced
by projecting a sphere to a 2D plane, a direct application of recent learning-based methods to surfaces
yields poor results. In this study, we present SphereMorph, a diffeomorphic registration framework
for cortical surfaces using deep networks that addresses these issues. SphereMorph uses a UNet-style
network associated with a spherical kernel to learn the displacement field and warps the sphere
using a modified spatial transformer layer. We propose a resampling weight in computing the data
fitting loss to account for distortions introduced by polar projection, and demonstrate the performance
of our proposed method on two tasks, including cortical parcellation and group-wise functional
area alignment. The experiments show that the proposed SphereMorph is capable of modeling the geometric
registration problem in a CNN framework and demonstrate superior registration accuracy and computational
efficiency. The source code of SphereMorph will be released to the public upon acceptance of this
manuscript at https://github.com/voxelmorph/spheremorph.
