Recent technological advances have fostered the development of complex industrial cyber-physical
systems which demand real-time communication with delay guarantees. The consequences of delay
requirement violation in such systems may become increasingly severe. In this paper, we propose
a contract-based fault-resilient methodology which aims at managing the communication delays
of real-time flows in industries. With this objective, we present a light-weight mechanism to estimate
end-to-end delay in the network in which the clocks of the switches are not synchronized. The mechanism
aims at providing high level of accuracy with lower communication overhead. We then propose a contract-based
framework using software-defined networking where the components are associated with delay contracts
and a resilience manager. The proposed resilience management framework contains: (1) contracts
which state guarantees about components behaviors, (2) observers which are responsible to detect
contract failure (fault), (3) monitors to detect events such as run-time changes in the delay requirements
and link failure, (4) control logic to take suitable decisions based on the type of the fault, (5)
resilience manager to decide response strategies containing the best course of action as per the
control logic decision. Finally, we present a delay-aware path finding algorithm which is used
to route/reroute the real-time flows to provide resiliency in the case of faults and, to adapt to
the changes in the network state. Performance of the proposed framework is evaluated with the Ryu
SDN controller and Mininet network emulator.
