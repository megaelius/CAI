Roughgarden, Vassilvitskii, and Wang (JACM 18) recently introduced a novel framework for proving
lower bounds for Massively Parallel Computation using techniques from boolean function complexity.
We extend their framework in two different ways, to capture two common features of Massively Parallel
Computation: $\circ$ Adaptivity, where machines can write to and adaptively read from shared memory
throughout the execution of the computation. Recent work of Behnezhad et al. (SPAA 19) showed that
adaptivity enables significantly improved round complexities for a number of central graph problems.
$\circ$ Promise problems, where the algorithm only has to succeed on certain inputs. These inputs
may have special structure that is of particular interest, or they may be representative of hard
instances of the overall problem. Using this extended framework, we give the first unconditional
lower bounds on the complexity of distinguishing whether an input graph is a cycle of length $n$ or
two cycles of length $n/2$. This promise problem, 1v2-Cycle, has emerged as a central problem in
the study of Massively Parallel Computation. We prove that any adaptive algorithm for the 1v2-Cycle
problem with I/O capacity $O(n^{\varepsilon})$ per machine requires $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$
rounds, matching a recent upper bound of Behnezhad et al. In addition to strengthening the connections
between Massively Parallel Computation and boolean function complexity, we also develop new machinery
to reason about the latter. At the heart of our proofs are optimal lower bounds on the query complexity
and approximate certificate complexity of the 1v2-Cycle problem.
