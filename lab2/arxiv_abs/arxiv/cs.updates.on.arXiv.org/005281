The capacity to filter out irrelevant information from our environment is critical to efficient
processing. Yet, during development, when building a knowledge base of the world is occurring,
the ability to selectively allocate attentional resources is limited (e.g., Amso & Scerif, 2015).
In adulthood, research has demonstrated that surrounding the spatial location of attentional
focus is a suppressive field, resulting from top-down attention promoting the processing of relevant
stimuli and inhibiting surrounding distractors (e.g., Hopf et al., 2006). It is not fully known,
however, whether this phenomenon manifests in development. In the current study, we examined whether
spatial suppression surrounding the focus of visual attention is exhibited in developmental age
groups. Participants between 12 and 27 years of age exhibited spatial suppression surrounding
their focus of visual attention. Their accuracy increased as a function of the separation distance
between a spatially cued (and attended) target and a second target, suggesting that a ring of suppression
surrounded the attended target. When a central cue was instead presented and therefore attention
was no longer spatially cued, surround suppression was not observed, indicating that our initial
findings of suppression were indeed related to the focus of attention. Attentional surround suppression
was not observed in 8- to 11-years-olds, even with a longer spatial cue presentation time, demonstrating
that the lack of the effect at these ages is not due to slowed attentional feedback processes. Our
findings demonstrate that top-down attentional processes are still immature until approximately
12 years of age, and that they continue to be refined throughout adolescence, converging well with
previous research on attentional development.
