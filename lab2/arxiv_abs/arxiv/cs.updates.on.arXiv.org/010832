We introduce a method for training neural networks to perform image or volume segmentation in which
prior knowledge about the topology of the segmented object can be explicitly provided and then incorporated
into the training process. By using the differentiable properties of persistent homology, a concept
used in topological data analysis, we can specify the desired topology of segmented objects in terms
of their Betti numbers and then drive the proposed segmentations to contain the specified topological
features. Importantly this process does not require any ground-truth labels, just prior knowledge
of the topology of the structure being segmented. We demonstrate our approach in three experiments.
Firstly we create a synthetic task in which handwritten MNIST digits are de-noised, and show that
using this kind of topological prior knowledge in the training of the network significantly improves
the quality of the de-noised digits. Secondly we perform an experiment in which the task is segmenting
the myocardium of the left ventricle from cardiac magnetic resonance images. We show that the incorporation
of the prior knowledge of the topology of this anatomy improves the resulting segmentations in terms
of both the topological accuracy and the Dice coefficient. Thirdly, we extend the method to 3D volumes
and demonstrate its performance on the task of segmenting the placenta from ultrasound data, again
showing that incorporating topological priors improves performance on this challenging task.
We find that embedding explicit prior knowledge in neural network segmentation tasks is most beneficial
when the segmentation task is especially challenging and that it can be used in either a semi-supervised
or post-processing context to extract a useful training gradient from images without pixelwise
labels.
