The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is widely used for creating ER schemas for modeling application
domains in the field of Information Systems development. However, when an ER schema is transformed
to a Relational Database Schema (RDS), some important information on the ER schema may not be represented
meaningfully on the RDS. This causes a loss of information during the transformation process. Although,
several previous researches have proposed solutions to remedy the situation, the problem still
exists. Thus, in this on-going research, we wish to improve the proposed solutions and maximize
information preservation in the ER to relational transformation process. Cardinality ratio constraints,
role names, composite attributes, and certain relationship types are among the information frequently
lost in the transformation process. Deficiencies in the ER model and the transformation method
seems to cause this situation. We take the view that if the information lost is resolved; a one-to-one
mapping should exist from the ER schema to its RDS. We modified the ER model and the transformation
algorithm following a heuristic research method with a view to eliminating the deficiencies and
thereby achieving a one-to-one mapping. We should show that the mapping exists for any real-world
application. We create a generic ER schema - an ER schema that represents any phenomena in symbolic
form - and use it to show that a one-to-one mapping exists for any real-world application. In this
paper, we explore our generic ER schema and its advantages over its predecessors in view of representing
any real-world application.
