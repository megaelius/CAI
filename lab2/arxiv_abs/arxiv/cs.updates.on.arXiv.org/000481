It has been shown recently by Geng et al. that in a $K$ user Gaussian interference network, if for each
user the desired signal strength is no less than the sum of the strengths of the strongest interference
from this user and the strongest interference to this user (all signal strengths measured in dB scale),
then power control and treating interference as noise (TIN) is sufficient to achieve the entire
generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) region. Motivated by the intuition that the deterministic
model of Avestimehr et al. (ADT deterministic model) is particularly suited for exploring the optimality
of TIN, the results of Geng et al. are first re-visited under the ADT deterministic model, and are
shown to directly translate between the Gaussian and deterministic settings. Next, we focus on
the extension of these results to parallel interference networks, from a sum-capacity/sum-GDoF
perspective. To this end, we interpret the explicit characterization of the sum-capacity/sum-GDoF
of a TIN optimal network (without parallel channels) as a minimum weighted matching problem in combinatorial
optimization, and obtain a simple characterization in terms of a partition of the interference
network into vertex-disjoint cycles. Aided by insights from the cyclic partition, the sum-capacity
optimality of TIN for $K$ user parallel interference networks is characterized for the ADT deterministic
model, leading ultimately to corresponding GDoF results for the Gaussian setting. In both cases,
subject to a mild invertibility condition the optimality of TIN is shown to extend to parallel networks
in a separable fashion.
