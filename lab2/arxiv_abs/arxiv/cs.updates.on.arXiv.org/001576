As low frequency band becomes more and more crowded, millimeter-wave (mmWave) has attracted significant
attention recently. IEEE has released the 802.11ad standard to satisfy the demand of ultra-high-speed
communication. It adopts beamforming technology that can generate directional beams to compensate
for high path loss. In the Association Beamforming Training (A-BFT) phase of beamforming (BF) training,
a station (STA) randomly selects an A-BFT slot to contend for training opportunity. Due to the limited
number of A-BFT slots, A-BFT phase suffers high probability of collisions in dense user scenarios,
resulting in inefficient training performance. Based on the evaluation of the IEEE 802.11ad standard
and 802.11ay draft in dense user scenarios of mmWave wireless networks, we propose an enhanced A-BFT
beam training and random access mechanism, including the Separated A-BFT (SA-BFT) and Secondary
Backoff A-BFT (SBA-BFT). The SA-BFT can provide more A-BFT slots and divide A-BFT slots into two
regions by defining a new `E-A-BFT Length' field compared to the legacy 802.11ad A-BFT, thereby
maintaining compatibility when 802.11ay devices are mixed with 802.11ad devices. It can also reduce
the collision probability in dense user scenarios greatly. The SBA-BFT performs secondary backoff
with very small overhead of transmission opportunities within one A-BFT slot, which not only further
reduces collision probability, but also improves the A-BFT slots utilization. Furthermore, we
propose a three-dimensional Markov model to analyze the performance of the SBA-BFT. The analytical
and simulation results show that both the SA-BFT and the SBA-BFT can significantly improve BF training
efficiency, which are beneficial to the optimization design of dense user wireless networks based
on the IEEE 802.11ay standard and mmWave technology.
