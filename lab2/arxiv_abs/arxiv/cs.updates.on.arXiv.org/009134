The collection of large, complex datasets has become common across a wide variety of domains. Visual
analytics tools increasingly play a key role in exploring and answering complex questions about
these large datasets. However, many visualizations are not designed to concurrently visualize
the large number of dimensions present in complex datasets (e.g. tens of thousands of distinct codes
in an electronic health record system). This fact, combined with the ability of many visual analytics
systems to enable rapid, ad-hoc specification of groups, or cohorts, of individuals based on a small
subset of visualized dimensions, leads to the possibility of introducing selection bias--when
the user creates a cohort based on a specified set of dimensions, differences across many other unseen
dimensions may also be introduced. These unintended side effects may result in the cohort no longer
being representative of the larger population intended to be studied, which can negatively affect
the validity of subsequent analyses. We present techniques for selection bias tracking and visualization
that can be incorporated into high-dimensional exploratory visual analytics systems, with a focus
on medical data with existing data hierarchies. These techniques include: (1) tree-based cohort
provenance and visualization, with a user-specified baseline cohort that all other cohorts are
compared against, and visual encoding of the drift for each cohort, which indicates where selection
bias may have occurred, and (2) a set of visualizations, including a novel icicle-plot based visualization,
to compare in detail the per-dimension differences between the baseline and a user-specified focus
cohort. These techniques are integrated into a medical temporal event sequence visual analytics
tool. We present example use cases and report findings from domain expert user interviews.
