Objective: Accurate surgery duration estimation is necessary for optimal OR planning, which plays
an important role for patient comfort and safety as well as resource optimization. It is however
challenging to preoperatively predict surgery duration since it varies significantly depending
on the patient condition, surgeon skills, and intraoperative situation. We present an approach
for intraoperative estimation of remaining surgery duration, which is well suited for deployment
in the OR. Methods: We propose a deep learning pipeline, named RSDNet, which automatically estimates
the remaining surgery duration intraoperatively by using only visual information from laparoscopic
videos. An interesting feature of RSDNet is that it does not depend on any manual annotation during
training. Results: The experimental results show that the proposed network significantly outperforms
the method that is frequently used in surgical facilities for estimating surgery duration. Further,
the generalizability of the approach is demonstrated by testing the pipeline on two large datasets
containing different types of surgeries, 120 cholecystectomy and 170 gastric bypass videos. Conclusion:
Creation of manual annotations requires expert knowledge and is a time-consuming process, especially
considering the numerous types of surgeries performed in a hospital and the large number of laparoscopic
videos available. Since the proposed pipeline is not reliant on manual annotation, it is easily
scalable to many types of surgeries. Significance: An improved OR management system could be developed
with RSDNet as a result of its superior performance and ability to be efficiently scaled up to many
kinds of surgeries.
