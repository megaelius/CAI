Increased data gathering capacity, together with the spreading of data analytics techniques,
has allowed an unprecedented concentration of information related to the individuals' preferences
in the hands of a few gatekeepers. In such context, the traditional economic literature has been
attempting to frame all the data-driven economy features. Such features, although being able to
bring about a more efficient matching of people and relevant purchase opportunities, also result
into distortions and disequilibria, up to market failures. Data-economy market disequilibria
can be decrypted by leveraging on some of the known network properties, thus obtaining general results
suitable for building a new theoretical framework for economic phenomena. Starting from the hypothesis
that a digital company can always benefit from an underlying network of consumers or items related
to its market, their representation can indeed provide significant competitive advantages, also
enhancing the platforms' capacity to implement discriminatory practices by means of an increased
ability to estimate individuals' preferences. In the present paper, we propose a measure called
Information Patrimony, considering the amount of information available within the system and
we look into how platforms may exploit data stemming from connected profiles within a network, with
a view to obtaining competitive advantages. Such information flow may eventually allow to envisage
the emergence of a new hybrid price discrimination pattern, through which platforms may influence
and steer individuals' purchase choices, as well as to apply different prices to different customers.
