In this work, a dense recurrent convolutional neural network (DRCNN) was constructed to detect
sleep disorders including arousal, apnea and hypopnea using Polysomnography (PSG) measurement
channels provided in the 2018 Physionet challenge database. Our model structure is composed of
multiple dense convolutional units (DCU) followed by a bidirectional long-short term memory (LSTM)
layer followed by a softmax output layer. The sleep events including sleep stages, arousal regions
and multiple types of apnea and hypopnea are manually annotated by experts which enables us to train
our proposed network using a multi-task learning mechanism. Three binary cross-entropy loss functions
corresponding to sleep/wake, target arousal and apnea-hypopnea/normal detection tasks are summed
up to generate our overall network loss function that is optimized using the Adam method. Our model
performance was evaluated using two metrics: the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC)
and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To measure our model generalization,
4-fold cross-validation was also performed. For training, our model was applied to full night recording
data. Finally, the average AUPRC and AUROC values associated with the arousal detection task were
0.505 and 0.922, respectively on our testing dataset. An ensemble of four models trained on different
data folds improved the AUPRC and AUROC to 0.543 and 0.931, respectively. Our proposed algorithm
achieved the first place in the official stage of the 2018 Physionet challenge for detecting sleep
arousals with AUPRC of 0.54 on the blind testing dataset.
