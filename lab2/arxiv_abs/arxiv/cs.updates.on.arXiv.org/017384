Radar sensors are gradually becoming a wide-spread equipment for road vehicles, playing a crucial
role in autonomous driving and road safety. The broad adoption of radar sensors increases the chance
of interference among sensors from different vehicles, generating corrupted range profiles and
range-Doppler maps. In order to extract distance and velocity of multiple targets from range-Doppler
maps, the interference affecting each range profile needs to be mitigated. In this paper, we propose
a fully convolutional neural network for automotive radar interference mitigation. In order to
train our network in a real-world scenario, we introduce a new data set of realistic automotive radar
signals with multiple targets and multiple interferers. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to mitigate interference from multiple sources. Furthermore, we introduce a new training regime
that eliminates noisy weights, showing superior results compared to the widely-used dropout.
While some previous works successfully estimated the magnitude of automotive radar signals, we
are the first to propose a deep learning model that can accurately estimate the phase. For instance,
our novel approach reduces the phase estimation error with respect to the commonly-adopted zeroing
technique by half, from 12.55 degrees to 6.58 degrees. Considering the lack of databases for automotive
radar interference mitigation, we release as open source our large-scale data set that closely
replicates the real-world automotive scenario for multiple interference cases, allowing others
to objectively compare their future work in this domain. Our data set is available for download at:
