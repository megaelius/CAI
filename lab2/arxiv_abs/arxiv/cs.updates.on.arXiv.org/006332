Actions taken immediately following a life-threatening personal health incident are critical
for the survival of the sufferer. The timely arrival of specialist ambulance crew in particular
often makes the difference between life and death. As a consequence, it is critical that emergency
ambulance services achieve short response times. This objective sets a considerable challenge
to ambulance services worldwide, especially in metropolitan areas where the density of incident
occurrence and traffic congestion are high. Using London as a case study, in this paper we consider
the advantages and limitations of data-driven methods for ambulance routing and navigation. Our
long-term aim is to enable considerable improvements to their operational efficiency through
the automated generation of more effective response strategies and tactics. A key ingredient of
our approach is to use a large historical dataset of incidents and ambulance location traces to model
route selection and arrival times. Working on the London road network graph modified to reflect
the differences between emergency and civilian vehicle traffic, we develop a methodology for the
precise estimation of expected ambulance speed at the individual road segment level. We demonstrate
how a model that exploits this information achieves best predictive performance by implicitly
capturing route-specific persistent patterns in changing traffic conditions. We then present
a predictive method that achieves a high route similarity score while minimising journey duration
error. This is achieved through the combination of a technique that correctly predicts routes selected
by the current navigation system of the London Ambulance Service and our best performing speed estimation
model. This hybrid approach outperforms alternative mobility models.
