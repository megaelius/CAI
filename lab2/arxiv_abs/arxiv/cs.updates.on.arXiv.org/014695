LoRaWAN is one of the leading Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) architectures. It was originally
designed for systems consisting of static sensor or Internet of Things (IoT) devices and static
gateways. It was recently updated to introduce new features such as nano-second timestamps which
open up applications to enable LoRaWAN to be adopted for mobile device tracking and localisation.
In such mobile scenarios, devices could temporarily lose communication with the gateways because
of interference from obstacles or deep fading, causing throughput reduction and delays in data
transmission. To overcome this problem, we propose a new data forwarding scheme. Instead of holding
the data until the next contact with gateways, devices can forward their data to nearby devices that
have a higher probability of being in contact with gateways. We propose a new network metric called
Real-Time Contact-Aware Expected Transmission Count (RCA-ETX) to model this contact probability
in real-time. Without making any assumption on mobility models, this metric exploits data transmission
delays to model complex device mobility. We also extend RCA-ETX with a throughput-optimal stochastic
backpressure routing scheme and propose Real-Time Opportunistic Backpressure Collection (ROBC),
a protocol to counter the stochastic behaviours resulting from the dynamics associated with mobility.
To apply our approaches seamlessly to LoRaWAN-enabled devices, we further propose two new LaRaWAN
classes, namely Modified Class-C and Queue-based Class-A. Both of them are compatible with LoRaWAN
Class-A devices. Our data-driven experiments, based on the London bus network, show that our approaches
can reduce data transmission delays up to $25\%$ and provide a $53\%$ throughput improvement in
data transfer performance.
