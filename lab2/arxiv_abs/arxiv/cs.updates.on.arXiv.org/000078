Hybrid optimization algorithms have gained popularity as it has become apparent there cannot be
a universal optimization strategy which is globally more beneficial than any other. Despite their
popularity, hybridization frameworks require more detailed categorization regarding: the nature
of the problem domain, the constituent algorithms, the coupling schema and the intended area of
application. This report proposes a hybrid algorithm for solving small to large-scale continuous
global optimization problems. It comprises evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms and a sequential
quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm; combined in a collaborative portfolio. The SQP is a gradient
based local search method. To optimize the individual contributions of the EC and SQP algorithms
for the overall success of the proposed hybrid system, improvements were made in key features of
these algorithms. The report proposes enhancements in: i) the evolutionary algorithm, ii) a new
convergence detection mechanism was proposed; and iii) in the methods for evaluating the search
directions and step sizes for the SQP local search algorithm. The proposed hybrid design aim was
to ensure that the two algorithms complement each other by exploring and exploiting the problem
search space. Preliminary results justify that an adept hybridization of evolutionary algorithms
with a suitable local search method, could yield a robust and efficient means of solving wide range
of global optimization problems. Finally, a discussion of the outcomes of the initial investigation
and a review of the associated challenges and inherent limitations of the proposed method is presented
to complete the investigation. The report highlights extensive research, particularly, some
potential case studies and application areas.
