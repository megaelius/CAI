Social media is considered a democratic space in which people connect and interact with each other
regardless of their gender, race, or any other demographic aspect. Despite numerous efforts that
explore demographic aspects in social media, it is still unclear whether social media perpetuates
old inequalities from the offline world. In this dissertation, we attempt to identify gender and
race of Twitter users located in the United States using advanced image processing algorithms from
Face++. We investigate how different demographic groups connect with each other and differentiate
them regarding linguistic styles and also their interests. We quantify to what extent one group
follows and interacts with each other and the extent to which these connections and interactions
reflect in inequalities in Twitter. We also extract linguistic features from six categories (affective
attributes, cognitive attributes, lexical density and awareness, temporal references, social
and personal concerns, and interpersonal focus) in order to identify the similarities and the differences
in the messages they share in Twitter. Furthermore, we extract the absolute ranking difference
of top phrases between demographic groups. As a dimension of diversity, we use the topics of interest
that we retrieve from each user. Our analysis shows that users identified as white and male tend to
attain higher positions, in terms of the number of followers and number of times in another user's
lists, in Twitter. There are clear differences in the way of writing across different demographic
groups in both gender and race domains as well as in the topic of interest. We hope our effort can stimulate
the development of new theories of demographic information in the online space. Finally, we developed
a Web-based system that leverages the demographic aspects of users to provide transparency to the
Twitter trending topics system.
