Revenue potential from offshore wind and energy storage systems for a Long Island node in the New
York ISO (NYISO) is examined using advanced lithium-ion battery representations. These advanced
mixed-integer-linear battery models account for the dynamic performance, as well as the degradation
behavior of the batteries, which are usually not accounted for in power systems models. Multiple
hybrid offshore wind and battery system designs are investigated to examine the impact of locating
the battery offshore versus locating it onshore. For the examined systems, we explore different
battery usable state-of-charge (SOC) windows, and corresponding dispatch of the battery to maximize
energy- and capacity-market revenues. The impacts of variability of offshore wind output along
with energy- and capacity-market prices are evaluated using publicly available data from 2010
to 2013. Locating the battery onshore resulted in higher revenues. For 2013, results highlight
that without accurate battery representations, models can overestimate battery revenues by up
to 155%, resulting primarily from degradation-related costs. Using advanced algorithms, net
revenue can be increased by 29%. Results also indicate that wider useable SOC windows could lead
to higher net revenues from the energy market, due to higher arbitrage opportunities that compensate
for any additional degradation-tied costs in higher DODs. The added value of a MWh of energy storage
varies from $2 to $3.5 per MWh of wind energy, which leads to a breakeven cost range of $50-$95 per kWh
for the battery systems studied. As such, energy- and capacity-market revenues were found to be
insufficient in recovering the investment costs of current battery systems for the applications
considered in this analysis.
