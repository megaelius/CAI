Temporal data are naturally everywhere, especially in the digital era that sees the advent of big
data and internet of things. One major challenge that arises during temporal data analysis and mining
is the comparison of time series or sequences, which requires to determine a proper distance or (dis)similarity
measure. In this context, the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has enjoyed success in many domains, due
to its 'temporal elasticity', a property particularly useful when matching temporal data. Unfortunately
this dissimilarity measure suffers from a quadratic computational cost, which prohibits its use
for large scale applications. This work addresses the sparsification of the alignment path search
space for DTW-like measures, essentially to lower their computational cost without loosing on
the quality of the measure. As a result of our sparsification approach, two new (dis)similarity
measures, namely SP-DTW (Sparsified-Paths search space DTW) and its kernelization SP-K rdtw (Sparsified-Paths
search space K rdtw kernel) are proposed for time series comparison. A wide range of public datasets
is used to evaluate the efficiency (estimated in term of speed-up ratio and classification accuracy)
of the proposed (dis)similarity measures on the 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) and the Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classification algorithms. Our experiment shows that our proposed measures provide
a significant speed-up without loosing on accuracy. Furthermore, at the cost of a slight reduction
of the speedup they significantly outperform on the accuracy criteria the old but well known Sakoe-Chiba
approach that reduces the DTW path search space using a symmetric corridor.
