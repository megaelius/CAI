Against the backdrop of the development of modern technologies in the field of scientific research
the new class of Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) and related intelligent information
technologies has arisen. It was called - Research and Development Workstation Environment (RDWE)
- the comprehensive problem-oriented information systems for scientific research and development
lifecycle support. The given paper describes design and development fundamentals of the RDWE class
systems. The RDWE class system's generalized information model is represented in the article as
a three-tuple composite web service that include: a set of atomic web services, each of them can be
designed and developed as a microservice or a desktop application, that allows them to be used as
an independent software separately; a set of functions, the functional filling-up of the Research
and Development Workstation Environment; a subset of atomic web services that are required to implement
function of composite web service. In accordance with the fundamental information model of the
RDWE class the system for supporting research in the field of ontology engineering - the automated
building of applied ontology in an arbitrary domain area, scientific and technical creativity
- the automated preparation of application documents for patenting inventions in Ukraine was developed.
It was called - Personal Research Information System. A distinctive feature of such systems is the
possibility of their problematic orientation to various types of scientific activities by combining
on a variety of functional services and adding new ones within the cloud integrated environment.
The main results of our work are focused on enhancing the effectiveness of the scientist's research
and development lifecycle in the arbitrary domain area.
