Achieving secure communication between an Implantable Medical Device (IMD) inside the body and
a gateway outside the body has showed its criticality with recent reports of hackings. The use of
asymmetric cryptography is not a practical solution for IMDs due to the scarce computational and
power resources, symmetric key cryptography is preferred. One of the factors in security of a symmetric
cryptographic system is to use a strong key for encryption. A solution without using extensive resources
in an IMD, is to extract it from the body physiological signals. To have a strong enough key, the physiological
signal must be a strong source of randomness and InterPulse Interval (IPI) has been advised to be
such that. A strong randomness source should have five conditions: Universality, Liveness, Robustness
Permanence and Uniqueness. Nevertheless, for current proposed random extraction methods from
IPI these conditions (mainly last three conditions) were not examined. In this study, firstly,
we proposed a methodology to measure the last three conditions. Then, using a huge dataset of IPI
values, we showed that IPI does not have conditions of Robustness and Permanence. Thus, extraction
of a strong uniform random number from IPI value, mathematically, is impossible. Thirdly, rather
than using the value of IPI, we proposed the trend of IPI as a source for a new randomness extraction
method named as Martingale Randomness Extraction from IPI (MRE-IPI). MRE-IPI satisfies the Robustness
condition completely and Permanence to some level. We, also, used randomness test suites and showed
that MRE-IPI is able to outperform all recent randomness extraction methods from IPIs and its quality
is half of the AES random number. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in this area which
uses such a comprehensive method and large dataset to examine the randomness of a physiological
signal.
