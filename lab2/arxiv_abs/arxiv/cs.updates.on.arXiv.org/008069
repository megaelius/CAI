Permissioned Blockchain has become quite popular with enterprises forming consortium since it
prioritizes trust over privacy. One of the popular platforms for distributed ledger solution,
Hyperledger Fabric, requires a transaction to be endorsed or approved by a group of special members
known as endorsers before undergoing validation. To endorse a transaction, an endorser mentions
its identity along with the signature so that it can be verified later. However, for certain transactions,
difference in opinion may exist among endorsers. Disclosing the identity of an endorser may lead
to conflict within the consortium. In such cases, an endorsement policy which not only allows an
endorser to support a transaction discreetly, but at the same time takes into account the decision
of the majority is preferred. Thus we propose an Anonymous Endorsement System which uses a threshold
endorsement policy in order to address the issue. All these factors motivated us to design a new ring
signature scheme, called Fabric' Constant-Sized Linkable Ring Signature (FCsLRS) with Transaction-Oriented
linkability for hiding identity of the endorsers. We have implemented the signature scheme in Golang
and analyzed its security and performance by varying the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) modulus
size. Feasibility of implementation is supported by experimental analysis. Signature and tag
generation time is quite fast and remains constant irrespective of change in message length or endorsement
set size for a given RSA modulus value, assuming all the endorsers generates their signature in parallel.
Lastly, we also discuss the integration of the scheme on v1.2 Hyperledger Fabric.
