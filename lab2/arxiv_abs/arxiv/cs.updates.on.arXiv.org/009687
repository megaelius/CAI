Logic locking has emerged as a promising solution for protecting the semiconductor intellectual
Property (IP) from the untrusted entities in the design and fabrication process. Logic locking
hides the functionality of the IP by embedding additional key-gates in the circuit. The correct
output of the chip is produced, once the correct key value is available at the input of the key-gates.
The confidentiality of the key is imperative for the security of the locked IP as it stands as the lone
barrier against IP infringement. Therefore, the logic locking is considered as a broken scheme
once the key value is exposed. The research community has shown the vulnerability of the logic locking
techniques against different classes of attacks, such as Oracle-guided and physical attacks.
Although several countermeasures have already been proposed against such attacks, none of them
is simultaneously impeccable against Oracle-guided, Oracle-less, and physical attacks. Under
such circumstances, a defense-in-depth approach can be considered as a practical approach in addressing
the vulnerabilities of logic locking. Defense-in-depth is a multilayer defense approach where
several independent countermeasures are implemented in the device to provide aggregated protection
against different attack vectors. Introducing such a multilayer defense model in logic locking
is the major contribution of this paper. With regard to this, we first identify the core components
of logic locking schemes, which need to be protected. Afterwards, we categorize the vulnerabilities
of core components according to potential threats for the locking key in logic locking schemes.
Furthermore, we propose several defense layers and countermeasures to protect the device from
those vulnerabilities. Finally, we turn our focus to open research questions and conclude with
suggestions for future research directions.
