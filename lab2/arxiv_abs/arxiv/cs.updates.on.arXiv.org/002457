First the basic definition of information as a selection from a set of possibilities resp. domain
is recalled. This also applies to digital information. The bits of digital information are parts
of number sequences which represent a selection from a set of possibilities resp. domain. For faultless
conversation sender and receiver of information must have the same definition of the domain (e.g.
of language vocabulary). Up to now the definition of the domain and of its elements is derived from
context and knowledge. The internet provides an additional important possibility: A link to a conjoint
uniform definition of the domain at unique location on the internet. The associated basic information
structure is called "Domain Vector" (DV) and has the structure "UL (of the domain definition) plus
sequence of numbers". The "UL" is not only "Uniform Locator" of the domain definition. It also identifies
a certain kind of information for later comparison and search. It can be a Uniform Resource Locator
(URL) or an abbreviated equivalent, e.g. a hierarchic numeric pointer or a short local pointer to
a table with global internet pointers. The DV structure can be used as general carrier of information
which is language independent and more precise than language. A domain which contains DVs is called
"Domain Space" (DS) and is defined as metric space. This allows similarity search according to user
defined criteria, so that any kind of definable information can be made comparable and searchable
according to user selected (relevant) and objectifiable (globally uniform) criteria. DS definitions
can be reused in new DS definitions. Their elements, the DVs, are automatically globally uniformly
identified and defined. Obviously such conjoint definition of comparable information has great
potential. It also can avoid interoperability problems and redundant programming and so save high
costs.
