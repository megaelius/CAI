Machine-learning based intrusion detection classifiers are able to detect unknown attacks, but
at the same time, they may be susceptible to evasion by obfuscation techniques. An adversary intruder
which possesses a crucial knowledge about a protection system can easily bypass the detection module.
The main objective of our work is to improve the performance capabilities of intrusion detection
classifiers against such adversaries. To this end, we firstly propose several obfuscation techniques
of remote attacks that are based on the modification of various properties of network connections;
then we conduct a set of comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of intrusion detection
classifiers against obfuscated attacks. We instantiate our approach by means of a tool, based on
NetEm and Metasploit, which implements our obfuscation operators on any TCP communication. This
allows us to generate modified network traffic for machine learning experiments employing features
for assessing network statistics and behavior of TCP connections. We perform the evaluation of
five classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive Bayes with kernel density estimation,
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines. Our experiments confirm the
assumption that it is possible to evade the intrusion detection capability of all classifiers trained
without prior knowledge about obfuscated attacks, causing an exacerbation of the TPR ranging from
7.8% to 66.8%. Further, when widening the training knowledge of the classifiers by a subset of obfuscated
attacks, we achieve a significant improvement of the TPR by 4.21% - 73.3%, while the FPR is deteriorated
only slightly (0.1% - 1.48%). Finally, we test the capability of an obfuscations-aware classifier
to detect unknown obfuscated attacks, where we achieve over 90% detection rate on average for most
of the obfuscations.
