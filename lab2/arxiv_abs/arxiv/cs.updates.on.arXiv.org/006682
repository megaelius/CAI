Real-time traffic signal control systems can effectively reduce urban traffic congestion but
can also become significant contributors to congestion if poorly timed. Real-time traffic signal
control is typically challenging owing to constantly changing traffic demand patterns, very limited
planning time and various sources of uncertainty in the real world (due to vehicle detection or unobserved
vehicle turn movements, for instance). SURTRAC (Scalable URban TRAffic Control) is a recently
developed traffic signal control approach which computes delay-minimising and coordinated (across
neighbouring traffic lights) schedules of oncoming vehicle clusters in real time. To ensure real-time
responsiveness in the presence of turn-induced uncertainty, SURTRAC computes schedules which
minimize the delay for the expected turn movements as opposed to minimizing the expected delay under
turn-induced uncertainty. Furthermore, expected outgoing traffic clusters are communicated
to downstream intersections. These approximations ensure real-time tractability, but degrade
solution quality in the presence of turn-induced uncertainty. To address this limitation, we introduce
TuSeRACT (Turn-Sample-based Real-time trAffic signal ConTrol), a distributed sample-based
scheduling approach to traffic signal control. Unlike SURTRAC, TuSeRACT computes schedules that
minimize expected delay over sampled turn movements of observed traffic, and communicates samples
of traffic outflows to neighbouring intersections. We formulate this sample-based scheduling
problem as a constraint program, and empirically evaluate our approach on synthetic traffic networks.
We demonstrate that our approach results in substantially lower average vehicle waiting times
as compared to SURTRAC when turn-induced uncertainty is present.
