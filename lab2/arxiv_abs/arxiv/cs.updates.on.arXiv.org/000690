Transposable data represents interactions among two sets of entities, and are typically represented
as a matrix containing the known interaction values. Additional side information may consist of
feature vectors specific to entities corresponding to the rows and/or columns of such a matrix.
Further information may also be available in the form of interactions or hierarchies among entities
along the same mode (axis). We propose a novel approach for modeling transposable data with missing
interactions given additional side information. The interactions are modeled as noisy observations
from a latent noise free matrix generated from a matrix-variate Gaussian process. The construction
of row and column covariances using side information provides a flexible mechanism for specifying
a-priori knowledge of the row and column correlations in the data. Further, the use of such a prior
combined with the side information enables predictions for new rows and columns not observed in
the training data. In this work, we combine the matrix-variate Gaussian process model with low rank
constraints. The constrained Gaussian process approach is applied to the prediction of hidden
associations between genes and diseases using a small set of observed associations as well as prior
covariances induced by gene-gene interaction networks and disease ontologies. The proposed approach
is also applied to recommender systems data which involves predicting the item ratings of users
using known associations as well as prior covariances induced by social networks. We present experimental
results that highlight the performance of constrained matrix-variate Gaussian process as compared
to state of the art approaches in each domain.
