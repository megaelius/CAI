We define the deconstruction cost of a tripartite quantum state on systems $ABE$ as the minimum rate
of noise needed to apply to the $AE$ systems, such that there is negligible disturbance to the marginal
state on the $BE$ systems, while the system $A$ of the resulting state is locally recoverable from
the $E$ system alone. We refer to such actions as deconstruction operations and protocols implementing
them as state deconstruction protocols. State deconstruction generalizes Landauer erasure of
a single-party quantum state as well the erasure of correlations of a two-party quantum state. We
find that the deconstruction cost of a tripartite quantum state on systems $ABE$ is equal to its conditional
quantum mutual information (CQMI) $I(A;B|E)$, thus giving the CQMI an operational interpretation
in terms of a state deconstruction protocol. We also define a related task called conditional erasure,
in which the goal is to apply noise to systems $AE$ in order to decouple system $A$ from systems $BE$,
while causing negligible disturbance to the marginal state of systems $BE$. We find that the optimal
rate of noise for conditional erasure is also equal to the CQMI $I(A;B|E)$. State deconstruction
and conditional erasure lead to operational interpretations of the quantum discord and squashed
entanglement, which are quantum correlation measures based on the CQMI. We find that the quantum
discord is equal to the cost of simulating einselection, the process by which a quantum system interacts
with an environment, resulting in selective loss of information in the system. The squashed entanglement
is equal to half the minimum rate of noise needed for deconstruction/conditional erasure if Alice
has available the best possible system $E$ to help in the deconstruction/conditional erasure task.
