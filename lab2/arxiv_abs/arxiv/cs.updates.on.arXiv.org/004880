Much research effort has been devoted to better understanding adversarial examples, which are
specially crafted inputs to machine-learning models that are perceptually similar to benign inputs,
but are classified differently (i.e., misclassified). Both algorithms that create adversarial
examples and strategies for defending against them typically use $L_p$-norms to measure the perceptual
similarity between an adversarial input and its benign original. Prior work has already shown,
however, that two images need not be close to each other as measured by an $L_p$-norm to be perceptually
similar. In this work, we show that nearness according to an $L_p$-norm is not just unnecessary for
perceptual similarity, but is also insufficient. Specifically, focusing on datasets (CIFAR10
and MNIST), $L_p$-norms, and thresholds used in prior work, we show through online user studies
that "adversarial examples" that are closer to their benign counterparts than required by commonly
used $L_p$-norm thresholds can nevertheless be perceptually different to humans from the corresponding
benign examples. Namely, the perceptual distance between two images that are "near" each other
according to an $L_p$-norm can be high enough that participants frequently classify the two images
as representing different objects or digits. Combined with prior work, we thus demonstrate that
nearness of inputs as measured by $L_p$-norms is neither necessary nor sufficient for perceptual
similarity, which has implications for both creating and defending against adversarial examples.
We propose and discuss alternative similarity metrics to stimulate future research in the area.
