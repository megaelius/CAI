The presence of noisy instances in mobile phone data is a fundamental issue for classifying user
phone call behavior (i.e., accept, reject, missed and outgoing), with many potential negative
consequences. The classification accuracy may decrease and the complexity of the classifiers
may increase due to the number of redundant training samples. To detect such noisy instances from
a training dataset, researchers use naive Bayes classifier (NBC) as it identifies misclassified
instances by taking into account independence assumption and conditional probabilities of the
attributes. However, some of these misclassified instances might indicate usages behavioral
patterns of individual mobile phone users. Existing naive Bayes classifier based noise detection
techniques have not considered this issue and, thus, are lacking in classification accuracy. In
this paper, we propose an improved noise detection technique based on naive Bayes classifier for
effectively classifying users' phone call behaviors. In order to improve the classification accuracy,
we effectively identify noisy instances from the training dataset by analyzing the behavioral
patterns of individuals. We dynamically determine a noise threshold according to individual's
unique behavioral patterns by using both the naive Bayes classifier and Laplace estimator. We use
this noise threshold to identify noisy instances. To measure the effectiveness of our technique
in classifying user phone call behavior, we employ the most popular classification algorithm (e.g.,
decision tree). Experimental results on the real phone call log dataset show that our proposed technique
more accurately identifies the noisy instances from the training datasets that leads to better
classification accuracy.
