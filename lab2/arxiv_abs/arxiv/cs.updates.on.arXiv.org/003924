Next generation wireless architectures are expected to enable slices of shared wireless infrastructure
which are customized to specific mobile operators/services. Given infrastructure costs and the
stochastic nature of mobile services' spatial loads, it is highly desirable to achieve efficient
statistical multiplexing amongst such slices. We study a simple dynamic resource sharing policy
which allocates a 'share' of a pool of (distributed) resources to each slice-Share Constrained
Proportionally Fair (SCPF). We give a characterization of SCPF's performance gains over static
slicing and general processor sharing. We show that higher gains are obtained when a slice's spatial
load is more 'imbalanced' than, and/or 'orthogonal' to, the aggregate network load, and that the
overall gain across slices is positive. We then address the associated dimensioning problem. Under
SCPF, traditional network dimensioning translates to a coupled share dimensioning problem, which
characterizes the existence of a feasible share allocation given slices' expected loads and performance
requirements. We provide a solution to robust share dimensioning for SCPF-based network slicing.
Slices may wish to unilaterally manage their users' performance via admission control which maximizes
their carried loads subject to performance requirements. We show this can be modeled as a 'traffic
shaping' game with an achievable Nash equilibrium. Under high loads, the equilibrium is explicitly
characterized, as are the gains in the carried load under SCPF vs. static slicing. Detailed simulations
of a wireless infrastructure supporting multiple slices with heterogeneous mobile loads show
the fidelity of our models and range of validity of our high load equilibrium analysis.
