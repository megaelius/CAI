Transgender individuals show brain structural alterations that differ from their biological
sex as well as their perceived gender. To substantiate evidence that the brain structure of transgender
individuals differs from male and female, we use a combined multivariate and univariate approach.
Gray matter segments resulting from voxel-based morphometry preprocessing of N = 1753 cisgender
(CG) healthy participants were used to train (N = 1402) and validate (20% hold-out N = 351) a support
vector machine classifying the biological sex. As a second validation, we classified N = 1104 patients
with depression. A third validation was performed using the matched CG sample of the transgender
women (TW) application sample. Subsequently, the classifier was applied to N = 25 TW. Finally, we
compared brain volumes of CG-men, women and TW pre/post treatment (CHT) in a univariate analysis
controlling for sexual orientation, age and total brain volume. The application of our biological
sex classifier to the transgender sample resulted in a significantly lower true positive rate (TPR-male
= 56.0%). The TPR did not differ between CG-individuals with (TPR-male = 86.9%) and without depression
(TPR-male = 88.5%). The univariate analysis of the transgender application sample revealed that
TW pre/post treatment show brain structural differences from CG-women and CG-men in the putamen
and insula, as well as the whole-brain analysis. Our results support the hypothesis that brain structure
in TW differs from brain structure of their biological sex (male) as well as their perceived gender
(female). This finding substantiates evidence that transgender individuals show specific brain
structural alterations leading to a different pattern of brain structure than CG individuals.
