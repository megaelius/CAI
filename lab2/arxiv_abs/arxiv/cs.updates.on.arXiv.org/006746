In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled WSN where a flying UAV is employed to collect data from multiple
sensor nodes (SNs). Our objective is to maximize the minimum average data collection rate from all
SNs subject to a prescribed reliability constraint for each SN by jointly optimizing the UAV communication
scheduling and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory. Different from the existing works that assume
the simplified line-of-sight (LoS) UAV-ground channels, we consider the more practically accurate
angle-dependent Rician fading channels between the UAV and SNs with the Rician factors determined
by the corresponding UAV-SN elevation angles. However, the formulated optimization problem is
intractable due to the lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter termed effective fading
power that characterizes the achievable rate given the reliability requirement in terms of outage
probability. To tackle this difficulty, we first approximate the parameter by a logistic ('S' shape)
function with respect to the 3D UAV trajectory by using the data regression method. Then the original
problem is reformulated to an approximate form, which, however, is still challenging to solve due
to its non-convexity. As such, we further propose an efficient algorithm to derive its suboptimal
solution by using the block coordinate descent technique, which iteratively optimizes the communication
scheduling, the UAV's horizontal trajectory, and its vertical trajectory. The latter two subproblems
are shown to be non-convex, while locally optimal solutions are obtained for them by using the successive
convex approximation technique. Last, extensive numerical results are provided to evaluate the
performance of the proposed algorithm and draw new insights on the 3D UAV trajectory under the Rician
fading as compared to conventional LoS channel models.
