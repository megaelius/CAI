According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women.
It is the second leading cause of death among women round the world, becoming the most fatal form of
cancer. Mammographic image segmentation is a fundamental task to support image analysis and diagnosis,
taking into account shape analysis of mammary lesions and their borders. However, mammogram segmentation
is a very hard process, once it is highly dependent on the types of mammary tissues. In this work we
present a new semi-supervised segmentation algorithm based on the modification of the GrowCut
algorithm to perform automatic mammographic image segmentation once a region of interest is selected
by a specialist. In our proposal, we used fuzzy Gaussian membership functions to modify the evolution
rule of the original GrowCut algorithm, in order to estimate the uncertainty of a pixel being object
or background. The main impact of the proposed method is the significant reduction of expert effort
in the initialization of seed points of GrowCut to perform accurate segmentation, once it removes
the need of selection of background seeds. We also constructed an automatic point selection process
based on the simulated annealing optimization method, avoiding the need of human intervention.
The proposed approach was qualitatively compared with other state-of-the-art segmentation techniques,
considering the shape of segmented regions. In order to validate our proposal, we built an image
classifier using a classical multilayer perceptron. We used Zernike moments to extract segmented
image features. This analysis employed 685 mammograms from IRMA breast cancer database, using
fat and fibroid tissues. Results show that the proposed technique could achieve a classification
rate of 91.28\% for fat tissues, evidencing the feasibility of our approach.
