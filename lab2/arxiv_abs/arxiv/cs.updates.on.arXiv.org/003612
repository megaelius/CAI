Pre-screening of ship proposals is now employed by top ship detectors to avoid exhaustive search
across image. In very high resolution (VHR) optical image, ships appeared as a cluster of abnormal
bright pixels in open sea clutter (noise-like background). Anomaly-based detector utilizing
Panchromatic (PAN) data has been widely used in many researches to detect ships, however, still
facing two main drawbacks: 1) detection rate tend to be low particularly when a ship is low contrast
and 2) these models require a high manual configuration to select a threshold value best separate
ships from sea surface background. This paper aims at further investigation of anomaly-based model
to solve those issues. First, pan-sharpened Multi Spectral (MS) data is incorporated together
with PAN to enhance ship discrimination. Second, we propose an improved anomaly-based model combining
both global intensity anomaly and local texture anomaly map. Regarding noise appeared due to the
present of sea clutter and because of pan-sharpen process, texture abnormality suppression term
based on quantization theory is introduced. Experimental results on VNREDSat-1 VHR optical satellite
images suggest that the pan-sharpened near-infrared (P-NIR) band can improve discrimination
of ships from surrounding waters. Compared to state-of-the-art anomaly-based detectors, our
proposed anomaly-based model on the combination of PAN and P-NIR data cannot only achieved highest
ship detection's recall rate (91.14% and 45.9% on high-contrast and low-contrast dataset respectively)
but also robust to different automatic threshold selection techniques.
