This paper uses stop-level passenger count data in four cities to understand the nation-wide bus
ridership decline between 2012 and 2018. The local characteristics associated with ridership
change are evaluated in Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta. Poisson models explain
ridership as a cross-section and the change thereof as a panel. While controlling for change in frequency,
jobs, and population, the correlation with local socio-demographic characteristics are investigated
using data from the American Community Survey. The effect of changing neighborhood demographics
on bus ridership are modeled using Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data. At a point in
time, neighborhoods with high proportions of non-white, carless, and most significantly, high-school-educated
residents are the most likely to have high ridership. Over time, white neighborhoods are losing
the most ridership across all four cities. Places with high concentrations of residents with college
education and without access to a car also lose ridership at a faster rate in two of the cities. The
sign and significance of these results remain consistent even when controlling for intra-urban
migration. Although bus ridership is declining across neighborhood characteristics, these results
suggest that the underlying cause must be primarily affecting the travel behavior of white bus riders.
Shifts in neighborhood socio-demographics, however, were found to be modest and unlikely to be
causing the nation-wide ridership crisis. Only in Miami is the proportion of white residents near
the most frequent parts of the bus network increasing. There, demographic shifts may be contributing
to the overall decline in bus ridership.
