Electronic circuit behavioral models built with hardware description/modeling languages such
as Verilog-AMS for system-level simulations are typically functional models. They do not capture
the physical design (layout) information of the target design. Numerous iterations of post-layout
design adjustments are usually required to ensure that design specifications are met with the presence
of layout parasitics. In this paper a paradigm shift of the current trend is presented that integrates
layout-level information in Verilog-AMS through metamodels such that system-level simulation
of a mixed-signal circuit/system is realistic and as accurate as true parasitic netlist simulation.
The simulations performed with these parasitic-aware models can be used to estimate system performance
without layout iterations. We call this new form of Verilog-AMS as iVAMS (i.e. Intelligent Verilog-AMS).
We call this iVAMS 1.0 as it is simple polynomial-metamodel integrated Intelligent Verilog-AMS.
As a specific case study, a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) Verilog-AMS behavioral model
and design flow are proposed to assist fast PLL design space exploration. The PLL simulation employing
quadratic metamodels achieves approximately 10X speedup compared to that employing the layout
extracted, parasitic netlist. The simulations using this behavioral model attain high accuracy.
The observed error for the simulated lock time and average power dissipation are 0.7% and 3%, respectively.
This behavioral metamodel approach bridges the gap between layout-accurate but fast simulation
and design space exploration. The proposed method also allows much shorter design verification
and optimization to meet stringent time-to-market requirements. Compared to the optimization
using the layout netlist, the runtime using the behavioral model is reduced by 88.9%.
