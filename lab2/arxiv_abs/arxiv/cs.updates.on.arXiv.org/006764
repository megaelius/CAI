The prevalence of networked sensors and actuators in many real-world systems such as smart buildings,
factories, power plants, and data centers generate substantial amounts of multivariate time series
data for these systems. The rich sensor data can be continuously monitored for intrusion events
through anomaly detection. However, conventional threshold-based anomaly detection methods
are inadequate due to the dynamic complexities of these systems, while supervised machine learning
methods are unable to exploit the large amounts of data due to the lack of labeled data. On the other
hand, current unsupervised machine learning approaches have not fully exploited the spatial-temporal
correlation and other dependencies amongst the multiple variables (sensors/actuators) in the
system for detecting anomalies. In this work, we propose an unsupervised multivariate anomaly
detection method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Instead of treating each data
stream independently, our proposed MAD-GAN framework considers the entire variable set concurrently
to capture the latent interactions amongst the variables. We also fully exploit both the generator
and discriminator produced by the GAN, using a novel anomaly score called DR-score to detect anomalies
by discrimination and reconstruction. We have tested our proposed MAD-GAN using two recent datasets
collected from real-world CPS: the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) and the Water Distribution (WADI)
datasets. Our experimental results showed that the proposed MAD-GAN is effective in reporting
anomalies caused by various cyber-intrusions compared in these complex real-world systems.
