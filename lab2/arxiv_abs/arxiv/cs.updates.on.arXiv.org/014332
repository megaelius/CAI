This paper is motivated by emerging edge computing systems which consist of sensor nodes that acquire
and process information and then transmit status updates to an edge receiver for possible further
processing. As power is a scarce resource at the sensor nodes, the system is modeled as a tandem computation-transmission
queue with power-efficient computing. Jobs arrive at the computation server with rate $\lambda$
as a Poisson process with no available data buffer. The computation server can be in one of three states:
(i) OFF: the server is turned off and no jobs are observed or processed, (ii) ON-Idle: the server is
turned on but there is no job in the server, (iii) ON-Busy: the server is turned on and a job is processed
in the server. These states cost zero, one and $p_c$ units of power, respectively. Under a long-term
power constraint, the computation server switches from one state to another in sequence: first
a deterministic $T_o$ time units in OFF state, then waiting for a job arrival in ON-Idle state and
then in ON-Busy state for an independent identically distributed compute time duration. The transmission
server has a single unit data buffer to save incoming packets and applies last come first serve with
discarding as well as a packet deadline to discard a sitting packet for maintaining information
freshness, which is measured by the Age of Information (AoI). Additionally, there is a monotonic
functional relation between the mean time spent in ON-Busy state and the mean transmission time.
We obtain closed-form expressions for average AoI and average peak AoI. Our numerical results illustrate
various regimes of operation for best AoI performances optimized over packet deadlines with relation
to power efficiency.
