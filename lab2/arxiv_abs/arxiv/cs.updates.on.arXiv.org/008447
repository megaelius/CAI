We aimed to enhance the performance of a supervised model for clinical named-entity recognition
(NER) using medical terminologies. In order to evaluate our system in French, we built a corpus for
5 types of clinical entities. We used a terminology-based system as baseline, built upon UMLS and
SNOMED. Then, we evaluated a biGRU-CRF, and an hybrid system using the prediction of the terminology-based
system as feature for the biGRU-CRF. In English, we evaluated the NER systems on the i2b2-2009 Medication
Challenge for Drug name recognition, which contained 8,573 entities for 268 documents. In French,
we built APcNER, a corpus of 147 documents annotated for 5 entities (drug name, sign or symptom, disease
or disorder, diagnostic procedure or lab test and therapeutic procedure). We evaluated each NER
systems using exact and partial match definition of F-measure for NER. The APcNER contains 4,837
entities which took 28 hours to annotate, the inter-annotator agreement was acceptable for Drug
name in exact match (85%) and acceptable for other entity types in non-exact match (>70%). For drug
name recognition on both i2b2-2009 and APcNER, the biGRU-CRF performed better that the terminology-based
system, with an exact-match F-measure of 91.1% versus 73% and 81.9% versus 75% respectively. Moreover,
the hybrid system outperformed the biGRU-CRF, with an exact-match F-measure of 92.2% versus 91.1%
(i2b2-2009) and 88.4% versus 81.9% (APcNER). On APcNER corpus, the micro-average F-measure of
the hybrid system on the 5 entities was 69.5% in exact match, and 84.1% in non-exact match. APcNER
is a French corpus for clinical-NER of five type of entities which covers a large variety of document
types. Extending supervised model with terminology allowed for an easy performance gain, especially
in low regimes of entities, and established near state of the art results on the i2b2-2009 corpus.
