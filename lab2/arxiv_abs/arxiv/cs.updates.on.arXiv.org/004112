In a biometric verification system, leakage of biometric data leads to permanent identity loss
since original biometric data is inherently linked to a user. Further, various types of attacks
on a biometric system may reveal the original template and utility in other applications. To address
these security and privacy concerns cancelable biometric has been introduced. Cancelable biometric
constructs a protected template from the original biometric template using transformation functions
and performs the comparison between templates in the transformed domain. Recent approaches towards
cancelable fingerprint generation either rely on aligning minutiae points with respect to singular
points (core/delta) or utilize the absolute coordinate positions of minutiae points. In this paper,
we propose a novel non-invertible ridge feature transformation method to protect the original
fingerprint template information. The proposed method partitions the fingerprint region into
a number of sectors with reference to each minutia point employing a ridge-based co-ordinate system.
The nearest neighbor minutiae in each sector are identified, and ridge-based features are computed.
Further, a cancelable template is generated by applying the Cantor pairing function followed by
random projection. We have evaluated our method with FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 databases. It
is evident from the experimental results that the proposed method outperforms existing methods
in the literature. Moreover, the security analysis demonstrates that the proposed method fulfills
the necessary requirements of non-invertibility, revocability, and diversity with a minor performance
degradation caused due to cancelable transformation.
