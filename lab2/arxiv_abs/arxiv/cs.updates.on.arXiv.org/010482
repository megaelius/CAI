Time bounded reachability is a fundamental problem in model checking continuous-time Markov chains
(CTMCs) and Markov decision processes (CTMDPs) for specifications in continuous stochastic logics.
It can be computed by numerically solving a characteristic linear dynamical system but the procedure
is computationally expensive. We take a control-theoretic approach and propose a reduction technique
that finds another dynamical system of lower dimension (number of variables), such that numerically
solving the reduced dynamical system provides an approximation to the solution of the original
system with guaranteed error bounds. Our technique generalises lumpability (or probabilistic
bisimulation) to a quantitative setting. Our main result is a Lyapunov function characterisation
of the difference in the trajectories of the two dynamics that depends on the initial mismatch and
exponentially decreases over time. In particular, the Lyapunov function enables us to compute
an error bound between the two dynamics as well as a convergence rate. Finally, we show that the search
for the reduced dynamics can be computed in polynomial time using a Schur decomposition of the transition
matrix. This enables us to efficiently solve the reduced dynamical system by computing the exponential
of an upper-triangular matrix characterising the reduced dynamics. For CTMDPs, we generalise
our approach using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions for switched affine dynamical systems.
We synthesise a policy for the CTMDP via its reduced-order switched system that guarantees the time
bounded reachability probability lies above a threshold. We provide error bounds that depend on
the minimum dwell time of the policy. We demonstrate the technique on examples from queueing networks,
for which lumpability does not produce any state space reduction but our technique synthesises
policies using reduced version of the model.
