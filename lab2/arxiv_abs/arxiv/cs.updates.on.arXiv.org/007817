Context: Safety analysis is a predominant activity in developing safety-critical systems. It
is a highly cooperative task among multiple functional departments due to increasingly sophisticated
safety-critical systems and close-knit development processes. Communication occurs pervasively.
Motivation: Effective communication channels among multiple functional departments influence
safety analysis, quality as well as a safe product delivery. However, the use of communication channels
during safety analysis is sometimes arbitrary and poses challenges. Objective: Investige the
existing communication channels, their usage frequencies, their purposes and challenges during
safety analysis in industry.. Method: Multiple case study of experts (survey: 39, interview: 21)
in safety-critical companies including software developers, quality engineers and functional
safety managers. Direct observations and documentation review were also conducted. Results:
Popular communication channels during safety analysis include formal meetings, project coordination
tools, documentation and telephone. Email, personal discussion, training, internal communication
software and boards are also in use. Training involving safety analysis happens 1-4 times per year,
while other aforementioned communication channels happen ranges from 1-4 times per day to 1-4 times
per month. We summarise 28 purposes for these communication channels. Communication happens mostly
for the purpose of clarifying safety requirements, fixing temporary problems, conflicts and obstacles
and sharing safety knowledge. The top challenges are reported. Conclusion: During safety analysis,
to use communication channels effectively and avoid challenges, a clear purpose of communication
during safety analysis should be established at the beginning. To derive countermeasures of fixing
the top 10 challenges are potential next steps.
