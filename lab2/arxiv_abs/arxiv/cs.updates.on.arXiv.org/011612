For most relevant computation, the energy and time needed for data movement dominates that for performing
arithmetic operations on all computing systems today. Hence it is of critical importance to understand
the minimal total data movement achievable during the execution of an algorithm. The achieved total
data movement for different schedules of an algorithm can vary widely depending on how efficiently
the cache is used, e.g., untiled versus effectively tiled matrix-matrix multiplication. A significant
current challenge is that no existing tool is able to meaningfully quantify the potential reduction
to the data movement of a computation that can be achieved by more effective use of the cache through
operation rescheduling. Asymptotic parametric expressions of data movement lower bounds have
previously been manually derived for a limited number of algorithms, often without scaling constants.
In this paper, we present the first compile-time approach for deriving non-asymptotic parametric
expressions of data movement lower bounds for arbitrary affine computations. The approach has
been implemented in a fully automatic tool (IOLB) that can generate these lower bounds for input
affine programs. IOLB's use is demonstrated by exercising it on all the benchmarks of the PolyBench
suite. The advantages of IOLB are many: (1) IOLB enables us to derive bounds for few dozens of algorithms
for which these lower bounds have never been derived. This reflects an increase of productivity
by automation. (2) Anyone is able to obtain these lower bounds through IOLB, no expertise is required.
(3) For some of the most well-studied algorithms, the lower bounds obtained by \tool are higher than
any previously reported manually derived lower bounds.
