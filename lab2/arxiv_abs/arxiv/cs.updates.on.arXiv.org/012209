This paper describes a machine learning and data science pipeline for structured information extraction
from documents, implemented as a suite of open-source tools and extensions to existing tools. It
centers around a methodology for extracting procedural information in the form of recipes, stepwise
procedures for creating an artifact (in this case synthesizing a nanomaterial), from published
scientific literature. From our overall goal of producing recipes from free text, we derive the
technical objectives of a system consisting of pipeline stages: document acquisition and filtering,
payload extraction, recipe step extraction as a relationship extraction task, recipe assembly,
and presentation through an information retrieval interface with question answering (QA) functionality.
This system meets computational information and knowledge management (CIKM) requirements of
metadata-driven payload extraction, named entity extraction, and relationship extraction from
text. Functional contributions described in this paper include semi-supervised machine learning
methods for PDF filtering and payload extraction tasks, followed by structured extraction and
data transformation tasks beginning with section extraction, recipe steps as information tuples,
and finally assembled recipes. Measurable objective criteria for extraction quality include
precision and recall of recipe steps, ordering constraints, and QA accuracy, precision, and recall.
Results, key novel contributions, and significant open problems derived from this work center
around the attribution of these holistic quality measures to specific machine learning and inference
stages of the pipeline, each with their performance measures. The desired recipes contain identified
preconditions, material inputs, and operations, and constitute the overall output generated
by our computational information and knowledge management (CIKM) system.
