Interactions between pedestrians and automated vehicles (AVs) will increase significantly with
the popularity of AV. However, pedestrians often have not enough trust on the AVs , particularly
when they are confused about an AV's intention in a interaction. This study seeks to evaluate if pedestrians
clearly understand the driving intentions of AVs in interactions and presents experimental research
on the relationship between gaze behaviors of pedestrians and their understanding of the intentions
of the AV. The hypothesis investigated in this study was that the less the pedestrian understands
the driving intentions of the AV, the longer the duration of their gazing behavior will be. A pedestrian--vehicle
interaction experiment was designed to verify the proposed hypothesis. A robotic wheelchair was
used as the manual driving vehicle (MV) and AV for interacting with pedestrians while pedestrians'
gaze data and their subjective evaluation of the driving intentions were recorded. The experimental
results supported our hypothesis as there was a negative correlation between the pedestrians'
gaze duration on the AV and their understanding of the driving intentions of the AV. Moreover, the
gaze duration of most of the pedestrians on the MV was shorter than that on an AV. Therefore, we conclude
with two recommendations to designers of external human-machine interfaces (eHMI): (1) when a
pedestrian is engaged in an interaction with an AV, the driving intentions of the AV should be provided;
(2) if the pedestrian still gazes at the AV after the AV displays its driving intentions, the AV should
provide clearer information about its driving intentions.
