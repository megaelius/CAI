Statistical shape modeling (SSM) has proven useful in many areas of biology and medicine as a new
generation of morphometric approaches for the quantitative analysis of anatomical shapes. Recently,
the increased availability of high-resolution in vivo images of anatomy has led to the development
and distribution of open-source computational tools to model anatomical shapes and their variability
within populations with unprecedented detail and statistical power. Nonetheless, there is little
work on the evaluation and validation of such tools as related to clinical applications that rely
on morphometric quantifications for treatment planning. To address this lack of validation, we
systematically assess the outcome of widely used off-the-shelf SSM tools, namely ShapeWorks,
SPHARM-PDM, and Deformetrica, in the context of designing closure devices for left atrium appendage
(LAA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients to prevent stroke, where an incomplete LAA closure may
be worse than no closure. This study is motivated by the potential role of SSM in the geometric design
of closure devices, which could be informed by population-level statistics, and patient-specific
device selection, which is driven by anatomical measurements that could be automated by relating
patient-level anatomy to population-level morphometrics. Hence, understanding the consequences
of different SSM tools for the final analysis is critical for the careful choice of the tool to be deployed
in real clinical scenarios. Results demonstrate that estimated measurements from ShapeWorks
model are more consistent compared to models from Deformetrica and SPHARM-PDM. Furthermore, ShapeWorks
and Deformetrica shape models capture clinically relevant population-level variability compared
to SPHARM-PDM models.
