Tutorials are one of the most fundamental means of conveying knowledge. Ideally when the task involves
physical or digital objects, tutorials not only describe each step with text or via audio narration
but show it as well using photos or animation. In most cases, online tutorial authors capture media
from handheld mobile devices to compose these documents, but increasingly they use wearable devices
as well. In this work, we explore the full life-cycle of online tutorial creation and viewing using
head-mounted capture and displays. We developed a media-capture tool for Google Glass that requires
minimal attention to the capture device and instead allows the author to focus on creating the tutorial's
content rather than its capture. The capture tool is coupled with web-based authoring tools for
creating annotatable videos and multimedia documents. In a study comparing standalone (camera
on tripod) versus wearable capture (Google Glass) as well as two types of multimedia representation
for authoring tutorials, we show that tutorial authors have a preference for wearable capture devices,
especially when recording activities involving larger objects in non-desktop environments.
Authors preferred document-based multimedia tutorials because they are more straightforward
to compose and the step-based structure translates more directly to explaining a procedure. In
addition, we explored using head-mounted displays for accessing tutorials in comparison to lightweight
computing devices such as tablets. Our study included tutorials recorded with the same capture
methods as in our access study. We found that although authors preferred head-mounted capture,
tutorial consumers preferred video recorded by a camera on tripod that provides a more stable image
of the workspace.
