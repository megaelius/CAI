The development of models for multiple heterogeneous network data is of critical importance both
in statistical network theory and across multiple application domains. Although single-graph
inference is well-studied, multiple graph inference is largely unexplored, in part because of
the challenges inherent in appropriately modeling graph differences and yet retaining sufficient
model simplicity to render estimation feasible. This paper addresses exactly this gap, by introducing
a new model, the common subspace independent-edge (COSIE) multiple random graph model, which describes
a heterogeneous collection of networks with a shared latent structure on the vertices but potentially
different connectivity patterns for each graph. The COSIE model encompasses many popular network
representations, including the stochastic blockmodel. The model is both flexible enough to meaningfully
account for important graph differences and tractable enough to allow for accurate inference in
multiple networks. In particular, a joint spectral embedding of adjacency matrices - the multiple
adjacency spectral embedding (MASE) - leads, in a COSIE model, to simultaneous consistent estimation
of underlying parameters for each graph. Under mild additional assumptions, MASE estimates satisfy
asymptotic normality and yield improvements for graph eigenvalue estimation and hypothesis testing.
In both simulated and real data, the COSIE model and the MASE embedding can be deployed for a number
of subsequent network inference tasks, including dimensionality reduction, classification,
hypothesis testing and community detection. Specifically, when MASE is applied to a dataset of
connectomes constructed through diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, the result is an accurate
classification of brain scans by patient and a meaningful determination of heterogeneity across
scans of different subjects.
