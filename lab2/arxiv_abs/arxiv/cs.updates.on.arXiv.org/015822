Decades of continuous scaling has reduced the energy of unit computing to virtually zero, while
energy-efficient communication has remained the primary bottleneck in achieving fully energy-autonomous
IoT nodes. This paper presents and analyzes the trade-offs between the energies required for communication
and computation in a wireless sensor network, deployed in a mesh architecture over a 2400-acre university
campus, and is targeted towards multi-sensor measurement of temperature, humidity and water nitrate
concentration for smart agriculture. Several scenarios involving In-Sensor-Analytics (ISA),
Collaborative Intelligence (CI) and Context-Aware-Switching (CAS) of the cluster-head during
CI has been considered. A real-time co-optimization algorithm has been developed for minimizing
the energy consumption in the network, hence maximizing the overall battery lifetime of individual
nodes. Measurement results show that the proposed ISA consumes ~467X lower energy as compared to
traditional Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, and ~69,500X lower energy as compared with
Long Range (LoRa) communication. When the ISA is implemented in conjunction with LoRa, the lifetime
of the node increases from a mere 4.3 hours to 66.6 days with a 230 mAh coin cell battery, while preserving
more than 98% of the total information. The CI and CAS algorithms help in extending the worst-case
node lifetime by an additional 50%, thereby exhibiting an overall network lifetime of ~104 days,
which is >90% of the theoretical limits as posed by the leakage currents present in the system, while
effectively transferring information sampled every second. A web-based monitoring system was
developed to archive the measured data in a continuous manner, and to report anomalies in the measured
data.
