The birth of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) fulfils a dream that simple arithmetic calculations
can simulate complex fluid flows without solving complicated partial differential flow equations.
Its power and potential of resolving more and more challenging physical problems have been and are
being demonstrated in science and engineering covering a wide range of disciplines such as physics,
chemistry, biology, material science and image analysis. The method is a highly simplified model
for fluid flows using a few limited fictitious particles that move one grid at a constant time interval
and collide each other at a grid point on uniform lattices, which are the two routine steps for implementation
of the method to simulate fluid flows. As such, a real complex particle dynamics is approximated
as a regular particle model using three parameters of lattice size, particle speed and collision
operator. A fundamental question is "Are the two steps integral to the method or can the three parameters
be reduced to one for a minimal lattice Boltzmann method?". Here, I show that the collision step can
be removed and the standard LBM can be reformulated into a simple macroscopic lattice Boltzmann
method (MacLAB). This model relies on macroscopic physical variables only and is completely defined
by one basic parameter of lattice size dx, bringing the LBM into a precise "Lattice" Boltzmann method.
The viscous effect on flows is naturally embedded through the particle speed, making it an ideal
automatic simulator for fluid flows. The findings have been demonstrated and confirmed with numerical
tests including flows that are independent of and dependent on fluid viscosity, 2D and 3D cavity
flows, and an unsteady Taylor-Green vortex flow. This provides an efficient and powerful model
for resolving physical problems in various disciplines of science and engineering.
