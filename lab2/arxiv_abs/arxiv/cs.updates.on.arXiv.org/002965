It is a well known fact that sequential algorithms which exhibit a strong "local" nature can be adapted
to the distributed setting given a legal graph coloring. The running time of the distributed algorithm
will then be at least the number of colors. Surprisingly, this well known idea was never formally
stated as a unified framework. In this paper we aim to define a robust family of local sequential algorithms
which can be easily adapted to the distributed setting. We then develop new tools to further enhance
these algorithms, achieving state of the art results for fundamental problems. We define a simple
class of greedy-like algorithms which we call \emph{orderless-local} algorithms. We show that
given a legal $c$-coloring of the graph, every algorithm in this family can be converted into a distributed
algorithm running in $O(c)$ communication rounds in the CONGEST model. We show that this family
is indeed robust as both the method of conditional expectations and the unconstrained submodular
maximization algorithm of Buchbinder \etal \cite{BuchbinderFNS15} can be expressed as orderless-local
algorithms for \emph{local utility functions} --- Utility functions which have a strong local
nature to them. We use the above algorithms as a base for new distributed approximation algorithms
for the weighted variants of some fundamental problems: Max $k$-Cut, Max-DiCut, Max 2-SAT and correlation
clustering. We develop algorithms which have the same approximation guarantees as their sequential
counterparts, up to a constant additive $\epsilon$ factor, while achieving an $O(\log^* n)$ running
time for deterministic algorithms and $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ running time for randomized ones. This
improves exponentially upon the currently best known algorithms.
