We use a well-known deep neural network framework, called Mask R-CNN, for identification of solar
filaments in full-disk H-alpha images from Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). The image data, collected
from BBSO's archive, are integrated with the spatiotemporal metadata of filaments retrieved from
the Heliophysics Events Knowledgebase (HEK) system. This integrated data is then treated as the
ground-truth in the training process of the model. The available spatial metadata are the output
of a currently running filament-detection module developed and maintained by the Feature Finding
Team; an international consortium selected by NASA. Despite the known challenges in the identification
and characterization of filaments by the existing module, which in turn are inherited into any other
module that intends to learn from such outputs, Mask R-CNN shows promising results. Trained and
validated on two years worth of BBSO data, this model is then tested on the three following years.
Our case-by-case and overall analyses show that Mask R-CNN can clearly compete with the existing
module and in some cases even perform better. Several cases of false positives and false negatives,
that are correctly segmented by this model are also shown. The overall advantages of using the proposed
model are two-fold: First, deep neural networks' performance generally improves as more annotated
data, or better annotations are provided. Second, such a model can be scaled up to detect other solar
events, as well as a single multi-purpose module. The results presented in this study introduce
a proof of concept in benefits of employing deep neural networks for detection of solar events, and
in particular, filaments.
