We consider a setting where $p$ public resources are to be allocated among $n$ competing and strategic
agents so as to maximize social welfare (the objects should be allocated to those who value them the
most). This is called allocative efficiency (AE). We need the agents to report their valuations
for obtaining these resources, truthfully referred to as dominant strategy incentive compatibility
(DSIC). We use auction-based mechanisms to achieve AE and DSIC yet budget balance cannot be ensured,
due to Green-Laffont Impossibility Theorem. That is, the net transfer of money cannot be zero. This
problem has been addressed by designing a redistribution mechanism so as to ensure a minimum surplus
of money as well as AE and DSIC. The objective could be to minimize surplus in expectation or in the
worst case and these $p$ objects could be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Designing redistribution
mechanisms which perform well in expectation becomes analytically challenging for heterogeneous
settings. In this paper, we take a completely different, data-driven approach. We train a neural
network to determine an optimal redistribution mechanism based on given settings with both the
objectives, optimal in expectation and optimal in the worst case. We also propose a loss function
to train a neural network to optimize worst case. We design neural networks with the underlying rebate
functions being linear as well as nonlinear in terms of bids of the agents. Our networks' performances
are same as the theoretical guarantees for the cases where it has been solved. We observe that a neural
network based redistribution mechanism for homogeneous settings which uses nonlinear rebate
functions outperforms linear rebate functions when the objective is optimal in expectation. Our
approach also yields an optimal in expectation redistribution mechanism for heterogeneous settings.
