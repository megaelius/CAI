We consider manipulation strategies for the rank-maximal matching problem. In the rank-maximal
matching problem we are given a bipartite graph $G = (A \cup P, E)$ such that $A$ denotes a set of applicants
and $P$ a set of posts. Each applicant $a \in A$ has a preference list over the set of his neighbours
in $G$, possibly involving ties. Preference lists are represented by ranks on the edges - an edge
$(a,p)$ has rank $i$, denoted as $rank(a,p)=i$, if post $p$ belongs to one of $a$'s $i$-th choices.
A rank-maximal matching is one in which the maximum number of applicants is matched to their rank
one posts and subject to this condition, the maximum number of applicants is matched to their rank
two posts, and so on. A rank-maximal matching can be computed in $O(\min(c \sqrt{n},n) m)$ time,
where $n$ denotes the number of applicants, $m$ the number of edges and $c$ the maximum rank of an edge
in an optimal solution. A central authority matches applicants to posts. It does so using one of the
rank-maximal matchings. Since there may be more than one rank- maximal matching of $G$, we assume
that the central authority chooses any one of them randomly. Let $a_1$ be a manipulative applicant,
who knows the preference lists of all the other applicants and wants to falsify his preference list
so that he has a chance of getting better posts than if he were truthful. In the first problem addressed
in this paper the manipulative applicant $a_1$ wants to ensure that he is never matched to any post
worse than the most preferred among those of rank greater than one and obtainable when he is truthful.
In the second problem the manipulator wants to construct such a preference list that the worst post
he can become matched to by the central authority is best possible or in other words, $a_1$ wants to
minimize the maximal rank of a post he can become matched to.
