The data-driven sparse methods such as synthesis dictionary learning and sparsifying transform
learning have been proven to be effective in image denoising. However, these methods are intrinsically
single-scale, which ignores the multiscale nature of images. This often leads to suboptimal results.
In this paper, we propose several strategies to exploit multiscale information in image denoising
through the sparsifying transform learning denoising (TLD) method. To this end, we first employ
a simple method of denoising each wavelet subband independently via TLD. Then, we show that this
method can be greatly enhanced using wavelet subbands mixing, which is a cheap fusion technique,
to combine the results of single-scale and multiscale methods. Finally, we remove the need for denoising
detail subbands. This simplification leads to an efficient multiscale denoising method with competitive
performance to its baseline. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are experimentally shown
over two datasets: 1) classic test images corrupted with Gaussian noise, and 2) fluorescence microscopy
images corrupted with real Poisson-Gaussian noise. The proposed multiscale methods improve over
the single-scale baseline method by an average of about 0.2 dB (in terms of PSNR) for removing synthetic
Gaussian noise form classic test images and real Poisson-Gaussian noise from microscopy images,
respectively. Interestingly, the proposed multiscale methods keep their superiority over the
baseline even when noise is relatively weak. More importantly, we show that the proposed methods
lead to visually pleasing results, in which edges and textures are better recovered. Extensive
experiments over these two different datasets show that the proposed methods offer a good trade-off
between performance and complexity.
