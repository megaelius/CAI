Recent years have seen many algorithmic advances in the area of submodular optimization: (SO) $\min/\max~f(S):
S \in \mathcal{F}$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a given family of feasible sets over a ground set $V$ and
$f:2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is submodular. This progress has been coupled with a wealth of new
applications for these models. Our focus is on a more general class of \emph{multi-agent submodular
optimization} (MASO) which was introduced by Goel et al. in the minimization setting: $\min \sum_i
f_i(S_i): S_1 \uplus S_2 \uplus \cdots \uplus S_k \in \mathcal{F}$. Here we use $\uplus$ to denote
disjoint union and hence this model is attractive where resources are being allocated across $k$
agents, each with its own submodular cost function $f_i()$. In this paper we explore the extent to
which the approximability of the multi-agent problems are linked to their single-agent {\em primitives},
referred to informally as the {\em multi-agent gap}. We present different reductions that transform
a multi-agent problem into a single-agent one. For maximization we show that (MASO) admits an $O(\alpha)$-approximation
whenever (SO) admits an $\alpha$-approximation over the multilinear formulation, and thus substantially
expanding the family of tractable models. We also discuss several family classes (such as spanning
trees, matroids, and $p$-systems) that have a provable multi-agent gap of 1. In the minimization
setting we show that (MASO) has an $O(\alpha \cdot \min \{k, \log^2 (n)\})$-approximation whenever
(SO) admits an $\alpha$-approximation over the convex formulation. In addition, we discuss the
class of "bounded blocker" families where there is a provably tight O$(\log n)$ gap between (MASO)
and (SO).
