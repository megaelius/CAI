Biological and cultural inspired optimization algorithms are nowadays part of the basic toolkit
of a great many research domains. By mimicking processes in nature and animal societies, these general-purpose
search algorithms promise to deliver optimal or near-optimal solutions using hardly any information
on the optimization problems they are set to tackle. Here we study the performances of a cultural-inspired
algorithm -- the imitative learning search -- as well as of asexual and sexual variants of evolutionary
algorithms in finding the global maxima of NK-fitness landscapes. The main performance measure
is the total number of agent updates required by the algorithms to find those global maxima and the
baseline performance, which establishes the effectiveness of the cooperative algorithms, is
set by the blind search in which the agents explore the problem space (binary strings) by flipping
bits at random. We find that even for smooth landscapes that exhibit a single maximum, the evolutionary
algorithms do not perform much better than the blind search due to the stochastic effects of the genetic
roulette. The imitative learning is immune to this effect thanks to the deterministic choice of
the fittest string in the population, which is used as a model for imitation. The tradeoff is that
for rugged landscapes the imitative learning search is more prone to be trapped in local maxima than
the evolutionary algorithms. In fact, in the case of rugged landscapes with a mild density of local
maxima, the blind search either beats or matches the cooperative algorithms regardless of whether
the task is to find the global maximum or to find the fittest state within a given runtime.
