Economic and operational advantages have led the supply chain of printed circuit boards (PCBs)
to incorporate various untrusted entities. Any of the untrusted entities are capable of introducing
malicious alterations to facilitate a functional failure or leakage of secret information during
field operation. While researchers have been investigating the threat of malicious modification
within the scale of individual microelectronic components, the possibility of a board-level malicious
manipulation has essentially been unexplored. In the absence of standard benchmarking solutions,
prospective countermeasures for PCB trust assurance are likely to utilize homegrown representation
of the attacks that undermines their evaluation and does not provide scope for comparison with other
techniques. In this paper, we have developed the first-ever benchmarking solution to facilitate
an unbiased and comparable evaluation of countermeasures applicable to PCB trust assurance. Based
on a taxonomy tailored for PCB-level alterations, we have developed high-level Trojan models.
From these models, we have generated a custom pool of board-level Trojan designs of varied complexity
and functionality. We have also developed a tool-flow for automatically inserting these Trojans
into various PCB designs and generate the Trojan benchmarks (i.e., PCB designs with Trojan). The
tool-based Trojan insertion facilitate a comprehensive evaluation against large number of diverse
Trojan implementations and application of data mining for trust verification. Finally, with experimental
measurements from a fabricated PCB, we analyze the stealthiness of the Trojan designs.
