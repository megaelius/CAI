The fast developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies provide a promising opportunity
to build large-scale systems to connect numerous heterogeneous devices into the Internet. Most
existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management
but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain
technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization,
trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT
architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain
technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained
IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain
storage structure, \textit{ChainSplitter}. Specially, the proposed architecture features
a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while
the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed
architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud
infrastructure together through two connectors, the \textit{blockchain connector} and the \textit{cloud
connector}, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the
overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud
connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the
clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain
storage in a practical Industrial IoT case.
