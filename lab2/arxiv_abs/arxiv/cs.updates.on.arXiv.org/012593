These notes were originally developed as lecture notes for a category theory course. They should
be well-suited to anyone that wants to learn category theory from scratch and has a scientific mind.
There is no need to know advanced mathematics, nor any of the disciplines where category theory is
traditionally applied, such as algebraic geometry or theoretical computer science. The only knowledge
that is assumed from the reader is linear algebra. All concepts are explained by giving concrete
examples from different, non-specialized areas of mathematics (such as basic group theory, graph
theory, and probability). Not every example is helpful for every reader, but hopefully every reader
can find at least one helpful example per concept. The reader is encouraged to read all the examples,
this way they may even learn something new about a different field. Particular emphasis is given
to the Yoneda lemma and its significance, with both intuitive explanations, detailed proofs, and
specific examples. Another common theme in these notes is the relationship between categories
and directed multigraphs, which is treated in detail. From the applied point of view, this shows
why categorical thinking can help whenever some process is taking place on a graph. From the pure
math point of view, this can be seen as the 1-dimensional first step into the theory of simplicial
sets. Finally, monads and comonads are treated on an equal footing, differently to most literature
in which comonads are often overlooked as "just the dual to monads". Theorems, interpretations
and concrete examples are given for monads as well as for comonads.
