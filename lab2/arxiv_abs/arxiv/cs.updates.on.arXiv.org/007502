Scalable nonvolatile memory DIMMs will finally be commercially available with the release of the
Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Module (or just "Optane DC PMM"). This new nonvolatile DIMM supports
byte-granularity accesses with access times on the order of DRAM, while also providing data storage
that survives power outages. This work comprises the first in-depth, scholarly, performance review
of Intel's Optane DC PMM, exploring its capabilities as a main memory device, and as persistent,
byte-addressable memory exposed to user-space applications. This report details the technologies
performance under a number of modes and scenarios, and across a wide variety of macro-scale benchmarks.
Optane DC PMMs can be used as large memory devices with a DRAM cache to hide their lower bandwidth and
higher latency. When used in this Memory (or cached) mode, Optane DC memory has little impact on applications
with small memory footprints. Applications with larger memory footprints may experience some
slow-down relative to DRAM, but are now able to keep much more data in memory. When used under a file
system, Optane DC PMMs can result in significant performance gains, especially when the file system
is optimized to use the load/store interface of the Optane DC PMM and the application uses many small,
persistent writes. For instance, using the NOVA-relaxed NVMM file system, we can improve the performance
of Kyoto Cabinet by almost 2x. Optane DC PMMs can also enable user-space persistence where the application
explicitly controls its writes into persistent Optane DC media. In our experiments, modified applications
that used user-space Optane DC persistence generally outperformed their file system counterparts.
For instance, the persistent version of RocksDB performed almost 2x faster than the equivalent
program utilizing an NVMM-aware file system.
