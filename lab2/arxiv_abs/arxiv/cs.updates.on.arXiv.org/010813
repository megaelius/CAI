Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising solution to enhance the wireless communication
capacity both cost-effectively and energy-efficiently, by properly altering the signal propagation
via tuning a large number of passive reflecting units. In this paper, we aim to characterize the fundamental
capacity limit of IRS-aided point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication
systems with multi-antenna transmitter and receiver in general, by jointly optimizing the IRS
reflection coefficients and the MIMO transmit covariance matrix. First, we consider narrowband
transmission under frequency-flat fading channels, and develop an efficient alternating optimization
algorithm to find a locally optimal solution by iteratively optimizing the transmit covariance
matrix or one of the reflection coefficients with the others being fixed. Next, we consider capacity
maximization for broadband transmission in a general MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) system under frequency-selective fading channels, where transmit covariance matrices
can be optimized for different subcarriers while only one common set of IRS reflection coefficients
can be designed to cater to all subcarriers. To tackle this more challenging problem, we propose
a new alternating optimization algorithm based on convex relaxation to find a high-quality suboptimal
solution. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve substantially increased
capacity compared to traditional MIMO channels without the IRS, and also outperform various benchmark
schemes. In particular, it is shown that with the proposed algorithms, various key parameters of
the IRS-aided MIMO channel such as channel total power, rank, and condition number can be significantly
improved for capacity enhancement.
