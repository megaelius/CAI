Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are present in many settings addressing a myriad of purposes. Examples
are Internet-of-Things (IoT) or sensing software embedded in appliances or even specialised meters
that measure and respond to electricity demands in smart grids. Due to their pervasive nature, they
are usually chosen as recipients for larger scope cyber-security attacks. Those promote system-wide
disruptions and are directed towards one key aspect such as confidentiality, integrity, availability
or a combination of those characteristics. Our paper focuses on a particular and distressing attack
where coordinated malware infected IoT units are maliciously employed to synchronously turn on
or off high-wattage appliances, affecting the grid's primary control management. Our model could
be extended to larger (smart) grids, Active Buildings as well as similar infrastructures. Our approach
models Coordinated Load-Changing Attacks (CLCA) also referred as GridLock or BlackIoT, against
a theoretical power grid, containing various types of power plants. It employs Continuous-Time
Markov Chains where elements such as Power Plants and Botnets are modelled under normal or attack
situations to evaluate the effect of CLCA in power reliant infrastructures. We showcase our modelling
approach in the scenario of a power supplier (e.g. power plant) being targeted by a botnet. We demonstrate
how our modelling approach can quantify the impact of a botnet attack and be abstracted for any CPS
system involving power load management in a smart grid. Our results show that by prioritising the
type of power-plants, the impact of the attack may change: in particular, we find the most impacting
attack times and show how different strategies impact their success. We also find the best power
generator to use depending on the current demand and strength of attack.
