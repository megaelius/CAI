Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have been developed to provide students with personalized
learning experiences by adaptively generating learning paths optimized for each individual.
Within the vast scope of ITS, score prediction stands out as an area of study that enables students
to construct individually realistic goals based on their current position. Via the expected score
provided by the ITS, a student can instantaneously compare one's expected score to one's actual
score, which directly corresponds to the reliability that the ITS can instill. In other words, refining
the precision of predicted scores strictly correlates to the level of confidence that a student
may have with an ITS, which will evidently ensue improved student engagement. However, previous
studies have solely concentrated on improving the performance of a prediction model, largely lacking
focus on the benefits generated by its practical application. In this paper, we demonstrate that
the accuracy of the score prediction model deployed in a real-world setting significantly impacts
user engagement by providing empirical evidence. To that end, we apply a state-of-the-art deep
attentive neural network-based score prediction model to Santa, a multi-platform English ITS
with approximately 780K users in South Korea that exclusively focuses on the TOEIC (Test of English
for International Communications) standardized examinations. We run a controlled A/B test on
the ITS with two models, respectively based on collaborative filtering and deep attentive neural
networks, to verify whether the more accurate model engenders any student engagement. The results
conclude that the attentive model not only induces high student morale (e.g. higher diagnostic
test completion ratio, number of questions answered, etc.) but also encourages active engagement
(e.g. higher purchase rate, improved total profit, etc.) on Santa.
