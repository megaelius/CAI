Deep-Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a therapy used in conjunction with medication to help alleviate
the motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, the monitoring and adjustment of DBS settings
is tedious and expensive, requiring long programming appointments every few months. We investigated
the possible correlation between PD motor score severity and digitally extracted patient voice
features to potentially aid clinicians in their monitoring and treatment of PD with DBS, and eventually
enable a closed-loop DBS system. 5 DBS PD patients were enrolled. Voice samples were collected for
various voice tasks (single phoneme vocalization, free speech task, sentence reading task, counting
backward task, categorical fluency task) for DBS ON and OFF states. Motor scores per the Unified
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were also collected for DBS ON and OFF states. Voice samples
were then analyzed to extract voice features using publicly available voice feature library sets,
and statistically compared for DBS ON and OFF. Of the feature categories explored (Acoustic, Prosodic,
Linguistic) 6 features from the GeMAPS feature set for acoustic features demonstrated significant
differences with DBS ON and OFF (p<0.05). Prosodic features such as pause length/percentage were
found to be negatively correlated with increased motor symptom severity. Non-significant differences
were found for linguistic features. These findings provide preliminary evidence for acoustic
and prosodic speech features to act as potential biomarkers for PD disease severity in DBS patients.
We hope to explore further by expanding our data set, identifying other features, applying machine
learning models, and working towards a closed-loop DBS system that can auto-tune itself based on
changes in a patient's voice.
