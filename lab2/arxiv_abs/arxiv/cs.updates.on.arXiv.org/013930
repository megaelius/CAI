Knowledge graphs have become a popular formalism for representing entities and their properties
using a graph data model, e.g., the Resource Description Framework (RDF). An RDF graph comprises
entities of the same type connected to objects or other entities using labeled edges annotated with
properties. RDF graphs usually contain entities that share the same objects in a certain group of
properties, i.e., they match star patterns composed of these properties and objects. In case the
number of these entities or properties in these star patterns is large, the size of the RDF graph and
query processing are negatively impacted; we refer these star patterns as frequent star patterns.
We address the problem of identifying frequent star patterns in RDF graphs and devise the concept
of factorized RDF graphs, which denote compact representations of RDF graphs where the number of
frequent star patterns is minimized. We also develop computational methods to identify frequent
star patterns and generate a factorized RDF graph, where compact RDF molecules replace frequent
star patterns. A compact RDF molecule of a frequent star pattern denotes an RDF subgraph that instantiates
the corresponding star pattern. Instead of having all the entities matching the original frequent
star pattern, a surrogate entity is added and related to the properties of the frequent star pattern;
it is linked to the entities that originally match the frequent star pattern. We evaluate the performance
of our factorization techniques on several RDF graph benchmarks and compare with a baseline built
on top of gSpan, a state-of-the-art algorithm to detect frequent patterns. The outcomes evidence
the efficiency of proposed approach and show that our techniques are able to reduce execution time
of the baseline approach in at least three orders of magnitude reducing the RDF graph size by up to
66.56%.
