The application of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to harness high-content screening
images or 2D compound representations is gaining increasing attention in drug discovery. However,
existing applications often require large data sets for training, or sophisticated pretraining
schemes. Here, we show using 33 IC50 data sets from ChEMBL 23 that the in vitro activity of compounds
on cancer cell lines and protein targets can be accurately predicted on a continuous scale from their
Kekule structure representations alone by extending existing architectures, which were pretrained
on unrelated image data sets. We show that the predictive power of the generated models is comparable
to that of Random Forest (RF) models and fully-connected Deep Neural Networks trained on circular
(Morgan) fingerprints. Notably, including additional fully-connected layers further increases
the predictive power of the ConvNets by up to 10%. Analysis of the predictions generated by RF models
and ConvNets shows that by simply averaging the output of the RF models and ConvNets we obtain significantly
lower errors in prediction for multiple data sets, although the effect size is small, than those
obtained with either model alone, indicating that the features extracted by the convolutional
layers of the ConvNets provide complementary predictive signal to Morgan fingerprints. Lastly,
we show that multi-task ConvNets trained on compound images permit to model COX isoform selectivity
on a continuous scale with errors in prediction comparable to the uncertainty of the data. Overall,
in this work we present a set of ConvNet architectures for the prediction of compound activity from
their Kekule structure representations with state-of-the-art performance, that require no generation
of compound descriptors or use of sophisticated image processing techniques.
