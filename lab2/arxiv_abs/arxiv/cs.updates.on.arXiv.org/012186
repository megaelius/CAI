This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on Predictive Maintenance (PdM) with emphasis
on system architectures, purposes and approaches. In industry, any outages and unplanned downtime
of machines or systems would degrade or interrupt a company's core business, potentially resulting
in significant penalties and unmeasurable reputation loss. Existing traditional maintenance
approaches suffer from some assumptions and limits, such as high prevent/repair costs, inadequate
or inaccurate mathematical degradation processes and manual feature extraction. With the trend
of smart manufacturing and development of Internet of Things (IoT), data mining and Artificial
Intelligence (AI), etc., PdM is proposed as a novel type of maintenance paradigm to perform maintenances
only after the analytical models predict certain failures or degradations. In this survey, we first
provide a high-level view of the PdM system architectures including the Open System Architecture
for Condition Based Monitoring (OSA-CBM), cloud-enhanced PdM system and PdM 4.0, etc. Then, we
make clear the specific maintenance purposes/objectives, which mainly comprise cost minimization,
availability/reliability maximization and multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, we
provide a review of the existing approaches for fault diagnosis and prognosis in PdM systems that
include three major subcategories: knowledge based, traditional Machine Learning (ML) based
and DL based approaches. We make a brief review on the knowledge based and traditional ML based approaches
applied in diverse industrial systems or components with a complete list of references, while providing
a comprehensive review of DL based approaches. Finally, important future research directions
are introduced.
