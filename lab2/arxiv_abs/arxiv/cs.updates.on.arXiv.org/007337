The computer-aided detection (CADe) systems are developed to assist pathologists in slide assessment,
increasing diagnosis efficiency and reducing missing inspections. Many studies have shown such
a CADe system with deep learning approaches outperforms the one using conventional methods that
rely on hand-crafted features based on field-knowledge. However, most developers who adopted
deep learning models directly focused on the efficacy of outcomes, without providing comprehensive
explanations on why their proposed frameworks can work effectively. In this study, we designed
four experiments to verify the consecutive concepts, showing that the deep features learned from
pathological patches are interpretable by domain knowledge of pathology and enlightening for
clinical diagnosis in the task of lesion detection. The experimental results show the activation
features work as morphological descriptors for specific cells or tissues, which agree with the
clinical rules in classification. That is, the deep learning framework not only detects the distribution
of tumor cells but also recognizes lymphocytes, collagen fibers, and some other non-cell structural
tissues. Most of the characteristics learned by the deep learning models have summarized the detection
rules that can be recognized by the experienced pathologists, whereas there are still some features
may not be intuitive to domain experts but discriminative in classification for machines. Those
features are worthy to be further studied in order to find out the reasonable correlations to pathological
knowledge, from which pathological experts may draw inspirations for exploring new characteristics
in diagnosis.
