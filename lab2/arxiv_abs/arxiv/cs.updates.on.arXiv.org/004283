Many real-world dynamical systems can successfully be analyzed using the temporal network formalism.
Empirical temporal networks and dynamic processes that take place in these situations show heterogeneous,
non-Markovian, and intrinsically correlated dynamics, making their analysis particularly challenging.
Randomized reference models (RRMs) for temporal networks constitute a versatile toolbox for studying
such systems. Defined as ensembles of random networks with given features constrained to match
those of an input (empirical) network, they may be used to identify statistically significant motifs
in empirical temporal networks (i.e. overrepresented w.r.t. the null random networks) and to infer
the effects of such motifs on dynamical processes unfolding in the network. However, the effects
of most randomization procedures on temporal network characteristics remain poorly understood,
rendering their use non-trivial and susceptible to misinterpretation. Here we propose a unified
framework for classifying and understanding microcanonical RRMs (MRRMs). We use this framework
to propose a canonical naming convention for existing randomization procedures, classify them,
and deduce their effects on a range of important temporal network features. We furthermore show
that certain classes of compatible MRRMs may be applied in sequential composition to generate more
than a hundred new MRRMs from existing ones surveyed in this article. We provide a tutorial for the
use of MRRMs to analyze an empirical temporal network and we review applications of MRRMs found in
literature. The taxonomy of MRRMs we have developed provides a reference to ease the use of MRRMs,
and the theoretical foundations laid here may further serve as a base for the development of a principled
and systematic way to generate and apply randomized reference null models for the study of temporal
networks.
