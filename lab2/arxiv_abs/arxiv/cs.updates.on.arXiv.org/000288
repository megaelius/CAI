Despite its existing incentives for leecher cooperation, BitTorrent file sharing fundamentally
relies on the presence of seeder peers. Seeder peers essentially operate outside the BitTorrent
incentives, with two caveats: slow downlinks lead to increased numbers of "temporary" seeders
(who left their console, but will terminate their seeder role when they return), and the copyright
liability boon that file segmentation offers for permanent seeders. Using a simple epidemic model
for a two-segment BitTorrent swarm, we focus on the BitTorrent rule to disseminate the (locally)
rarest segments first. With our model, we show that the rarest-segment first rule minimizes transition
time to seeder (complete file acquisition) and equalizes the segment populations in steady-state.
We discuss how alternative dissemination rules may {\em beneficially increase} file acquisition
times causing leechers to remain in the system longer (particularly as temporary seeders). The
result is that leechers are further enticed to cooperate. This eliminates the threat of extinction
of rare segments which is prevented by the needed presence of permanent seeders. Our model allows
us to study the corresponding trade-offs between performance improvement, load on permanent seeders,
and content availability, which we leave for future work. Finally, interpreting the two-segment
model as one involving a rare segment and a "lumped" segment representing the rest, we study a model
that jointly considers control of rare segments and different uplinks causing "choking," where
high-uplink peers will not engage in certain transactions with low-uplink peers.
