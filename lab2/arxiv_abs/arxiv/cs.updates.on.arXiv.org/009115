Long non-coding RNA, microRNA, and messenger RNA enable key regulations of various biological
processes through a variety of diverse interaction mechanisms. Identifying the interactions
and cross-talk between these heterogeneous RNA classes is essential in order to uncover the functional
role of individual RNA transcripts, especially for unannotated and newly-discovered RNA sequences
with no known interactions. Recently, sequence-based deep learning and network embedding methods
are becoming promising approaches that can either predict RNA-RNA interactions from a sequence
or infer missing interactions from patterns that may exist in the network topology. However, the
majority of these methods have several limitations, e.g., the inability to perform inductive predictions,
to distinguish the directionality of interactions, or to integrate various sequence, interaction,
and annotation biological datasets. We proposed a novel deep learning-based framework, rna2rna,
which learns from RNA sequences to produce a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the proximities
in both the interactions topology and the functional affinity topology. In this proposed embedding
space, we have designated a two-part "source and target contexts" to capture the targeting and receptive
fields of each RNA transcript, while encapsulating the heterogenous cross-talk interactions
between lncRNAs and miRNAs. From experimental results, our method exhibits superior performance
in AUPR rates compared to state-of-art approaches at predicting missing interactions in different
RNA-RNA interaction databases and was shown to accurately perform link predictions to novel RNA
sequences not seen at training time, even without any prior information. Additional results suggest
that our proposed framework may have successfully captured a manifold for heterogeneous RNA sequences
to be used to discover novel functional annotations.
