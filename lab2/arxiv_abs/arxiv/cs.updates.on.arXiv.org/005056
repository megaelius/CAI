In this work, we analyze the secrecy outage performance of a dual-hop relay system composed of multiple-input-multiple-output
radio-frequency (RF) links and a free-space optical (FSO) link while a multiple-antenna eavesdropper
wiretaps the confidential information by decoding the received signals from the resource node.
The channel state information (CSI) of the RF and FSO links is considered to be outdated. We propose
three transmit antenna selection (TAS) schemes to enhance the secrecy performance of the considered
systems. The secrecy outage performance with different TAS schemes is analyzed and the effects
of misalignment and detection technology on the secrecy outage performance of mixed systems are
studied. We derive the closed-form expressions for probability density function (PDF) and cumulative
distribution function (CDF) over M\'alaga channel with imperfect CSI. Then the closed-form expressions
for the CDF and PDF of the equivalent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the legitimate receiver over
Nakagami-$m$ and M\'alaga channels are derived. Furthermore, the lower bound of the secrecy outage
probability (SOP) with different TAS schemes are derived. Besides, the asymptotic results for
SOP are investigated by exploiting the unfolding of Meijer's $G$-function when the electrical
SNR of FSO link approaches infinity. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulation results are presented to
testify the correctness of the proposed analysis. The results illustrate that the outdated CSI
shows a strong effect on the secrecy outage performance. In addition, increasing the number of antennas
at the source cannot significantly enhance the secrecy performance of the considered systems.
