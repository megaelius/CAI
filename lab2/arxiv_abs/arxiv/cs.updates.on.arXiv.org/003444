We show that a Bayesian strategy map profile is a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium independent of any prior
if and only if the Bayesian strategy map profile, evaluated at any type profile, is the Nash equilibrium
of the so-called local deterministic game corresponding to that type profile. We call such a Bayesian
game type-regular. We then show that an m-dimensional n-agent Bayesian game whose utilities are
linearly dependent on the types of the agents is equivalent, following a normalisation of the type
space of each agent into the (m-1)-simplex, to a simultaneous competition in nm so-called basic
n-agent games. If the game is own-type-linear, i.e., the utility of each player only depends linearly
on its own type, then the Bayesian game is equivalent to a simultaneous competition in m basic n-agent
games, called a multi-game. We then prove that an own-type-linear Bayesian game is type-regular
if it is type-regular on the vertices of the (m-1)-simplex, a result which provides a large class
of type-regular Bayesian maps. The class of m-dimensional own-type-linear Bayesian games can
model, via their equivalence with multi-games, simultaneous decision-making in m different environments.
We show that a two dimensional own-type-linear Bayesian game can be used to give a new model of the
Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) in which the prosocial tendencies of the agents are considered as their
types and the two agents play simultaneously in the PD as well as in a prosocial game. This Bayesian
game addresses the materialistic and the prosocial tendencies of the agents. Similarly, we present
a new two dimensional Bayesian model of the Trust game in which the type of the two agents reflect their
prosocial tendency or trustfulness, which leads to more reasonable Nash equilibria. We finally
consider an example of such multi-environment decision making in production by several companies
in multi-markets.
