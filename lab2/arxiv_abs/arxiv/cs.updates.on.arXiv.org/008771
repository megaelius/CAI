Effect systems are lightweight extensions to type systems that can verify a wide range of important
properties with modest developer burden. But our general understanding of effect systems is limited
primarily to systems where the order of effects is irrelevant. Understanding such systems in terms
of a semilattice of effects grounds understanding of the essential issues, and provides guidance
when designing new effect systems. By contrast, sequential effect systems --- where the order of
effects is important --- lack an established algebraic structure on effects. We derive an algebraic
structure of sequential effects from the shape of prior concrete sequential effect systems. We
present an abstract polymorphic effect system with singleton effects parameterized by an effect
quantale --- an algebraic structure with well-defined properties that can model the effects of
a range of existing sequential effect systems. We define effect quantales, derive useful properties,
and show how they cleanly model a variety of known sequential effect systems. We show that for most
effect quantales, there is a free, general notion of iterating a sequential effect, and that for
systems we consider the derived iteration agrees with the manually designed iteration operators
in prior work. This induced notion of iteration is as general as possible: for every effect quantale
either our free iteration construct is defined, or there is no way to define iteration for that effect
quantale. We also position effect quantales with respect to work on categorical semantics for sequential
effect systems, clarifying the distinctions between these systems and our own. In addition, our
derived iteration construct should generalize to these semantic structures, addressing limitations
of that work.
