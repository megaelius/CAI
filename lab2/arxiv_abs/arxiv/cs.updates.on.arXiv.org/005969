Graphs are complex objects that do not lend themselves easily to typical learning tasks. Recently,
a range of approaches based on graph kernels or graph neural networks have been developed for graph
classification and for representation learning on graphs in general. As the developed methodologies
become more sophisticated, it is important to understand which components of the increasingly
complex methods are necessary or most effective. As a first step, we develop a simple yet meaningful
graph representation, and explore its effectiveness in graph classification. We test our baseline
representation for the graph classification task on a range of graph datasets. Interestingly,
this simple representation achieves similar performance as the state-of-the-art graph kernels
and graph neural networks for non-attributed graph classification. Its performance on classifying
attributed graphs is slightly weaker as it does not incorporate attributes. However, given its
simplicity and efficiency, we believe that it still serves as an effective baseline for attributed
graph classification. Our graph representation is efficient (linear-time) to compute. We also
provide a simple connection with the graph neural networks. Note that these observations are only
for the task of graph classification while existing methods are often designed for a broader scope
including node embedding and link prediction. The results are also likely biased due to the limited
amount of benchmark datasets available. Nevertheless, the good performance of our simple baseline
calls for the development of new, more comprehensive benchmark datasets so as to better evaluate
and analyze different graph learning methods. Furthermore, given the computational efficiency
of our graph summary, we believe that it is a good candidate as a baseline method for future graph classification
(or even other graph learning) studies.
