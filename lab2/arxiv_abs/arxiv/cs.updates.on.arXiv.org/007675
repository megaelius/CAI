Automated, data-driven quality management systems, which facilitate the transformation of data
into useable information, are desired to enhance decision-making processes. Integration of accurate,
reliable, and straightforward approaches that measure uncertainty of inspection processes are
instrumental for the successful implementation of automated, data-driven quality management
systems. This research has addressed these needs by exploring and adapting Bayesian statistics-based
approaches for fraction nonconforming posterior distribution derivation purposes. Using these
accurate and reliable inputs, this research further develops novel, analytically-based approaches
to improve the practical function of traditional construction fabrication quality management
systems. Multiple descriptive and predictive analytical functionalities are developed to support
and augment quality-associated decision-making processes. Multi-relational databases (e.g.,
quality management system, engineering design system, and cost management system) from an industrial
company in Edmonton, Canada, are investigated and mapped to implement the novel system proposed.
This research has contributed to academic literature and practice by: (1) advancing decision-support
systems for construction management by developing a dynamic simulation environment that uses
real-time data to enhance simulation predictability; (2) developing integrated analytical methods
for improved modeling in fabrication quality-associated decision making; and (3) creating reliable
and interpretable decision-support metrics for quality performance measurement, complexity
analysis, and rework cost management to reduce the data interpretation load of practitioners and
to uncover valuable knowledge and information from available data sources.
