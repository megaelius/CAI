This paper presents PreVIous, a methodology to predict the performance of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) in terms of throughput and energy consumption on vision-enabled devices for the
Internet of Things. CNNs typically constitute a massive computational load for such devices, which
are characterized by scarce hardware resources to be shared among multiple concurrent tasks. Therefore,
it is critical to select the optimal CNN architecture for a particular hardware platform according
to prescribed application requirements. However, the zoo of CNN models is already vast and rapidly
growing. To facilitate a suitable selection, we introduce a prediction framework that allows to
evaluate the performance of CNNs prior to their actual implementation. The proposed methodology
is based on PreVIousNet, a neural network specifically designed to build accurate per-layer performance
predictive models. PreVIousNet incorporates the most usual parameters found in state-of-the-art
network architectures. The resulting predictive models for inference time and energy have been
tested against comprehensive characterizations of seven well-known CNN models running on two
different software frameworks and two different embedded platforms. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the most extensive study in the literature concerning CNN performance prediction on low-power
low-cost devices. The average deviation between predictions and real measurements is remarkably
low, ranging from 3% to 10%. This means state-of-the-art modeling accuracy. As an additional asset,
the fine-grained a priori analysis provided by PreVIous could also be exploited by neural architecture
search engines.
