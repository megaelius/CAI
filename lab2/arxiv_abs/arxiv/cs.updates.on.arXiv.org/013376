Magic-state distillation (or non-stabilizer state manipulation) is a crucial component in the
leading approaches to realizing scalable, fault-tolerant, and universal quantum computation.
Related to non-stabilizer state manipulation is the resource theory of non-stabilizer states,
for which one of the goals is to characterize and quantify non-stabilizerness of a quantum state.
In this paper, we introduce the family of thauma measures to quantify the amount of non-stabilizerness
in a quantum state, and we exploit this family of measures to address several open questions in the
resource theory of non-stabilizer states. As a first application, we establish the hypothesis
testing thauma as an efficiently computable benchmark for the one-shot distillable non-stabilizerness,
which in turn leads to a variety of bounds on the rate at which non-stabilizerness can be distilled,
as well as on the overhead of magic-state distillation. We then prove that the max-thauma can be used
as an efficiently computable tool in benchmarking the efficiency of magic-state distillation
and that it can outperform pervious approaches based on mana. Finally, we use the min-thauma to bound
a quantity known in the literature as the "regularized relative entropy of magic." As a consequence
of this bound, we find that two classes of states with maximal mana, a previously established non-stabilizerness
measure, cannot be interconverted in the asymptotic regime at a rate equal to one. This result resolves
a basic question in the resource theory of non-stabilizer states and reveals a difference between
the resource theory of non-stabilizer states and other resource theories such as entanglement
and coherence.
