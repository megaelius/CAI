With the increasing demands on interactive video applications, how to adapt video bit rate to avoid
network congestion has become critical, since congestion results in self-inflicted delay and
packet loss which deteriorate the quality of real-time video service. The existing congestion
control is hard to simultaneously achieve low latency, high throughput, good adaptability and
fair bandwidth allocation, mainly because of the hardwired control strategy and egocentric convergence
objective. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end statistical learning based congestion
control, named Iris. By exploring the underlying principles of self-inflicted delay, we reveal
that congestion delay is determined by sending rate, receiving rate and network status, which inspires
us to control video bit rate using a statistical-learning congestion control model. The key idea
of Iris is to force all flows to converge to the same queue load, and adjust the bit rate by the model.
All flows keep a small and fixed number of packets queuing in the network, thus the fair bandwidth
allocation and low latency are both achieved. Besides, the adjustment step size of sending rate
is updated by online learning, to better adapt to dynamically changing networks. We carried out
extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of Iris, with the implementations of transport
layer (UDP) and application layer (QUIC) respectively. The testing environment includes emulated
network, real-world Internet and commercial LTE networks. Compared against TCP flavors and state-of-the-art
protocols, Iris is able to achieve high bandwidth utilization, low latency and good fairness concurrently.
Especially over QUIC, Iris is able to increase the video bitrate up to 25%, and PSNR up to 1dB.
