The article analyzes the historical aspect of the formation of computer modeling as one of the perspective
directions of educational process development. The notion of "system of computer modeling", conceptual
model of system of computer modeling (SCMod), its components (mathematical, animation, graphic,
strategic), functions, principles and purposes of use are grounded. The features of the organization
of students work using SCMod, individual and group work, the formation of subject competencies
are described; the aspect of students' motivation to learning is considered. It is established
that educational institutions can use SCMod at different levels and stages of training and in different
contexts, which consist of interrelated physical, social, cultural and technological aspects.
It is determined that the use of SCMod in general secondary school would increase the capacity of
teachers to improve the training of students in natural and mathematical subjects and contribute
to the individualization of the learning process, in order to meet the pace, educational interests
and capabilities of each particular student. It is substantiated that the use of SCMod in the study
of natural-mathematical subjects contributes to the formation of subject competencies, develops
the skills of analysis and decision-making, increases the level of digital communication, develops
vigilance, raises the level of knowledge, increases the duration of attention of students. Further
research requires the justification of the process of forming students' competencies in natural-mathematical
subjects and designing cognitive tasks using SCMod.
