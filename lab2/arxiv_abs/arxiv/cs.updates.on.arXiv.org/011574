The advent of the Internet era has led to an explosive growth in the Electronic Health Records (EHR)
in the past decades. The EHR data can be regarded as a collection of clinical events, including laboratory
results, medication records, physiological indicators, etc, which can be used for clinical outcome
prediction tasks to support constructions of intelligent health systems. Learning patient representation
from these clinical events for the clinical outcome prediction is an important but challenging
step. Most related studies transform EHR data of a patient into a sequence of clinical events in temporal
order and then use sequential models to learn patient representations for outcome prediction.
However, clinical event sequence contains thousands of event types and temporal dependencies.
We further make an observation that clinical events occurring in a short period are not constrained
by any temporal order but events in a long term are influenced by temporal dependencies. The multi-scale
temporal property makes it difficult for traditional sequential models to capture the short-term
co-occurrence and the long-term temporal dependencies in clinical event sequences. In response
to the above challenges, this paper proposes a Multi-level Representation Model (MRM). MRM first
uses a sparse attention mechanism to model the short-term co-occurrence, then uses interval-based
event pooling to remove redundant information and reduce sequence length and finally predicts
clinical outcomes through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Experiments on real-world datasets
indicate that our proposed model largely improves the performance of clinical outcome prediction
tasks using EHR data.
