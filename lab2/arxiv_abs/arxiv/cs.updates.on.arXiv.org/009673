The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to require more effective and efficient wireless communications
than ever before. For this reason, techniques such as spectrum sharing, dynamic spectrum access,
extraction of signal intelligence and optimized routing will soon become essential components
of the IoT wireless communication paradigm. Given that the majority of the IoT will be composed of
tiny, mobile, and energy-constrained devices, traditional techniques based on a priori network
optimization may not be suitable, since (i) an accurate model of the environment may not be readily
available in practical scenarios; (ii) the computational requirements of traditional optimization
techniques may prove unbearable for IoT devices. To address the above challenges, much research
has been devoted to exploring the use of machine learning to address problems in the IoT wireless
communications domain. This work provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in the application
of machine learning techniques to address key problems in IoT wireless communications with an emphasis
on its ad hoc networking aspect. First, we present extensive background notions of machine learning
techniques. Then, by adopting a bottom-up approach, we examine existing work on machine learning
for the IoT at the physical, data-link and network layer of the protocol stack. Thereafter, we discuss
directions taken by the community towards hardware implementation to ensure the feasibility of
these techniques. Additionally, before concluding, we also provide a brief discussion of the application
of machine learning in IoT beyond wireless communication. Finally, each of these discussions is
accompanied by a detailed analysis of the related open problems and challenges.
