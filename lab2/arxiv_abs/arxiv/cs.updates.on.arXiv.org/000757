Segmentation is one of the most important tasks in image processing. It consist in classify the pixels
into two or more groups depending on their intensity levels and a threshold value. The quality of
the segmentation depends on the method applied to select the threshold. The use of the classical
implementations for multilevel thresholding is computationally expensive since they exhaustively
search the best values to optimize the objective function. Under such conditions, the use of optimization
evolutionary approaches has been extended. The Electromagnetism Like algorithm (EMO) is an evolutionary
method which mimics the attraction repulsion mechanism among charges to evolve the members of a
population. Different to other algorithms, EMO exhibits interesting search capabilities whereas
maintains a low computational overhead. In this paper, a multilevel thresholding (MT) algorithm
based on the EMO is introduced. The approach combines the good search capabilities of EMO algorithm
with objective functions proposed by the popular MT methods of Otsu and Kapur. The algorithm takes
random samples from a feasible search space inside the image histogram. Such samples build each
particle in the EMO context whereas its quality is evaluated considering the objective that is function
employed by the Otsu or Kapur method. Guided by these objective values the set of candidate solutions
are evolved through the EMO operators until an optimal solution is found. The approach generates
a multilevel segmentation algorithm which can effectively identify the threshold values of a digital
image in a reduced number of iterations. Experimental results show performance evidence of the
implementation of EMO for digital image segmentation.
