Objective Electronic health records (EHRs) are a promising source of data for health outcomes research
in oncology. A challenge in using EHR data is that selecting cohorts of patients often requires information
in unstructured parts of the record. Machine learning has been used to address this, but even high-performing
algorithms may select patients in a non-random manner and bias the resulting cohort. To improve
the efficiency of cohort selection while measuring potential bias, we introduce a technique called
Model-Assisted Cohort Selection (MACS) with Bias Analysis and apply it to the selection of metastatic
breast cancer (mBC) patients. Materials and Methods We trained a model on 17,263 patients using
term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) and logistic regression. We used a test
set of 17,292 patients to measure algorithm performance and perform Bias Analysis. We compared
the cohort generated by MACS to the cohort that would have been generated without MACS as reference
standard, first by comparing distributions of an extensive set of clinical and demographic variables
and then by comparing the results of two analyses addressing existing example research questions.
Results Our algorithm had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.976, a sensitivity of 96.0%, and an abstraction
efficiency gain of 77.9%. During Bias Analysis, we found no large differences in baseline characteristics
and no differences in the example analyses. Conclusion MACS with bias analysis can significantly
improve the efficiency of cohort selection on EHR data while instilling confidence that outcomes
research performed on the resulting cohort will not be biased.
