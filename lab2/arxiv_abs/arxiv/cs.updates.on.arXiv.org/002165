Solar-powered aircraft promise significantly increased flight endurance over conventional
aircraft. While this makes them promising candidates for large-scale aerial inspection missions,
their structural fragility necessitates that adverse weather is avoided using appropriate path
planning methods. This paper therefore presents MetPASS, the Meteorology-aware Path Planning
and Analysis Software for Solar-powered UAVs. MetPASS is the first path planning framework in the
literature that considers all aspects that influence the safety or performance of solar-powered
flight: It avoids environmental risks (thunderstorms, rain, wind, wind gusts and humidity) and
exploits advantageous regions (high sun radiation or tailwind). It also avoids system risks such
as low battery state of charge and returns safe paths through cluttered terrain. MetPASS imports
weather data from global meteorological models, propagates the aircraft state through an energetic
system model, and then combines both into a cost function. A combination of dynamic programming
techniques and an A*-search-algorithm with a custom heuristic is leveraged to plan globally optimal
paths in station-keeping, point-to-point or multi-goal aerial inspection missions with coverage
guarantees. A full software implementation including a GUI is provided. The planning methods are
verified using three missions of ETH Zurich's AtlantikSolar UAV: An 81-hour continuous solar-powered
station-keeping flight, a 4000km Atlantic crossing from Newfoundland to Portugal, and two multi-glacier
aerial inspection missions above the Arctic Ocean performed near Greenland in summer 2017.
