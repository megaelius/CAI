We reflect on our ongoing journey in the educational Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS) Project
to create two concept inventories for cybersecurity. We identify key steps in this journey and important
questions we faced. We explain the decisions we made and discuss the consequences of those decisions,
highlighting what worked well and what might have gone better. The CATS Project is creating and validating
two concept inventories---conceptual tests of understanding---that can be used to measure the
effectiveness of various approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity
Concept Inventory (CCI) is for students who have recently completed any first course in cybersecurity;
the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA) is for students who have recently completed an undergraduate
major or track in cybersecurity. Each assessment tool comprises 25 multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) of various difficulties that target the same five core concepts, but the CCA assumes greater
technical background. Key steps include defining project scope, identifying the core concepts,
uncovering student misconceptions, creating scenarios, drafting question stems, developing
distractor answer choices, generating educational materials, performing expert reviews, recruiting
student subjects, organizing workshops, building community acceptance, forming a team and nurturing
collaboration, adopting tools, and obtaining and using funding. Creating effective MCQs is difficult
and time-consuming, and cybersecurity presents special challenges. Because cybersecurity issues
are often subtle, where the adversarial model and details matter greatly, it is challenging to construct
MCQs for which there is exactly one best but non-obvious answer. We hope that our experiences and
lessons learned may help others create more effective concept inventories and assessments in STEM.
