Wind energy forecasting helps to manage power production, and hence, reduces energy cost. Deep
Neural Networks (DNN) mimics hierarchical learning in the human brain and thus possesses hierarchical,
distributed, and multi-task learning capabilities. Based on aforementioned characteristics,
we report Deep Belief Network (DBN) based forecast engine for wind power prediction because of its
good generalization and unsupervised pre-training attributes. The proposed DBN-WP forecast
engine, which exhibits stochastic feature generation capabilities and is composed of multiple
Restricted Boltzmann Machines, generates suitable features for wind power prediction using atmospheric
properties as input. DBN-WP, due to its unsupervised pre-training of RBM layers and generalization
capabilities, is able to learn the fluctuations in the meteorological properties and thus is able
to perform effective mapping of the wind power. In the deep network, a regression layer is appended
at the end to predict sort-term wind power. It is experimentally shown that the deep learning and
unsupervised pre-training capabilities of DBN based model has comparable and in some cases better
results than hybrid and complex learning techniques proposed for wind power prediction. The proposed
prediction system based on DBN, achieves mean values of RMSE, MAE and SDE as 0.124, 0.083 and 0.122,
respectively. Statistical analysis of several independent executions of the proposed DBN-WP
wind power prediction system demonstrates the stability of the system. The proposed DBN-WP architecture
is easy to implement and offers generalization as regards the change in location of the wind farm
is concerned.
