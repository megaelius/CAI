In this paper, we aim to investigate the synchronization problem of dynamical systems, which can
be of generic linear or Lipschitz nonlinear type, communicating over directed switching network
topologies. A mild connectivity assumption on the switching topologies is imposed, which allows
them to be directed and jointly connected. We propose a novel analysis framework from both algebraic
and geometric perspectives to justify the attractiveness of the synchronization manifold. Specifically,
it is proven that the complementary space of the synchronization manifold can be spanned by certain
subspaces. These subspaces can be the eigenspaces of the nonzero eigenvalues of Laplacian matrices
in linear case. They can also be subspaces in which the projection of the nonlinear self-dynamics
still retains the Lipschitz property. This allows to project the states of the dynamical systems
into these subspaces and transform the synchronization problem under consideration equivalently
into a convergence one of the projected states in each subspace. Then, assuming the joint connectivity
condition on the communication topologies, we are able to work out a simple yet effective and unified
convergence analysis for both types of dynamical systems. More specifically, for partial-state
coupled generic linear systems, it is proven that synchronization can be reached if an extra condition,
which is easy to verify in several cases, on the system dynamics is satisfied. For Lipschitz-type
nonlinear systems with positive-definite inner coupling matrix, synchronization is realized
if the coupling strength is strong enough to stabilize the evolution of the projected states in each
subspace under certain conditions.
