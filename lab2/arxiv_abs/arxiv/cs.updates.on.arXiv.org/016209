The anti-Ramsey numbers are a fundamental notion in graph theory, introduced in 1978, by Erd\" os,
Simonovits and S\' os. For given graphs $G$ and $H$ the \emph{anti-Ramsey number} $\textrm{ar}(G,H)$
is defined to be the maximum number $k$ such that there exists an assignment of $k$ colors to the edges
of $G$ in which every copy of $H$ in $G$ has at least two edges with the same color. There are works on
the computational complexity of the problem when $H$ is a star. Along this line of research, we study
the complexity of computing the anti-Ramsey number $\textrm{ar}(G,P_k)$, where $P_k$ is a path
of length $k$. First, we observe that when $k = \Omega(n)$, the problem is hard; hence, the challenging
part is the computational complexity of the problem when $k$ is a fixed constant. We provide a characterization
of the problem for paths of constant length. Our first main contribution is to prove that computing
$\textrm{ar}(G,P_k)$ for every integer $k>2$ is NP-hard. We obtain this by providing several structural
properties of such coloring in graphs. We investigate further and show that approximating $\textrm{ar}(G,P_3)$
to a factor of $n^{-1/2 - \epsilon}$ is hard already in $3$-partite graphs, unless P=NP. We also study
the exact complexity of the precolored version and show that there is no subexponential algorithm
for the problem unless ETH fails for any fixed constant $k$. Given the hardness of approximation
and parametrization of the problem, it is natural to study the problem on restricted graph families.
We introduce the notion of color connected coloring and employing this structural property. We
obtain a linear time algorithm to compute $\textrm{ar}(G,P_k)$, for every integer $k$, when the
host graph, $G$, is a tree.
