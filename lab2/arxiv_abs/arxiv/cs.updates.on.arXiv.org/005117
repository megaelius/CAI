Clustering via graph-Laplacian spectral imbedding is ubiquitous in data science and machine learning.
However, it becomes less efficient for large data sets due to two factors. First, computing the partial
eigendecomposition of the graph-Laplacian typically requires a large Krylov subspace. Second,
after the spectral imbedding is complete, the clustering is typically performed with various relaxations
of k-means, which may become prone to getting stuck in local minima and scale poorly in terms of computational
cost for large data sets. Here we propose two novel algorithms for spectral clustering of a subset
of the graph vertices (target subset) based on the theory of model order reduction. They rely on realizations
of a reduced order model (ROM) that accurately approximates the diffusion transfer function of
the original graph for inputs and outputs restricted to the target subset. While our focus is limited
to this subset, our algorithms produce its clustering that is consistent with the overall structure
of the graph. Moreover, working with a small target subset reduces greatly the required dimension
of Krylov subspace and allows to exploit the approximations of k-means in the regimes when they are
most robust and efficient, as verified by the numerical experiments. There are several uses for
our algorithms. First, they can be employed on their own to clusterize a representative subset in
cases when the full graph clustering is either infeasible or not required. Second, they may be used
for quality control. Third, as they drastically reduce the problem size, they enable the application
of more powerful approximations of k-means like those based on semi-definite programming (SDP)
instead of the conventional Lloyd's algorithm. Finally, they can be used as building blocks of a
divide-and-conquer algorithm for the full graph clustering. The latter will be reported in a separate
article.
