Designing usable products is important to provide a competitive edge through user satisfaction.
A first step to establish or improve a usability process is to perform a process assessment. As this
may be costly, an alternative for organizations seeking for lighter assessments, especially small
organizations, may be self-assessments. They can be carried out by an organization on its own to
assess the capability of its process. Although there are specific assessment methods to assess
the usability process, none of them provides a self-assessment method considering the specific
characteristics of small organizations. The objective of this research is to propose a method for
self-assessing the capability of the usability process in small organizations. The method consists
of a usability process reference model, a measurement framework, an assessment model, and a self-assessment
process supported by an online tool. Based on systematic mapping studies on usability capability/maturity
models and software process self-assessment methods, we identified the specific requirements
of such a method. The UPCASE method was systematically developed using a multi-method approach
based on the ISO/IEC TR 29110 and ISO/TR 18529 standard. The method has been applied and evaluated
with respect to its reliability, usability, comprehensibility and internal consistency through
a series of case studies. First results indicate that the method may be reliable. Feedback also indicates
that the method is easy to use and understandable even for non-software process improvement experts.
The UPCASE method is a first step to the self-assessment of the usability process in small organizations
supporting the systematic establishment and improvement of the usability process contributing
to the improvement of the usability of their software products.
