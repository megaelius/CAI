This paper investigates a secure energy efficiency (SEE) optimization problem in a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) underlay cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, a multi-antenna secondary
transmitter (SU-Tx) simultaneously sends secured information and energy to a secondary receiver
(SU-Rx) and an energy receiver (ER), respectively, in the presence of a primary receiver (PU-Rx).
It is assumed that the SU-Rx, ER and PU-Rx are each equipped with a single antenna. In addition, the
SU-Tx should satisfy constraints on maximum interference leakage to the PU-Rx and minimum harvested
energy at the ER. In this CR network, we consider the transmit covariance matrix design with the assumption
of perfect channel state information (CSI) at the SU-Tx. In addition, it is assumed that the ER is
a potential passive eavesdropper due to broadcast nature of wireless transmission. On the other
hand, we consider the worst-case scenario that ER's energy harvesting requirement is only satisfied
when it performs only energy harvesting without intercepting or eavesdropping information intended
for the SU-Rx. We formulate this transmit covariance matrix design as a SEE maximization problem
which is a non-convex problem due the non-linear fractional objective function. To realize the
solution for this non-convex problem, we utilize the non-linear fractional programming and difference
of concave (DC) functions approaches to reformulate into a tractable form. Based on these techniques
and the Dinkelbach's method, we propose iterative algorithms to determine the solution for the
original SEE maximization problem. Numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate
the performance of the proposed transmit covariance matrix design and convergence of the proposed
algorithms.
