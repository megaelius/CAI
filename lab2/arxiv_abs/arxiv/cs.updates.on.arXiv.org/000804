The fresh water reservoirs are one of the main power resources of Pakistan.These water reservoirs
are in the form of Tarbela Dam, Mangla Dam, Bhasha Dam,and Warsak Dam. To estimate the current power
capability of the Dams, the statistical information about the water in the dam has to be clear and
precise. For the purpose of water management monthly or yearly survey of the dams required. One of
the important parameter is to find the water level of water, which can help us in finding the pressure
and flow of water in dams. The existing surveying systems have some problems, i.e., risky, errors
in measurement and sometimes expensive. Our project has tried a lot to overcome these flaws and to
develop more economical, safe and accurate system for finding depth values of dams and ponds. The
key purpose of Our Project Autonomous Surveying Boat is to have it log water depths along a predefined
set of points. The Autonomous Surveying Boat floats in water according to predefined path, getting
the coordinates from GPS Sensor and direction is controlled by using Magnetometer Sensor. It stores
its data on SD card as a text file for later readings. The boat can also be used to find the average capacity
of the dam. The average depth is calculated from the measured depth values at different set points
of the dam. The actual length of the dam is determined by the magnetometer. The numbers of surveys
over the time can help us in finding the silting ratio in dams.For square dams the length and width
of the dam are measured and the average depth, then using these three parameters we can estimate the
average capacity of the dam.The boat is scalable for furthered modification if needed.
