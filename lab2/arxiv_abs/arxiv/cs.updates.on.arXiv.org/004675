Context:Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the practice to automatically configure system dependencies
and to provision local and remote instances. Practitioners consider IaC as a fundamental pillar
to implement DevOps practices, which helps them to rapidly deliver software and services to end-users.
Information technology (IT) organizations, such as Github, Mozilla, Facebook, Google and Netflix
have adopted IaC. A systematic mapping study on existing IaC research can help researchers to identify
potential research areas related to IaC, for example, the areas of defects and security flaws that
may occur in IaC scripts. Objective: The objective of this paper is to help researchers identify
research areas related to infrastructure as code (IaC) by conducting a systematic mapping study
of IaC-related research. Methodology: We conduct our research study by searching six scholar databases.
We collect a set of 33,887 publications by using seven search strings. By systematically applying
inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identify 31 publications related to IaC. We identify topics
addressed in these publications by applying qualitative analysis. Results: We identify four topics
studied in IaC-related publications: (i) framework/tool for infrastructure as code; (ii) use
of infrastructure as code; (iii) empirical study related to infrastructure as code; and (iv) testing
in infrastructure as code. According to our analysis, 52% of the studied 31 publications propose
a framework or tool to implement the practice of IaC or extend the functionality of an existing IaC
tool. Conclusion: As defects and security flaws can have serious consequences for the deployment
and development environments in DevOps, along with other topics, we observe the need for research
studies that will study defects and security flaws for IaC.
