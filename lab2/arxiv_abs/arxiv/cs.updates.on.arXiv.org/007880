Infrastructure in future smart and connected communities is envisioned as an aggregate of public
services, including the energy, transportation and communication systems, all intertwined with
each other. The intrinsic interdependency among these systems may exert underlying influence
on both design and operation of the heterogeneous infrastructures. However, few prior studies
have tapped into the interdependency among the three systems in order to quantify their potential
impacts during standard operation. In response to this, this paper proposes an open source, flexible,
integrated modeling framework suitable for designing coupled energy, transportation, and communication
systems and for assessing the impact of their interdependencies. First, a novel multi-level, multi-layer,
multi-agent approach is proposed to enable flexible modeling of the interconnected energy, transportation,
and communication systems. Then, for the framework's proof-of-concept, preliminary component
and system-level models for different systems are designed and implemented using Modelica, an
equation-based object-oriented modeling language. Finally, three case studies of gradually
increasing complexity are presented (energy, energy + transportation, energy + transportation
+ communication) to evaluate the interdependencies among the three systems. Quantitative analyses
show that the deviation of the average velocity on the road can be 10.5\% and the deviation of the power
draw from the grid can be 7\% with or without considering the transportation and communication system
at the peak commute time, indicating the presence of notable interdependencies. The proposed modeling
framework also has the potential to be further extended for various modeling purposes and use cases,
such as dynamic modeling and optimization, resilience analysis, and integrated decision making
in future connected communities.
