The article discusses the prospects of the augmented reality using as a component of a cloud-based
environment. The research goals are the next: to explore the possibility of the augmented reality
using with the involvement of the cloud-based environment components. The research objectives
are the next: to consider the notion of augmented reality; to analyze the experience the augmented
reality using within the cloud environment / system; to outline the prospects of the augmented reality
using in educational institutions; to consider the technical conditions of the augmented reality
use. The object of research is: the educational process in educational institutions of Ukraine
of different levels of accreditation. The subject of research is: the educational process in a cloud-based
environment in educational institutions of Ukraine. The research methods used are the next: analysis
of scientific publications, observations. The results of the research are the next: on the basis
of the analysis of scientific works, it has been established that the experience of the augmented
reality using in the systems based on cloud technologies already exists. However, the success of
such a combination has not yet been proven. Currently, laboratory tests are known, while the experiment
was not carried out under natural conditions in control and experimental groups. It is revealed
that the attraction of the augmented reality for the educators requires the development of new methodologies,
didactic materials, updating and updating of the curriculum. The main conclusions and recommendations:
the main principles of augmented reality use in the learning process are: designing of the environment
that is flexible enough, attention should be paid to the teaching and didactic issues; adjusting
the educational content for mastering the material provided by the curriculum.
