A common view in evolutionary biology is that mutation rates are minimised. However, studies in
combinatorial optimisation and search have shown a clear advantage of using variable mutation
rates as a control parameter to optimise the performance of evolutionary algorithms. Much biological
theory in this area is based on Ronald Fisher's work, who used Euclidean geometry to study the relation
between mutation size and expected fitness of the offspring in infinite phenotypic spaces. Here
we reconsider this theory based on the alternative geometry of discrete and finite spaces of DNA
sequences. First, we consider the geometric case of fitness being isomorphic to distance from an
optimum, and show how problems of optimal mutation rate control can be solved exactly or approximately
depending on additional constraints of the problem. Then we consider the general case of fitness
communicating only partial information about the distance. We define weak monotonicity of fitness
landscapes and prove that this property holds in all landscapes that are continuous and open at the
optimum. This theoretical result motivates our hypothesis that optimal mutation rate functions
in such landscapes will increase when fitness decreases in some neighbourhood of an optimum, resembling
the control functions derived in the geometric case. We test this hypothesis experimentally by
analysing approximately optimal mutation rate control functions in 115 complete landscapes of
binding scores between DNA sequences and transcription factors. Our findings support the hypothesis
and find that the increase of mutation rate is more rapid in landscapes that are less monotonic (more
rugged). We discuss the relevance of these findings to living organisms.
