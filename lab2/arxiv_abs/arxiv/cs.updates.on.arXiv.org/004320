Speech intelligibility is often severely degraded among hearing impaired individuals in situations
such as the cocktail party scenario. The performance of the current hearing aid technology has been
observed to be limited in these scenarios. In this paper, we propose a binaural speech enhancement
framework that takes into consideration the speech production model. The enhancement framework
proposed here is based on the Kalman filter that allows us to take the speech production dynamics
into account during the enhancement process. The usage of a Kalman filter requires the estimation
of clean speech and noise short term predictor (STP) parameters, and the clean speech pitch parameters.
In this work, a binaural codebook-based method is proposed for estimating the STP parameters, and
a directional pitch estimator based on the harmonic model and maximum likelihood principle is used
to estimate the pitch parameters. The proposed method for estimating the STP and pitch parameters
jointly uses the information from left and right ears, leading to a more robust estimation of the
filter parameters. Objective measures such as PESQ and STOI have been used to evaluate the enhancement
framework in different acoustic scenarios representative of the cocktail party scenario. We have
also conducted subjective listening tests on a set of nine normal hearing subjects, to evaluate
the performance in terms of intelligibility and quality improvement. The listening tests show
that the proposed algorithm, even with access to only a single channel noisy observation, significantly
improves the overall speech quality, and the speech intelligibility by up to 15%.
