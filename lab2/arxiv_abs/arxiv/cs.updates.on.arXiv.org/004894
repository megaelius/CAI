Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) systems are successful in restoring motor function and
supporting paralyzed users. Commercially available FES products are open loop, meaning that the
system is unable to adapt to changing conditions with the user and their muscles which results in
muscle fatigue and poor stimulation protocols. This is because it is difficult to close the loop
between stimulation and monitoring of muscle contraction using adaptive stimulation. FES causes
electrical artefacts which make it challenging to monitor muscle contractions with traditional
methods such as electromyography (EMG). We look to overcome this limitation by combining FES with
novel mechanomyographic (MMG) sensors to be able to monitor muscle activity during stimulation
in real time. To provide a meaningful task we built an FES cycling rig with a software interface that
enabled us to perform adaptive recording and stimulation, and then combine this with sensors to
record forces applied to the pedals using force sensitive resistors (FSRs), crank angle position
using a magnetic incremental encoder and inputs from the user using switches and a potentiometer.
We illustrated this with a closed-loop stimulation algorithm that used the inputs from the sensors
to control the output of a programmable RehaStim 1 FES stimulator (Hasomed) in real-time. This recumbent
bicycle rig was used as a testing platform for FES cycling. The algorithm was designed to respond
to a change in requested speed (RPM) from the user and change the stimulation power (% of maximum current
mA) until this speed was achieved and then maintain it.
