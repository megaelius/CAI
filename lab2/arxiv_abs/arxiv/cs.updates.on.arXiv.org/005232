With the prevalence of multimedia content on the Web, developing recommender solutions that can
effectively leverage the rich signal in multimedia data is in urgent need. Owing to the success of
deep neural networks in representation learning, recent advance on multimedia recommendation
has largely focused on exploring deep learning methods to improve the recommendation accuracy.
To date, however, there has been little effort to investigate the robustness of multimedia representation
and its impact on the performance of multimedia recommendation. In this paper, we shed light on the
robustness of multimedia recommender system. Using the state-of-the-art recommendation framework
and deep image features, we demonstrate that the overall system is not robust, such that a small (but
purposeful) perturbation on the input image will severely decrease the recommendation accuracy.
This implies the possible weakness of multimedia recommender system in predicting user preference,
and more importantly, the potential of improvement by enhancing its robustness. To this end, we
propose a novel solution named Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR), which can lead to
a more robust multimedia recommender model by using adversarial learning. The idea is to train the
model to defend an adversary, which adds perturbations to the target image with the purpose of decreasing
the model's accuracy. We conduct experiments on two representative multimedia recommendation
tasks, namely, image recommendation and visually-aware product recommendation. Extensive results
verify the positive effect of adversarial learning and demonstrate the effectiveness of our AMR
method. Source codes are available in https://github.com/duxy-me/AMR.
