Multi-channel short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain-based processing of reverberant microphone
signals commonly relies on power-spectral-density (PSD) estimates of early source images, where
early refers to reflections contained within the same STFT frame. State-of-the-art approaches
to multi-source early PSD estimation, given an estimate of the associated relative early transfer
functions (RETFs), conventionally minimize the approximation error defined with respect to the
early correlation matrix, requiring non-negative inequality constraints on the PSDs. Instead,
we here propose to factorize the early correlation matrix and minimize the approximation error
defined with respect to the early-correlation-matrix square root. The proposed minimization
problem -- constituting a generalization of the so-called orthogonal Procrustes problem -- seeks
a unitary matrix and the square roots of the early PSDs up to an arbitrary complex argument, making
non-negative inequality constraints redundant. A solution is obtained iteratively, requiring
one singular value decomposition (SVD) per iteration. The estimated unitary matrix and early PSD
square roots further allow to recursively update the RETF estimate, which is not inherently possible
in the conventional approach. An estimate of the said early-correlation-matrix square root itself
is obtained by means of the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD), where we further propose
to restore non-stationarities by desmoothing the generalized eigenvalues in order to compensate
for inevitable recursive averaging. Simulation results indicate fast convergence of the proposed
multi-source early PSD estimation approach in only one iteration if initialized appropriately,
and better performance as compared to the conventional approach.
