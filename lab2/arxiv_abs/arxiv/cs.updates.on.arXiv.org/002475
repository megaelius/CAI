An upcoming industrial IoT revolution, supposedly led by the introduction of embedded sensing
and computing, seamless communication and massive data analytics within industrial processes
[1], seems unquestionable today. Multiple technologies are being developed, and huge marketing
efforts are being made to position solutions in this industrial landscape. However, we have observed
that industrial wireless technologies are hardly being adopted by the manufacturing industry.
In this article, we try to understand the reasons behind this current lack of wireless technologies
adoption by means of conducting visits to the manufacturing industry and interviews with the maintenance
and engineering teams in these industries. The manufacturing industry is very diverse and specialized,
so we have tried to cover some of the most representative cases: the automotive sector, the pharmaceutical
sector (blistering), machine-tool industries (both consumer and aerospace sectors) and robotics.
We have analyzed the technology of their machinery, their application requirements and restrictions,
and identified a list of obstacles for wireless technology adoption. The most immediate obstacles
we have found are the need to strictly follow standards and certifications processes, as well as
their prudence. But the less obvious and perhaps even more limiting obstacles are their apparent
lack of concern regarding low energy consumption or cost which, in contrast, are believed to be of
utmost importance by wireless researchers and practitioners. In this reality-check article,
we analyze the causes of this different perception, we identify these obstacles and devise complementary
paths to make wireless adoption by the industrial manufacturing sector a reality in the coming years.
