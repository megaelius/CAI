The Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma (LLL) is a keystone principle in probability theory, guaranteeing the
existence of configurations which avoid a collection $\mathcal B$ of "bad" events which are mostly
independent and have low probability. In its simplest form, it asserts that whenever a bad-event
has probability $p$ and affects at most $d$ other bad-events, and $e p (d+1) < 1$, then a configuration
avoiding all $\mathcal B$ exists. A seminal algorithm of Moser & Tardos (2010) gives randomized
algorithms for most constructions based on the LLL. However, deterministic algorithms have lagged
behind. Notably, prior deterministic LLL algorithms have required stringent conditions on $\mathcal
B$; for example, they have required that events in $\mathcal B$ have low decision-tree complexity
or depend on a small number of variables. For this reason, they can only be applied to small fraction
of the numerous LLL applications in practice. We describe an alternate deterministic parallel
(NC) algorithm for the LLL, based on a general derandomization method of Sivakumar (2002) using
log-space statistical tests. The only requirement here is that bad-events should be computable
via a finite automaton with $\text{poly}(d)$ states. This covers most LLL applications to graph
theory and combinatorics. No auxiliary information about the bad-events, including any conditional
probability calculations, are required. Additionally, the proof is a straightforward combination
of general derandomization results and high-level analysis of the Moser-Tardos algorithm. We
illustrate with applications to defective vertex coloring, domatic partition, and independent
transversals.
