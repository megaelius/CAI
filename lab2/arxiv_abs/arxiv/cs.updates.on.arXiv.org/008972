Esports have become major international sports with hundreds of millions of spectators. Esports
games generate massive amounts of telemetry data. Using these to predict the outcome of esports
matches has received considerable attention, but micro-predictions, which seek to predict events
inside a match, is as yet unknown territory. Micro-predictions are however of perennial interest
across esports commentators and audience, because they provide the ability to observe events that
might otherwise be missed: esports games are highly complex with fast-moving action where the balance
of a game can change in the span of seconds, and where events can happen in multiple areas of the playing
field at the same time. Such events can happen rapidly, and it is easy for commentators and viewers
alike to miss an event and only observe the following impact of events. In Dota 2, a player hero being
killed by the opposing team is a key event of interest to commentators and audience. We present a deep
learning network with shared weights which provides accurate death predictions within a five-second
window. The network is trained on a vast selection of Dota 2 gameplay features and professional/semi-professional
level match dataset. Even though death events are rare within a game (1\% of the data), the model achieves
0.377 precision with 0.725 recall on test data when prompted to predict which of any of the 10 players
of either team will die within 5 seconds. An example of the system applied to a Dota 2 match is presented.
This model enables real-time micro-predictions of kills in Dota 2, one of the most played esports
titles in the world, giving commentators and viewers time to move their attention to these key events.
