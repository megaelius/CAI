Information-theoretical private information retrieval (PIR) is considered from a coded database
with colluding servers. The storage code is a locally repairable code (LRC) with maximal recoverability
(MR), and in particular, with optimal global minimum distance, for arbitrary code parameters:
Number of local groups $ g $, locality $ r $, local distance $ \delta $, dimension $ k \leq gr $ and length
$ n = g(r + \delta - 1) $. Servers are identified bijectively with local groups, and only locally non-redundant
information is considered and downloaded from each server, that is, only $ r $ nodes (out of $ r+\delta-1
$) are considered per server. When the remaining MDS code, after removing all locally redundant
nodes, is a linearized Reed-Solomon code, a PIR scheme is provided achieving the (download) rate
$ R = (N - k - rt + 1)/N $, where $ N = gr = n - g(\delta - 1) $ is the length of the restricted MDS code, for any
$ t $ colluding servers such that $ k + rt \leq N $. The field size is roughly $ g^r $, polynomial in the
number of servers $ g $. Assume an arbitrarily large number of stored files. If $ N - k - rt = 0 $, the rate
$ R = 1/N $ is the highest known and coincides with that of previous PIR schemes that work for any MDS
storage code. If $ N - k - rt > 0 $, the achieved rate $ R > 1/N $ coincides with the best known rate of PIR
schemes for MDS storage codes (but which do not work for LRCs or linearized Reed-Solomon storage
codes) and is always strictly higher than that of known PIR schemes that work for arbitrary MDS storage
codes. Finally, the obtained PIR scheme can also be adapted to the case where communication between
the user and each server is through a linearly-coded network, achieving the same rate as previous
known PIR schemes but with polynomial field sizes in the number of servers, instead of exponential.
