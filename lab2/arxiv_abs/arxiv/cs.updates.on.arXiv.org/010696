We propose a novel adaptive and causal random linear network coding (AC-RLNC) algorithm with forward
error correction (FEC) for a point-to-point communication channel with delayed feedback. AC-RLNC
is adaptive to the channel condition, that the algorithm estimates, and is causal, as coding depends
on the particular erasure realizations, as reflected in the feedback acknowledgments. Specifically,
the proposed model can learn the erasure pattern of the channel via feedback acknowledgments, and
adaptively adjust its retransmission rates using a priori and posteriori algorithms. By those
adjustments, AC-RLNC achieves the desired delay and throughput, and enables transmission with
zero error probability. We upper bound the throughput and the mean and maximum in order delivery
delay of AC-RLNC, and prove that for the point to point communication channel in the non-asymptotic
regime the proposed code may achieve more than 90% of the channel capacity. To upper bound the throughput
we utilize the minimum Bhattacharyya distance for the AC-RLNC code. We validate those results via
simulations. We contrast the performance of AC-RLNC with the one of selective repeat (SR)-ARQ,
which is causal but not adaptive, and is a posteriori. Via a study on experimentally obtained commercial
traces, we demonstrate that a protocol based on AC-RLNC can, vis-`a-vis SR-ARQ, double the throughput
gains, and triple the gain in terms of mean in order delivery delay when the channel is bursty. Furthermore,
the difference between the maximum and mean in order delivery delay is much smaller than that of SR-ARQ.
Closing the delay gap along with boosting the throughput is very promising for enabling ultra-reliable
low-latency communications (URLLC) applications.
