Urban transportation networks, from sidewalks and bicycle paths to streets and rail lines, provide
the backbone for movement and socioeconomic life in cities. These networks can be understood as
layers of a larger multiplex transport network. Because most cities are car-centric, the most developed
layer is typically the street layer, while other layers can be highly disconnected. To make urban
transport sustainable, cities are increasingly investing to develop their bicycle networks.
However, given the usually patchy nature of the bicycle network layer, it is yet unclear how to extend
it comprehensively and effectively given a limited budget. Here we develop data-driven, algorithmic
network growth strategies and apply them to cities around the world, showing that small but focused
investments allow to significantly increase the connectedness and directness of urban bicycle
networks. We motivate the development of our algorithms with a network component analysis and with
multimodal urban fingerprints that reveal different classes of cities depending on the connectedness
between different network layers. We introduce two greedy algorithms to add the most critical missing
links in the bicycle layer: The first algorithm connects the two largest connected components,
the second algorithm connects the largest with the closest component. We show that these algorithms
outmatch both a random approach and a baseline minimum investment strategy that connects the closest
components ignoring size. Our computational approach outlines novel pathways from car-centric
towards sustainable cities by taking advantage of urban data available on a city-wide scale. It
is a first step towards a quantitative consolidation of bicycle infrastructure development that
can become valuable for urban planners and stakeholders.
