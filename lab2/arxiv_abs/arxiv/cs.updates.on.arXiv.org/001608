Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is an approach to networking which handles network disruptions
and high delays that may occur in many kinds of communication networks. The major reasons for high
delay include partial connectivity of networks as can be seen in many types of ad hoc wireless networks
with frequent network partitions, long propagation time as experienced in inter-planetary and
deep space networks, and frequent link disruptions due to the mobility of nodes as observed in terrestrial
wireless network environments. Experimenting network architectures, protocols, and mobility
models in such real-world scenarios is difficult due to the complexities involved in the network
environment. Therefore, in this document, we present the documentation of an Urban Delay Tolerant
Network Simulator (UDTNSim) version 0.1, capable of simulating urban road network environments
with DTN characteristics including mobility models and routing protocols. The mobility models
included in this version of UDTNSim are (i) Stationary Movement, (ii) Simple Random Movement, (iii)
Path Type Based Movememt, (iv) Path Memory Based Movement, (v) Path Type with Restricted Movement,
and (vi) Path Type with Wait Movement. In addition to mobility models, we also provide three routing
and data hand-off protocols: (i) Epidemic Routing, (ii) Superior Only Handoff, and (iii) Superior
Peer Handoff. UDTNSim v0.1 is designed using object-oriented programming approach in order to
provide flexibility in addition of new features to the DTN environment. UDTNSim v0.1 is distributed
as an open source simulator for the use of the research community.
