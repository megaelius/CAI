Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is an imaging technique that assesses left ventricle
function and myocardial perfusion for the detection of coronary artery diseases. Automatic MCE
perfusion quantification is challenging and requires accurate segmentation of the myocardium
from noisy and time-varying images. Random forests (RF) have been successfully applied to many
medical image segmentation tasks. However, the pixel-wise RF classifier ignores contextual relationships
between label outputs of individual pixels. RF which only utilizes local appearance features is
also susceptible to data suffering from large intensity variations. In this paper, we demonstrate
how to overcome the above limitations of classic RF by presenting a fully automatic segmentation
pipeline for myocardial segmentation in full-cycle 2D MCE data. Specifically, a statistical shape
model is used to provide shape prior information that guide the RF segmentation in two ways. First,
a novel shape model (SM) feature is incorporated into the RF framework to generate a more accurate
RF probability map. Second, the shape model is fitted to the RF probability map to refine and constrain
the final segmentation to plausible myocardial shapes. We further improve the performance by introducing
a bounding box detection algorithm as a preprocessing step in the segmentation pipeline. Our approach
on 2D image is further extended to 2D+t sequence which ensures temporal consistency in the resultant
sequence segmentations. When evaluated on clinical MCE data, our proposed method achieves notable
improvement in segmentation accuracy and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods including
the classic RF and its variants, active shape model and image registration.
