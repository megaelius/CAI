Estimation of patient-specific model parameters is important for personalized modeling, although
sparse and noisy clinical data can introduce significant uncertainty in the estimated parameter
values. This importance source of uncertainty, if left unquantified, will lead to unknown variability
in model outputs that hinder their reliable adoptions. Probabilistic estimation model parameters,
however, remains an unresolved challenge because standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling requires
repeated model simulations that are computationally infeasible. A common solution is to replace
the simulation model with a computationally-efficient surrogate for a faster sampling. However,
by sampling from an approximation of the exact posterior probability density function (pdf) of
the parameters, the efficiency is gained at the expense of sampling accuracy. In this paper, we address
this issue by integrating surrogate modeling into Metropolis Hasting (MH) sampling of the exact
posterior pdfs to improve its acceptance rate. It is done by first quickly constructing a Gaussian
process (GP) surrogate of the exact posterior pdfs using deterministic optimization. This efficient
surrogate is then used to modify commonly-used proposal distributions in MH sampling such that
only proposals accepted by the surrogate will be tested by the exact posterior pdf for acceptance/rejection,
reducing unnecessary model simulations at unlikely candidates. Synthetic and real-data experiments
using the presented method show a significant gain in computational efficiency without compromising
the accuracy. In addition, insights into the non-identifiability and heterogeneity of tissue
properties can be gained from the obtained posterior distributions.
