Leveraging massive numbers of sensors in user equipment as well as opportunistic human mobility,
mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, where prolonging battery life of
constrained devices and motivating human involvement are two key design challenges. To address
these, we envision a novel framework, named wirelessly powered crowd sensing (WPCS), which integrates
MCS with wireless power transfer (WPT) for supplying the involved devices with extra energy and
thus facilitating user incentivization. This paper considers a multiuser WPCS system where an
access point (AP) transfers energy to multiple mobile sensors (MSs), each of which performs data
sensing, compression, and transmission. Assuming lossless (data) compression, an optimization
problem is formulated to simultaneously maximize data utility and minimize energy consumption
at the operator side, by jointly controlling wireless-power allocation at the AP as well as sensing-data
sizes, compression ratios, and sensor-transmission durations at the MSs. Given fixed compression
ratios, the proposed optimal power allocation policy has the threshold-based structure with respect
to a defined crowd-sensing priority function for each MS depending on both the operator configuration
and the MS information. Further, for fixed sensing-data sizes, the optimal compression policy
suggests that compression can reduce the total energy consumption at each MS only if the sensing-data
size is sufficiently large. Our solution is also extended to the case of lossy compression, while
extensive simulations are offered to confirm the efficiency of the contributed mechanisms.
