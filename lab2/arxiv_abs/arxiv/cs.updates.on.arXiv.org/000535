The development of the works of the author about adaptive algorithms of teaching the robotic systems
with the help of operator is described here. An operator is assumed to be an experience decision-maker
and sane carrier of a target which the robotic system needs to achieve. The works characteristic
is that the behavior of the robotic system is not specified a priori (as standard) but is formed adaptively
based on the information about the situation and decisions made by a decision-maker. In this scheme
the robotic system and the decision-maker can cooperate in the normal operation mode of the robotic
system or in the time sharing mode with the possibility to plan actively the experiment on the robotic
system. If the adaptive scheme is chosen, there are teaching stages and operating stages of the robotic
system. At that the decision-maker can act slowly having the possibility to weigh the decision made.
This way allows the robotic system reacting flexibly by switching between preset models and respond
to the environment instability. The data integrity about the environment condition and about target
preferences of an operator plays a very important role in robotic system work. The effective work
of the robotic system depends on the effective settings of a preference model of the robotic system
based on the decisions of the decision-maker and on the effective control. The influence of settings
and control factors on the index of effectiveness of the robotic system is subject of this work. The
uncertainty may be caused by the data flow limitation received by the operator on the stage of the
model setting.
