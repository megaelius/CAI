This document is one of the deliverable reports created for the ESCAPE project. ESCAPE stands for
Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather Prediction at Exascale. The project develops
world-class, extreme-scale computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather
prediction and future climate models. This is done by identifying Weather & Climate dwarfs which
are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit of the Berkeley dwarfs).
These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware architectures (single and multi-node)
and alternative algorithms are explored. Performance portability is addressed through the use
of domain specific languages. Here we summarize the work performed on optimizations of the dwarfs
on CPUs, Xeon Phi, GPUs and on the Optalysys optical processor. We limit ourselves to a subset of the
dwarf configurations and to problem sizes small enough to execute on a single node. Also, we use time-to-solution
as the main performance metric. Multi-node optimizations of the dwarfs and energy-specific optimizations
are beyond the scope of this report and will be described in Deliverable D3.4. To cover the important
algorithmic motifs we picked dwarfs related to the dynamical core as well as column physics. Specifically,
we focused on the formulation relevant to spectral codes like ECMWF's IFS code. The main findings
of this report are: (a) Acceleration of 1.1x - 2.5x of the dwarfs on CPU based systems using compiler
directives, (b) order of magnitude acceleration of the dwarfs on GPUs (23x for spectral transform,
9x for MPDATA) using data locality optimizations and (c) demonstrated feasibility of a spectral
transform in a purely optical fashion.
