It is difficult to implement an efficient detection approach for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
and many factors contribute to this challenge. One such challenge concerns establishing adequate
boundaries and finding a proper data source. Typical IDS detection approaches deal with raw traffics.
These traffics need to be studied in depth and thoroughly investigated in order to extract the required
knowledge base. Another challenge involves implementing the binary decision. This is because
there are no reasonable limits between normal and attack traffics patterns. In this paper, we introduce
a novel idea capable of supporting the proper data source while avoiding the issues associated with
the binary decision. This paper aims to introduce a detection approach for defining abnormality
by using the Fuzzy Rule Interpolation (FRI) with Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management
Information Base (MIB) parameters. The strength of the proposed detection approach is based on
adapting the SNMP-MIB parameters with the FRI. This proposed method eliminates the raw traffic
processing component which is time consuming and requires extensive computational measures.
It also eliminates the need for a complete fuzzy rule based intrusion definition. The proposed approach
was tested and evaluated using an open source SNMP-MIB dataset and obtained a 93% detection rate.
Additionally, when compared to other literature in which the same test-bed environment was employed
along with the same number of parameters, the proposed detection approach outperformed the support
vector machine and neural network. Therefore, combining the SNMP-MIB parameters with the FRI based
reasoning could be beneficial for detecting intrusions, even in the case if the fuzzy rule based
intrusion definition is incomplete (not fully defined).
