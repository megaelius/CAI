The emergence of Cloud computing provides a new computing paradigm for scientific workflow execution.
It provides dynamic, on-demand and scalable resources that enable the processing of complex workflow-based
experiments. With the ever growing size of the experimental data and increasingly complex processing
workflows, the need for reproducibility has also become essential. Provenance has been thought
of a mechanism to verify a workflow and to provide workflow reproducibility. One of the obstacles
in reproducing an experiment execution is the lack of information about the execution infrastructure
in the collected provenance. This information becomes critical in the context of Cloud in which
resources are provisioned on-demand and by specifying resource configurations. Therefore, a
mechanism is required that enables capturing of infrastructure information along with the provenance
of workflows executing on the Cloud to facilitate the re-creation of execution environment on the
Cloud. This paper presents a framework, ReCAP, along with the proposed mapping approaches that
aid in capturing the Cloud-aware provenance information and help in re-provisioning the execution
resource on the Cloud with similar configurations. Experimental evaluation has shown the impact
of different resource configurations on the workflow execution performance, therefore justifies
the need for collecting such provenance information in the context of Cloud. The evaluation has
also demonstrated that the proposed mapping approaches can capture Cloud information in various
Cloud usage scenarios without causing performance overhead and can also enable the re-provisioning
of resources on Cloud. Experiments were conducted using workflows from different scientific domains
such as astronomy and neuroscience to demonstrate the applicability of this research for different
workflows.
