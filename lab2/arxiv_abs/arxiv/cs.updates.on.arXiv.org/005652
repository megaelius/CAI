Magnetic tapes have been playing a key role as means for storage of digital data for decades, and their
unsurpassed cost-effectiveness still make them the technology of choice in several industries,
such as media and entertainment. Tapes are mostly used for cold storage nowadays, and therefore
the study of scheduling algorithms for read requests tailored for these devices has been largely
neglected in the literature. In this article, we investigate the Linear Tape Scheduling Problem
(LTSP), in which read requests associated with files stored on a single-tracked magnetic tape should
be scheduled in a way that the sum of all response times are minimized. LTSP has many similarities
with classical combinatorial optimization problems such as the Traveling Repairmen Problem and
the Dial-a-Ride Problem restricted to the real line; nevertheless, significant differences on
structural properties and strict time-limit constraints of real-world scenarios make LTSP challenging
and interesting on its own. In this work, we investigate several properties and algorithms for LTSP
and some of its extensions. The results allowed for the identification of 3-approximation algorithms
for LTSP and efficient exact algorithms for some of its special cases. We also show that LTSPR, the
version of the problem with heterogeneous release times for requests, is NP-complete. OLTSP, the
online extension of LTSPR, does not admit c-competitive algorithms for any constant factor c, but
we nevertheless introduce an algorithm for the problem and show through extensive computational
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that different embodiments of the proposed strategy
are computationally efficient and over-perform by orders of magnitude an algorithm being currently
used by real-world tape file systems.
