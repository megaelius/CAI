Purpose: The standard clinical treatment of Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome consists in the
photo-coagulation of undesired anastomoses located on the placenta which are responsible to a
blood transfer between the two twins. While being the standard of care procedure, fetoscopy suffers
from a limited field-of-view of the placenta resulting in missed anastomoses. To facilitate the
task of the clinician, building a global map of the placenta providing a larger overview of the vascular
network is highly desired. Methods: To overcome the challenging visual conditions inherent to
in vivo sequences (low contrast, obstructions or presence of artifacts, among others), we propose
the following contributions: (i) robust pairwise registration is achieved by aligning the orientation
of the image gradients, and (ii) difficulties regarding long-range consistency (e.g. due to the
presence of outliers) is tackled via a bag-of-word strategy, which identifies overlapping frames
of the sequence to be registered regardless of their respective location in time. Results: In addition
to visual difficulties, in vivo sequences are characterised by the intrinsic absence of gold standard.
We present mosaics motivating qualitatively our methodological choices and demonstrating their
promising aspect. We also demonstrate semi-quantitatively, via visual inspection of registration
results, the efficacy of our registration approach in comparison to two standard baselines. Conclusion:
This paper proposes the first approach for the construction of mosaics of placenta in in vivo fetoscopy
sequences. Robustness to visual challenges during registration and long-range temporal consistency
are proposed, offering first positive results on in vivo data for which standard mosaicking techniques
are not applicable.
