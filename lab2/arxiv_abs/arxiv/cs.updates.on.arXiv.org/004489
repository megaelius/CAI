The Enterprise Ethereum Client Specification by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance defines the
requirements which Ethereum Clients offering private smart contract capabilities should comply
with. This specification though ground breaking, misses some important blockchain requirements
and does not fully consider the requirements of Ethereum Clients offering Private Sidechain capabilities.
This paper presents the case for Private Sidechains and defines requirements to be complied with
to deliver this technology. The capabilities of three blockchain clients have been analysed based
on the requirements: Quorum, Parity, and Hyperledger Fabric. Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric operate
as private consortium blockchains where as Parity delivers private transaction capabilities
on top of Ethereum MainNet. These differing approaches has led to different strengths and weaknesses
which has resulted in each client not complying with one or more key requirement. In particular,
none of the reviewed blockchain clients support the ability to determine bootstrap information
to establish on-demand blockchains and none of the clients support secure management and pinning
from Ethereum MainNet. This paper presents Ethereum Private Sidechains and a range of technologies
which allow it to deliver on complex sidechain requirements. Ethereum Registration Authorities
are presented, which allow entities which have not previously interacted to securely obtain information
to bootstrap a sidechain, and a Management and Pinning strategy is described which allows the state
of a sidechain to be securely pinned to Ethereum MainNet without compromising privacy.
