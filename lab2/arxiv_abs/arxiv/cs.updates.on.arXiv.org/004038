Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a standard imaging modality for assessing
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of death globally. CMR enables accurate quantification
of the cardiac chamber volume, ejection fraction and myocardial mass, providing information for
diagnosis and monitoring of CVDs. However, for years, clinicians have been relying on manual approaches
for CMR image analysis, which is time consuming and prone to subjective errors. It is a major clinical
challenge to automatically derive quantitative and clinically relevant information from CMR
images. Deep neural networks have shown a great potential in image pattern recognition and segmentation
for a variety of tasks. Here we demonstrate an automated analysis method for CMR images, which is
based on a fully convolutional network (FCN). The network is trained and evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from the UK Biobank, consisting of 4,875 subjects with 93,500 pixelwise annotated images.
The performance of the method has been evaluated using a number of technical metrics, including
the Dice metric, mean contour distance and Hausdorff distance, as well as clinically relevant measures,
including left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic volume (LVESV),
LV mass (LVM); right ventricle (RV) end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and end-systolic volume (RVESV).
By combining FCN with a large-scale annotated dataset, the proposed automated method achieves
a high performance on par with human experts in segmenting the LV and RV on short-axis CMR images and
the left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) on long-axis CMR images.
