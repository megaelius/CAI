3-D cross point phase change memory (PCM) is a promising emerging memory. However, dynamic performances
of 3-D cross point PCM are limited and the role of bias scheme is unknown. Previous studies on bias
schemes for planar memories use static analyses to assess static array performances. Here, a high
peak transient read current is found to result in a long read access time. Three factors which contribute
to the high peak read current are analyzed. The proposed 2V/3 bias scheme and a single-reference
parasitic-matching sensing circuit are utilized in a 64Mbit 3-D cross point PCM. The sensing time
is reduced by 22.5%. Designing bias schemes through dynamic analyses paves the way for the development
of high-performance 3-D PCM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems. The
following contents are the listed errors as mentioned in the comments for reasons of withdrawal:
missing labels of Fig.1, lack of the explanation of the peak current on the sensing speed, lack of
the reason of the chosen of 2V/3 scheme, lack of influence of the parasitic capacitors, unclear explanation
of the factor that contributes to a high peak read current, lack of comparisons, lack of the explanation
of the sneak current, lack of the explanations of the SRPM sensing circuit, lack of the define valuables
like NM_{A1}, unclear explanation of comparisons of the power consumption, wrong writing of the
two conventional circuits, writing of 3D-IC, wrong writing of number of memory layers, etc. These
errors may confuse a good understanding of our work. Therefore, we decide to withdraw this manuscript
from arXiv. We will significantly rewrite it and publish the correct and complete paper in the future.
