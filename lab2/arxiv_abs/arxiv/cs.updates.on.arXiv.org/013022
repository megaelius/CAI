Understanding how the D-Wave quantum computer could be used for machine learning problems is of
growing interest. Our work evaluates the feasibility of using the D-Wave as a sampler for machine
learning. We describe a hybrid system that combines a classical deep neural network autoencoder
with a quantum annealing Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using the D-Wave. We evaluate our hybrid
autoencoder algorithm using two datasets, the MNIST dataset and MNIST Fashion dataset. We evaluate
the quality of this method by using a downstream classification method where the training is based
on quantum RBM-generated samples. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the current 2000-qubit
D-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate typical problem
sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions and samples that are binary pixel representations.
As a consequence of these limitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression
factor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a lossy recovery of the original
28 x 28 grayscale images. We further show how generating samples from the D-Wave after training the
RBM, resulted in 28 x 28 images that were variations of the original input data distribution, as opposed
to recreating the training samples. We formulated an MNIST classification problem using a deep
convolutional neural network that used samples from a quantum RBM to train the MNIST classifier
and compared the results with an MNIST classifier trained with the original MNIST training data
set, as well as an MNIST classifier trained using classical RBM samples. Our hybrid autoencoder
approach indicates advantage for RBM results relative to the use of a current RBM classical computer
implementation for image-based machine learning and even more promising results for the next generation
D-Wave quantum system.
