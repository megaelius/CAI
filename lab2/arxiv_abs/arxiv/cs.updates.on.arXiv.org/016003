We recall that if $A$ is an invertible and symmetric real $m\times m$ matrix, then it is diagonalisable.
Therefore, if we denote by $\mathcal{E}^{+}(A)\subset \mathbb{R}^m$ (respectively $\mathcal{E}^{-}(A)\subset
\mathbb{R}^m$) to be the vector subspace generated by eigenvectors with positive eigenvalues
of $A$ (correspondingly the vector subspace generated by eigenvectors with negative eigenvalues
of $A$), then we have an orthogonal decomposition $\mathbb{R}^m=\mathcal{E}^{+}(A)\oplus \mathcal{E}^{-}(A)$.
Hence, every $x\in \mathbb{R}^m$ can be written uniquely as $x=pr_{A,+}(x)+pr_{A,-}(x)$ with
$pr_{A,+}(x)\in \mathcal{E}^{+}(A)$ and $pr_{A,-}(x)\in \mathcal{E}^{-}(A)$. We propose
the following simple new modification of quasi-Newton's methods. {\bf New Q-Newton's method.}
Let $\Delta =\{\delta _0,\delta _1,\delta _2,\ldots \}$ be a countable set of real numbers which
has at least $m+1$ elements. Let $f:\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a $C^2$ function.
Let $\alpha >0$. For each $x\in \mathbb{R}^m$ such that $\nabla f(x)\not=0$, let $\delta (x)=\delta
_j$, where $j$ is the smallest number so that $\nabla ^2f(x)+\delta _j||\nabla f(x)||^{1+\alpha}Id$
is invertible. (If $\nabla f(x)=0$, then we choose $\delta (x)=\delta _0$.) Let $x_0\in \mathbb{R}^m$
be an initial point. We define a sequence of $x_n\in \mathbb{R}^m$ and invertible and symmetric
$m\times m$ matrices $A_n$ as follows: $A_n=\nabla ^2f(x_n)+\delta (x_n) ||\nabla f(x_n)||^{1+\alpha}Id$
and $x_{n+1}=x_n-w_n$, where $w_n=pr_{A_n,+}(v_n)-pr_{A_n,-}(v_n)$ and $v_n=A_n^{-1}\nabla
f(x_n)$. The main result of this paper roughly says that if $f$ is $C^3$ and a sequence $\{x_n\}$,
constructed by the New Q-Newton's method from a random initial point $x_0$, {\bf converges}, then
the limit point is not a saddle point, and the convergence rate is the same as that of Newton's method.
