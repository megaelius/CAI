In recent years, SSDs have gained tremendous attention in computing and storage systems due to significant
performance improvement over HDDs. The cost per capacity of SSDs, however, prevents them from entirely
replacing HDDs in such systems. One approach to effectively take advantage of SSDs is to use them
as a caching layer to store performance critical data blocks to reduce the number of accesses to disk
subsystem. Due to characteristics of Flash-based SSDs such as limited write endurance and long
latency on write operations, employing caching algorithms at the Operating System (OS) level necessitates
to take such characteristics into consideration. Previous caching techniques are optimized towards
only one type of application, which affects both generality and applicability. In addition, they
are not adaptive when the workload pattern changes over time. This paper presents an efficient Reconfigurable
Cache Architecture (ReCA) for storage systems using a comprehensive workload characterization
to find an optimal cache configuration for I/O intensive applications. For this purpose, we first
investigate various types of I/O workloads and classify them into five major classes. Based on this
characterization, an optimal cache configuration is presented for each class of workloads. Then,
using the main features of each class, we continuously monitor the characteristics of an application
during system runtime and the cache organization is reconfigured if the application changes from
one class to another class of workloads. The cache reconfiguration is done online and workload classes
can be extended to emerging I/O workloads in order to maintain its efficiency with the characteristics
of I/O requests. Experimental results obtained by implementing ReCA in a server running Linux show
that the proposed architecture improves performance and lifetime up to 24\% and 33\%, respectively.
