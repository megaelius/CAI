Change detection is a basic task of remote sensing image processing. The research objective is to
identity the change information of interest and filter out the irrelevant change information as
interference factors. Recently, the rise of deep learning has provided new tools for change detection,
which have yielded impressive results. However, the available methods focus mainly on the difference
information between multitemporal remote sensing images and lack robustness to pseudo-change
information. To overcome the lack of resistance of current methods to pseudo-changes, in this paper,
we propose a new method, namely, dual attentive fully convolutional Siamese networks (DASNet)
for change detection in high-resolution images. Through the dual-attention mechanism, long-range
dependencies are captured to obtain more discriminant feature representations to enhance the
recognition performance of the model. Moreover, the imbalanced sample is a serious problem in change
detection, i.e. unchanged samples are much more than changed samples, which is one of the main reasons
resulting in pseudo-changes. We put forward the weighted double margin contrastive loss to address
this problem by punishing the attention to unchanged feature pairs and increase attention to changed
feature pairs. The experimental results of our method on the change detection dataset (CDD) and
the building change detection dataset (BCDD) demonstrate that compared with other baseline methods,
the proposed method realizes maximum improvements of 2.1\% and 3.6\%, respectively, in the F1 score.
