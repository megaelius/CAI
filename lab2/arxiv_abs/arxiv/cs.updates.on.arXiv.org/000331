Since radio signals carry both energy and information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has recently drawn a great deal of attention for
designing wireless powered communication networks. In this paper, we study a multiple-input single-output
(MISO) multicast SWIPT network with one multi-antenna transmitter sending common information
to multiple single-antenna receivers simultaneously along with opportunistic wireless energy
harvesting at each receiver. For the practical consideration, we assume that the channel state
information (CSI) is only known at each respective receiver but is unavailable at the transmitter.
We propose a novel receiver mode switching scheme for SWIPT based on a new application of the conventional
random beamforming technique at the multi-antenna transmitter, which generates artificial channel
fading to enable more efficient energy harvesting at each receiver when the channel power exceeds
a certain threshold. For the proposed scheme, we investigate the achievable information rate,
harvested average energy and/or energy outage probability, as well as their various trade-offs
in both AWGN and quasi-static fading channels. Compared to a reference scheme of periodic receiver
mode switching without random transmit beamforming, the proposed scheme is shown to be able to achieve
better rate-energy trade-offs when the harvested energy target is sufficiently large. Particularly,
it is revealed that employing one single random beam for the proposed scheme is asymptotically optimal
as the transmit power increases to infinity, and also performs the best with finite transmit power
for the high harvested energy regime of most practical interests, thus leading to an appealing low-complexity
implementation. Finally, we compare the rate-energy performances of the proposed scheme with
selected random beam designs.
