A variety of modeling techniques have been developed in the past decade to reduce the computational
expense and increase the calculation accuracy. In this study, the distinctive characteristic
compared to classical modeling models is "from image based model to mechanical based model (e.g.
stress, strain, and deformation)". In such framework, a neural network architecture named ReConNN
is proposed and the ReConNN mainly contains two neural networks that are CNN and GAN. A classical
topology optimization is considered as an experimental example, and the CNN is employed to construct
the mapping between contour images during topology optimization and compliance. Subsequently,
the GAN is utilized to generate more contour images to improve the reconstructed model. Finally,
the Lagrange polynomial is applied to complete the reconstruction. However, typical CNN architectures
are commonly applied to classification problems, which appear powerless handling with regression
of images for simulation problems. Meanwhile, the existing GAN architectures are insufficient
to generate high-accuracy "pseudo contour images". Therefore, a Convolution in Convolution (CIC)
architecture and a Convolutional AutoEncoder based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network
(WGAN-CAE) architecture are suggested. Specially, extensive experiments and comparisons with
existing architectures of CNN and GAN demonstrate that the CIC is highly accurate and corresponding
computational cost also can be significantly reduced when handling the regression problem of contour
images, and the WGAN-CAE achieves significant improvements on generating contour images. The
results demonstrate that the proposed ReConNN has a potential capability to reconstruct physical
field for further researches, e.g. optimization.
