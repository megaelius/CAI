Deep neural networks ( DNNs ) are becoming a key enabling technology for many application domains.
However, on-device inference on battery-powered, resource-constrained embedding systems is
often infeasible due to prohibitively long inferencing time and resource requirements of many
DNNs. Offloading computation into the cloud is often unacceptable due to privacy concerns, high
latency, or the lack of connectivity. While compression algorithms often succeed in reducing inferencing
times, they come at the cost of reduced accuracy. This paper presents a new, alternative approach
to enable efficient execution of DNNs on embedded devices. Our approach dynamically determines
which DNN to use for a given input, by considering the desired accuracy and inference time. It employs
machine learning to develop a low-cost predictive model to quickly select a pre-trained DNN to use
for a given input and the optimization constraint. We achieve this by first off-line training a predictive
model, and then using the learned model to select a DNN model to use for new, unseen inputs. We apply
our approach to two representative DNN domains: image classification and machine translation.
We evaluate our approach on a Jetson TX2 embedded deep learning platform and consider a range of influential
DNN models including convolutional and recurrent neural networks. For image classification,
we achieve a 1.8x reduction in inference time with a 7.52% improvement in accuracy, over the most-capable
single DNN model. For machine translation, we achieve a 1.34x reduction in inference time over the
most-capable single model, with little impact on the quality of translation.
