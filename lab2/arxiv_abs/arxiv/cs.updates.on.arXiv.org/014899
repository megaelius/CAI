Smart Cities evolve into complex and pervasive urban environments with a citizens' mandate to meet
sustainable development goals. Repositioning democratic values of citizens' choices in these
complex ecosystems has turned out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake
news and opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper introduces
a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed
decision-making augmented to public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital
revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble
to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of
the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject
of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows
how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower
citizens' trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel
platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart
Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens' choices can be made in fully
decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized
system for crowd-sensing the use sustainable transport means. Furthermore, witness presence
of cycling risk is validated using wisdom of the crowd evidence against official accident data from
public authorities. The paramount role of dynamic consensus, self-governance and ethically aligned
artificial intelligence in the augmented democracy paradigm is outlined.
