A revised version of this article is now available at Human Brain Mapping, see this http URL . Deep
learning with convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) has revolutionized computer vision
through end-to-end learning, i.e. learning from the raw data. Now, there is increasing interest
in using deep ConvNets for end-to-end EEG analysis. However, little is known about many important
aspects of how to design and train ConvNets for end-to-end EEG decoding, and there is still a lack
of techniques to visualize the informative EEG features the ConvNets learn. Here, we studied deep
ConvNets with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executed movements
from raw EEG. Our results show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch
normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted
the deep ConvNets decoding performance, reaching or surpassing that of the widely-used filter
bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) decoding algorithm. While FBCSP is designed to use spectral
power modulations, the features used by ConvNets are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing
the learned features demonstrated that ConvNets indeed learned to use spectral power modulations
in the alpha, beta and high gamma frequencies. These methods also proved useful as a technique for
spatially mapping the learned features, revealing the topography of the causal contributions
of features in different frequency bands to decoding the movement classes. Our study thus shows
how to design and train ConvNets to decode movement-related information from the raw EEG without
handcrafted features and highlights the potential of deep ConvNets combined with advanced visualization
techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.
