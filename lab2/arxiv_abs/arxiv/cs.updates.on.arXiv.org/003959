In this paper, a novel concept of three-dimensional (3D) cellular networks, that integrate drone
base stations (drone-BS) and cellular-connected drone users (drone-UEs), is introduced. For
this new 3D cellular architecture, a novel framework for network planning for drone-BSs as well
as latency-minimal cell association for drone-UEs is proposed. For network planning, a tractable
method for drone-BSs' deployment based on the notion of truncated octahedron shapes is proposed
that ensures full coverage for a given space with minimum number of drone-BSs. In addition, to characterize
frequency planning in such 3D wireless networks, an analytical expression for the feasible integer
frequency reuse factors is derived. Subsequently, an optimal 3D cell association scheme is developed
for which the drone-UEs' latency, considering transmission, computation, and backhaul delays,
is minimized. To this end, first, the spatial distribution of the drone-UEs is estimated using a
kernel density estimation method, and the parameters of the estimator are obtained using a cross-validation
method. Then, according to the spatial distribution of drone-UEs and the locations of drone-BSs,
the latency-minimal 3D cell association for drone-UEs is derived by exploiting tools from optimal
transport theory. Simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the latency of drone-UEs
compared to the classical cell association approach that uses a signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) criterion. In particular, the proposed approach yields a reduction of up to 46% in the
average latency compared to the SINR-based association. The results also show that the proposed
latency-optimal cell association improves the spectral efficiency of a 3D wireless cellular network
of drones.
