Expert finding is an important task in both industry and academia. It is challenging to rank candidates
with appropriate expertise for various queries. In addition, different types of objects interact
with one another, which naturally forms heterogeneous information networks. We study the task
of expert finding in heterogeneous bibliographical networks based on two aspects: textual content
analysis and authority ranking. Regarding the textual content analysis, we propose a new method
for query expansion via locally-trained embedding learning with concept hierarchy as guidance,
which is particularly tailored for specific queries with narrow semantic meanings. Compared with
global embedding learning, locally-trained embedding learning projects the terms into a latent
semantic space constrained on relevant topics, therefore it preserves more precise and subtle
information for specific queries. Considering the candidate ranking, the heterogeneous information
network structure, while being largely ignored in the previous studies of expert finding, provides
additional information. Specifically, different types of interactions among objects play different
roles. We propose a ranking algorithm to estimate the authority of objects in the network, treating
each strongly-typed edge type individually. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, we apply the proposed method to a large-scale bibliographical dataset with over two
million entries and one million researcher candidates. The experiment results show that the proposed
framework outperforms existing methods for both general and specific queries.
