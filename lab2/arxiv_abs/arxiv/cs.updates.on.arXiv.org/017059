We present a novel method for learning from demonstration 6-D tasks that can be modeled as a sequence
of linear motions and compliances. The focus of this paper is the learning of a single linear primitive,
many of which can be sequenced to perform more complex tasks. The presented method learns from demonstrations
only, without any prior information, how to take advantage of mechanical gradients in in-contact
tasks, such as assembly, both for translations and rotations. The method assumes there exists a
desired linear direction in 6-D which, if followed by the manipulator, leads the robot's end-effector
to the goal area shown in the demonstration, either in free space or by leveraging contact through
compliance. First, demonstrations are gathered where the teacher explicitly shows the robot how
the mechanical gradients can be used as guidance towards the goal. From the demonstrations, a set
of directions is computed which would result in the observed motion at each timestep during a demonstration
of a single primitive. By observing which direction is included in all these sets, we find a single
desired direction which can reproduce the demonstrated motion. Finding the number of compliant
axes and their directions in both rotation and translation is based on the assumption that in the
presence of a desired direction of motion, all other observed motion is caused by the contact force
of the environment, signalling the need for compliance. We evaluate the method on a KUKA LWR4+ robot
with test setups imitating typical tasks where a human would use compliance to cope with positional
uncertainty. Results show that the method can successfully learn and reproduce compliant motions
by taking advantage of the geometry of the task, therefore reducing the need for localization accuracy.
