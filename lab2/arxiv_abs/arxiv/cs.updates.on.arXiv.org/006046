In warehouse-scale cloud datacenters, co-locating online services and offline batch jobs is an
efficient approach to improving datacenter utilization. To better facilitate the understanding
of interactions among the co-located workloads and their real-world operational demands, Alibaba
recently released a cluster usage and co-located workload dataset, which is the first publicly
dataset with precise information about the category of each job. In this paper, we perform a deep
analysis on the released Alibaba workload dataset, from the perspective of anomaly analysis and
diagnosis. Through data preprocessing, node similarity analysis based on Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW), co-located workloads characteristics analysis and anomaly analysis based on iForest,
we reveals several insights including: (1) The performance discrepancy of machines in Alibaba's
production cluster is relatively large, for the distribution and resource utilization of co-located
workloads is not balanced. For instance, the resource utilization (especially memory utilization)
of batch jobs is fluctuating and not as stable as that of online containers, and the reason is that
online containers are long-running jobs with more memory-demanding and most batch jobs are short
jobs, (2) Based on the distribution of co-located workload instance numbers, the machines can be
classified into 8 workload distribution categories1. And most patterns of machine resource utilization
curves are similar in the same workload distribution category. (3) In addition to the system failures,
unreasonable scheduling and workload imbalance are the main causes of anomalies in Alibaba's cluster.
