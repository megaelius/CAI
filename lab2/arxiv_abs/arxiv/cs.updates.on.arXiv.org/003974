Some of the main challenges towards utilizing conventional cryptographic techniques in Internet
of Things (IoT) include the need for generating secret keys for such a large-scale network, distributing
the generated keys to all the devices, key storage as well as the vulnerability to security attacks
when an adversary gets physical access to the devices. In this paper, a novel secret key generation
method is proposed for IoTs that utilize the intrinsic randomness embedded in the devices' memories
introduced in the manufacturing process. A fuzzy extractor structure using serially concatenated
BCH-Polar codes is proposed to generate reproducible keys from a ReRAM-based \emph{ternary-state}
Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for device authentication and secret key generation. The
ReRAM based PUFs are the most practical choice for authentication and key generation in IoT, as they
operate at or below the systems' noise level and therefore are less vulnerable to side channel attacks
compared to the alternative memory technologies. However, the current ReRAM-based PUFs present
a high false negative authentication rate since the behavior of these devices can vary in different
physical conditions that results in a low probability of regenerating the same response in different
attempts. In this paper, we propose a secret key generation scheme for ternary state PUFs that enables
reliable reconstruction of the desired secret keys utilizing a serially concatenated BCH-Polar
fuzzy extractor. The experimental results show that the proposed model can offer a significantly
lower probability of mismatch between the original key and the regenerated ones, while a less number
of \textit{Helper data} bits were used to extract the \textit{Key} when compared to previously
proposed fuzzy extractor techniques.
