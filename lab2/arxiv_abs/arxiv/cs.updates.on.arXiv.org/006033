Random via failure is a major concern for post-fabrication reliability and poor manufacturing
yield. A demanding solution to this problem is redundant via insertion during post-routing optimization.
It becomes very critical when a multi-layer routing solution already incurs a large number of vias.
Very few global routers addressed unconstrained via minimization (UVM) problem, while using minimal
pattern routing and layer assignment of nets. It also includes a recent floorplan based early global
routability assessment tool STAIRoute \cite{karb2}. This work addresses an early version of unconstrained
via minimization problem during early global routing by identifying a set of minimal bend routing
regions in any floorplan, by a new recursive bipartitioning framework. These regions facilitate
monotone pattern routing of a set of nets in the floorplan by STAIRoute. The area/number balanced
floorplan bipartitionining is a multi-objective optimization problem and known to be NP-hard
\cite{majum2}. No existing approaches considered bend minimization as an objective and some of
them incurred higher runtime overhead. In this paper, we present a Greedy as well as randomized neighbor
search based staircase wave-front propagation methods for obtaining optimal bipartitioning
results for minimal bend routing through multiple routing layers, for a balanced trade-off between
routability, wirelength and congestion. Experiments were conducted on MCNC/GSRC floorplanning
benchmarks for studying the variation of early via count obtained by STAIRoute for different values
of the trade-off parameters ($\gamma, \beta$) in this multi-objective optimization problem,
using $8$ metal layers. We studied the impact of ($\gamma, \beta$) values on each of the objectives
as well as their linear combination function $Gain$ of these objectives.
