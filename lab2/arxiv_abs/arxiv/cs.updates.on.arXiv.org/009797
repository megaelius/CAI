Data sharing among multiple parties becomes increasingly common today, so is the potential for
data leakage. As required by new data protection regulations and laws, when data leakage occurs,
one must be able to reliably identify the leaking party. Existing solutions utilize watermark technology
or data object allocation strategy to differentiate the data shared with different parties to identify
potential leakers. However the differentiation loses its effectiveness under several attacks,
including injecting noise into the data copy to weaken the differentiation, or denying the reception
of certain shared data. Worse yet, multiple parties might collude and apply a set of operations such
as intersection, complement, and union to the shared dataset before leaking it, making leaker identification
more difficult. In this paper, we propose ActShare, a systematic solution to provide reliable leaking
source identification for leakages of identifiable information. ActShare takes advantage of
the intrinsic properties of identifiable data and allocates data objects to individual sharing
parties by identifying attributes, uses oblivious data transfer between the sender and receivers,
and employs an immutable ledger to log all data sharing operations. A knowledge-based identification
algorithm is proposed in ActShare to identify leakers in data leakage. Our evaluation shows that,
with a modest amount of leaked data, ActShare can accurately (with accuracy > 99%) and undeniably
identify the guilty party(s) in cases of non-collusive leakage, or collusive leakage by any number
of data receivers, or even leakage by the data sender.
