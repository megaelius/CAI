Background: Pharmacokinetic evaluation is one of the key processes in drug discovery and development.
However, current absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion prediction models still have
limited accuracy. Aim: This study aims to construct an integrated transfer learning and multitask
learning approach for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship models to predict
four human pharmacokinetic parameters. Methods: A pharmacokinetic dataset included 1104 U.S.
FDA approved small molecule drugs. The dataset included four human pharmacokinetic parameter
subsets (oral bioavailability, plasma protein binding rate, apparent volume of distribution
at steady-state and elimination half-life). The pre-trained model was trained on over 30 million
bioactivity data. An integrated transfer learning and multitask learning approach was established
to enhance the model generalization. Results: The pharmacokinetic dataset was split into three
parts (60:20:20) for training, validation and test by the improved Maximum Dissimilarity algorithm
with the representative initial set selection algorithm and the weighted distance function. The
multitask learning techniques enhanced the model predictive ability. The integrated transfer
learning and multitask learning model demonstrated the best accuracies, because deep neural networks
have the general feature extraction ability, transfer learning and multitask learning improved
the model generalization. Conclusions: The integrated transfer learning and multitask learning
approach with the improved dataset splitting algorithm was firstly introduced to predict the pharmacokinetic
parameters. This method can be further employed in drug discovery and development.
