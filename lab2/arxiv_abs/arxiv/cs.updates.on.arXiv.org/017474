Two decades of U.S. government legislative outcomes, as well as the policy preferences of rich people,
the general population, and diverse interest groups, were captured in a detailed dataset curated
and analyzed by Gilens, Page et al. (2014). They found that the preferences of the rich correlated
strongly with policy outcomes, while the preferences of the general population did not, except
via a linkage with rich people's preferences. Their analysis applied the tools of classical statistical
inference, in particular logistic regression. In this paper we analyze the Gilens dataset using
the complementary tools of Random Forest classifiers (RFs), from Machine Learning. We present
two primary findings, concerning respectively prediction and inference: (i) Holdout test sets
can be predicted with approximately 70% balanced accuracy by models that consult only the preferences
of rich people and a small number of powerful interest groups, as well as policy area labels. These
results include retrodiction, where models trained on pre-1997 cases predicted "future" (post-1997)
cases. The 20% gain in accuracy over baseline (chance), in this detailed but noisy dataset, indicates
the high importance of a few wealthy players in U.S. policy outcomes, and aligns with a body of research
indicating that the U.S. government has significant plutocratic tendencies. (ii) The feature
selection methods of RF models identify especially salient subsets of interest groups (economic
players). These can be used to further investigate the dynamics of governmental policy making,
and also offer an example of the potential value of RF feature selection methods for inference on
datasets such as this.
