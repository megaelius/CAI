Edge computing is the practice of placing computing resources at the edges of the Internet in close
proximity to devices and information sources. This, much like a cache on a CPU, increases bandwidth
and reduces latency for applications but at a potential cost of dependability and capacity. This
is because these edge devices are often not as well maintained, dependable, powerful, or robust
as centralized server-class cloud resources. This article explores dependability and deployment
challenges in the field of edge computing, what aspects are solvable with today's technology, and
what aspects call for new solutions. The first issue addressed is failures, both hard (crash, hang,
etc.) and soft (performance-related), and real-time constraint violation. In this domain, edge
computing bolsters real-time system capacity through reduced end-to-end latency. However, much
like cache misses, overloaded or malfunctioning edge computers can drive latency beyond tolerable
limits. Second, decentralized management and device tampering can lead to chain of trust and security
or privacy violations. Authentication, access control, and distributed intrusion detection
techniques have to be extended from current cloud deployments and need to be customized for the edge
ecosystem. The third issue deals with handling multi-tenancy in the typically resource-constrained
edge devices and the need for standardization to allow for interoperability across vendor products.
We explore the key challenges in each of these three broad issues as they relate to dependability
of edge computing and then hypothesize about promising avenues of work in this area.
