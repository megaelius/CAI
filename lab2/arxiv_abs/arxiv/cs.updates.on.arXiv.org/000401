A monotone CNF formula is a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form where each variable appears
positively. We design a deterministic fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for
counting the number of satisfying assignments for a given monotone CNF formula when each variable
appears in at most $5$ clauses. Equivalently, our algorithm can also be interpreted as an FPTAS for
counting the number of set covers when each set contains at most $5$ elements. If we allow variables
to appear in a maximum of $6$ clauses (or sets to contain $6$ elements), it is NP-hard to approximate
it. Thus, this gives a complete understanding of the approximability of counting for monotone CNF
formulas. It is also an important step towards a complete characterization of the approximability
for all bounded degree Boolean $#CSP$ problems. In addition, we design an FPTAS for another interesting
counting CSP problem, which can be viewed as a generalization of matching. Our main technique is
correlation decay, a powerful tool to design deterministic FPTAS for counting problems defined
by local constraints among a number of variables. All previous uses of this design technique fall
into two categories: each constraint involves at most two variables, such as independent set, coloring,
and spin systems in general; or each variable appears in at most two constraints, such as matching,
edge cover, and holant problem in general. The CNF and CSP problems studied here have more complicated
structures than these problems and require new design and proof techniques. The techniques developed
here may find applications in other CSP or more general counting problems.
