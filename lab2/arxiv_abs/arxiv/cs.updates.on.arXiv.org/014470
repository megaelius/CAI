We propose a dimension reduction framework for feature extraction and moment reconstruction in
dynamical systems that operates on spaces of probability measures induced by observables of the
system rather than directly in the original data space of the observables themselves as in more conventional
methods. Our approach is based on the fact that orbits of a dynamical system induce probability measures
over the measurable space defined by (partial) observations of the system. We equip the space of
these probability measures with a divergence, i.e., a distance between probability distributions,
and use this divergence to define a kernel integral operator. The eigenfunctions of this operator
create an orthonormal basis of functions that capture different timescales of the dynamical system.
One of our main results shows that the evolution of the moments of the dynamics-dependent probability
measures can be related to a time-averaging operator on the original dynamical system. Using this
result, we show that the moments can be expanded in the eigenfunction basis, thus opening up the avenue
for nonparametric forecasting of the moments. If the collection of probability measures is itself
a manifold, we can in addition equip the statistical manifold with the Riemannian metric and use
techniques from information geometry. We present applications to ergodic dynamical systems on
the 2-torus and the Lorenz 63 system, and show on a real-world example that a small number of eigenvectors
is sufficient to reconstruct the moments (here the first four moments) of an atmospheric time series,
i.e., the realtime multivariate Madden-Julian oscillation index.
