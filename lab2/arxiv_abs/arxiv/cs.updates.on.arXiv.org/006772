Among the problems to guarantee secrecy for in-transit information, the difficulties involved
in renewing cryptographic keys in a secure way using couriers, the perfect secrecy encryption method
known as One-Time-Pad (OTP) became almost obsolete. Pure quantum key distribution (QKD) ideally
offers security for key distribution and could revive OTP. However, special networks that may need
optical fibers, satellite, relay stations, expensive detection equipment compared with telecom
technology and the slow protocol offer powerful obstacles for widespread use of QKD. Classical
encryption methods flood the secure communication landscape. Many of them rely its security on
historical difficulties such as factoring of large numbers -- their alleged security sometimes
are presented as the difficulty to brake encryption by brute force. The possibility for a mathematical
breakthrough that could make factoring trivial are poorly discussed. This work proposes a solution
to bring perfect secrecy to in-transit communication and without the above problems. It shows the
key distribution scheme (nicknamed KeyBITS Platform) based on classical signals carrying information
but that carry with them recordings of quantum noise. Legitimate users start with a shared information
of the coding bases used that gives them an information advantage that allows easy signal recovery.
The recorded noise protects the legitimate users and block the attacker's access. This shared information
is refreshed at the end of each batch of keys sent providing the secret shared information for the
next round. With encryption keys distilled from securely transmitted signals at each round OTP
can be revived and at fast speeds.
