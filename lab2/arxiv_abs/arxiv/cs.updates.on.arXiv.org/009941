Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) detection using computerized methods is an emerging research area with
the evolution of machine learning algorithms. However, existing research focuses on detecting
and segmenting the ulcers. According to DFU medical classification systems, i.e. University of
Texas Classification and SINBAD Classification, the presence of infection (bacteria in the wound)
and ischaemia (inadequate blood supply) has important clinical implication for DFU assessment,
which were used to predict the risk of amputation. In this work, we propose a new dataset and novel
techniques to identify the presence of infection and ischaemia. We introduce a very comprehensive
DFU dataset with ground truth labels of ischaemia and infection cases. For hand-crafted machine
learning approach, we propose new feature descriptor, namely Superpixel Color Descriptor. Then,
we propose a technique using Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for ischaemia and
infection recognition. The novelty lies in our proposed natural data-augmentation method, which
clearly identifies the region of interest on foot images and focuses on finding the salient features
existing in this area. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed techniques on binary
classification, i.e. ischaemia versus non-ischaemia and infection versus non-infection. Overall,
our proposed method performs better in the classification of ischaemia than infection. We found
that our proposed Ensemble CNN deep learning algorithms performed better for both classification
tasks than hand-crafted machine learning algorithms, with 90% accuracy in ischaemia classification
and 73% in infection classification.
