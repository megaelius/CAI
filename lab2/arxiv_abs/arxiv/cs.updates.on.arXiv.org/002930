In the absence of external reference position information (e.g. GNSS) SLAM has proven to be an effective
method for indoor navigation. The positioning drift can be reduced with regular loop-closures
and global relaxation as the backend, thus achieving a good balance between exploration and exploitation.
Although vision-based systems like laser scanners are typically deployed for SLAM, these sensors
are heavy, energy inefficient, and expensive, making them unattractive for wearables or smartphone
applications. However, the concept of SLAM can be extended to non-optical systems such as magnetometers.
Instead of matching features such as walls and furniture using some variation of the ICP algorithm,
the local magnetic field can be matched to provide loop-closure and global trajectory updates in
a Gaussian Process (GP) SLAM framework. With a MEMS-based inertial measurement unit providing
a continuous trajectory, and the matching of locally distinct magnetic field maps, experimental
results in this paper show that a drift-free navigation solution in an indoor environment with millimetre-level
accuracy can be achieved. The GP-SLAM approach presented can be formulated as a maximum a posteriori
estimation problem and it can naturally perform loop-detection, feature-to-feature distance
minimization, global trajectory optimization, and magnetic field map estimation simultaneously.
Spatially continuous features (i.e. smooth magnetic field signatures) are used instead of discrete
feature correspondences (e.g. point-to-point) as in conventional vision-based SLAM. These position
updates from the ambient magnetic field also provide enough information for calibrating the accelerometer
and gyroscope bias in-use. The only restriction for this method is the need for magnetic disturbances
(which is typically not an issue indoors); however, no assumptions are required for the general
motion of the sensor.
