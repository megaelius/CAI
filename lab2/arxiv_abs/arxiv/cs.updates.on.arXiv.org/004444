Lower extremity exoskeleton has been developed as a motion assistive technology in recent years.
Walking pattern generation is a fundamental topic in the design of these robots. The usual approach
with most exoskeletons is to use a pre-recorded pattern as a look-up table. There are some deficiencies
with this method, including data storage limitation and poor regulation relating to the walking
parameters. Therefore modeling human walking patterns to use in exoskeletons is required. The
few existing models provide piece by piece walking patterns, only generating at the beginning of
each stride cycle in respect to fixed walking parameters. In this paper, we present a real-time walking
pattern generation method which enables changing the walking parameters during the stride. For
this purpose, two feedback controlled third order systems are proposed as optimal trajectory planners
for generating the trajectory of the x and y components of each joints position. The boundary conditions
of the trajectories are obtained according to some pre-considered walking constraints. In addition,
a cost function is intended for each trajectory planner in order to increase the trajectories smoothness.
We use the minimum principle of Pontryagin to design the feedback controller in order to track the
boundary conditions in such a way that the cost functions are minimized. Finally, by using inverse
kinematics equations, the proper joints angles are generated for and implemented on Exoped robot.
The good performance of the gait planner is demonstrated by second derivative continuity of the
trajectories being maintained as a result of a simulation, and user satisfaction being determined
by experimental testing.
