Since the inception of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology have
attracted an increasing interest from both academia and industry. Among various core components,
consensus protocol is the defining technology behind the security and performance of blockchain.
From incremental modifications of Nakamoto consensus protocol to innovative alternative consensus
mechanisms, many consensus protocols have been proposed to improve the performance of the blockchain
network itself or to accommodate other specific application needs. In this survey, we present a
comprehensive review and analysis on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. To
facilitate the discussion of our analysis, we first introduce the key definitions and relevant
results in the classic theory of fault tolerance which helps to lay the foundation for further discussion.
We identify five core components in a blockchain, namely, block proposal, block validation, information
propagation, block finalization, and incentive mechanism. A wide spectrum of blockchain consensus
protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic abstractions and vulnerability
analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are analyzed using the five-component framework and
compared with respect to different performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons provide
us new insights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their suitable application
scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance, scalability, drawbacks and trade-offs.
We believe this survey will provide blockchain developers and researchers a comprehensive view
on the state-of-the-art consensus protocols and facilitate the process of designing future protocols.
