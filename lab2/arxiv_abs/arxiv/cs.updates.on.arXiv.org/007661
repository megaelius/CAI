In 2015, the CCC co-sponsored an industry round table that produced the document "The Future of Computing
Research: Industry-Academic Collaborations". Since then, several important trends in computing
research have emerged, and this document considers how those trends impact the interaction between
academia and industry in computing fields. We reach the following conclusions: - In certain computing
disciplines, such as currently artificial intelligence, we observe significant increases in
the level of interaction between professors and companies, which take the form of extended joint
appointments. - Increasingly, companies are highly motivated to engage both professors and graduate
students working in specific technical areas because companies view computing research and technical
talent as a core aspect of their business success. - This increasing connection between faculty,
students, and companies has the potential to change (either positively or negatively) numerous
things, including: the academic culture in computing research universities, the research topics
that faculty and students pursue, the ability of universities to train undergraduate and graduate
students, how companies and universities cooperate, share, and interact - This report outlines
areas of further investigation to help direct the computing research community to achieve the maximum
benefits from these changes and minimize the negative outcomes. - We actively seek input from all
the constituencies that can influence and are affected by these changes including industry, universities,
and government agencies and in the roles of students, professors, industry representatives, and
administrators.
