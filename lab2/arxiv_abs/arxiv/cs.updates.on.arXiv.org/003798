Providing network connectivity to mobile users is a key requirement for cellular wireless networks.
User mobility impacts network performance as well as user perceived service quality. For efficient
network dimensioning and optimization, it is therefore required to characterize the mobility-aware
network performance metrics such as the handoff rate, handoff probability, sojourn time, direction
switch rate, and users' throughput or coverage. This characterization is particularly challenging
for heterogeneous, dense/ultra-dense, and random cellular networks such as the emerging 5G and
beyond 5G (B5G) networks. In this article, we provide a tutorial on mobility-aware performance
analysis of both the spatially random and non-random, single-tier and multi-tier cellular networks.
We first provide a summary of the different mobility models which include purely random models,
spatially correlated, and temporally correlated models. The differences among various mobility
models, their statistical properties, and their pros and cons are presented. We then describe two
main analytical approaches for mobility-aware performance analysis of both random and non-random
cellular networks. For the first approach, we describe a general methodology and present several
case studies for different cellular network tessellations such as square lattice, hexagon lattice,
single-tier and multi-tier models in which base-stations (BSs) follow a homogeneous Poisson Point
Process (PPP). For the second approach, we also outline the general methodology. In addition, we
discuss some limitations/imperfections of the existing techniques and provide corrections to
these imperfections. Finally, we point out specific 5G application scenarios where the impact
of mobility would be significant and outline the challenges associated with mobility-aware analysis
of those scenarios.
