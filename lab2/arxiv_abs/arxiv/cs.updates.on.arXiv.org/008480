Differential privacy has seen remarkable success as a rigorous and practical formalization of
data privacy in the past decade. This privacy definition and its divergence based relaxations,
however, have several acknowledged weaknesses, either in handling composition of private algorithms
or in analyzing important primitives like privacy amplification by subsampling. Inspired by the
hypothesis testing formulation of privacy, this paper proposes a new relaxation, which we term
`$f$-differential privacy' ($f$-DP). This notion of privacy has a number of appealing properties
and, in particular, avoids difficulties associated with divergence based relaxations. First,
$f$-DP preserves the hypothesis testing interpretation. In addition, $f$-DP allows for lossless
reasoning about composition in an algebraic fashion. Moreover, we provide a powerful technique
to import existing results proven for original DP to $f$-DP and, as an application, obtain a simple
subsampling theorem for $f$-DP. In addition to the above findings, we introduce a canonical single-parameter
family of privacy notions within the $f$-DP class that is referred to as `Gaussian differential
privacy' (GDP), defined based on testing two shifted Gaussians. GDP is focal among the $f$-DP class
because of a central limit theorem we prove. More precisely, the privacy guarantees of \emph{any}
hypothesis testing based definition of privacy (including original DP) converges to GDP in the
limit under composition. The CLT also yields a computationally inexpensive tool for analyzing
the exact composition of private algorithms. Taken together, this collection of attractive properties
render $f$-DP a mathematically coherent, analytically tractable, and versatile framework for
private data analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the tools we develop by giving an improved
privacy analysis of noisy stochastic gradient descent.
