Sequential experiments are often designed to strike a balance between maximizing immediate payoffs
based on available information, and acquiring new information that is essential for maximizing
future payoffs. This trade-off is captured by the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework that has been
studied and applied, typically when at each time epoch feedback is received only on the action that
was selected at that epoch. However, in many practical settings, including product recommendations,
dynamic pricing, retail management, and health care, additional information may become available
between decision epochs. We introduce a generalized MAB formulation in which auxiliary information
may appear arbitrarily over time. By obtaining matching lower and upper bounds, we characterize
the minimax complexity of this family of problems as a function of the information arrival process,
and study how salient characteristics of this process impact policy design and achievable performance.
We establish that while Thompson sampling and UCB policies leverage additional information naturally,
policies with exogenous exploration rate may not exhibit such robustness. We introduce a virtual
time indexes method for dynamically controlling the exploration rate of such policies, and apply
it for designing $\varepsilon_t$-greedy-type policies that, without any prior knowledge on the
information arrival process, attain the best performance (in terms of regret rate) that is achievable
when the information arrival process is a priori known. We use data from a large media site to analyze
the value that may be captured in practice by leveraging auxiliary information for designing content
recommendations.
