Hyperledger Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating
permissioned blockchains. Fabric is currently used in more than 400 prototypes and proofs-of-concept
of distributed ledger technology, as well as several production systems, across different industries
and use cases. Starting from the premise that there are no "one-size-fits-all" solutions, Fabric
is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports
modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and
trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written
in general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency.
This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain platforms for running smart contracts that
require code to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Furthermore,
it uses a portable notion of membership for realizing the permissioned model, which may be integrated
with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric takes a novel
approach to the design of a permissioned blockchain and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism,
resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture,
the rationale behind various design decisions, its security model and guarantees, its most prominent
implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further
evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show
that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain
popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency.
