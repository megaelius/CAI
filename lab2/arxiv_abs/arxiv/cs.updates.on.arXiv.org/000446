The fuzzy vault scheme is one of the most popular primitives used in biometric cryptosystems. Dodis
et al. proposed an improved version that require less storage and leak less information on the protected
features. It has been recently shown by Blanton and Aliasgari that, if several instances (vault
records) of the improved fuzzy vault scheme from the same individual are available, their relation
may be determined by solving a system of non-linear equations. However, the question whether these
equations can be solved efficiently has not been answered yet. In this paper, we present a new attack
against the improved fuzzy vault scheme based on the extended Euclidean algorithm that efficiently
solves the equations established by Blanton and Aliasgari; thereby, our attack can determine,
if two records are related, and recover the elements by which the protected features, e.g., the biometric
templates, differ. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that the attack is effective
for parameters that we expect to encounter in practice. Furthermore, we show, how this attack can
be extended to fully recover both feature sets from two related vault records much more efficiently
than possible by attacking each record individually. We complement this work by deriving lower
bounds for record multiplicity attacks and use these to show that our attack is asymptotically optimal
in an information theoretic sense. Finally, we propose remedies that harden the scheme against
record multiplicity attacks. Our work strengthens the notion of Blanton and Aliasgari that, additional
countermeasures are necessary in order to allow secure reuse of the improved fuzzy vault scheme.
