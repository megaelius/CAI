LTE/LTE-Advanced networks are known to be vulnerable to denial-of-service and loss-of-service
attacks from smart jammers. In this article, the interaction between a smart jammer and LTE network
is modeled as an infinite-horizon, zero-sum, asymmetric repeated game. The smart jammer and eNode
B are modeled as the informed and the uninformed player, respectively. The main purpose of this article
is to construct efficient suboptimal strategies for both players that can be used to solve the above-mentioned
infinite-horizon repeated game with asymmetric and incomplete information. It has been shown
in game-theoretic literature that security strategies provide optimal solution in zero-sum games.
It is also shown that both players' security strategies in an infinite-horizon asymmetric game
depend only on the history of the informed player's actions. However, fixed-sized sufficient statistics
are needed for both players to solve the above-mentioned game efficiently. The smart jammer uses
its evolving belief state as the fixed-sized sufficient statistics for the repeated game. Whereas,
the LTE network (uninformed player) uses worst-case regret of its security strategy and its anti-discounted
update as the fixed-sized sufficient statistics. Although fixed-sized sufficient statistics
are employed by both players, optimal security strategy computation in {\lambda}-discounted
asymmetric games is still hard to perform because of non-convexity. Hence, the problem is convexified
in this article by devising `approximated' security strategies for both players that are based
on approximated optimal game value. However, `approximated' strategies require full monitoring.
Therefore, a simplistic yet effective `expected' strategy is also constructed for the LTE network
that does not require full monitoring. The simulation results show that the smart jammer plays non-revealing
and misleading strategies.
