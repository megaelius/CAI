Prognostic information at diagnosis has important implications for cancer treatment and monitoring.
Although cancer staging, histopathological assessment, molecular features, and clinical variables
can provide useful prognostic insights, improving risk stratification remains an active research
area. We developed a deep learning system (DLS) to predict disease specific survival across 10 cancer
types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We used a weakly-supervised approach without pixel-level
annotations, and tested three different survival loss functions. The DLS was developed using 9,086
slides from 3,664 cases and evaluated using 3,009 slides from 1,216 cases. In multivariable Cox
regression analysis of the combined cohort including all 10 cancers, the DLS was significantly
associated with disease specific survival (hazard ratio of 1.58, 95% CI 1.28-1.70, p<0.0001) after
adjusting for cancer type, stage, age, and sex. In a per-cancer adjusted subanalysis, the DLS remained
a significant predictor of survival in 5 of 10 cancer types. Compared to a baseline model including
stage, age, and sex, the c-index of the model demonstrated an absolute 3.7% improvement (95% CI 1.0-6.5)
in the combined cohort. Additionally, our models stratified patients within individual cancer
stages, particularly stage II (p=0.025) and stage III (p<0.001). By developing and evaluating
prognostic models across multiple cancer types, this work represents one of the most comprehensive
studies exploring the direct prediction of clinical outcomes using deep learning and histopathology
images. Our analysis demonstrates the potential for this approach to provide prognostic information
in multiple cancer types, and even within specific pathologic stages. However, given the relatively
small number of clinical events, we observed wide confidence intervals, suggesting that future
work will benefit from larger datasets.
