In this paper we study the topic of signal restoration using complexity regularization, quantifying
the compression bit-cost of the signal estimate. While complexity-regularized restoration is
an established concept, solid practical methods were suggested only for the Gaussian denoising
task, leaving more complicated restoration problems without a generally constructive approach.
Here we present practical methods for complexity-regularized restoration of signals, accommodating
degradations caused by a known linear operator of an arbitrary form. Our iterative procedure, obtained
using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach, addresses the restoration
task as a sequence of simpler problems involving L2-regularized estimations and rate-distortion
optimizations (considering the squared-error criterion). Further, we replace the rate-distortion
optimizations with an arbitrary standardized compression technique and thereby restore the signal
by leveraging underlying models designed for compression. Additionally, we propose a shift-invariant
complexity regularizer, measuring the bit-cost of all the shifted forms of the estimate, extending
our method to use averaging of decompressed outputs gathered from compression of shifted signals.
On the theoretical side, we present an analysis of complexity-regularized restoration of a cyclo-stationary
Gaussian signal from deterioration by a linear shift-invariant operator and an additive white
Gaussian noise. The theory shows that optimal complexity-regularized restoration relies on an
elementary restoration filter and compression spreading reconstruction quality unevenly based
on the energy distribution of the degradation filter. Nicely, these ideas are realized also in the
proposed practical methods. The presented experiments show good results for image deblurring
and inpainting using the JPEG2000 and HEVC compression standards.
