In this paper, we propose a novel method named GP-Aligner to deal with the problem of non-rigid groupwise
point set registration. Compared to previous non-learning approaches, our proposed method gains
competitive advantages by leveraging the power of deep neural networks to effectively and efficiently
learn to align a large number of highly deformed 3D shapes with superior performance. Unlike most
learning-based methods that use an explicit feature encoding network to extract the per-shape
features and their correlations, our model leverages a model-free learnable latent descriptor
to characterize the group relationship. More specifically, for a given group we first define an
optimizable Group Latent Descriptor (GLD) to characterize the gruopwise relationship among a
group of point sets. Each GLD is randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution and then concatenated
with the coordinates of each point of the associated point sets in the group. A neural network-based
decoder is further constructed to predict the coherent drifts as the desired transformation from
input groups of shapes to aligned groups of shapes. During the optimization process, GP-Aligner
jointly updates all GLDs and weight parameters of the decoder network towards the minimization
of an unsupervised groupwise alignment loss. After optimization, for each group our model coherently
drives each point set towards a middle, common position (shape) without specifying one as the target.
GP-Aligner does not require large-scale training data for network training and it can directly
align groups of point sets in a one-stage optimization process. GP-Aligner shows both accuracy
and computational efficiency improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for groupwise
point set registration. Moreover, GP-Aligner is shown great efficiency in aligning a large number
of groups of real-world 3D shapes.
