This study considers the expressiveness (that is the expressive power or expressivity) of different
types of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) and discusses its potential to be machine-processable
in the context of the Semantic Web. For this purpose, the theoretical foundations of KOS are reviewed
based on conceptualizations introduced by the Functional Requirements for Subject Authority
Data (FRSAD) and the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS); natural language processing
techniques are also implemented. Applying a comparative analysis, the dataset comprises a thesaurus
(Eurovoc), a subject headings system (LCSH) and a classification scheme (DDC). These are compared
with an ontology (CIDOC-CRM) by focusing on how they define and handle concepts and relations. It
was observed that LCSH and DDC focus on the formalism of character strings (nomens) rather than on
the modelling of semantics; their definition of what constitutes a concept is quite fuzzy, and they
comprise a large number of complex concepts. By contrast, thesauri have a coherent definition of
what constitutes a concept, and apply a systematic approach to the modelling of relations. Ontologies
explicitly define diverse types of relations, and are by their nature machine-processable. The
paper concludes that the potential of both the expressiveness and machine processability of each
KOS is extensively regulated by its structural rules. It is harder to represent subject headings
and classification schemes as semantic networks with nodes and arcs, while thesauri are more suitable
for such a representation. In addition, a paradigm shift is revealed which focuses on the modelling
of relations between concepts, rather than the concepts themselves.
