A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was detected and has spread rapidly across various
countries around the world since the end of the year 2019, Computed Tomography (CT) images have been
used as a crucial alternative to the time-consuming RT-PCR test. However, pure manual segmentation
of CT images faces a serious challenge with the increase of suspected cases, resulting in urgent
requirements for accurate and automatic segmentation of COVID-19 infections. Unfortunately,
since the imaging characteristics of the COVID-19 infection are diverse and similar to the backgrounds,
existing medical image segmentation methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance. In this
work, we try to establish a new deep convolutional neural network tailored for segmenting the chest
CT images with COVID-19 infections. We firstly maintain a large and new chest CT image dataset consisting
of 21,658 annotated chest CT images from 861 patients with confirmed COVID-19. Inspired by the observation
that the boundary of the infected lung can be enhanced by adjusting the global intensity, in the proposed
deep CNN, we introduce a feature variation block which adaptively adjusts the global properties
of the features for segmenting COVID-19 infection. The proposed FV block can enhance the capability
of feature representation effectively and adaptively for diverse cases. We fuse features at different
scales by proposing Progressive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling to handle the sophisticated infection
areas with diverse appearance and shapes. We conducted experiments on the data collected in China
and Germany and show that the proposed deep CNN can produce impressive performance effectively.
