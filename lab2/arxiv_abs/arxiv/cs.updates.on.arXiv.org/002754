Community detection in hypergraphs is explored. Under a generative hypergraph model called "d-wise
hypergraph stochastic block model" (d-hSBM) which naturally extends the Stochastic Block Model
from graphs to d-uniform hypergraphs, the asymptotic minimax mismatch ratio is characterized.
For proving the achievability, we propose a two-step polynomial time algorithm that achieves the
fundamental limit. The first step of the algorithm is a hypergraph spectral clustering method which
achieves partial recovery to a certain precision level. The second step is a local refinement method
which leverages the underlying probabilistic model along with parameter estimation from the outcome
of the first step. To characterize the asymptotic performance of the proposed algorithm, we first
derive a sufficient condition for attaining weak consistency in the hypergraph spectral clustering
step. Then, under the guarantee of weak consistency in the first step, we upper bound the worst-case
risk attained in the local refinement step by an exponentially decaying function of the size of the
hypergraph and characterize the decaying rate. For proving the converse, the lower bound of the
minimax mismatch ratio is set by finding a smaller parameter space which contains the most dominant
error events, inspired by the analysis in the achievability part. It turns out that the minimax mismatch
ratio decays exponentially fast to zero as the number of nodes tends to infinity, and the rate function
is a weighted combination of several divergence terms, each of which is the Renyi divergence of order
1/2 between two Bernoulli's. The Bernoulli's involved in the characterization of the rate function
are those governing the random instantiation of hyperedges in d-hSBM. Experimental results on
synthetic data validate our theoretical finding that the refinement step is critical in achieving
the optimal statistical limit.
