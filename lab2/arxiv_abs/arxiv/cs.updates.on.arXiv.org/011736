Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced to testing sets of null
hypotheses of the form "the average of this list is not greater than 1/2" for a collection of finite
lists of nonnegative numbers. Such social choice functions include majority, super-majority,
plurality, multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval voting,
and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand count iff all the null hypotheses
are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new
ballot-polling risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given. Ballot-level
comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion that the mean of re-scaled tabulation
errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn, that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods
used for ballot polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers. SHANGRLA
comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits for two reasons: (i) for most
social choice functions, the conditions tested are both necessary and sufficient for the reported
outcome to be correct, while previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary,
and (ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction simplifies stratified
audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with ballot-level comparisons, producing
sharper audits than the "SUITE" approach. SHANGRLA works with the "phantoms to evil zombies" strategy
to treat missing ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates sampling
from "ballot-style manifests," which can dramatically improve efficiency when the audited contests
do not appear on every ballot card. Open-source software implementing SHANGRLA ballot-level comparison
audits is available.
