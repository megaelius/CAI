Most modern HVAC systems suffer from two intrinsic problems. First, inability to meet diverse comfort
requirements of the occupants. Second, heat or cool an entire zone even when the zone is only partially
occupied. Both issues can be mitigated by using personal comfort systems (PCS) which bridge the
comfort gap between what is provided by a central HVAC system and the personal preferences of the
occupants. In recent work, we have proposed and deployed such a system, called SPOT. We address the
question, "How should an existing HVAC system modify its operation to benefit the availability
of PCS like SPOT?" For example, energy consumption could be reduced during sparse occupancy by choosing
appropriate thermal set backs, with the PCS providing the additional offset in thermal comfort
required for each occupant. Our control strategy based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), employs
a bi-linear thermal model, and has two time-scales to accommodate the physical constraints that
limit certain components of the central HVAC system from frequently changing their set points.
We compare the energy consumption and comfort offered by our SPOT-aware HVAC system with that of
a state-of-the-art MPC-based central HVAC system in multiple settings including different room
layouts and partial deployment of PCS. Numerical evaluations show that our system obtains, in average,
45% (15%) savings in energy in summer (winter), compared with the benchmark system for the case of
homogeneous comfort requirements. For heterogeneous comfort requirements, we observe 51% (29%)
improvement in comfort in summer (winter) in addition to significant savings in energy.
