Plasmodium falciparum malaria still poses one of the greatest threats to human life with over 200
million cases globally leading to half-million deaths annually. Of these, 90% of cases and of the
mortality occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly among children. Although malaria prediction systems
are central to the 2016-2030 malaria Global Technical Strategy, currently these are inadequate
at capturing and estimating the burden of disease in highly endemic countries. We developed and
validated a computational system that exploits the predictive power of current Machine Learning
approaches on 22-years of prospective data from the high-transmission holoendemic malaria urban-densely-populated
sub-Saharan West-Africa metropolis of Ibadan. Our dataset of >9x104 screened study participants
attending our clinical and community services from 1996 to 2017 contains monthly prevalence, temporal,
environmental and host features. Our Locality-specific Elastic-Net based Malaria Prediction
System (LEMPS) achieves good generalization performance, both in magnitude and direction of the
prediction, when tasked to predict monthly prevalence on previously unseen validation data (MAE<=6x10-2,
MSE<=7x10-3) within a range of (+0.1 to -0.05) error-tolerance which is relevant and usable for
aiding decision-support in a holoendemic setting. LEMPS is well-suited for malaria prediction,
where there are multiple features which are correlated with one another, and trading-off between
regularization-strength L1-norm and L2-norm allows the system to retain stability. Data-driven
systems are critical for regionally-adaptable surveillance, management of control strategies
and resource allocation across stretched healthcare systems.
