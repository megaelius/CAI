We study several questions in the reliable agnostic learning framework of Kalai et al. (2009), which
captures learning tasks in which one type of error is costlier than others. A positive reliable classifier
is one that makes no false positive errors. The goal in the positive reliable agnostic framework
is to output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i) its false positive error rate is at most
$\epsilon$, (ii) its false negative error rate is at most $\epsilon$ more than that of the best positive
reliable classifier from the class. A closely related notion is fully reliable agnostic learning,
which considers partial classifiers that are allowed to predict "unknown" on some inputs. The best
fully reliable partial classifier is one that makes no errors and minimizes the probability of predicting
"unknown", and the goal in fully reliable learning is to output a hypothesis that is almost as good
as the best fully reliable partial classifier from a class. For distribution-independent learning,
the best known algorithms for PAC learning typically utilize polynomial threshold representations,
while the state of the art agnostic learning algorithms use point-wise polynomial approximations.
We show that one-sided polynomial approximations, an intermediate notion between polynomial
threshold representations and point-wise polynomial approximations, suffice for learning in
the reliable agnostic settings. We then show that majorities can be fully reliably learned and disjunctions
of majorities can be positive reliably learned, through constructions of appropriate one-sided
polynomial approximations. Our fully reliable algorithm for majorities provides the first evidence
that fully reliable learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning. Our algorithms also
satisfy strong attribute-efficiency properties, and provide smooth tradeoffs between sample
complexity and running time.
