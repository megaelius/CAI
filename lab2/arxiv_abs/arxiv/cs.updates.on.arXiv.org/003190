Many resource allocation problems in the cloud can be described as a basic Virtual Network Embedding
Problem (VNEP): finding mappings of request graphs (describing the workloads) onto a substrate
graph (describing the physical infrastructure). In the offline setting, the two natural objectives
are profit maximization, i.e., embedding a maximal number of request graphs subject to the resource
constraints, and cost minimization, i.e., embedding all requests at minimal overall cost. The
VNEP can be seen as a generalization of classic routing and call admission problems, in which requests
are arbitrary graphs whose communication endpoints are not fixed. Due to its applications, the
problem has been studied intensively in the networking community. However, the underlying algorithmic
problem is hardly understood. This paper presents the first fixed-parameter tractable approximation
algorithms for the VNEP. Our algorithms are based on randomized rounding. Due to the flexible mapping
options and the arbitrary request graph topologies, we show that a novel linear program formulation
is required. Only using this novel formulation the computation of convex combinations of valid
mappings is enabled, as the formulation needs to account for the structure of the request graphs.
Accordingly, to capture the structure of request graphs, we introduce the graph-theoretic notion
of extraction orders and extraction width and show that our algorithms have exponential runtime
in the request graphs' maximal width. Hence, for request graphs of fixed extraction width, we obtain
the first polynomial-time approximations. Studying the new notion of extraction orders we show
that (i) computing extraction orders of minimal width is NP-hard and (ii) that computing decomposable
LP solutions is in general NP-hard, even when restricting request graphs to planar ones.
