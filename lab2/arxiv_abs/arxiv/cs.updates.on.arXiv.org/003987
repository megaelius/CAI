Halfspace depth and $\beta$-skeleton depth are two types of depth functions in nonparametric data
analysis. The halfspace depth of a query point $q\in \mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to $S\subset\mathbb{R}^d$
is the minimum portion of the elements of $S$ which are contained in a halfspace which passes through
$q$. For $\beta \geq 1$, the $\beta$-skeleton depth of $q$ with respect to $S$ is defined to be the
total number of \emph{$\beta$-skeleton influence regions} that contain $q$, where each of these
influence regions is the intersection of two hyperballs obtained from a pair of points in $S$. The
$\beta$-skeleton depth introduces a family of depth functions that contain \emph{spherical depth}
and \emph{lens depth} if $\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$, respectively. The main results of this paper
include approximating the planar halfspace depth and $\beta$-skeleton depth using two different
approximation methods. First, the halfspace depth is approximated by the $\beta$-skeleton depth
values. For this method, two dissimilarity measures based on the concepts of \emph{fitting function}
and \emph{Hamming distance} are defined to train the halfspace depth function by the $\beta$-skeleton
depth values obtaining from a given data set. The goodness of this approximation is measured by a
function of error values. Secondly, computing the planar $\beta$-skeleton depth is reduced to
a combination of some range counting problems. Using existing results on range counting approximations,
the planar $\beta$-skeleton depth of a query point is approximated in $O(n\;poly(1/\varepsilon,\log
n))$, $\beta\geq 1$. Regarding the $\beta$-skeleton depth functions, it is also proved that this
family of depth functions converge when $\beta \to \infty$. Finally, some experimental results
are provided to support the proposed method of approximation and convergence of $\beta$-skeleton
depth functions.
