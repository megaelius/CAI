We study the complexity of computing or approximating an equilibrium for a given finite n-player
extensive form game of perfect recall (EFGPR), where n >= 3. Our results apply not only to Nash
equilibrium (NE), but also to various important refinements of NE for EFGPRs, including: subgame-perfect
equilibrium in behavior strategies, sequential equilibrium (SE), and extensive form trembling-hand
perfect equilibrium (PE). Of these, the most refined notion is PE. By a classic result of Selten,
a PE exists for any EFGPR. We also study quasi-perfect equilibrium (QPE), a refinement that is incompatible
with PE. We show that, for all these notions of equilibrium, approximating an equilibrium for a given
EFGPR, to within a given desired precision, is FIXP_a-complete. We also show that computing a "delta-almost
subgame-perfect equilibrium" in behavior strategies for a given EFGPR and given delta > 0, is
PPAD-complete. In doing so, we also define the more refined notions of "delta-almost epsilon-(quasi-)perfect"
equilibrium, and show that computing one is PPAD-complete. Thus, approximating one such (delta-almost)
equilibrium for n-player EFGPRs, n >= 3, is P-time equivalent to approximating a (delta-almost)
NE for a normal form game (NFG) with 3 or more players. NFGs are trivially encodable as EFGPRs without
blowup in size. Thus our results extend the celebrated complexity results for NFGs to the considerably
more general setting of EFGPRs. For 2-player EFGPRs, analogous complexity results follow from
the algorithms of Koller, Megiddo, and von Stengel (1996), and von Stengel, van den Elzen, and Talman
(2002). However, prior to the present paper, no analogous results were known for EFGPRs with 3 or
more players.
