There are several numerical models that describe real phenomena being used to solve complex problems.
For example, an accurate numerical breast model can provide assistance to surgeons with visual
information of the breast as a result of a surgery simulation. The process of finding the model parameters
requires numeric inputs, either based in medical imaging techniques, or other measures. Inputs
can be processed by iterative methods (inverse elasticity solvers). Such solvers are highly robust
and provide solutions within the required degree of accuracy. However, their computational complexity
is costly. On the other hand, machine learning based approaches provide outputs in real-time. Although
high accuracy rates can be achieved, these methods are not exempt from producing solutions outside
the required degree of accuracy. In the context of real life situations, a non accurate solution
might present complications to the patient. We present an hybrid parameter estimation method to
take advantage of the positive features of each of the aforementioned approaches. Our method preserves
both the real-time performance of deep-learning methods, and the reliability of inverse elasticity
solvers. The underlying reasoning behind our proposal is the fact that deep-learning methods,
such as neural networks, can provide accurate results in the majority of cases and they just need
a fail-safe system to ensure its reliability. Hence, we propose using a Multilayer Neural Networks
(MNN) to get an estimation which is in turn validated by a iterative solver. In case the MNN provides
an estimation not within the required accuracy range, the solver refines the estimation until the
required accuracy is achieved. Based on our results we can conclude that the presented hybrid method
is able to complement the computational performance of MNNs with the robustness of iterative solver
approaches.
