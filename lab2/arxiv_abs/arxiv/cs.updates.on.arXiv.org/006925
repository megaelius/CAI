Thesis Statement: Cost-effective switching and spectrum utilization efficiency have become
critical design considerations in optical networks. This dissertation provides in-depth exploration
of these important aspects, and proposes effective techniques for low-cost switching architectures
and resource allocation algorithms to facilitate the adoption of optical networks in the near future.
The dramatic growth of Internet traffic brings challenges for optical network designers. The increasing
traffic and bandwidth requirements mean that various resource allocation schemes to achieve different
network design goals assume great importance. The general problem of resource allocation to lightpath
requests is a challenging problem. An emerging technology of flexible and more fine-grained grid
through the use of Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OOFDM) allows fiber bandwidth
to be more suitably matched up with application requirements, thereby making the network more elastic
than the conventional Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. Despite the advances
of employing OOFDM technology in elastic optical networks (EONs), imminent fiber capacity exhaustion
due to the ever-increasing demands means that multiple fibers per link will be inevitable. While
increasing the number of fibers boosts the capacity of networks, there is a price to pay for it in the
form of increased number of switch ports / complexity of switches. The huge amount of traffic demands
and thus high hardware requirements motivate multigranularity (such as wavebanding) to save costs
in optical networks. This dissertation aims to tackle several types of resource allocation challenges
in multi-granular optical networks to either improve the spectrum utilization or provide cost-effective
switching techniques.
