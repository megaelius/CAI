Lung cancer is the commonest cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and its mortality can be reduced significantly
by performing early diagnosis and screening. Since the 1960s, driven by the pressing needs to accurately
and effectively interpret the massive volume of chest images generated daily, computer-assisted
diagnosis of pulmonary nodule has opened up new opportunities to relax the limitation from physicians'
subjectivity, experiences and fatigue. And the fair access to the reliable and affordable computer-assisted
diagnosis will fight the inequalities in incidence and mortality between populations. It has been
witnessed that significant and remarkable advances have been achieved since the 1980s, and consistent
endeavors have been exerted to deal with the grand challenges on how to accurately detect the pulmonary
nodules with high sensitivity at low false-positives rate as well as on how to precisely differentiate
between benign and malignant nodules. There is a lack of comprehensive examination of the techniques'
development which is evolving the pulmonary nodules diagnosis from classical approaches to machine
learning-assisted decision support. The main goal of this investigation is to provide a comprehensive
state-of-the-art review of the computer-assisted nodules detection and benign-malignant classification
techniques developed over 3 decades, which have evolved from the complicated ad hoc analysis pipeline
of conventional approaches to the simplified seamlessly integrated deep learning techniques.
This review also identifies challenges and highlights opportunities for future work in learning
models, learning algorithms and enhancement schemes for bridging current state to future prospect
and satisfying future demand.
