The Internet of Bio-Nano-Things is a new paradigm that can bring novel remotely controlled actuation
and sensing techniques inside the human body. Towards precise bionano sensing techniques in the
brain, we investigate the challenges of modelling spatial distribution of astrocyte networks
in developing a mathematical framework that lay the groundwork for future early-detection techniques
of neurodegenerative disease. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the $\beta$-amyloid
plaques in astrocytes with the Alzheimer's disease. We developed a computation model of healthy
and Alzheimer's diseases astrocytes networks from the state of the art models and results that account
for the intracellular pathways, IP$_3$ dynamics, gap junctions, voltage-gated calcium channels
and astrocytes volumes. We also implemented different types of astrocytes network topologies
including shortcut networks, regular degree networks, Erd\"os R\'enyi networks and link radius
networks. A proposed multi-scale stochastic computational model captures the relationship between
the intracellular and intercellular scales. Lastly, we designed and evaluated a single-hop communication
system with frequency modulation using metrics such as propagation extend, molecular delay and
channel gain. The results show that the more unstable but at the same time lower level oscillations
of Alzheimer's astrocyte networks can create a multi-scale effect on communication between astrocytes
with increased molecular delay and lower channel gain compared to healthy astrocytes, with an elevated
impact on Erd\"os R\'enyi networks and link radius networks topologies.
