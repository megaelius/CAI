Deploying deep models on embedded devices has been a challenging problem since the great success
of deep learning based networks. Fixed-point networks, which represent their data with low bits
fixed-point and thus give remarkable savings on memory usage, are generally preferred. Even though
current fixed-point networks employ relative low bits (e.g. 8-bits), the memory saving is far from
enough for the embedded devices. On the other hand, quantization deep networks, for example XNOR-Net
and HWGQNet, quantize the data into 1 or 2 bits resulting in more significant memory savings but still
contain lots of floatingpoint data. In this paper, we propose a fixed-point network for embedded
vision tasks through converting the floatingpoint data in a quantization network into fixed-point.
Furthermore, to overcome the data loss caused by the conversion, we propose to compose floating-point
data operations across multiple layers (e.g. convolution, batch normalization and quantization
layers) and convert them into fixedpoint. We name the fixed-point network obtained through such
integrated conversion as Integrated Fixed-point Quantization Networks (IFQ-Net). We demonstrate
that our IFQNet gives 2.16x and 18x more savings on model size and runtime feature map memory respectively
with similar accuracy on ImageNet. Furthermore, based on YOLOv2, we design IFQ-Tinier-YOLO face
detector which is a fixed-point network with 256x reduction in model size (246k Bytes) than Tiny-YOLO.
We illustrate the promising performance of our face detector in terms of detection rate on Face Detection
Data Set and Bencmark (FDDB) and qualitative results of detecting small faces of Wider Face dataset.
