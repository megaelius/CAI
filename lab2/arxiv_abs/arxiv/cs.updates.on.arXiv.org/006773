Big science initiatives are trying to reconstruct and model the brain by attempting to simulate
brain tissue at larger scales and with increasingly more biological detail than previously thought
possible. The exponential growth of parallel computer performance has been supporting these developments,
and at the same time maintainers of neuroscientific simulation code have strived to optimally and
efficiently exploit new hardware features. Current state of the art software for the simulation
of biological networks has so far been developed using performance engineering practices, but
a thorough analysis and modeling of the computational and performance characteristics, especially
in the case of morphologically detailed neuron simulations, is lacking. Other computational sciences
have successfully used analytic performance engineering and modeling methods to gain insight
on the computational properties of simulation kernels, aid developers in performance optimizations
and eventually drive co-design efforts, but to our knowledge a model-based performance analysis
of neuron simulations has not yet been conducted. We present a detailed study of the shared-memory
performance of morphologically detailed neuron simulations based on the Execution-Cache-Memory
(ECM) performance model. We demonstrate that this model can deliver accurate predictions of the
runtime of almost all the kernels that constitute the neuron models under investigation. The gained
insight is used to identify the main governing mechanisms underlying performance bottlenecks
in the simulation. The implications of this analysis on the optimization of neural simulation software
and eventually co-design of future hardware architectures are discussed. In this sense, our work
represents a valuable conceptual and quantitative contribution to understanding the performance
properties of biological networks simulations.
