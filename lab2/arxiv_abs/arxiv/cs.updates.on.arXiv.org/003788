This paper studies a multiuser mobile edge computing (MEC) system, in which one base station (BS)
serves multiple users with intensive computation tasks. We exploit the multi-antenna non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) technique for multiuser computation offloading, such that different users
can simultaneously offload their computation tasks to the multi-antenna BS over the same time/frequency
resources, and the BS can employ successive interference cancellation (SIC) to efficiently decode
all users' offloaded tasks for remote execution. We aim to minimize the weighted sum-energy consumption
at all users subject to their computation latency constraints, by jointly optimizing the communication
and computation resource allocation as well as the BS's decoding order for SIC. For the case with
partial offloading, the weighted sum-energy minimization is a convex optimization problem, for
which an efficient algorithm based on the Lagrange duality method is presented to obtain the globally
optimal solution. For the case with binary offloading, the weighted sum-energy minimization corresponds
to a {\em mixed Boolean convex problem} that is generally more difficult to be solved. We first use
the branch-and-bound (BnB) method to obtain the globally optimal solution, and then develop two
low-complexity algorithms based on the greedy method and the convex relaxation, respectively,
to find suboptimal solutions with high quality in practice. Via numerical results, it is shown that
the proposed NOMA-based computation offloading design significantly improves the energy efficiency
of the multiuser MEC system as compared to other benchmark schemes. It is also shown that for the case
with binary offloading, the proposed greedy method performs close to the optimal BnB based solution,
and the convex relaxation based solution achieves a suboptimal performance but with lower implementation
complexity.
