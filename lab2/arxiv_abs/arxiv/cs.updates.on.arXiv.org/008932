Human behavior expression and experience are inherently multi-modal, and characterized by vast
individual and contextual heterogeneity. To achieve meaningful human-computer and human-robot
interactions, multi-modal models of the users states (e.g., engagement) are therefore needed.
Most of the existing works that try to build classifiers for the users states assume that the data
to train the models are fully labeled. Nevertheless, data labeling is costly and tedious, and also
prone to subjective interpretations by the human coders. This is even more pronounced when the data
are multi-modal (e.g., some users are more expressive with their facial expressions, some with
their voice). Thus, building models that can accurately estimate the users states during an interaction
is challenging. To tackle this, we propose a novel multi-modal active learning (AL) approach that
uses the notion of deep reinforcement learning (RL) to find an optimal policy for active selection
of the users data, needed to train the target (modality-specific) models. We investigate different
strategies for multi-modal data fusion, and show that the proposed model-level fusion coupled
with RL outperforms the feature-level and modality-specific models, and the naive AL strategies
such as random sampling, and the standard heuristics such as uncertainty sampling. We show the benefits
of this approach on the task of engagement estimation from real-world child-robot interactions
during an autism therapy. Importantly, we show that the proposed multi-modal AL approach can be
used to efficiently personalize the engagement classifiers to the target user using a small amount
of actively selected users data.
