Changes to network structure can substantially affect when and how widely new ideas, products,
and conventions are adopted. In models of biological contagion, interventions that randomly rewire
edges (making them "longer") accelerate spread. However, there are other models relevant to social
contagion, such as those motivated by myopic best-response in games with strategic complements,
in which individual's behavior is described by a threshold number of adopting neighbors above which
adoption occurs (i.e., complex contagions). Recent work has argued that highly clustered, rather
than random, networks facilitate spread of these complex contagions. Here we show that minor modifications
of prior analyses, which make them more realistic, reverse this result. The modification is that
we allow very rarely below threshold adoption, i.e., very rarely adoption occurs, where there is
only one adopting neighbor. To model the trade-off between long and short edges we consider networks
that are the union of cycle-power-$k$ graphs and random graphs on $n$ nodes. We study how the time
to global spread changes as we replace the cycle edges with (random) long ties. Allowing adoptions
below threshold to occur with order $1/\sqrt{n}$ probability is enough to ensure that random rewiring
accelerates spread. Simulations illustrate the robustness of these results to other commonly-posited
models for noisy best-response behavior. We then examine empirical social networks, where we find
that hypothetical interventions that (a) randomly rewire existing edges or (b) add random edges
reduce time to spread compared with the original network or addition of "short", triad-closing
edges, respectively. This substantially revises conclusions about how interventions change
the spread of behavior, suggesting that those wanting to increase spread should induce formation
of long ties, rather than triad-closing ties.
