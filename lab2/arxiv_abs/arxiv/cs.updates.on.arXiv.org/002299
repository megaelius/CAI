Precise 3D segmentation of infant brain tissues is an essential step towards comprehensive volumetric
studies and quantitative analysis of early brain developement. However, computing such segmentations
is very challenging, especially for the infant brain at round 6-month of age, due to the poor image
quality, among other difficulties inherent to infant brain MRI, e.g., the isointense contrast
between white and gray matter and the severe partial volume effect due to small brain sizes. This
study investigates the problem with an ensemble of semi-dense fully convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), which employs T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images as input. We demonstrate that the ensemble
agreement is highly correlated with the segmentation errors. Therefore, our method provides measures
that can guide local user corrections. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first ensemble
of 3D CNNs for suggesting annotations within images. Furthermore, inspired by the very recent success
of dense networks, we propose a novel architecture, SemiDenseNet, which connects all convolutional
layers directly to the end of the network. Our architecture allows the efficient propagation of
gradients during training, while limiting the number of parameters, requiring one order of magnitude
less parameters than popular medical image segmentation networks such as 3D U-Net. Another contribution
of our work is the study of the impact that early or late fusions of multiple image modalities might
have on the performances of deep architectures. We report evaluations of our method on the public
data of the MICCAI iSEG-2017 Challenge on 6-month infant brain MRI segmentation, and show very competitive
results among 21 teams, ranking first or second in most metrics.
