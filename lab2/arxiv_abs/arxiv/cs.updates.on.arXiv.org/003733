Harmful algae blooms (HABs), which produce lethal toxins, are a growing global concern since they
negatively affect the quality of drinking water and have major negative impact on wildlife, the
fishing industry, as well as tourism and recreational water use. In this study, we investigate the
feasibility of leveraging machine learning and fluorescence-based spectral-morphological
features to enable the identification of six different algae types in an automated fashion. More
specifically, a custom multi-band fluorescence imaging microscope is used to capture fluorescence
imaging data of a water sample at six different excitation wavelengths ranging from 405 nm - 530 nm.
A number of morphological and spectral fluorescence features are then extracted from the isolated
micro-organism imaging data, and used to train neural network classification models designed
for the purpose of identification of the six algae types given an isolated micro-organism. Experimental
results using three different neural network classification models showed that the use of either
fluorescence-based spectral features or fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features
to train neural network classification models led to statistically significant improvements
in identification accuracy when compared to the use of morphological features (with average identification
accuracies of 95.7%+/-3.5% and 96.1%+/-1.5%, respectively). These preliminary results are quite
promising, given that the identification accuracy of human taxonomists are typically between
the range of 67% and 83%, and thus illustrates the feasibility of leveraging machine learning and
fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features as a viable method for automated identification
of different algae types.
