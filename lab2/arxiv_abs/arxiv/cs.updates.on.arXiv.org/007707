Recently a library of design patterns for designing distributed user interfaces (DUIs) was created
to help researchers and designers to create user interfaces and to provide an overview of solutions
to common DUIs design problems without requiring a significant amount of time to be spent on reading
domain-specific literature and exploring existing DUIs implementations. The current version
of the DUI design patterns library need to be assessed because a lot of design patterns are overlapping
each other and their relationships are not clear enough to effectively find the most relevant design
pattern for solving particular design problem, so the purpose of this thesis is to mature the DUI
design patterns knowledge field by removing the duplicate design patterns, their description
and to create a taxonomy where each design pattern should be organised in a way that will reduce redundancy,
possibly leading to grouping or eventually merging similar patterns and allow to navigate to related
patterns. To achieve the defined goals, the first target was to investigate the possible overlaps
among design patterns and their relevancy with each other, in order to get these insights natural
language processing tool was built for extracting and analysing each design pattern research paper
to find potential codes. Later in this study thematic analysis was done with domain experts to get
themes, their description and higher level categories from generated codes to organize all related
design patterns in a clear hierarchy. The outcomes of this thesis included the clarification of
the relationships among design patterns by creating a taxonomy, clarified the description of individual
design pattern, overlaps and duplicate design patterns were removed and merged similar design
patterns.
