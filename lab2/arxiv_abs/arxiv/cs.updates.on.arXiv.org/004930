We study the role of caches in wireless interference networks. We focus on content caching and delivery
across a Gaussian interference network, where both transmitters and receivers are equipped with
caches. We provide a constant-factor approximation of the system's degrees of freedom (DoF), for
arbitrary number of transmitters, number of receivers, content library size, receiver cache size,
and transmitter cache size (as long as the transmitters combined can store the entire content library
among them). We demonstrate approximate optimality with respect to information-theoretic bounds
that do not impose any restrictions on the caching and delivery strategies. Our characterization
reveals three key insights. First, the approximate DoF is achieved using a strategy that separates
the physical and network layers. This separation architecture is thus approximately optimal.
Second, we show that increasing transmitter cache memory beyond what is needed to exactly store
the entire library between all transmitters does not provide more than a constant-factor benefit
to the DoF. A consequence is that transmit zero-forcing is not needed for approximate optimality.
Third, we derive an interesting trade-off between the receiver memory and the number of transmitters
needed for approximately maximal performance. In particular, if each receiver can store a constant
fraction of the content library, then only a constant number of transmitters are needed. Our solution
to the caching problem requires formulating and solving a new communication problem, the symmetric
multiple multicast X-channel, for which we provide an exact DoF characterization.
