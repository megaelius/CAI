Recent works in social network stream analysis show that a user's online persona attributes (e.g.,
gender, ethnicity, political interest, location, etc.) can be accurately inferred from the topics
the user writes about or engages with. Attribute and preference inferences have been widely used
to serve personalized recommendations, directed ads, and to enhance the user experience in social
networks. However, revealing a user's sensitive attributes could represent a privacy threat to
some individuals. Microtargeting (e.g.,Cambridge Analytica scandal), surveillance, and discriminating
ads are examples of threats to user privacy caused by sensitive attribute inference. In this paper,
we propose Multifaceted privacy, a novel privacy model that aims to obfuscate a user's sensitive
attributes while publicly preserving the user's public persona. To achieve multifaceted privacy,
we build Aegis, a prototype client-centric social network stream processing system that helps
preserve multifaceted privacy, and thus allowing social network users to freely express their
online personas without revealing their sensitive attributes of choice. Aegis allows social network
users to control which persona attributes should be publicly revealed and which ones should be kept
private. For this, Aegis continuously suggests topics and hashtags to social network users to post
in order to obfuscate their sensitive attributes and hence confuse content-based sensitive attribute
inferences. The suggested topics are carefully chosen to preserve the user's publicly revealed
persona attributes while hiding their private sensitive persona attributes. Our experiments
show that adding as few as 0 to 4 obfuscation posts (depending on how revealing the original post is)
successfully hides the user specified sensitive attributes without changing the user's public
persona attributes.
