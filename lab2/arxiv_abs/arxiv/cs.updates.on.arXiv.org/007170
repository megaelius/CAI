Over the past 15 years, the volume, richness and quality of data collected from the combined social
networking platforms has increased beyond all expectation, providing researchers from a variety
of disciplines to use it in their research. Perhaps more impactfully, it has provided the foundation
for a range of new products and services, transforming industries such as advertising and marketing,
as well as bringing the challenges of sharing personal data into the public consciousness. But how
to make sense of the ever-increasing volume of big social data so that we can better understand and
improve the user experience in increasingly complex, data-driven digital systems. This link with
usability and the user experience of data-driven system bridges into the wider field of HCI, attracting
interdisciplinary researchers as we see the demand for consumer technologies, software and systems,
as well as the integration of social networks into our everyday lives. The fact that the data largely
posted on social networks tends to be textual, provides a further link to linguistics, psychology
and psycholinguistics to better understand the relationship between human behaviours offline
and online. In this thesis, we present a novel conceptual framework based on a complex digital system
using collected longitudinal datasets to predict system status based on the personality traits
and emotions extracted from text posted by users. The system framework was built using a dataset
collected from an online scholarship system in which 2000 students had their digital behaviour
and social network behaviour collected for this study. We contextualise this research project
with a wider review and critical analysis of the current psycholinguistics, artificial intelligence
and human-computer interaction literature, which reveals a gap of mapping and understanding digital
profiling against system status.
