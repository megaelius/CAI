Space situation awareness (SSA) includes tracking of active and inactive resident space objects
(RSOs) and space weather assessment through space environmental data collection and processing.
To enhance SSA, the dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) framework couples on-line
data with off-line models to enhance system performance. For information management, there is
a need for identity authentication and access control strategy to ensure the integrity of exchanged
data as well as to grant authorized entities access right to data and services. Due to decentralization
and heterogeneity nature of SSA systems, it is very challenging to build a efficient centralized
access control system, which could either be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure.
Inspired by the blockchain technology, this paper introduces BlendCAC, a decentralized authentication
and capability-based access control mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services
and information in SSA networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the BlendCAC leverages
the blockchain to create virtual trust zones, in which distributed components could identify and
update each other in a trustless network environment. A robust identity-based capability token
management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registration,
propagation, and revocation of the access authorization. A proof-of-concept prototype has been
implemented and tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate
the feasibility of the BlendCAC scheme to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained
access control solution for space system towards SSA.
