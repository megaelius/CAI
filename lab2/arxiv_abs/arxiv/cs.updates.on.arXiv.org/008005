We propose and evaluate a new MRI reconstruction method named LORAKI that trains an autocalibrated
scan-specific recurrent neural network (RNN) to recover missing k-space data. Methods like GRAPPA,
SPIRiT, and AC-LORAKS assume that k-space data has shift-invariant autoregressive structure,
and that the scan-specific autoregression relationships needed to recover missing samples can
be learned from fully-sampled autocalibration (ACS) data. Recently, the structure of the linear
GRAPPA method has been translated into a nonlinear deep learning method named RAKI. RAKI uses ACS
data to train an artificial neural network to interpolate missing k-space samples, and often outperforms
GRAPPA. In this work, we apply a similar principle to translate the linear AC-LORAKS method (simultaneously
incorporating support, phase, and parallel imaging constraints) into a nonlinear deep learning
method named LORAKI. Since AC-LORAKS is iterative and convolutional, LORAKI takes the form of a
convolutional RNN. This new architecture admits a wide range of sampling patterns, and even calibrationless
patterns are possible if synthetic ACS data is generated. The performance of LORAKI was evaluated
with retrospectively undersampled brain datasets, with comparisons against other related reconstruction
methods. Results suggest that LORAKI can provide improved reconstruction compared to other scan-specific
autocalibrated reconstruction methods like GRAPPA, RAKI, and AC-LORAKS. LORAKI offers a new deep-learning
approach to MRI reconstruction based on RNNs in k-space, and enables improved image quality and
enhanced sampling flexibility.
