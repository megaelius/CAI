Whenever we are addressing a specific object or refer to a certain spatial location, we are using
referential or deictic gestures usually accompanied by some verbal description. Especially pointing
gestures are necessary to dissolve ambiguities in a scene and they are of crucial importance when
verbal communication may fail due to environmental conditions or when two persons simply do not
speak the same language. With the currently increasing advances of humanoid robots and their future
integration in domestic domains, the development of gesture interfaces complementing human-robot
interaction scenarios is of substantial interest. The implementation of an intuitive gesture
scenario is still challenging because both the pointing intention and the corresponding object
have to be correctly recognized in real-time. The demand increases when considering pointing gestures
in a cluttered environment, as is the case in households. Also, humans perform pointing in many different
ways and those variations have to be captured. Research in this field often proposes a set of geometrical
computations which do not scale well with the number of gestures and objects, use specific markers
or a predefined set of pointing directions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach
to model the distribution of pointing gestures using a growing-when-required (GWR) network. We
introduce an interaction scenario with a humanoid robot and define so-called ambiguity classes.
Our implementation for the hand and object detection is independent of any markers or skeleton models,
thus it can be easily reproduced. Our evaluation comparing a baseline computer vision approach
with our GWR model shows that the pointing-object association is well learned even in cases of ambiguities
resulting from close object proximity.
