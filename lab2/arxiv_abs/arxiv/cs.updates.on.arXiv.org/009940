In the process of exploring the world, the curiosity constantly drives humans to cognize new things.
Supposing you are a zoologist, for a presented animal image, you can recognize it immediately if
you know its class. Otherwise, you would more likely attempt to cognize it by exploiting the side-information
(e.g., semantic information, etc.) you have accumulated. Inspired by this, this paper decomposes
the generalized zero-shot learning (G-ZSL) task into an open set recognition (OSR) task and a zero-shot
learning (ZSL) task, where OSR recognizes seen classes (if we have seen (or known) them) and rejects
unseen classes (if we have never seen (or known) them before), while ZSL identifies the unseen classes
rejected by the former. Simultaneously, without violating OSR's assumptions (only known class
knowledge is available in training), we also first attempt to explore a new generalized open set
recognition (G-OSR) by introducing the accumulated side-information from known classes to OSR.
For G-ZSL, such a decomposition effectively solves the class overfitting problem with easily misclassifying
unseen classes as seen classes. The problem is ubiquitous in most existing G-ZSL methods. On the
other hand, for G-OSR, introducing such semantic information of known classes not only improves
the recognition performance but also endows OSR with the cognitive ability of unknown classes.
Specifically, a visual and semantic prototypes-jointly guided convolutional neural network
(VSG-CNN) is proposed to fulfill these two tasks (G-ZSL and G-OSR) in a unified end-to-end learning
framework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our learning
framework.
