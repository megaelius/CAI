We consider the problem of distributed channel allocation in large networks under the frequency-selective
interference channel. Performance is measured by the weighted sum of achievable rates. Our proposed
algorithm is a modified Fictitious Play algorithm that can be implemented distributedly and its
stable points are the pure Nash equilibria of a given game. Our goal is to design a utility function
for a non-cooperative game such that all of its pure Nash equilibria have close to optimal global
performance. This will make the algorithm close to optimal while requiring no communication between
users. We propose a novel technique to analyze the Nash equilibria of a random interference game,
determined by the random channel gains. Our analysis is asymptotic in the number of users. First
we present a natural non-cooperative game where the utility of each user is his achievable rate.
It is shown that, asymptotically in the number of users and for strong enough interference, this
game exhibits many bad equilibria. Then we propose a novel non-cooperative M Frequency-Selective
Interference Channel Game (M-FSIG), as a slight modification of the former, where the utility of
each user is artificially limited. We prove that even its worst equilibrium has asymptotically
optimal weighted sum-rate for any interference regime and even for correlated channels. This is
based on an order statistics analysis of the fading channels that is valid for a broad class of fading
distributions (including Rayleigh, Rician, m-Nakagami and more). We carry out simulations that
show fast convergence of our algorithm to the proven asymptotically optimal pure Nash equilibria.
