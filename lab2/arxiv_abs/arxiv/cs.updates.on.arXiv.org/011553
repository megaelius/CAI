Random key predistribution schemes have emerged as a widely adopted solution for facilitating
secure communication in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Emerging real world networks increasingly
rely on integrating information from sensor nodes with different resources and requirements.
We analyze the strength of connectivity of a heterogeneous WSN under the random pairwise key predistribution
scheme of Chan et al. According to this scheme, each of the $n$ sensor nodes is classified as type-1
(respectively, type-2) with probability $\mu$ (respectively, $1-\mu)$ where $0<\mu<1$. Each
type-1 (respectively, type-2) node is paired with 1 (respectively, $K_n$) other node selected
uniformly at random; each pair is then assigned a unique pairwise key so that they can securely communicate
with each other. A main question in the design of secure networks is how should the parameters $n$,
$\mu$, and $K_n$ be selected such that the resulting network exhibits certain desirable properties
with high probability. It was recently established that achieving even 1-connectivity a.a.s.
requires $K_n=\omega(1)$ for the inhomogeneous random K-out graph model naturally induced under
the heterogeneous pairwise scheme. In this paper, we analyse $k$-connectivity, the property that
the network remains connected despite the removal of any $k-1$ nodes or links. First, we establish
a sharp zero-one law for $k$-connectivity, showing that for the network to be $k$-connected a.a.s.,
we need to set $K_n = \frac{1}{1-\mu}(\log n +(k-2)\log\log n + \omega(1))$ for all $k=2, 3, \ldots$.
Despite such large scaling of $K_n$ being required for $k$-connectivity, we also show that merely
having $K_n =3$ ensures that all but finitely many nodes will form a connected sub-network a.a.s..
We provide comprehensive simulations to demonstrate the usefulness of our results in choosing
network parameters in the finite node regime.
