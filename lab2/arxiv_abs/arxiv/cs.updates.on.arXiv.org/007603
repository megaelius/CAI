A network effect is said to take place when a new feature not only impacts the people who receive it,
but also other users of the platform, like their connections or the people who follow them. This very
common phenomenon violates the fundamental assumption underpinning nearly all enterprise experimentation
systems, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). When this assumption is broken, a
typical experimentation platform, which relies on Bernoulli randomization for assignment and
two-sample t-test for assessment of significance, will not only fail to account for the network
effect, but potentially give highly biased results. This paper outlines a simple and scalable solution
to measuring network effects, using ego-network randomization, where a cluster is comprised of
an "ego" (a focal individual), and her "alters" (the individuals she is immediately connected to).
Our approach aims at maintaining representativity of clusters, avoiding strong modeling assumption,
and significantly increasing power compared to traditional cluster-based randomization. In
particular, it does not require product-specific experiment design, or high levels of investment
from engineering teams, and does not require any changes to experimentation and analysis platforms,
as it only requires assigning treatment an individual level. Each user either has the feature or
does not, and no complex manipulation of interactions between users is needed. It focuses on measuring
the one-out network effect (i.e the effect of my immediate connection's treatment on me), and gives
reasonable estimates at a very low setup cost, allowing us to run such experiments dozens of times
a year.
