A human-swarm cooperative system, which mixes multiple robots and a human supervisor to form a heterogeneous
team, is widely used for emergent scenarios such as criminal tracking in social security and victim
assistance in a natural disaster. These emergent scenarios require a cooperative team to quickly
terminate the current task and transit the system to a new task, bringing difficulty in motion planning.
Moreover, due to the immediate task transitions, uncertainty from both physical systems and prior
tasks is accumulated to decrease swarm performance, causing robot failures and influencing the
cooperation effectiveness between the human and the robot swarm. Therefore, given the quick-transition
requirements and the introduced uncertainty, it is challenging for a human-swarm system to respond
to emergent tasks, compared with executing normal tasks where a gradual transition between tasks
is allowed. Human trust reveals the behavior expectations of others and is used to adjust unsatisfactory
behaviors for better cooperation. Inspired by human trust, in this paper, a trust-aware reflective
control (Trust-R) is developed to dynamically calibrate human-swarm cooperation. Trust-R, based
on a weighted mean subsequence reduced algorithm (WMSR) and human trust modeling, helps a swarm
to self-reflect its performance from the perspective of human trust; then proactively correct
its faulty behaviors in an early stage before a human intervenes. One typical task scenario {emergency
response} was designed in the real-gravity simulation environment, and a human user study with
145 volunteers was conducted. Trust-R's effectiveness in correcting faulty behaviors in emergency
response was validated by the improved swarm performance and increased trust scores.
