In this paper, the problem of training federated learning (FL) algorithms over a realistic wireless
network is studied. In particular, in the considered model, wireless users execute an FL algorithm
while training their local FL models using their own data and transmitting the trained local FL models
to a base station (BS) that will generate a global FL model and send it back to the users. Since all training
parameters are transmitted over wireless links, the quality of the training will be affected by
wireless factors such as packet errors and the availability of wireless resources. Meanwhile,
due to the limited wireless bandwidth, the BS must select an appropriate subset of users to execute
the FL algorithm so as to build a global FL model accurately. This joint learning, wireless resource
allocation, and user selection problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to
minimize an FL loss function that captures the performance of the FL algorithm. To address this problem,
a closed-form expression for the expected convergence rate of the FL algorithm is first derived
to quantify the impact of wireless factors on FL. Then, based on the expected convergence rate of
the FL algorithm, the optimal transmit power for each user is derived, under a given user selection
and uplink resource block (RB) allocation scheme. Finally, the user selection and uplink RB allocation
is optimized so as to minimize the FL loss function. Simulation results show that the proposed joint
federated learning and communication framework can reduce the FL loss function value by up to 10%
and 16%, respectively, compared to: 1) An optimal user selection algorithm with random resource
allocation and 2) a standard FL algorithm with random user selection and resource allocation.
