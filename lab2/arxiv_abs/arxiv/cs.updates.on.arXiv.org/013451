Synthetic molecular communication (MC) is a new communication engineering paradigm which is expected
to enable revolutionary applications such as smart drug delivery and real-time health monitoring.
The design and implementation of synthetic MC systems (MCSs) at nano- and microscale is very challenging.
This is particularly true for synthetic MCSs employing biological components as transmitters
and receivers or as interfaces with natural biological MCSs. Nevertheless, since such biological
components have been optimized by nature over billions of years, using them in synthetic MCSs is
highly promising. This paper provides a survey of biological components that can potentially serve
as the main building blocks, i.e., transmitter, receiver, and signaling particles, for the design
and implementation of synthetic MCSs. Nature uses a large variety of signaling particles of different
sizes and with vastly different properties for communication among biological entities. Here,
we focus on three important classes of signaling particles: cations (specifically protons and
calcium ions), neurotransmitters (specifically acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin), and
phosphopeptides. For each of these candidate signaling particles, we present several specific
transmitter and receiver structures mainly built upon proteins that are capable of performing
the distinct physiological functionalities required from the transmitters and receivers of MCSs.
Moreover, we present options for both microscale implementation of MCSs as well as the micro-to-macroscale
interfaces needed for experimental evaluation of MCSs. Furthermore, we outline new research directions
for the implementation and the theoretical design and analysis of the proposed transmitter and
receiver architectures.
