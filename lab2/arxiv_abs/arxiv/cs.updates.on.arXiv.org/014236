Diffusion MRI is the modality of choice to study alterations of white matter. In past years, various
works have used diffusion MRI for automatic classification of AD. However, classification performance
obtained with different approaches is difficult to compare and these studies are also difficult
to reproduce. In the present paper, we first extend a previously proposed framework to diffusion
MRI data for AD classification. Specifically, we add: conversion of diffusion MRI ADNI data into
the BIDS standard and pipelines for diffusion MRI preprocessing and feature extraction. We then
apply the framework to compare different components. First, FS has a positive impact on classification
results: highest balanced accuracy (BA) improved from 0.76 to 0.82 for task CN vs AD. Secondly, voxel-wise
features generally gives better performance than regional features. Fractional anisotropy (FA)
and mean diffusivity (MD) provided comparable results for voxel-wise features. Moreover, we observe
that the poor performance obtained in tasks involving MCI were potentially caused by the small data
samples, rather than by the data imbalance. Furthermore, no extensive classification difference
exists for different degree of smoothing and registration methods. Besides, we demonstrate that
using non-nested validation of FS leads to unreliable and over-optimistic results: 0.05 up to 0.40
relative increase in BA. Lastly, with proper FR and FS, the performance of diffusion MRI features
is comparable to that of T1w MRI. All the code of the framework and the experiments are publicly available:
general-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software package (www.clinica.run)
