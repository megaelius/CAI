As 3D scanning devices and depth sensors mature, point clouds have attracted increasing attention
as a format for 3D object representation, with applications in various fields such as tele-presence,
navigation and heritage reconstruction. However, point clouds usually exhibit holes of missing
data, mainly due to the limitation of acquisition techniques and complicated structure. Further,
point clouds are defined on irregular non-Euclidean domains, which is challenging to address especially
with conventional signal processing tools. Hence, leveraging on recent advances in graph signal
processing, we propose an efficient point cloud inpainting method, exploiting both the local smoothness
and the non-local self-similarity in point clouds. Specifically, we first propose a frequency
interpretation in graph nodal domain, based on which we introduce the local graph-signal smoothness
prior in order to describe the local smoothness of point clouds. Secondly, we explore the characteristics
of non-local self-similarity, by globally searching for the most similar area to the missing region.
The similarity metric between two areas is defined based on the direct component and the anisotropic
graph total variation of normals in each area. Finally, we formulate the hole-filling step as an
optimization problem based on the selected most similar area and regularized by the graph-signal
smoothness prior. Besides, we propose voxelization and automatic hole detection methods for the
point cloud prior to inpainting. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms
four competing methods significantly, both in objective and subjective quality.
