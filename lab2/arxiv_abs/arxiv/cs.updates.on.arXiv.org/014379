Ant Credit Pay is a consumer credit service in Ant Financial Service Group. Similar to credit card,
loan default is one of the major risks of this credit product. Hence, effective algorithm for default
prediction is the key to losses reduction and profits increment for the company. However, the challenges
facing in our scenario are different from those in conventional credit card service. The first one
is scalability. The huge volume of users and their behaviors in Ant Financial requires the ability
to process industrial-scale data and perform model training efficiently. The second challenges
is the cold-start problem. Different from the manual review for credit card application in conventional
banks, the credit limit of Ant Credit Pay is automatically offered to users based on the knowledge
learned from big data. However, default prediction for new users is suffered from lack of enough
credit behaviors. It requires that the proposal should leverage other new data source to alleviate
the cold-start problem. Considering the above challenges and the special scenario in Ant Financial,
we try to incorporate default prediction with network information to alleviate the cold-start
problem. In this paper, we propose an industrial-scale distributed network representation framework,
termed NetDP, for default prediction in Ant Credit Pay. The proposal explores network information
generated by various interaction between users, and blends unsupervised and supervised network
representation in a unified framework for default prediction problem. Moreover, we present a parameter-server-based
distributed implement of our proposal to handle the scalability challenge. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal, especially in cold-start problem, as well as the
efficiency for industrial-scale dataset.
