Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has been regarded as one of the most promising technologies
for the future generation wireless networks because of its advantages of providing a ultra-wide
new spectrum and ultra-high data transmission rate. To reduce the power consumption and circuit
cost for mmWave systems, hybrid digital and analog (HDA) architecture is preferred in such a scenario.
In this paper, an artificial-noise (AN) aided secure HDA beamforming scheme is proposed for mmWave
MISO system with low resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and finite-quantized phase
shifters on RF. The additive quantization noise model for AN aided HDA system is established to make
an analysis of the secrecy performance of such systems. With the partial channel knowledge of eavesdropper
available, an approximate expression of secrecy rate (SR) is derived. Then using this approximation
formula, we propose a two-layer alternately iterative structure (TLAIS) for optimizing digital
precoder (DP) of confidential message (CM), digital AN projection matrix (DANPM) and analog precoder
(AP). The inner-layer iteration loop is to design the DP of CMs and DANPM alternatively given a fixed
matrix of AP. The outer-layer iteration loop is in between digital baseband part and analog part,
where the former refers to DP and DANPM, and the latter is AP. Then for a given digital part, we propose
a gradient ascent algorithm to find the vector of AP vector. Given a matrix of AP, we make use of general
power iteration (GPI) method to compute DP and DANPM. This process is repeated until the terminal
condition is reached. Simulation results show that the proposed TLAIS can achieve a better SR performance
compared to existing methods, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio region.
