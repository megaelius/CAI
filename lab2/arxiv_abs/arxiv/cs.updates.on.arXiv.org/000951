Motivated by [ arXiv:1309.0563 ], we provide a framework for studying the size of linear programming
formulations as well as semidefinite programming formulations of combinatorial optimization
problems without encoding them first as linear programs or semidefinite programs. This is done
via a factorization theorem for the optimization problem itself (and not a specific encoding of
such). As a result we can define the first consistent reduction mechanism that degrades approximation
factors in a controlled fashion and which, at the same time, is compatible with approximate linear
and semidefinite programming formulations. Moreover, our reduction mechanism is a minor restriction
of classical reductions establishing inapproximability in the context of PCP theorems. As a consequence
we can establish strong linear programming inapproximability (for LPs with a polynomial number
of constraints) for a host of problems, including VertexCover, Max-k-SAT, Max-2-CSP, Min-2-CNFDeletion
and several more. All of our results hold for bounded degree subgraphs or with bounded occurence
of literals. For example, we obtain a $3/2-\varepsilon$ inapproximability for VertexCover (which
is not of the CSP type) answering an open question in [ arXiv:1309.0563 ] and we answer a weak version
of our sparse graph conjecture posed in [ arXiv:1309.0563 ]. In those cases where previous bounds
follow from [ arXiv:1309.0563 ] we provide improvements by reducing directly from Max-2-XOR or
MaxCUT propagating the inapproximability within $1/2+\varepsilon$ that has been established
in [ arXiv:1309.0563 ]. In the case of SDPs, while an SDP-inapproximable base problem is unknown,
we obtain relative inapproximability results for those problems.
