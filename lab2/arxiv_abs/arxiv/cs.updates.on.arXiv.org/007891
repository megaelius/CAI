With conventional anti-jamming solutions like frequency hopping or spread spectrum, legitimate
transceivers often tend to "escape" or "hide" themselves from jammers. These reactive anti-jamming
approaches are constrained by the lack of timely knowledge of jamming attacks. Bringing together
the latest advances in neural network architectures and ambient backscattering communications,
this work allows wireless nodes to effectively "face" the jammer by first learning its jamming strategy,
then adapting the rate or transmitting information right on the jamming signal. Specifically,
to deal with unknown jamming attacks, existing work often relies on reinforcement learning algorithms,
e.g., Q-learning. However, the Q-learning algorithm is notorious for its slow convergence to the
optimal policy, especially when the system state and action spaces are large. This makes the Q-learning
algorithm pragmatically inapplicable. To overcome this problem, we design a novel deep reinforcement
learning algorithm using the recent dueling neural network architecture. Our proposed algorithm
allows the transmitter to effectively learn about the jammer and attain the optimal countermeasures
thousand times faster than that of the conventional Q-learning algorithm. Through extensive simulation
results, we show that our design (using ambient backscattering and the deep dueling neural network
architecture) can improve the average throughput by up to 426% and reduce the packet loss by 24%.
By augmenting the ambient backscattering capability on devices and using our algorithm, it is interesting
to observe that the (successful) transmission rate increases with the jamming power. Our proposed
solution can find its applications in both civil (e.g., ultra-reliable and low-latency communications
or URLLC) and military scenarios (to combat both inadvertent and deliberate jamming).
