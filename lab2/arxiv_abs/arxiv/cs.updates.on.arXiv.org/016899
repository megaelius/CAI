The effect of gender diversity in open source communities has gained increasing attention from
practitioners and researchers. For instance, organizations such as the Python Software Foundation
and the OpenStack Foundation started actions to increase gender diversity and promote women to
top positions in the communities. Although the general underrepresentation of women (a.k.a. horizontal
segregation) in open source communities has been explored in a number of research studies, little
is known about the vertical segregation in open source communities -- which occurs when there are
fewer women in high-level positions. To address this research gap, in this paper we present the results
of a mixed-methods study on gender diversity and work practices of core developers contributing
to open-source communities. In the first study, we used mining-software repositories procedures
to identify the core developers of 711 open source projects, in order to understand how common are
women core developers in open source communities and characterize their work practices. In the
second study, we surveyed the women core developers we identified in the first study to collect their
perceptions of gender diversity and gender bias they might have observed while contributing to
open source systems. Our findings show that open source communities present both horizontal and
vertical segregation (only 2.3% of the core developers are women). Nevertheless, differently
from previous studies, most of the women core developers (65.7%) report never having experienced
gender discrimination when contributing to an open source project. Finally, we did not note substantial
differences between the work practices among women and men core developers. We reflect on these
findings and present some ideas that might increase the participation of women in open source communities.
