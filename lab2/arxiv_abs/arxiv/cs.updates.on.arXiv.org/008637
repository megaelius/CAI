In this work, we give a short introduction on cough detection efforts that were undertaken during
the last decade and we describe the solution for automatic cough detection developed for the AioCare
portable spirometry system. As the system is intended to be used in a large variety of environments
and different patients, we train the algorithm using the large database of spirometry curves which
is the NHANES database by the American National Center for Health Statistics. Using such a massive
dataset is a novelty in the field. We apply few data preprocessing steps, derive specific features
and train different classifiers such as logistic regression (LR), feed forward artificial neural
network (ANN), artificial neural network combined with principal component analysis (PCA-ANN),
support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) on this data to choose the one of the best performance.
The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the classifiers were comparable and equaled within
the range 91.1{\div}91.2%, 81.8{\div}83.8% and 95.0{\div}95.9% for the test set, respectively.
The ANN solution was selected as the final classifier. Classification methodology developed in
this study is robust for detecting cough events during spirometry measurements. We also show that
it is universal and transferable between different systems as the performance on the NHANES and
the AioCare test sets is similar. As far as we know, the solution presented in this work is the first
description of the automatic cough detection algorithm based totally on the air flow signals and
the first cough detection implemented in the commercial spirometry system that is to be published.
