Exploration is a cornerstone both for machine learning algorithms and for science in general to
discover novel solutions, phenomena and behaviors. Intrinsically motivated goal exploration
processes (IMGEPs) were shown to enable autonomous agents to efficiently explore the diversity
of effects they can produce on their environment. With IMGEPs, agents self-define their own experiments
by imagining goals, then try to achieve them by leveraging their past discoveries. Progressively
they learn which goals are achievable. IMGEPs were shown to enable efficient discovery and learning
of diverse repertoires of skills in high-dimensional robots. In this article, we show that the IMGEP
framework can also be used in an entirely different application area: automated discovery of self-organized
patterns in complex morphogenetic systems. We also introduce a new IMGEP algorithm where goal representations
are learned online and incrementally (past approaches used precollected training data with batch
learning). For experimentation, we use Lenia, a continuous game-of-life cellular automaton.
We study how IMGEPs enable to discover a variety of complex self-organized visual patterns. We compare
random search and goal exploration methods with hand-defined, pretrained and online learned goal
spaces. The results show that goal exploration methods identify more diverse patterns compared
to random explorations. Moreover, the online learned goal spaces allow to successfully discover
interesting patterns similar to the ones manually identified by human experts. Our results exemplify
the ability of IMGEPs to discover novel structures and patterns in complex systems. We are optimistic
that their application will aid the understanding and discovery of new knowledge in various domains
of science and engineering.
