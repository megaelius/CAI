We consider the problem of segmentation and classification of high-resolution and hyperspectral
remote sensing images. Unlike conventional natural (RGB) images, the inherent large scale and
complex structures of remote sensing images pose major challenges such as spatial object distribution
diversity and spectral information extraction when existing models are directly applied for image
classification. In this study, we develop an attention-based pyramid network for segmentation
and classification of remote sensing datasets. Attention mechanisms are used to develop the following
modules: i) a novel and robust attention-based multi-scale fusion method effectively fuses useful
spatial or spectral information at different and same scales; ii) a region pyramid attention mechanism
using region-based attention addresses the target geometric size diversity in large-scale remote
sensing images; and iii cross-scale attention} in our adaptive atrous spatial pyramid pooling
network adapts to varied contents in a feature-embedded space. Different forms of feature fusion
pyramid frameworks are established by combining these attention-based modules. First, a novel
segmentation framework, called the heavy-weight spatial feature fusion pyramid network (FFPNet),
is proposed to address the spatial problem of high-resolution remote sensing images. Second, an
end-to-end spatial--spectral FFPNet is presented for classifying hyperspectral images. Experiments
conducted on ISPRS Vaihingen and ISPRS Potsdam high-resolution datasets demonstrate the competitive
segmentation accuracy achieved by the proposed heavy-weight spatial FFPNet. Furthermore, experiments
on the Indian Pines and the University of Pavia hyperspectral datasets indicate that the proposed
spatial--spectral FFPNet outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image classification.
