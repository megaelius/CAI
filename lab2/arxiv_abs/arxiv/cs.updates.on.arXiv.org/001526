VoIP is becoming a low-priced and efficient replacement for PSTN in communication industries.
With a widely growing adoption rate, SIP is an application layer signaling protocol, standardized
by the IETF, for creating, modifying, and terminating VoIP sessions. Generally speaking, SIP routes
a call request to its destination by using SIP proxies. With the increasing use of SIP, traditional
configurations pose certain drawbacks, such as ineffective routing, un-optimized management
of proxy resources (including CPU and memory), and overload conditions. This paper presents OpenSIP
to upgrade the SIP network framework with emerging technologies, such as SDN and NFV. SDN provides
for management that decouples the data and control planes along with a software-based centralized
control that results in effective routing and resource management. Moreover, NFV assists SDN by
virtualizing various network devices and functions. However, current SDN elements limit the inspected
fields to layer 2-4 headers, whereas SIP routing information resides in the layer-7 header. A benefit
of OpenSIP is that it enforces policies on SIP networking that are agnostic to higher layers with
the aid of a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) engine. Among the benefits of OpenSIP is programmability,
cost reduction, unified management, routing, as well as efficient load balancing. The present
study implements OpenSIP on a real testbed which includes Open vSwitch and the Floodlight controller.
The results show that the proposed architecture has a low overhead and satisfactory performance
and, in addition, can take advantage of a flexible scale-out design during application deployment.
