Mobile robots, especially unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are of increasing interest for surveillance
and disaster response scenarios. We consider the problem of multi-robot persistent surveillance
with connectivity constraints where robots have to visit sensing locations periodically and maintain
a multi-hop connection to a base station. We formally define several problem instances closely
related to multi-robot persistent surveillance with connectivity constraints, i.e., connectivity-constrained
multi-robot persistent surveillance (CMPS), connectivity-constrained multi-robot reachability
(CMR), and connectivity-constrained multi-robot reachability with relay dropping (CMRD), and
show that they are all NP-hard on general graph. We introduce three heuristics with different planning
horizons for convex grid graphs and combine these with a tree traversal approach which can be applied
to a partitioning of non-convex grid graphs (CMPS with tree traversal, CMPSTT). In simulation studies
we show that a short horizon greedy approach, which requires parameters to be optimized beforehand,
can outperform a full horizon approach, which requires a tour through all sensing locations, if
the number of robots is larger than the minimum number of robots required to reach all sensing locations.
The minimum number required is the number of robots necessary for building a chain to the farthest
sensing location from the base station. Furthermore, we show that partitioning the area and applying
the tree traversal approach can achieve a performance similar to the unpartitioned case up to a certain
number of robots but requires less optimization time.
