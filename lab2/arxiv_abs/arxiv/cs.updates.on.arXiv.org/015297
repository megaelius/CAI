In the future we can expect that artificial intelligent agents, once deployed, will be required
to learn continually from their experience during their operational lifetime. Such agents will
also need to communicate with humans and other agents regarding the content of their experience,
in the context of passing along their learnings, for the purpose of explaining their actions in specific
circumstances or simply to relate more naturally to humans concerning experiences the agent acquires
that are not necessarily related to their assigned tasks. We argue that to support these goals, an
agent would benefit from an episodic memory; that is, a memory that encodes the agent's experience
in such a way that the agent can relive the experience, communicate about it and use its past experience,
inclusive of the agents own past actions, to learn more effective models and policies. In this short
paper, we propose one potential approach to provide an AI agent with such capabilities. We draw upon
the ever-growing body of work examining the function and operation of the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL)
in mammals to guide us in adding an episodic memory capability to an AI agent composed of artificial
neural networks (ANNs). Based on that, we highlight important aspects to be considered in the memory
organization and we propose an architecture combining ANNs and standard Computer Science techniques
for supporting storage and retrieval of episodic memories. Despite being initial work, we hope
this short paper can spark discussions around the creation of intelligent agents with memory or,
at least, provide a different point of view on the subject.
