This paper is motivated by the task of detecting anomalies in networks of financial transactions,
with accounts as nodes and a directed weighted edge between two nodes denoting a money transfer.
The weight of the edge is the transaction amount. Examples of anomalies in networks include long
paths of large transaction amounts, rings of large payments, and cliques of accounts. There are
many methods available which detect such specific structures in networks. Here we introduce a method
which is able to detect previously unspecified anomalies in networks. The method is based on a combination
of features from network comparison and spectral analysis as well as local statistics, yielding
140 main features. We then use a simple feature sum method, as well as a random forest method, in order
to classify nodes as normal or anomalous. We test the method first on synthetic networks which we
generated, and second on a set of synthetic networks which were generated without the methods team
having access to the ground truth. The first set of synthetic networks was split in a training set
of 70 percent of the networks, and a test set of 30 percent of the networks. The resulting classifier
was then applied to the second set of synthetic networks. We compare our method with Oddball, a widely
used method for anomaly detection in networks, as well as to random classification. While Oddball
outperforms random classification, both our feature sum method and our random forest method outperform
Oddball. On the test set, the random forest outperforms feature sum, whereas on the second synthetic
data set, initially feature sum tends to pick up more anomalies than random forest, with this behaviour
reversing for lower-scoring anomalies. In all cases, the top 2 percent of flagged anomalies contained
on average over 90 percent of the planted anomalies.
