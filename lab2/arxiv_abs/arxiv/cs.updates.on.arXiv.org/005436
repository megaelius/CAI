Communications based solely on radio frequency (RF) networks cannot provide adequate quality
of service for the rapidly growing demands of wireless connectivity. Since devices operating in
the optical spectrum do not interfere with those using the RF spectrum, wireless networks based
on the optical spectrum can be added to existing RF networks to fulfill this demand. Hence, optical
wireless communication (OWC) technology can be an excellent complement to RF-based technology
to provide improved service. Promising OWC systems include light fidelity (LiFi), visible light
communication, optical camera communication (OCC), and free-space optical communication (FSOC).
OWC and RF systems have differing limitations, and the integration of RF and optical wireless networks
can overcome the limitations of both systems. This paper describes an LiFi/femtocell hybrid network
system for indoor environments. Low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios and the shortage
bandwidth problems of existing RF femtocell networks can be overcome with the proposed hybrid model.
Moreover, we describe an integrated RF/optical wireless system that can be employed for users inside
a vehicle, remote monitoring of ambulance patients, vehicle tracking, and vehicle-to-vehicle
communications. We consider LiFi, OCC, and FSOC as the optical wireless technologies to be used
for communication support in transportation, and assume macrocells, femtocells, and wireless
fidelity to be the corresponding RF technologies. We describe handover management-including
detailed call flow, interference management, link reliability improvement, and group handover
provisioning-for integrated networks. Performance analyses demonstrate the significance of
the proposed integrated RF/optical wireless systems.
