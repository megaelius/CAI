Background: Evolution of open source projects frequently depends on a small number of core developers.
The loss of such core developers might be detrimental for projects and even threaten their entire
continuation. However, it is possible that new core developers assume the project maintenance
and allow the project to survive. Aims: The objective of this paper is to provide empirical evidence
on: 1) the frequency of project abandonment and survival, 2) the differences between abandoned
and surviving projects, and 3) the motivation and difficulties faced when assuming an abandoned
project. Method: We adopt a mixed-methods approach to investigate project abandonment and survival.
We carefully select 1,932 popular GitHub projects and recover the abandoned and surviving projects,
and conduct a survey with developers that have been instrumental in the survival of the projects.
Results: We found that 315 projects (16%) were abandoned and 128 of these projects (41%) survived
because of new core developers who assumed the project development. The survey indicates that (i)
in most cases the new maintainers were aware of the project abandonment risks when they started to
contribute; (ii) their own usage of the systems is the main motivation to contribute to such projects;
(iii) human and social factors played a key role when making these contributions; and (iv) lack of
time and the difficulty to obtain push access to the repositories are the main barriers faced by them.
Conclusions: Project abandonment is a reality even in large open source projects and our work enables
a better understanding of such risks, as well as highlights ways in avoiding them.
