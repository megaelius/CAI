The internet has enabled collaborations at a scale never before possible, but the best practices
for organizing such large collaborations are still not clear. Wikipedia is a visible and successful
example of such a collaboration which might offer insight into what makes large-scale, decentralized
collaborations successful. We analyze the relationship between the structural properties of
WikiProject coeditor networks and the performance and efficiency of those projects. We confirm
the existence of an overall performance-efficiency trade-off, while observing that some projects
are higher than others in both performance and efficiency, suggesting the existence factors correlating
positively with both. Namely, we find an association between low-degree coeditor networks and
both high performance and high efficiency. We also confirm results seen in previous numerical and
small-scale lab studies: higher performance with less skewed node distributions, and higher performance
with shorter path lengths. We use agent-based models to explore possible mechanisms for degree-dependent
performance and efficiency. We present a novel local-majority learning strategy designed to satisfy
properties of real-world collaborations. The local-majority strategy as well as a localized conformity-based
strategy both show degree-dependent performance and efficiency, but in opposite directions,
suggesting that these factors depend on both network structure and learning strategy. Our results
suggest possible benefits to decentralized collaborations made of smaller, more tightly-knit
teams, and that these benefits may be modulated by the particular learning strategies in use.
