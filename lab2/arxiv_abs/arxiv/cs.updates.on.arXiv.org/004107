Precise segmentation of bladder walls and tumor regions is an essential step towards non-invasive
identification of tumor stage and grade, which is critical for treatment decision and prognosis
of patients with bladder cancer (BC). However, the automatic delineation of bladder walls and tumor
in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is a challenging task, due to important bladder shape variations,
strong intensity inhomogeneity in urine and very high variability across population, particularly
on tumors appearance. To tackle these issues, we propose to use a deep fully convolutional neural
network. The proposed network includes dilated convolutions to increase the receptive field without
incurring extra cost nor degrading its performance. Furthermore, we introduce progressive dilations
in each convolutional block, thereby enabling extensive receptive fields without the need for
large dilation rates. The proposed network is evaluated on 3.0T T2-weighted MRI scans from 60 pathologically
confirmed patients with BC. Experiments shows the proposed model to achieve high accuracy, with
a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.98, 0.84 and 0.69 for inner wall, outer wall and tumor region,
respectively. These results represent a very good agreement with reference contours and an increase
in performance compared to existing methods. In addition, inference times are less than a second
for a whole 3D volume, which is between 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than related state-of-the-art
methods for this application. We showed that a CNN can yield precise segmentation of bladder walls
and tumors in bladder cancer patients on MRI. The whole segmentation process is fully-automatic
and yields results in very good agreement with the reference standard, demonstrating the viability
of deep learning models for the automatic multi-region segmentation of bladder cancer MRI images.
