Providing an accurate evaluation of palm tree plantation in a large region can bring meaningful
impacts in both economic and ecological aspects. However, the enormous spatial scale and the variety
of geological features across regions has made it a grand challenge with limited solutions based
on manual human monitoring efforts. Although deep learning based algorithms have demonstrated
potential in forming an automated approach in recent years, the labelling efforts needed for covering
different features in different regions largely constrain its effectiveness in large-scale problems.
In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptive oil palm tree detection method, i.e., a Multi-level
Attention Domain Adaptation Network (MADAN) to reap cross-regional oil palm tree counting and
detection. MADAN consists of 4 procedures: First, we adopted a batch-instance normalization network
(BIN) based feature extractor for improving the generalization ability of the model, integrating
batch normalization and instance normalization. Second, we embedded a multi-level attention
mechanism (MLA) into our architecture for enhancing the transferability, including a feature
level attention and an entropy level attention. Then we designed a minimum entropy regularization
(MER) to increase the confidence of the classifier predictions through assigning the entropy level
attention value to the entropy penalty. Finally, we employed a sliding window-based prediction
and an IOU based post-processing approach to attain the final detection results. We conducted comprehensive
ablation experiments using three different satellite images of large-scale oil palm plantation
area with six transfer tasks. MADAN improves the detection accuracy by 14.98% in terms of average
F1-score compared with the Baseline method (without DA), and performs 3.55%-14.49% better than
existing domain adaptation methods.
