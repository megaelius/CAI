Art Gallery is a fundamental visibility problem in Computational Geometry. The input consists
of a simple polygon P, (possibly infinite) sets G and C of points within P, and an integer k; the task
is to decide if at most k guards can be placed on points in G so that every point in C is visible to at least
one guard. In the classic formulation of Art Gallery, G and C consist of all the points within P. Other
well-known variants restrict G and C to consist either of all the points on the boundary of P or of all
the vertices of P. Recently, three new important discoveries were made: the above mentioned variants
of Art Gallery are all W[1]-hard with respect to k [Bonnet and Miltzow, ESA'16], the classic variant
has an O(log k)-approximation algorithm [Bonnet and Miltzow, SoCG'17], and it may require irrational
guards [Abrahamsen et al., SoCG'17]. Building upon the third result, the classic variant and the
case where G consists only of all the points on the boundary of P were both shown to be \exists R-complete~[Abrahamsen
et al., STOC'18]. Even when both G and C consist only of all the points on the boundary of P, the problem
is not known to be in NP. Given the first discovery, the following question was posed by Giannopoulos
[Lorentz Center Workshop, 2016]: Is Art Gallery FPT with respect to r, the number of reflex vertices?
We focus on the variant where G and C are all the vertices of P, called Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery. We
show that Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery is solvable in time r^{O(r^2)}n^{O(1)}. Our approach also
extends to assert that Vertex-Boundary Art Gallery and Boundary-Vertex Art Gallery are both FPT.
We utilize structural properties of "almost convex polygons" to present a two-stage reduction
from Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery to a new constraint satisfaction problem (whose solution is also
provided in this paper) where constraints have arity 2 and involve monotone functions.
