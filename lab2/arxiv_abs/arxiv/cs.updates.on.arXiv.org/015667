Open bisimilarity is a notion of bisimilarity for the pi-calculus that is a congruence. Open bisimilarity
is defined for process terms in which free variables may appear, i.e., process terms are open. Free
variables may be influenced by an observer and can be instantiated lazily; in contrast to early and
late bisimilarity which both assume process terms are built from distinct ground names. We build
on the established line of work, due to Milner, Parrow, and Walker, on classical modal logics characterising
early and late bisimilarity for the pi-calculus. The important insight is, in order to characterise
open bisimilarity, we move to the setting of intuitionistic modal logics. The intuitionistic modal
logic introduced, called OM, is such that modalities are closed under substitutions, which induces
a property known as intuitionistic hereditary. Intuitionistic hereditary reflects in logic the
lazy instantiation of free variables performed by open bisimilarity. The soundness proof for open
bisimilarity with respect to our intuitionistic modal logic is mechanised in Abella. The constructive
content of the completeness proof provides an algorithm for generating distinguishing formulae,
where such formulae are useful as certificates explaining why two processes are not open bisimilar.
The algorithm for generating distinguishing formulae has been implemented in a prototype tool.
We draw attention to the fact that open bisimilarity is not a canonical notion of bisimilarity congruence
for open pi-calculus processes: there is a spectrum of bisimilarity congruences that can be characterised
by variants of our intuitionistic modal logic, notably open barbed bisimilarity.
