Accurate and efficient numerical simulation of unconventional reservoirs is challenging. Long
periods of transient flow and steep potential gradients occur due to the extreme conductivity contrast
between matrix and fracture. Detailed near-well/near-fracture models are necessary to provide
sufficient resolution, but they are computationally impractical for field cases with multiple
fracture stages. Previous works in the literature of unconventional simulations mainly focus
on gridding level that adapts to wells and fractures. Limited research has been conducted on nonlinear
strategies that exploit locality across timesteps and nonlinear iterations. To perform localized
computations, an a-priori strategy is essential to first determine the active subset of simulation
cells for the subsequent iteration. The active set flags the cells that will be updated, and then
the corresponding localized linear system is solved. This work develops localization methods
that are readily applicable to complex fracture networks and flow physics in unconventional reservoirs.
By utilizing the diffusive nature of pressure updates, an adaptive algorithm is proposed to make
adequate estimates for the active domains. In addition, we develop a localized solver based on nonlinear
domain decomposition (DD). Comparing to a standard DD method, domain partitions are dynamically
constructed. The new solver provides effective partitioning that adapts to flow dynamics and Newton
updates. We evaluate the developed methods using several complex problems with discrete fracture
networks. The results show that large degrees of solution locality present across timesteps and
iterations. Comparing to a standard Newton solver, the new solvers enable superior computational
performance. Moreover, Newton convergence behavior is preserved, without any impact on solution
accuracy.
