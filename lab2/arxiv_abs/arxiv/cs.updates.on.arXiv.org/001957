We study approximations of the partition function of dense graphical models. Partition functions
of graphical models play a fundamental role is statistical physics, in statistics and in machine
learning. Two of the main methods for approximating the partition function are Markov Chain Monte
Carlo and Variational Methods. An impressive body of work in mathematics, physics and theoretical
computer science provides conditions under which Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods converge in
polynomial time. These methods often lead to polynomial time approximation algorithms for the
partition function in cases where the underlying model exhibits correlation decay. There are very
few theoretical guarantees for the performance of variational methods. One exception is recent
results by Risteski (2016) who considered dense graphical models and showed that using variational
methods, it is possible to find an $O(\epsilon n)$ additive approximation to the log partition function
in time $n^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ even in a regime where correlation decay does not hold. We show that
under essentially the same conditions, an $O(\epsilon n)$ additive approximation of the log partition
function can be found in constant time, independent of $n$. In particular, our results cover dense
Ising and Potts models as well as dense graphical models with $k$-wise interaction. They also apply
for low threshold rank models. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first to give a constant
time approximation to log partition functions and the first to use the algorithmic regularity lemma
for estimating partition functions. As an application of our results we derive a constant time algorithm
for approximating the magnetization of Ising and Potts model on dense graphs.
