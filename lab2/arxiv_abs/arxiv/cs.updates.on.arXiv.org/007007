Successful soft robot modeling approaches appearing in recent literature have been based on a variety
of distinct theories, including traditional robotic theory, continuum mechanics, and machine
learning. Though specific modeling techniques have been developed for and validated against already
realized systems, their strengths and weaknesses have not been explicitly compared against each
other. In this paper, we show how three distinct model structures ---a lumped-parameter model,
a continuum mechanical model, and a neural network--- compare in capturing the gross trends and
specific features of the force generation of soft robotic actuators. In particular, we study models
for Fiber Reinforced Elastomeric Enclosures (FREEs), which are a popular choice of soft actuator
and that are used in several soft articulated systems, including soft manipulators, exoskeletons,
grippers, and locomoting soft robots. We generated benchmark data by testing eight FREE samples
that spanned broad design and kinematic spaces and compared the models on their ability to predict
the loading-deformation relationships of these samples. This comparison shows the predictive
capabilities of each model on individual actuators and each model's generalizability across the
design space. While the neural net achieved the highest peak performance, the first principles-based
models generalized best across all actuator design parameters tested. The results highlight the
essential roles of mathematical structure and experimental parameter determination in building
high-performing, generalizable soft actuator models with varying effort invested in system identification.
