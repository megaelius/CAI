The study of parameterized streaming complexity on graph problems was initiated by Fafianie et
al. (MFCS'14) and Chitnis et al. (SODA'15 and SODA'16). Simply put, the main goal is to design streaming
algorithms for parameterized problems such that $O\left(f(k)\log^{O(1)}n\right)$ space is
enough, where $f$ is an arbitrary computable function depending only on the parameter $k$. However,
in the past few years, very few positive results have been established. Most of the graph problems
that do have streaming algorithms of the above nature are ones where localized checking is required,
like Vertex Cover or Maximum Matching parameterized by the size $k$ of the solution we are seeking.
Many important parameterized problems that form the backbone of traditional parameterized complexity
are known to require $\Omega(n)$ bits for any streaming algorithm; e.g., Feedback Vertex Set, Even/Odd
Cycle Transversal, Triangle Deletion or the more general ${\cal F}$-Subgraph Deletion when parameterized
by solution size $k$. Our main conceptual contribution is to overcome the obstacles to efficient
parameterized streaming algorithms by utilizing the power of parameterization. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work in parameterized streaming complexity that considers structural
parameters instead of the solution size as a parameter. We focus on the vertex cover size $K$ as the
parameter for the parameterized graph deletion problems we consider. At the same time, most of the
previous work in parameterized streaming complexity was restricted to the EA (edge arrival) or
DEA (dynamic edge arrival) models. In this work, we consider the above mentioned graph deletion
problems in the four most well-studied streaming models, i.e., the EA, DEA, VA (vertex arrival)
and AL (adjacency list) models.
