Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms
that are transforming social organization on and offline. Issues of governance in these Internet
platforms and other digital institutions have posed a challenge for software engineers, many of
whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. Here, we offer
one useful framework with an aim to stimulate dialogue between computer scientists and political
scientists. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer
interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an
incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm, a collection of atheoretical approaches
such as A/B-testing, and incremental issue-driven software engineering. One institutional analysis
framework that has been useful in the design of traditional institutions is the body of resource
governance literature known as the ``Ostrom Workshop''. A key finding of this literature that has
yet to be broadly incorporated in the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including
participatory change process mechanisms in what is called a ``constitutional layer'' of institutional
design---in other words, defining rules that allow and facilitate diverse stakeholder participation
in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent this consideration
is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis
informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows
us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital
institutions.
