We describe an annotation initiative to capture the scholarly contributions in natural language
processing (NLP) articles, particularly, for the articles that discuss machine learning (ML)
approaches for various information extraction tasks. We develop the annotation task based on a
pilot annotation exercise on 50 NLP-ML scholarly articles presenting contributions to five information
extraction tasks 1. machine translation, 2. named entity recognition, 3. question answering,
4. relation classification, and 5. text classification. In this article, we describe the outcomes
of this pilot annotation phase. Through the exercise we have obtained an annotation methodology;
and found eight core information units that reflect the contribution of the NLP-ML scholarly investigations.
The resulting annotation scheme we developed based on these information units is called NLPContributions.
The overarching goal of our endeavor is four-fold: 1) to find a systematic set of patterns of subject-predicate-object
statements for the semantic structuring of scholarly contributions that are more or less generically
applicable for NLP-ML research articles; 2) to apply the discovered patterns in the creation of
a larger annotated dataset for training machine readers of research contributions; 3) to ingest
the dataset into the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) infrastructure as a showcase for creating
user-friendly state-of-the-art overviews; 4) to integrate the machine readers into the ORKG to
assist users in the manual curation of their respective article contributions. We envision that
the NLPContributions methodology engenders a wider discussion on the topic toward its further
refinement and development. Our pilot annotated dataset of 50 NLP-ML scholarly articles according
to the NLPContributions scheme is openly available to the research community at https://github.com/jenlindadsouza/NLPContributions.
