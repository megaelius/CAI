Current popular methods for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprint (MRF) recovery are bottlenecked by
the heavy computations of a matched-filtering step due to the growing size and complexity of the
fingerprint dictionaries in multi-parametric quantitative MRI applications. We address this
shortcoming by arranging dictionary atoms in the form of cover tree structures and adopt the corresponding
fast approximate nearest neighbour searches to accelerate matched-filtering. For datasets belonging
to smooth low-dimensional manifolds cover trees offer search complexities logarithmic in terms
of data population. With this motivation we propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm, named
CoverBLIP, to address large-size MRF problems where the fingerprint dictionary i.e. discrete
manifold of Bloch responses, encodes several intrinsic NMR parameters. We study different forms
of convergence for this algorithm and we show that provided with a notion of embedding, the inexact
and non-convex iterations of CoverBLIP linearly convergence toward a near-global solution with
the same order of accuracy as using exact brute-force searches. Our further examinations on both
synthetic and real-world datasets and using different sampling strategies, indicates between
2 to 3 orders of magnitude reduction in total search computations. Cover trees are robust against
the curse-of-dimensionality and therefore CoverBLIP provides a notion of scalability -- a consistent
gain in time-accuracy performance-- for searching high-dimensional atoms which may not be easily
preprocessed (i.e. for dimensionality reduction) due to the increasing degrees of non-linearities
appearing in the emerging multi-parametric MRF dictionaries.
