Acute stroke lesion segmentation and prediction tasks are of great clinical interest as they can
help doctors make better informed time-critical treatment decisions. Automatic segmentation
of these lesions is a complex task due to their heterogeneous appearance, dynamic evolution and
inter-patient differences. Typically, acute stroke lesion tasks are approached with methods
developed for chronic stroke or other brain lesions. However, the pathophysiology and anatomy
of acute stroke establishes an inherently different problem that needs special consideration.
In this work, we propose a novel deep learning architecture specially designed for acute stroke
tasks that involve approximating complex non-linear functions with reduced data. Within our strategy,
class imbalance is tackled using a hybrid strategy based on state-of-the-art train sampling strategies
designed for other brain lesion related tasks, which is more suited to the anatomy and pathophysiology
of acute stroke lesions. The proposed method is evaluated on three unrelated public international
challenge datasets (ISLES) without any dataset specific hyper-parameter tuning. These involve
the tasks of sub-acute stroke lesion segmentation, acute stroke penumbra estimation and chronic
extent prediction from acute MR images. The performance of the proposed architecture is analysed
both against similar deep learning architectures from chronic stroke and related biomedical tasks
and also by submitting the segmented test images for blind online evaluation on each of the challenges.
When compared with the rest of submitted strategies, our method achieves top-rank performance
among the best submitted entries in all the three challenges, showing its capability to deal with
different unrelated tasks without hyper-parameter tuning. In order to promote the reproducibility
of our results, a public version of the proposed method has been released.
