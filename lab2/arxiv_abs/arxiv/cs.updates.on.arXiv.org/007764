Providing resources to different users or applications is fundamental to cloud computing. This
is a challenging problem as a cloud service provider may have insufficient resources to satisfy
all user requests. Furthermore, allocating available resources optimally to different applications
is also challenging. Resource sharing among different cloud service providers can improve resource
availability and resource utilization as certain cloud service providers may have free resources
available that can be ``rented'' by other service providers. However, different cloud service
providers can have different objectives or \emph{utilities}. Therefore, there is a need for a framework
that can share and allocate resources in an efficient and effective way, while taking into account
the objectives of various service providers that results in a \emph{multi-objective optimization}
problem. In this paper, we present a \emph{Cooperative Game Theory} (CGT) based framework for resource
sharing and allocation among different service providers with varying objectives that form a coalition.
We show that the resource sharing problem can be modeled as an $N-$player \emph{canonical} cooperative
game with \emph{non-transferable utility} (NTU) and prove that the game is convex for monotonic
non-decreasing utilities. We propose an $\mathcal{O}({N})$ algorithm that provides an allocation
from the \emph{core}, hence guaranteeing \emph{Pareto optimality}. We evaluate the performance
of our proposed resource sharing framework in a number of simulation settings and show that our proposed
framework improves user satisfaction and utility of service providers.
