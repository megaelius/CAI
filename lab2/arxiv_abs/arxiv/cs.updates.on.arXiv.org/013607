Accurate predictions of reactive mixing are critical for many Earth and environmental science
problems. To investigate mixing dynamics over time under different scenarios, a high-fidelity,
finite-element-based numerical model is built to solve the fast, irreversible bimolecular reaction-diffusion
equations to simulate a range of reactive-mixing scenarios. A total of 2,315 simulations are performed
using different sets of model input parameters comprising various spatial scales of vortex structures
in the velocity field, time-scales associated with velocity oscillations, the perturbation parameter
for the vortex-based velocity, anisotropic dispersion contrast, and molecular diffusion. Outputs
comprise concentration profiles of the reactants and products. The inputs and outputs of these
simulations are concatenated into feature and label matrices, respectively, to train 20 different
machine learning (ML) emulators to approximate system behavior. The 20 ML emulators based on linear
methods, Bayesian methods, ensemble learning methods, and multilayer perceptron (MLP), are compared
to assess these models. The ML emulators are specifically trained to classify the state of mixing
and predict three quantities of interest (QoIs) characterizing species production, decay, and
degree of mixing. Linear classifiers and regressors fail to reproduce the QoIs; however, ensemble
methods (classifiers and regressors) and the MLP accurately classify the state of reactive mixing
and the QoIs. Among ensemble methods, random forest and decision-tree-based AdaBoost faithfully
predict the QoIs. At run time, trained ML emulators are $\approx10^5$ times faster than the high-fidelity
numerical simulations. Speed and accuracy of the ensemble and MLP models facilitate uncertainty
quantification, which usually requires 1,000s of model run, to estimate the uncertainty bounds
on the QoIs.
