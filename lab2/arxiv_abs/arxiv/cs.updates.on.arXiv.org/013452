The problem of anonymous communications is to hide the fact that Alice is communicating with Bob
at all, rather than the contents of her communications. More formally, the scenario in which Alice
sends a message to Bob should be indistinguishable from the one in which Alice sends a message to Carol
instead. While many cryptographic constructions (e.g., blind signatures, anonymous credentials
and blockchains) assume anonymous channels as a starting point, there are significant drawbacks
to all known protocols that aim to achieve them in the standard active adversary setting where the
adversary can observe the network traffic on all links and, additionally, control a constant fraction
of the parties. Onion routing is the most promising approach to anonymous channels. In onion routing,
messages are sent via intermediaries and wrapped in layers of encryption, resulting in so-called
"onions"; each intermediary's task is to "peel off" a layer of encryption and send the resulting
onion to the next intermediary or to its final destination. In this paper, we initiate a rigorous
theoretical study of onion routing. We consider the "simple input-output setting" where each participant
desires to send a fixed-length message to a unique interlocutor and show that in this setting: - For
an onion routing protocol to be anonymous and fault-tolerant, each party must transmit, on average,
a polylogarithmic (in the security parameter) number of onions during an execution of the protocol.
- There exists an onion routing protocol that is anonymous and fault-tolerant such that each party
transmits only a polylogarithmic (in the security parameter) number of onions during an execution
of the protocol.
