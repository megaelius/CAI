Face restoration from low resolution and noise is important for applications of face analysis recognition.
However, most existing face restoration models omit the multiple scale issues in face restoration
problem, which is still not well-solved in research area. In this paper, we propose a Sequential
Gating Ensemble Network (SGEN) for multi-scale noise robust face restoration issue. To endow the
network with multi-scale representation ability, we first employ the principle of ensemble learning
for SGEN network architecture designing. The SGEN aggregates multi-level base-encoders and base-decoders
into the network, which enables the network to contain multiple scales of receptive field. Instead
of combining these base-en/decoders directly with non-sequential operations, the SGEN takes
base-en/decoders from different levels as sequential data. Specifically, it is visualized that
SGEN learns to sequentially extract high level information from base-encoders in bottom-up manner
and restore low level information from base-decoders in top-down manner. Besides, we propose to
realize bottom-up and top-down information combination and selection with Sequential Gating
Unit (SGU). The SGU sequentially takes information from two different levels as inputs and decides
the output based on one active input. Experiment results on benchmark dataset demonstrate that
our SGEN is more effective at multi-scale human face restoration with more image details and less
noise than state-of-the-art image restoration models. Further utilizing adversarial training
scheme, SGEN also produces more visually preferred results than other models under subjective
evaluation.
