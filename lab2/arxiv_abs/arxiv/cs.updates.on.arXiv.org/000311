We study the topic of dimensionality reduction for k-means clustering. Dimensionality reduction
encompasses the union of two approaches: feature selection and feature extraction. A feature selection
based algorithm for k-means clustering selects a small subset of the input features and then applies
k-means clustering on the selected features. A feature extraction based algorithm for k-means
constructs a small set of new artificial features and then applies k-means clustering on the constructed
features. Despite the significance of k-means clustering as well as the wealth of heuristic methods
addressing it, there are no provably accurate feature selection methods for k-means clustering
known. On the other hand, two provably accurate feature extraction methods for k-means clustering
are known in the literature; one is based on random projections and the other is based on the singular
value decomposition (SVD). This paper makes further progress towards a better understanding of
dimensionality reduction methods for k-means clustering. Namely, we present the first provably
accurate feature selection method for k-means clustering and, in addition, we present two feature
extraction methods. The first feature extraction method is based on random projections and it improves
upon the existing results in terms of time complexity and number of features needed to be extracted.
The second feature extraction method is based on fast approximate SVD factorizations and it also
improves upon the existing results in terms of time complexity. The proposed algorithms are randomized
and provide constant-factor approximation guarantees with respect to the optimal k-means objective
value.
