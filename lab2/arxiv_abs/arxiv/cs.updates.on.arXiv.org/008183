Although the fifth-generation (5G) technologies will significantly improve the spectrum and
energy efficiency of today's wireless communication networks, their high complexity and hardware
cost as well as increasingly more energy consumption are still crucial issues to be solved. Furthermore,
despite that such technologies are generally capable of adapting to the space and time varying wireless
environment, the signal propagation over it is essentially random and largely uncontrollable.
Recently, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been proposed as a revolutionizing solution
to address this open issue, by smartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment with
the use of massive low-cost, passive, reflective elements integrated on a planar surface. Specifically,
different elements of an IRS can independently reflect the incident signal by controlling its amplitude
and/or phase and thereby collaboratively achieve fine-grained three-dimensional (3D) passive
beamforming for signal enhancement or cancellation. In this article, we provide an overview of
the IRS technology, including its main applications in wireless communication, competitive advantages
over existing technologies, hardware architecture as well as the corresponding new signal model.
We focus on the key challenges in designing and implementing the new IRS-aided hybrid (with both
active and passive components) wireless network, as compared to the traditional network comprising
active components only. Furthermore, numerical results are provided to show the potential for
significant performance enhancement with the use of IRS in typical wireless network scenarios.
