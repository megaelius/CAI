We propose a theoretical framework to capture incremental solutions to cardinality constrained
maximization problems. The defining characteristic of our framework is that the cardinality/support
of the solution is bounded by a value $k\in\mathbb{N}$ that grows over time, and we allow the solution
to be extended one element at a time. We investigate the best-possible competitive ratio of such
an incremental solution, i.e., the worst ratio over all $k$ between the incremental solution after
$k$ steps and an optimum solution of cardinality $k$. We define a large class of problems that contains
many important cardinality constrained maximization problems like maximum matching, knapsack,
and packing/covering problems. We provide a general $2.618$-competitive incremental algorithm
for this class of problems, and show that no algorithm can have competitive ratio below $2.18$ in
general. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the inherently incremental greedy algorithm
that increases the objective value as much as possible in each step. This algorithm is known to be
$1.58$-competitive for submodular objective functions, but it has unbounded competitive ratio
for the class of incremental problems mentioned above. We define a relaxed submodularity condition
for the objective function, capturing problems like maximum (weighted) ($b$-)matching and a variant
of the maximum flow problem. We show that the greedy algorithm has competitive ratio (exactly) $2.313$
for the class of problems that satisfy this relaxed submodularity condition. Note that our upper
bounds on the competitive ratios translate to approximation ratios for the underlying cardinality
constrained problems.
