In this thesis, we draw inspiration from both classical system identification and modern machine
learning in order to solve estimation problems for real-world, physical systems. The main approach
to estimation and learning adopted is optimization based. Concepts such as regularization will
be utilized for encoding of prior knowledge and basis-function expansions will be used to add nonlinear
modeling power while keeping data requirements practical. The thesis covers a wide range of applications,
many inspired by applications within robotics, but also extending outside this already wide field.
Usage of the proposed methods and algorithms are in many cases illustrated in the real-world applications
that motivated the research. Topics covered include dynamics modeling and estimation, model-based
reinforcement learning, spectral estimation, friction modeling and state estimation and calibration
in robotic machining. In the work on modeling and identification of dynamics, we develop regularization
strategies that allow us to incorporate prior domain knowledge into flexible, overparameterized
models. We make use of classical control theory to gain insight into training and regularization
while using flexible tools from modern deep learning. A particular focus of the work is to allow use
of modern methods in scenarios where gathering data is associated with a high cost. In the robotics-inspired
parts of the thesis, we develop methods that are practically motivated and ensure that they are implementable
also outside the research setting. We demonstrate this by performing experiments in realistic
settings and providing open-source implementations of all proposed methods and algorithms.
