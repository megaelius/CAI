Effect systems are lightweight extensions to type systems that can verify a wide range of important
properties with modest developer burden. But our general understanding of effect systems is limited
primarily to systems where the order of effects is irrelevant. Understanding such systems in terms
of a semilattice of effects grounds understanding of the essential issues, and provides guidance
when designing new effect systems. By contrast, sequential effect systems -- where the order of
effects is important -- lack an established algebraic structure on effects. We present an abstract
polymorphic effect system parameterized by an effect quantale -- an algebraic structure with well-defined
properties that can model the effects of a range of existing sequential effect systems. We define
effect quantales, derive useful properties, and show how they cleanly model a variety of known sequential
effect systems. We show that for most effect quantales, there is a free, general notion of iterating
a sequential effect; that for systems we consider the derived iteration agrees with the manually
designed iteration operators in prior work; and that this induced notion of iteration is as precise
as possible when defined. We also position effect quantales with respect to work on categorical
semantics for sequential effect systems, clarifying the distinctions between these systems and
our own. Our derived iteration construct should generalize to these semantic structures, addressing
limitations of that work. Finally, we consider the relationship between sequential effects and
Kleene Algebras, where the latter may be used as instances of the former.
