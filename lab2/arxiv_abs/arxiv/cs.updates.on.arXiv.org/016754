The Internet of Things comes along with new challenges for experimenting, testing, and operating
decentralized socio-technical systems at large-scale. In such systems, autonomous agents interact
locally with their users, and remotely with other agents to make intelligent collective choices.
Via these interactions they self-regulate the consumption and production of distributed resources.
While such complex systems are often deployed and operated using centralized computing infrastructures,
the socio-technical nature of these decentralized systems requires new value-sensitive design
paradigms; empowering trust, transparency, and alignment with citizens' social values, such
as privacy preservation, autonomy, and fairness among citizens' choices. Currently, instruments
and tools to study such systems and guide the prototyping process from simulation to live deployment
are missing, or not practical in this distributed socio-technical context. This paper bridges
this gap by introducing a novel testbed architecture for decentralized socio-technical systems
running on IoT. This new architecture is designed for a seamless reusability of (i) application-independent
decentralized services by an IoT application, and (ii) different IoT applications by the same decentralized
service. This dual self-integration promises IoT applications that are simpler to prototype,
and can interoperate with decentralized services during runtime to self-integrate more complex
functionality. Such integration provides stronger validation of IoT applications, and improves
resource utilization. Pressure and crash tests during continuous operations of several weeks,
with more than 80K network joining and leaving of agents, 2.4M parameter changes, and 100M communicated
messages, confirm the robustness and practicality of the testbed architecture.
