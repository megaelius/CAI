Extended Predictable Feature Analysis (PFAx) [Richthofer and Wiskott, 2017] is an extension of
PFA [Richthofer and Wiskott, 2015] that allows generating a goal-directed control signal of an
agent whose dynamics has previously been learned during a training phase in an unsupervised manner.
PFAx hardly requires assumptions or prior knowledge of the agent's sensor or control mechanics,
or of the environment. It selects features from a high-dimensional input by intrinsic predictability
and organizes them into a reasonably low-dimensional model. While PFA obtains a well predictable
model, PFAx yields a model ideally suited for manipulations with predictable outcome. This allows
for goal-directed manipulation of an agent and thus for local navigation, i.e. for reaching states
where intermediate actions can be chosen by a permanent descent of distance to the goal. The approach
is limited when it comes to global navigation, e.g. involving obstacles or multiple rooms. In this
article, we extend theoretical results from [Sprekeler and Wiskott, 2008], enabling PFAx to perform
stable global navigation. So far, the most widely exploited characteristic of Slow Feature Analysis
(SFA) was that slowness yields invariances. We focus on another fundamental characteristics of
slow signals: They tend to yield monotonicity and one significant property of monotonicity is that
local optimization is sufficient to find a global optimum. We present an SFA-based algorithm that
structures an environment such that navigation tasks hierarchically decompose into subgoals.
Each of these can be efficiently achieved by PFAx, yielding an overall global solution of the task.
The algorithm needs to explore and process an environment only once and can then perform all sorts
of navigation tasks efficiently. We support this algorithm by mathematical theory and apply it
to different problems.
