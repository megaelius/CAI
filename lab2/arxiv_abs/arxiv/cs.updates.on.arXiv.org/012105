We introduce ratatoskr, an open-source framework for in-depth power, performance and area (PPA)
analysis in NoCs for 3D-integrated and heterogeneous System-on-Chips (SoCs). It covers all layers
of abstraction by providing a NoC hardware implementation on RT level, a NoC simulator on cycle-accurate
level and an application model on transaction level. By this comprehensive approach, ratatoskr
can provide the following specific PPA analyses: Dynamic power of links can be measured within 2.4%
accuracy of bit-level simulations while maintaining cycle-accurate simulation speed. Router
power is determined from RT level synthesis combined with cycle-accurate simulations. The performance
of the whole NoC can be measured both via cycle-accurate and RT level simulations. The performance
of individual routers is obtained from RT level including gate-level verification. The NoC area
is calculated from RT level. Despite these manifold features, ratatoskr offers easy two-step user
interaction: First, a single point-of-entry that allows to set design parameters and second, PPA
reports are generated automatically. For both the input and the output, different levels of abstraction
can be chosen for high-level rapid network analysis or low-level improvement of architectural
details. The synthesize NoC model reduces up to 32% total router power and 3% router area in comparison
to a conventional standard router. As a forward-thinking and unique feature not found in other NoC
PPA-measurement tools, ratatoskr supports heterogeneous 3D integration that is one of the most
promising integration paradigms for upcoming SoCs. Thereby, ratatoskr lies the groundwork to
design their communication architectures.
