We propose PiNcH, a methodology to detect the presence of a drone, its current status, and its movements
by leveraging just the communication traffic exchanged between the drone and its Remote Controller
(RC). PiNcH is built applying standard classification algorithms to the eavesdropped traffic,
analyzing features such as packets inter-arrival time and size. PiNcH is fully passive and it requires
just cheap and general-purpose hardware. To evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, we collected
real communication traces originated by a drone running the widespread ArduCopter open-source
firmware, currently mounted on-board of a wide range (30+) of commercial amateur drones. We tested
our solution against different publicly available wireless traces. The results prove that PiNcH
can efficiently and effectively: (i) identify the presence of the drone in several heterogeneous
scenarios; (ii) identify the current state of a powered-on drone, i.e., flying or lying on the ground;
(iii) discriminate the movements of the drone; and, finally, (iv) enjoy a reduced upper bound on
the time required to identify a drone with the requested level of assurance. The effectiveness of
PiNcH has been also evaluated in the presence of both heavy packet loss and evasion attacks. In this
latter case, the adversary modifies on purpose the profile of the traffic of the drone-RC link to
avoid the detection. In both the cited cases, PiNcH continues enjoying a remarkable performance.
Further, the comparison against state of the art solution confirms the superior performance of
PiNcH in several scenarios. Note that all the drone-controller generated data traces have been
released as open-source, to allow replicability and foster follow-up. Finally, the quality and
viability of our solution, do prove that network traffic analysis can be successfully adopted for
drone identification and status discrimination.
