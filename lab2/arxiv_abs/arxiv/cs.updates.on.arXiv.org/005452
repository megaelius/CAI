Diabetes is a major public health problem in the United States, affecting roughly 30 million people.
Diabetes complications, along with the mental health comorbidities that often co-occur with them,
are major drivers of high healthcare costs, poor outcomes, and reduced treatment adherence in diabetes.
Here, we evaluate in a large state-wide population whether we can use artificial intelligence (AI)
techniques to identify clusters of patient trajectories within the broader diabetes population
in order to create cost-effective, narrowly-focused case management intervention strategies
to reduce development of complications. This approach combined data from: 1) claims, 2) case management
notes, and 3) social determinants of health from ~300,000 real patients between 2014 and 2016. We
categorized complications as five types: Cardiovascular, Neuropathy, Opthalmic, Renal, and
Other. Modeling was performed combining a variety of machine learning algorithms, including supervised
classification, unsupervised clustering, natural language processing of unstructured care
notes, and feature engineering. The results showed that we can predict development of diabetes
complications roughly 83.5% of the time using claims data or social determinants of health data.
They also showed we can reveal meaningful clusters in the patient population related to complications
and mental health that can be used to cost-effective screening program, reducing the number of patients
to be screened down by 85%. This study outlines creation of an AI framework to develop protocols to
better address mental health comorbidities that lead to complications development in the diabetes
population. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of research and the need for
better addressing the 'people side' of the equation.
