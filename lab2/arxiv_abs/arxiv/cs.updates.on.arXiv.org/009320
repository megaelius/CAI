Autonomous terrestrial vehicles must be capable of perceiving traffic lights and recognizing
their current states to share the streets with human drivers. Most of the time, human drivers can
easily identify the relevant traffic lights. To deal with this issue, a common solution for autonomous
cars is to integrate recognition with prior maps. However, additional solution is required for
the detection and recognition of the traffic light. Deep learning techniques have showed great
performance and power of generalization including traffic related problems. Motivated by the
advances in deep learning, some recent works leveraged some state-of-the-art deep detectors to
locate (and further recognize) traffic lights from 2D camera images. However, none of them combine
the power of the deep learning-based detectors with prior maps to recognize the state of the relevant
traffic lights. Based on that, this work proposes to integrate the power of deep learning-based
detection with the prior maps used by our car platform IARA (acronym for Intelligent Autonomous
Robotic Automobile) to recognize the relevant traffic lights of predefined routes. The process
is divided in two phases: an offline phase for map construction and traffic lights annotation; and
an online phase for traffic light recognition and identification of the relevant ones. The proposed
system was evaluated on five test cases (routes) in the city of Vit\'oria, each case being composed
of a video sequence and a prior map with the relevant traffic lights for the route. Results showed
that the proposed technique is able to correctly identify the relevant traffic light along the trajectory.
