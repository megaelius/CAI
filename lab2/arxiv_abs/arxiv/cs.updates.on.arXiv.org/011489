We consider the following constrained Rayleigh quotient optimization problem (CRQopt) $$ \min_{x\in
\mathbb{R}^n} x^{T}Ax\,\,\mbox{subject to}\,\, x^{T}x=1\,\mbox{and}\,C^{T}x=b, $$ where
$A$ is an $n\times n$ real symmetric matrix and $C$ is an $n\times m$ real matrix. Usually, $m\ll n$.
The problem is also known as the constrained eigenvalue problem in the literature because it becomes
an eigenvalue problem if the linear constraint $C^{T}x=b$ is removed. We start by equivalently
transforming CRQopt into an optimization problem, called LGopt, of minimizing the Lagrangian
multiplier of CRQopt, and then an problem, called QEPmin, of finding the smallest eigenvalue of
a quadratic eigenvalue problem. Although such equivalences has been discussed in the literature,
it appears to be the first time that these equivalences are rigorously justified. Then we propose
to numerically solve LGopt and QEPmin by the Krylov subspace projection method via the Lanczos process.
The basic idea, as the Lanczos method for the symmetric eigenvalue problem, is to first reduce LGopt
and QEPmin by projecting them onto Krylov subspaces to yield problems of the same types but of much
smaller sizes, and then solve the reduced problems by some direct methods, which is either a secular
equation solver (in the case of LGopt) or an eigensolver (in the case of QEPmin). The resulting algorithm
is called the Lanczos algorithm. We perform convergence analysis for the proposed method and obtain
error bounds. The sharpness of the error bound is demonstrated by artificial examples, although
in applications the method often converges much faster than the bounds suggest. Finally, we apply
the Lanczos algorithm to semi-supervised learning in the context of constrained clustering.
