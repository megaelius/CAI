We show that any Algebraic Branching Program (ABP) computing the polynomial $\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^n$
has at least $\Omega(n^2)$ vertices. This improves upon the lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$, which
follows from the classical result of Baur and Strassen [Str73, BS83], and extends the results in
[K19], which showed a quadratic lower bound for \emph{homogeneous} ABPs computing the same polynomial.
Our proof relies on a notion of depth reduction which is reminiscent of similar statements in the
context of matrix rigidity, and shows that any small enough ABP computing the polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^n
x_i^n$ can be depth reduced to essentially a homogeneous ABP of the same size which computes the polynomial
$\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^n + \epsilon(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, for a structured "error polynomial" $\epsilon(x_1,
\ldots, x_n)$. To complete the proof, we then observe that the lower bound in [K19] is robust enough
and continues to hold for all polynomials $\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^n + \epsilon(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, where
$\epsilon(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ has the appropriate structure. We also use our ideas to show an $\Omega(n^2)$
lower bound of the size of algebraic formulas computing the elementary symmetric polynomial of
degree $0.1n$ on $n$ variables. This is a slight improvement upon the prior best known formula lower
bound (proved for a different polynomial) of $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$ [Nec66, K85, SY10]. Interestingly,
this lower bound is asymptotically better than $n^2/\log n$, the strongest lower bound that can
be proved using previous methods. This lower bound also matches the upper bound, due to Ben-Or, who
showed that elementary symmetric polynomials can be computed by algebraic formula (in fact depth-$3$
formula) of size $O(n^2)$. Prior to this work, Ben-Or's construction was known to be optimal only
for algebraic formulas of depth-$3$ [SW01].
