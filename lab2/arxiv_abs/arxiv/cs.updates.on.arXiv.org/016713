The Age-of-Information (AoI) has recently been proposed as an important metric for investigating
the timeliness performance in information-update systems. In this paper, we study the AoI minimization
problem under a new Pull model with replication schemes, where a user proactively sends a replicated
request to multiple servers to "pull" the information of interest. Interestingly, we find that
under this new Pull model, replication schemes capture a novel tradeoff between different values
of the AoI across the servers (due to the random updating processes) and different response times
across the servers, which can be exploited to minimize the expected AoI at the user's side. Specifically,
assuming Poisson updating process for the servers and exponentially distributed response time,
we derive a closed-form formula for computing the expected AoI and obtain the optimal number of responses
to wait for to minimize the expected AoI. Then, we extend our analysis to the setting where the user
aims to maximize the AoI-based utility, which represents the user's satisfaction level with respect
to freshness of the received information. Furthermore, we consider a more realistic scenario where
the user has no prior knowledge of the system. In this case, we reformulate the utility maximization
problem as a stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit problem with side observations and leverage a special
linear structure of side observations to design learning algorithms with improved performance
guarantees. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to elucidate our theoretical results and
compare the performance of different algorithms. Our findings reveal that under the Pull model,
waiting does not necessarily lead to aging; waiting wisely can significantly reduce the AoI and
improve the AoI-based utility in most scenarios.
