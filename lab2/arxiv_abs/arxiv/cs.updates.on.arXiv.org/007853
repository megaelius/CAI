One of the most important prerequisites for creating and evaluating 6D object pose detectors are
datasets with labeled 6D poses. In the advent of deep learning methods, demand for such datasets
is consinuously arising. Despite the fact that some of those exist, they are scarce and typically
have restricted setups, e.g. a single object per sequence, or focus on specific object types, such
as textureless industrial parts. Besides, two significant components are often ignored: training
only from available 3D models instead of real data and scalability, i.e. training one method to detect
all objects rather than training one detector per object. Other challenges, such as occlusions,
changing light conditions and object appearance changes, as well as precisely defined benchmarks
are either not present or scattered among different datasets. In this paper we present dataset for
6D pose estimation that covers the above-mentioned challenges, mainly targeting training from
3D models (both textured and textureless), scalability, occlusions, light and object appearance
changes. The dataset features 33 objects (17 toy, 8 household and 8 industry-relevant objects)
over 13 scenes of various difficulty. Moreover, we present a set benchmarks with the purpose of testing
various desired properties of the detectors, particularly focusing on scalability with respect
to the number of objects, resistance to changing light conditions, occlusions and clutter. We also
set a baseline for the presented benchmarks using a publicly available state of the art detector.
Considering difficulties in making such datasets, we plan to release the code allowing other researchers
to extend this dataset or make their own datasets in the future.
