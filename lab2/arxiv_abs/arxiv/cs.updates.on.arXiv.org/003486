Recent breakthroughs in machine learning especially artificial intelligence shift the paradigm
of wireless communication towards intelligence radios. One of their core operations is automatic
modulation recognition (AMR). Existing research focuses on coherent modulation schemes such
as QAM, PSK and FSK. The AMR of (non-coherent) space-time modulation remains an uncharted area despite
its wide deployment in modern multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The scheme using
a so called Grassmann constellation enables rate-enhancement using multi-antennas and blind
detection. In this work, we propose an AMR approach for Grassmann constellation based on data clustering,
which differs from traditional AMR based on classification using a modulation database. The approach
allows algorithms for clustering on the Grassmann manifold, such as Grassmann K-means and depth-first
search, originally developed for computer vision to be applied to AMR. We further develop an analytical
framework for studying and designing these algorithms in the context of AMR. First, the maximum-likelihood
Grassmann constellation detection is proved to be equivalent to clustering on the Grassmannian.
Thereby, a well-known machine-learning result that was originally established only for the Euclidean
space is rediscovered for the Grassmannian. Next, despite a rich literature on algorithmic design,
theoretical analysis of data clustering is largely overlooked due to the lack of tractable techniques.
We tackle the challenge by introducing probabilistic metrics for measuring the inter-cluster
separability and intra-cluster connectivity of received space-time symbols and deriving them
using tools from differential geometry and Grassmannian packing. The results provide useful insights
into the effects of various parameters ranging from the signal-to-noise ratio to constellation
size, facilitating algorithmic design.
