The role of social media in promoting media pluralism was initially viewed as wholly positive. However,
some governments are allegedly manipulating social media by hiring online commentators (also
known as trolls) to spread propaganda and disinformation. In particular, an alleged system of professional
trolls operating both domestically and internationally exists in Russia. In 2018, Twitter released
data on accounts identified as Russian trolls, starting a wave of research. However, while foreign-targeted
English language operations of these trolls have received significant attention, no research
has analyzed their Russian language domestic and regional-targeted activities. We address this
gap by characterizing the Russian-language operations of Russian trolls. We first perform a descriptive
analysis, and then focus in on the trolls' operation related to the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight
MH17. Among other things, we find that Russian-language trolls have run 163 hashtag campaigns (where
hashtag use grows abruptly within a month). The main political sentiments of such campaigns were
praising Russia and Putin (29%), criticizing Ukraine (26%), and criticizing the United States
and Obama (9%). Further, trolls actively reshared information with 76% of tweets being retweets
or containing a URL. Additionally, we observe periodic temporal patterns of tweeting suggesting
that trolls use automation tools. Further, we find that trolls' information campaign on the MH17
crash was the largest in terms of tweet count. However, around 68% of tweets posted with MH17 hashtags
were likely used simply for hashtag amplification. With these tweets excluded, about 49% of the
tweets suggested to varying levels that Ukraine was responsible for the crash, and only 13% contained
disinformation and propaganda presented as news. Interestingly, trolls promoted inconsistent
alternative theories for the crash.
