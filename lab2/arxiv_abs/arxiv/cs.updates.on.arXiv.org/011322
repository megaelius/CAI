Proactive resource allocation, say proactive caching at wireless edge, has shown promising gain
in boosting network performance and improving user experience, by leveraging big data and machine
learning. Earlier research efforts focus on optimizing proactive policies under the assumption
that the future knowledge required for optimization is perfectly known. Recently, various machine
learning techniques are proposed to predict the required knowledge such as file popularity, which
is treated as the true value for the optimization. In this paper, we introduce a \emph{proactive
optimization} framework for optimizing proactive resource allocation, where the future knowledge
is implicitly predicted from historical observations by the optimization. To this end, we formulate
a {proactive optimization} problem by taking proactive caching and bandwidth allocation as an
example, where the objective function is the conditional expectation of successful offloading
probability taken over the unknown popularity given the historically observed popularity. To
solve such a problem that depends on the conditional distribution of future information given current
and past information, we transform the problem equivalently to a problem depending on the joint
distribution of future and historical popularity. Then, we resort to stochastic optimization
to learn the joint distribution and resort to unsupervised learning with neural networks to learn
the optimal policy. The neural networks can be trained off-line, or in an on-line manner to adapt
to the dynamic environment. Simulation results using a real dataset validate that the proposed
framework can indeed predict the file popularity implicitly by optimization.
