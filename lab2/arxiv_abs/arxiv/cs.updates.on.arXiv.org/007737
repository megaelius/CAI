In order to stay up to date with world issues and cutting-edge technol-ogies, the newspaper plays
a crucial role. However, collecting news is not a very easy task. Currently, news publishers are
collecting news from their correspond-ents through social networks, email, phone call, fax etc.
and sometimes they buy news from the agencies. However, the existing news sharing networks may not
provide security for data integrity and any third party may obstruct the regular flow of news sharing.
Moreover, the existing news schemes are very vulnerable in case of disclosing the identity. Therefore,
a universal platform is needed in the era of globalization where anyone can share and trade news from
anywhere in the world securely, without the interference of third-party, and without disclosing
the identity of an individual. Recently, blockchain has gained popularity because of its security
mechanism over data, identity, etc. Blockchain enables a distrib-uted way of managing transactions
where each participant of the network holds the same copy of the transactions. Therefore, with the
help of pseudonymity, fault-tolerance, immutability and the distributed structure of blockchain,
a scheme (termed as NEWSTRADCOIN) is presented in this paper in which not only news can be shared securely
but also anyone can earn money by selling news. The proposed NEWSTRADCOIN can provide a universal
platform where publishers can directly obtain news from news-gatherers in a secure way by main-taining
data integrity, without experiencing the interference of a third-party, and without disclosing
the identity of the news gatherer and publishers.
