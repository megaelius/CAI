By combining metal nodes with organic linkers we can potentially synthesize millions of possible
metal organic frameworks (MOFs). At present, we have libraries of over ten thousand synthesized
materials and millions of in-silico predicted materials. The fact that we have so many materials
opens many exciting avenues to tailor make a material that is optimal for a given application. However,
from an experimental and computational point of view we simply have too many materials to screen
using brute-force techniques. In this review, we show that having so many materials allows us to
use big-data methods as a powerful technique to study these materials and to discover complex correlations.
The first part of the review gives an introduction to the principles of big-data science. We emphasize
the importance of data collection, methods to augment small data sets, how to select appropriate
training sets. An important part of this review are the different approaches that are used to represent
these materials in feature space. The review also includes a general overview of the different ML
techniques, but as most applications in porous materials use supervised ML our review is focused
on the different approaches for supervised ML. In particular, we review the different method to
optimize the ML process and how to quantify the performance of the different methods. In the second
part, we review how the different approaches of ML have been applied to porous materials. In particular,
we discuss applications in the field of gas storage and separation, the stability of these materials,
their electronic properties, and their synthesis. The range of topics illustrates the large variety
of topics that can be studied with big-data science. Given the increasing interest of the scientific
community in ML, we expect this list to rapidly expand in the coming years.
