This paper studies the newly emerging wireless powered communication network (WPCN) in which one
hybrid access point (H-AP) with constant power supply coordinates the wireless energy/information
transmissions to/from distributed users that do not have energy sources. A "harvest-then-transmit"
protocol is proposed where all users first harvest the wireless energy broadcast by the H-AP in the
downlink (DL) and then send their independent information to the H-AP in the uplink (UL) by time-division-multiple-access
(TDMA). First, we study the sum-throughput maximization of all users by jointly optimizing the
time allocation for the DL wireless power transfer versus the users' UL information transmissions
given a total time constraint based on the users' DL and UL channels as well as their average harvested
energy values. By applying convex optimization techniques, we obtain the closed-form expressions
for the optimal time allocations to maximize the sum-throughput. Our solution reveals "doubly
near-far" phenomenon due to both the DL and UL distance-dependent signal attenuation, where a far
user from the H-AP, which receives less wireless energy than a nearer user in the DL, has to transmit
with more power in the UL for reliable information transmission. Consequently, the maximum sum-throughput
is achieved by allocating substantially more time to the near users than the far users, thus resulting
in unfair rate allocation among different users. To overcome this problem, we furthermore propose
a new performance metric so-called common-throughput with the additional constraint that all
users should be allocated with an equal rate regardless of their distances to the H-AP. We present
an efficient algorithm to solve the common-throughput maximization problem. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the common-throughput approach for solving the new doubly near-far
problem in WPCNs.
