Utilizing a generative regime switching framework, we perform Monte-Carlo simulations of asset
returns for Value at Risk threshold estimation. Using equity markets and long term bonds as test
assets in the global, US, Euro area and UK setting over an up to 1,250 weeks sample horizon ending in
August 2018, we investigate neural networks along three design steps relating (i) to the initialization
of the neural network, (ii) its incentive function according to which it has been trained and (iii)
the amount of data we feed. First, we compare neural networks with random seeding with networks that
are initialized via estimations from the best-established model (i.e. the Hidden Markov). We find
latter to outperform in terms of the frequency of VaR breaches (i.e. the realized return falling
short of the estimated VaR threshold). Second, we balance the incentive structure of the loss function
of our networks by adding a second objective to the training instructions so that the neural networks
optimize for accuracy while also aiming to stay in empirically realistic regime distributions
(i.e. bull vs. bear market frequencies). In particular this design feature enables the balanced
incentive recurrent neural network (RNN) to outperform the single incentive RNN as well as any other
neural network or established approach by statistically and economically significant levels.
Third, we half our training data set of 2,000 days. We find our networks when fed with substantially
less data (i.e. 1,000 days) to perform significantly worse which highlights a crucial weakness
of neural networks in their dependence on very large data sets ...
