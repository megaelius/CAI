The availability of an abundance of knowledge sources has spurred a large amount of effort in the
development and enhancement of Information Retrieval techniques. Users information needs are
expressed in natural language and successful retrieval is very much dependent on the effective
communication of the intended purpose. Natural language queries consist of multiple linguistic
features which serve to represent the intended search goal. Linguistic characteristics that cause
semantic ambiguity and misinterpretation of queries as well as additional factors such as the lack
of familiarity with the search environment affect the users ability to accurately represent their
information needs, coined by the concept intention gap. The latter directly affects the relevance
of the returned search results which may not be to the users satisfaction and therefore is a major
issue impacting the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. Central to our discussion
is the identification of the significant constituents that characterize the query intent and their
enrichment through the addition of meaningful terms, phrases or even latent representations,
either manually or automatically to capture their intended meaning. Specifically, we discuss
techniques to achieve the enrichment and in particular those utilizing the information gathered
from statistical processing of term dependencies within a document corpus or from external knowledge
sources such as ontologies. We lay down the anatomy of a generic linguistic based query expansion
framework and propose its module-based decomposition, covering topical issues from query processing,
information retrieval, computational linguistics and ontology engineering. For each of the modules
we review state-of-the-art solutions in the literature categorized and analyzed under the light
of the techniques used.
