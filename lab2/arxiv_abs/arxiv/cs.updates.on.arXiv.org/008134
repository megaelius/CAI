The existing computational visual attention systems have focused on the objective to basically
simulate and understand the concept of visual attention system in adults. Consequently, the impact
of observer's age in scene viewing behavior has rarely been considered. This study quantitatively
analyzed the age-related differences in gaze landings during scene viewing for three different
class of images: naturals, man-made, and fractals. Observer's of different age-group have shown
different scene viewing tendencies independent to the class of the image viewed. Several interesting
observations are drawn from the results. First, gaze landings for man-made dataset showed that
whereas child observers focus more on the scene foreground, i.e., locations that are near, elderly
observers tend to explore the scene background, i.e., locations farther in the scene. Considering
this result a framework is proposed in this paper to quantitatively measure the depth bias tendency
across age groups. Second, the quantitative analysis results showed that children exhibit the
lowest exploratory behavior level but the highest central bias tendency among the age groups and
across the different scene categories. Third, inter-individual similarity metrics reveal that
an adult had significantly lower gaze consistency with children and elderly compared to other adults
for all the scene categories. Finally, these analysis results were consequently leveraged to develop
a more accurate age-adapted saliency model independent to the image type. The prediction accuracy
suggests that our model fits better to the collected eye-gaze data of the observers belonging to
different age groups than the existing models do.
