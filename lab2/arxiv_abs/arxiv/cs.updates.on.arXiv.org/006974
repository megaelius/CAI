The byte-addressable Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) is a promising technology since it simultaneously
provides DRAM-like performance, disk-like capacity, and persistency. The current NVM deployment
is symmetric, where NVM devices are directly attached to servers. Due to the higher density, NVM
provides larger capacity and can be shared among servers. Unfortunately, in the symmetric setting,
the availability of NVM devices is affected by the specific machine it is attached to. High availability
can be realized by replicating data to NVM on a remote machine. However, it requires full replication
of data structure in local memory, limiting the size of the working set. This paper rethinks NVM deployment
and makes a case for the asymmetric NVM architecture, which decouples servers from persistent data
storage. In the proposed AsymNVM architecture, NVM devices (back-end nodes) can be shared by multiple
servers (front-end nodes) and provide recoverable persistent data structures. The asymmetric
architecture is made possible by RDMA, and follows the recent industry trend of resource disaggregation.
We build AsymNVM framework based on AsymNVM architecture that implements: 1) high performance
persistent data structure update; 2) NVM data management; 3) concurrency control; and 4) crash-consistency
and replication. The central idea is to use operation logs to reduce the stall due to RDMA writes and
enable efficient batching and caching in front-end nodes. To evaluation performance, we construct
eight widely used data structures and two applications based on AsymNVM framework, and use traces
of industry workloads. In a cluster with ten machines, the results show that AsymNVM achieves comparable
performance to the best possible symmetric architecture while avoiding all the drawbacks with
disaggregation. Compared to the baseline AsymNVM, speedup brought by the proposed optimizations
is 6~22x.
