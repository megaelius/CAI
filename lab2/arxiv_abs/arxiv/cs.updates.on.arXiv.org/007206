Cortical synapse organization supports a range of dynamic states on multiple spatial and temporal
scales, from synchronous slow wave activity (SWA), characteristic of deep sleep or anesthesia,
to fluctuating, asynchronous activity during wakefulness (AW). Such dynamic diversity poses
a challenge for producing efficient large-scale simulations that embody realistic metaphors
of short- and long-range synaptic connectivity. In fact, during SWA and AW different spatial extents
of the cortical tissue are active in a given timespan and at different levels, which implies a wide
variety of loads of local computation and communication. A balanced evaluation of simulation performance
and robustness should therefore include tests of a variety of cortical dynamic states. Here, we
demonstrate performance scaling of our proprietary Distributed and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks
(DPSNN) simulation engine in both SWA and AW for bidimensional grids of neural populations, which
reflects the modular organization of the cortex. We explored networks up to 192x192 modules, each
composed of 1250 integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency adaptation, and exponentially
decaying inter-modular synaptic connectivity with varying spatial decay constant. For the largest
networks the total number of synapses was over 70 billion. The execution platform included up to
64 dual-socket nodes, each socket mounting 8 Intel Xeon Haswell processor cores @ 2.40GHz clock.
Network initialization time, memory usage, and execution time showed good scaling performances
from 1 to 1024 processes, implemented using the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol.
We achieved simulation speeds of between 2.3x10^9 and 4.1x10^9 synaptic events per second for both
cortical states in the explored range of inter-modular interconnections.
