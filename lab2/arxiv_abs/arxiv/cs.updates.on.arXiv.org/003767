Each year, significant investment of time and resources is made to improve diversity within engineering
across a range of federal and state agencies, private/not-for-profit organizations, and foundations.
In spite of decades of investments, efforts have not yielded desired returns - participation by
minorities continues to lag at a time when STEM workforce requirements are increasing. In recent
years a new stream of data has emerged - online social networks, including Twitter, Facebook, and
Instagram - that act as a key sensor of social behavior and attitudes of the public. Almost 87% of the
American population now participates in some form of social media activity. Consequently, social
networking sites have become powerful indicators of social action and social media data has shown
significant promise for studying many issues including public health communication, political
campaign, humanitarian crisis, and, activism. We argue that social media data can likewise be leveraged
to better understand and improve engineering diversity. As a case study to illustrate the viability
of the approach, we present findings from a campaign, #ILookLikeAnEngineer (using Twitter data
- 19,354 original tweets and 29,529 retweets), aimed at increasing gender diversity in the engineering
workplace. The campaign provided a continuous momentum to the overall effort to increase diversity
and novel ways of connecting with relevant audience. Our analysis demonstrates that diversity
initiatives related to STEM attract voices from various entities including individuals, large
corporations, media outlets, and community interest groups.
