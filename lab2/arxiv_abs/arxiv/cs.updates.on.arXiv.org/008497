Prosumers in many regions are facing reduced feed-in tariffs and currently have no possibility
to influence the level of remuneration for the locally produced solar energy. Peer-to-peer communities
may offer an alternative to the feed-in tariff model by enabling prosumers to directly sell their
solar energy to local consumers (possibly at a rate that is beneficial for both consumer and prosumer).
The Quartierstrom project investigates a transactional energy system that manages the exchange
and remuneration of electricity between consumers, prosumers and the local electric grid provider
in the absence of intermediaries. This whitepaper describes the prototypical real-world system
being implemented in the town of Walenstadt, Switzerland, with 37 participating households. The
community members of this pilot project pay a reduced tariff for grid usage if the electricity produced
by a prosumer is sold to another community member, which is located on the same voltage or grid level
downstream a substation1. Such a tariff structure incentivizes local balancing, i.e. locally
produced energy can be consumed locally whenever possible to avoid costs from higher grid levels.
The blockchain is a novel technology suitable to log the produced and consumed units of energy within
a community, making it possible to implement market places. In those marketplaces, both prosumers
and consumers can indicate a price at which they are willing to sell / buy locally produced solar energy
without the intermediation of a utility. The key goals of this project are the assessment of A) the
technical, economical and ecological feasibility of a blockchain-based community energy system
regarding local utilization of solar energy, grid quality and energy efficiency and B) resulting
dynamics regarding local market prices and user acceptance.
