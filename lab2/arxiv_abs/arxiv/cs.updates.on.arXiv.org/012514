Driven by the emergence of new compute-intensive applications and the vision of the Internet of
Things (IoT), it is foreseen that the emerging 5G network will face an unprecedented increase in
traffic volume and computation demands. However, end users mostly have limited storage capacities
and finite processing capabilities, thus how to run compute-intensive applications on resource-constrained
users has recently become a natural concern. Mobile edge computing (MEC), a key technology in the
emerging fifth generation (5G) network, can optimize mobile resources by hosting compute-intensive
applications, process large data before sending to the cloud, provide the cloud computing capabilities
within the radio access network (RAN) in close proximity to mobile users, and offer context-aware
services with the help of RAN information. Therefore, MEC enables a wide variety of applications,
where the real-time response is strictly required, e.g., driverless vehicles, augmented reality,
robotics, and immerse media. Indeed, the paradigm shift from 4G to 5G could become a reality with
the advent of new technological concepts. The successful realization of MEC in the 5G network is
still in its infancy and demands for constant efforts from both academic and industry communities.
In this survey, we first provide a holistic overview of MEC technology and its potential use cases
and applications. Then, we outline up-to-date researches on the integration of MEC with the new
technologies that will be deployed in 5G and beyond. We also summarize testbeds and experimental
evaluations, and open source activities, for edge computing. We further summarize lessons learned
from state-of-the-art research works as well as discuss challenges and potential future directions
for MEC research.
