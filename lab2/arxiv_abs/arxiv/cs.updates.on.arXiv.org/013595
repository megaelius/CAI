Spatio-temporal information is increasingly used for driving a plethora of intelligent transportation,
smart-city, and crowd-sensing applications. At the same time, different types of data marketplaces
are proposed for de-siloing and monetising individual and enterprise data. In this paper we study
the problem of estimating the relative value of spatio-temporal data sold in wholesale and retail
data marketplaces for the purpose of forecasting future demand in a certain area, e.g. a city. Using
as case studies large datasets of taxi rides from Chicago and New York, we ask questions such as "When
does it make sense for different taxi companies to combine their data?" and "How should different
companies be compensated for the data that they share?". We then turn our attention to the even harder
problem of establishing the value of the data brought to retail marketplaces by individual drivers.
Overall, we show that simplistic approaches, such as assuming that the value of the data held by companies
or drivers is proportional to its volume are inaccurate, because they fail to consider the complex
complementarities that may exist among different datasets. To remedy this, more complex notions
of value-sharing from economics and game-theory, such as the Shapley value need to be used to capture
the effect of mixing datasets on the accuracy of forecasting algorithms driven by them. Applying
the Shapley value to large datasets from many sources is computationally challenging. We use structured
sampling to overcome such scalability challenges and manage to compute accurately the importance
of different data sources, even when their number ranges in the thousands, as in the case of all the
taxi drivers in a large metropolis.
