Our world is moving towards the goal of fully autonomous driving at a fast pace. While the latest automated
vehicles (AVs) can handle most real-world scenarios they encounter, a major bottleneck for turning
fully autonomous driving into reality is the lack of sufficient corner case data for training and
testing AVs. Near-crash data, as a widely used surrogate data for traffic safety research, can also
serve the purpose of AV testing if properly collected. To this end, this paper proposes an Internet-of-Things
(IoT) system for real-time near-crash data collection. The system has several cool features. First,
it is a low-cost and standalone system that is backward-compatible with any existing vehicles.
People can fix the system to their dashboards for near-crash data collection and collision warning
without the approval or help of vehicle manufacturers. Second, we propose a new near-crash detection
method that models the target's size changes and relative motions with the bounding boxes generated
by deep-learning-based object detection and tracking. This near-crash detection method is fast,
accurate, and reliable; particularly, it is insensitive to camera parameters, thereby having
an excellent transferability to different dashboard cameras. We have conducted comprehensive
experiments with 100 videos locally processed at Jetson, as well as real-world tests on cars and
buses. Besides collecting corner cases, it can also serve as a white-box platform for testing innovative
algorithms and evaluating other AV products. The system contributes to the real-world testing
of AVs and has great potential to be brought into large-scale deployment.
