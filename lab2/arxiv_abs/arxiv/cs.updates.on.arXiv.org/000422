An original dataset referring to a medium-sized Italian university is implemented for analyzing
the determinants of scientific research production at individual level. Three different indicators,
based on the number of publications and/or citations, are considered. Their distributions are
highly skewed, displaying an excess of zero-valued observations, thus zero-inflated and hurdle
regression models are introduced. Among them, the Hurdle Negative Binomial model exhibits a good
fitting and appears to be reasonably coherent with the underlying generating data process. Indeed,
the performance of active researchers is described by the count component of the model, while the
odds to be in a non-active status is modelled by the zero component. Individual characteristics,
teaching and administrative activities, as well as the features of the department the researcher
belongs to, are considered as explanatory variables. The analysis of the results highlights that
scientific productivity is lower for oldest active researchers, and that there is a significant
effect of academic position on research production. Evidence of clear-cut and significant substitution
or complementarity effect between teaching and research activities is not found. Indeed, a major
teaching load does not apparently affect the odds to be a non-active researcher, while it has mixed
and very weak effects on publication performance of active researchers. A negative relationship
among productivity and administrative tasks is highlighted. Finally, the analysis points out
the effects of department composition on both the odds to be non-active and the value of the production
indicators of active researchers.
