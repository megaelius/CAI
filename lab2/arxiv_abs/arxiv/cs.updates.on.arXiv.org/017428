The recent emergence of fine-grained cryptography strongly motivates developing an average-case
analogue of Fine-Grained Complexity (FGC). This paper defines new versions of OV, $k$SUM and zero-$k$-clique
that are both worst-case and average-case fine-grained hard assuming the core hypotheses of FGC.
We then use these as a basis for fine-grained hardness and average-case hardness of other problems.
The new problems represent their inputs in a certain ``factored'' form. We call them ``factored''-OV,
``factored''-zero-$k$-clique and ``factored''-$3$SUM. We show that factored-$k$-OV and factored
$k$SUM are equivalent and are complete for a class of problems defined over Boolean functions. Factored
zero-$k$-clique is also complete, for a different class of problems. Our hard factored problems
are also simple enough that we can reduce them to many other problems, e.g.~to edit distance, $k$-LCS
and versions of Max-Flow. We further consider counting variants of the factored problems and give
WCtoACFG reductions for them for a natural distribution. Through FGC reductions we then get average-case
hardness for well-studied problems like regular expression matching from standard worst-case
FGC assumptions. To obtain our WCtoACFG reductions, we formalize the framework of [Boix-Adsera
et al. 2019] that was used to give a WCtoACFG reduction for counting $k$-cliques. We define an explicit
property of problems such that if a problem has that property one can use the framework on the problem
to get a WCtoACFG self reduction. We then use the framework to slightly extend Boix-Adsera et al.'s
average-case counting $k$-cliques result to average-case hardness for counting arbitrary subgraph
patterns of constant size in $k$-partite graphs...
