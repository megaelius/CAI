We study the parameterized complexity of a variant of the classic video game Snake that models real-world
problems of motion planning. Given a snake-like robot with an initial position and a final position
in an environment (modeled by a graph), our objective is to determine whether the robot can reach
the final position from the initial position without intersecting itself. Naturally, this problem
models a wide-variety of scenarios, ranging from the transportation of linked wagons towed by a
locomotor at an airport or a supermarket to the movement of a group of agents that travel in an `ant-like'
fashion and the construction of trains in amusement parks. Unfortunately, already on grid graphs,
this problem is PSPACE-complete [Biasi and Ophelders, 2016]. Nevertheless, we prove that even
on general graphs, the problem is solvable in time $k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}|I|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$
where $k$ is the size of the snake, and $|I|$ is the input size. In particular, this shows that the problem
is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). Towards this, we show how to employ color-coding to sparsify
the configuration graph of the problem to have size $k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}|I|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$
rather than $|I|^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$. We believe that our approach will find other applications
in motion planning. Additionally, we show that the problem is unlikely to admit a polynomial kernel
even on grid graphs, but it admits a treewidth-reduction procedure. To the best of our knowledge,
the study of the parameterized complexity of motion planning problems (where the intermediate
configurations of the motion are of importance) has so far been largely overlooked. Thus, our work
is pioneering in this regard.
