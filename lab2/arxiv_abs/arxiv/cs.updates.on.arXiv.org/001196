Recently, deep learning approaches have achieved significant performance improvement in various
imaging problems. However, it is still unclear why these deep learning architectures work. Moreover,
the link between the deep learning and the classical signal processing approaches such as wavelet,
non-local processing, compressed sensing, etc, is still not well understood, which often makes
signal processors in deep troubles. To address these issues, here we show that the long-searched-for
missing link is the convolutional framelets for representing a signal by convolving local and non-local
bases. The convolutional framelets was originally developed to generalize the recent theory of
low-rank Hankel matrix approaches, and this paper significantly extends the idea to derive a deep
neural network using multi-layer convolutional framelets with perfect reconstruction (PR) under
rectified linear unit (ReLU). Our analysis also shows that the popular deep network components
such as residual block, redundant filter channels, and concatenated ReLU (CReLU) indeed help to
achieve the PR, while the pooling and unpooling layers should be augmented with multi-resolution
convolutional framelets to achieve PR condition. This discovery reveals the limitations of many
existing deep learning architectures for inverse problems, and leads us to propose a novel deep
convolutional framelets neural network. Using numerical experiments with sparse view x-ray computed
tomography (CT), we demonstrated that our deep convolution framelets network shows consistent
improvement. This discovery suggests that the success of deep learning is not from a magical power
of a black-box, but rather comes from the power of a novel signal representation using non-local
basis combined with data-driven local basis, which is indeed a natural extension of classical signal
processing theory.
