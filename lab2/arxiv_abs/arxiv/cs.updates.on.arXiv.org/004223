A directed graph $G=(V,E)$ is {\it strongly pseudo transitive} if there is a partition $\{A,E-A\}$
of $E$ so that graphs $G_1=(V,A)$ and $G_2=(V,E-A)$ are transitive, and additionally, if $ab\in
A$ and $bc\in E $ implies that $ac\in E$. A strongly pseudo transitive graph $G=(V,E)$ is strongly
pseudo transitive of the first type, if $ab\in A$ and $bc\in E$ implies $ac\in A$. An undirected graph
is co-strongly pseudo transitive (co-strongly pseudo transitive of the first type) if its complement
has an orientation which is strongly pseudo transitive (co-strongly pseudo transitive of the first
type). Our purpose is show that the results in computational geometry \cite{CFP, Lu} and intersection
graph theory \cite{Ga2, ES} can be unified and extended, using the notion of strong pseudo transitivity.
As a consequence the general algorithmic framework in \cite{Sh} is applicable to solve the maximum
independent set in $O(n^3)$ time in a variety of problems, thereby, avoiding case by case lengthily
arguments for each problem. We show that the intersection graphs of axis parallel rectangles intersecting
a diagonal line from bottom, and half segments are co-strongly pseudo transitive. In addition,
we show that the class of the interval filament graphs is co-strongly transitive of the first type,
and hence the class of polygon circle graphs which is contained in the class of interval filament
graphs (but contains the classes of chordal graphs, circular arc, circle, and outer planar graphs),
and the class of incomparability graphs are strongly transitive of the first type. For class of chordal
graphs we give two different proofs, using two different characterizations, verifying that they
are co-strongly transitive of the first type. We present some containment results.
