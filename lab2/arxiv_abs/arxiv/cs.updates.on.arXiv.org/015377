Petri nets proved useful to describe various real-world systems, but many of their properties are
very hard to check. To alleviate this difficulty, subclasses are often considered. The class of
weighted marked graphs with relaxed place constraint (WMG=< for short), in which each place has
at most one input and one output, and the larger class of choice-free (CF) nets, in which each place
has at most one output, have been extensively studied to this end, with various applications. In
this work, we develop new properties related to the fundamental and intractable problems of reachability,
liveness and reversibility in weighted Petri nets. We focus mainly on the homogeneous Petri nets
with a single shared place (H1S nets for short), which extend the expressiveness of CF nets by allowing
one shared place (i.e. a place with at least two outputs and possibly several inputs) under the homogeneity
constraint (i.e. all the output weights of the shared place are equal). Indeed, this simple generalization
already yields new challenging problems and is expressive enough for modeling existing use-cases,
justifying a dedicated study. One of our central results is the first characterization of liveness
in a subclass of H1S nets more expressive than WMG=< that is expressed by the infeasibility of an integer
linear program (ILP) of polynomial size. This trims down the complexity to co-NP, contrasting with
the known EXPSPACE-hardness of liveness in the more general case of weighted Petri nets. In the same
subclass, we obtain a new reachability property related to the live markings, which is a variant
of the well-known Keller's theorem. Another central result is a new reversibility characterization
for the live H1S class, simplifying its checking. Finally, we apply our results to use-cases, highlight
their scalability and discuss their extensibility to more expressive classes.
