Compressed sensing (CS) methods in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer rapid acquisition and
improved image quality but require iterative reconstruction schemes with regularization to enforce
sparsity. Regardless of the difficulty in obtaining a fast numerical solution, the total variation
(TV) regularization is a preferred choice due to its edge-preserving and structure recovery capabilities.
While many approaches have been proposed to overcome the non-differentiability of the TV cost term,
an iterative shrinkage based formulation allows recovering an image through recursive application
of linear filtering and soft thresholding. However, providing an optimal setting for the regularization
parameter is critical due to its direct impact on the rate of convergence as well as steady state error.
In this paper, a regularizer adaptively varying in the derivative space is proposed, that follows
the generalized discrepancy principle (GDP). The implementation proceeds by adaptively reducing
the discrepancy level expressed as the absolute difference between TV norms of the consistency
error and the sparse approximation error. A criterion based on the absolute difference between
TV norms of consistency and sparse approximation errors is used to update the threshold. Application
of the adaptive shrinkage TV regularizer to CS recovery of parallel MRI (pMRI) and temporal gradient
adaptation in dynamic MRI are shown to result in improved image quality with accelerated convergence.
In addition, the adaptive TV-based iterative shrinkage (ATVIS) provides a significant speed advantage
over the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA).
