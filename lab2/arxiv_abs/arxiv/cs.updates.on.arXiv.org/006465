In this paper, an energy efficient IoT virtualization framework with P2P networking and edge computing
is proposed. In this network, the IoT task processing requests are served by peers. The peers in our
work are represented by IoT objects and relays that host virtual machines (VMs). We have considered
three scenarios to investigate the saving in power consumption and the system capabilities in terms
of task processing. The first scenario is the relays only scenario, where the task requests are processed
using relays only. The second scenario is the objects only scenario, where the task requests are
processed using the IoT objects only. The last scenario is a hybrid scenario, where the task requests
are processed using both IoT objects and VMs. We have developed a mixed integer linear programming
(MILP) model to maximize the number of processing tasks served by the system and minimize the total
power consumed by the IoT network. We investigated our framework under the impact of VMs placement
constraints, fairness constraints between the objects, tasks number limitations, uplink and
downlink limited capacities, and processing capability limitations. Based on the MILP model principles,
we developed an energy efficient virtualized IoT P2P networks heuristic (EEVIPN). The heuristic
results were comparable to those of the MILP in terms of energy efficiency and tasks processing.
Our results show that the hybrid scenario serves up to 77% (57% on average) processing task requests,
but with higher energy consumption compared to the other scenarios. The relays only scenario can
serve 74% (57% on average) of the processing task requests with 8% saving in power consumption compared
to the hybrid scenario. In contrast, 28% (22% on average) of task requests can be successfully handled
by applying the objects only scenario with up to 62% power saving compared to the hybrid scenario.
