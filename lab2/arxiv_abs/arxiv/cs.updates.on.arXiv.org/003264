A quantum time-dependent spectrum analysis, or simply, quantum spectral analysis (QSA) is presented
in this work, and it is based on Schrodinger equation, which is a partial differential equation that
describes how the quantum state of a non-relativistic physical system changes with time. In classic
world is named frequency in time (FIT), which is presented here in opposition and as a complement
of traditional spectral analysis frequency-dependent based on Fourier theory. Besides, FIT is
a metric, which assesses the impact of the flanks of a signal on its frequency spectrum, which is not
taken into account by Fourier theory and even less in real time. Even more, and unlike all derived
tools from Fourier Theory (i.e., continuous, discrete, fast, short-time, fractional and quantum
Fourier Transform, as well as, Gabor) FIT has the following advantages: a) compact support with
excellent energy output treatment, b) low computational cost, O(N) for signals and O(N2) for images,
c) it does not have phase uncertainties (indeterminate phase for magnitude = 0) as Discrete and Fast
Fourier Transform (DFT, FFT, respectively), d) among others. In fact, FIT constitutes one side
of a triangle (which from now on is closed) and it consists of the original signal in time, spectral
analysis based on Fourier Theory and FIT. Thus a toolbox is completed, which it is essential for all
applications of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Image Processing (DIP); and, even,
in the latter, FIT allows edge detection (which is called flank detection in case of signals), denoising,
despeckling, compression, and superresolution of still images. Such applications include signals
intelligence and imagery intelligence. On the other hand, we will present other DIP tools, which
are also derived from the Schrodinger equation.
