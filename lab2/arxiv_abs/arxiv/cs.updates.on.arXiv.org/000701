Fully dynamic graph is a data structure that (1) supports edge insertions and deletions and (2) answers
problem specific queries. The time complexity of (1) and (2) are referred to as the update time and
the query time respectively. There are many researches on dynamic graphs whose update time and query
time are $o(|G|)$, that is, sublinear in the graph size. However, almost all such researches are
for problems in P. In this paper, we investigate dynamic graphs for NP-hard problems exploiting
the notion of fixed parameter tractability (FPT). We give dynamic graphs for Vertex Cover and Cluster
Vertex Deletion parameterized by the solution size $k$. These dynamic graphs achieve almost the
best possible update time $O(\mathrm{poly}(k)\log n)$ and the query time $O(f(\mathrm{poly}(k),k))$,
where $f(n,k)$ is the time complexity of any static graph algorithm for the problems. We obtain these
results by dynamically maintaining an approximate solution which can be used to construct a small
problem kernel. Exploiting the dynamic graph for Cluster Vertex Deletion, as a corollary, we obtain
a quasilinear-time (polynomial) kernelization algorithm for Cluster Vertex Deletion. Until
now, only quadratic time kernelization algorithms are known for this problem. We also give a dynamic
graph for Chromatic Number parameterized by the solution size of Cluster Vertex Deletion, and a
dynamic graph for bounded-degree Feedback Vertex Set parameterized by the solution size. Assuming
the parameter is a constant, each dynamic graph can be updated in $O(\log n)$ time and can compute
a solution in $O(1)$ time. These results are obtained by another approach.
