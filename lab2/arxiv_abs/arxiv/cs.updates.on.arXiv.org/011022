The aviation industry has a market driven need to maintain and develop enhanced simulation capabilities
for a wide range of application domains. In particular, the future growth and disruptive ability
of smart cities, autonomous vehicles and in general, urban mobility, hinges on the development
of state of the art simulation tools and the intelligent utilization of data. While aviation based
companies have several historical and/or proprietary mission level simulation tools, there is
much to learn from the current state of the art within other industries (tangential and competing
in scope), as well as in academia. The purpose of this paper is to address and decompose the simulation
capabilities within the key players of the autonomous vehicle and self-driving car industry (Toyota,
Waymo, BMW, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Uber, etc.), as well as several notable startups within the high
fidelity 3D mapping and simulation domain (Mapper, HERE, Cognata, etc.). While providing an overview
of how other companies are using simulation tools and reliable data-sets, this paper will also seek
to address several important and related questions, namely: the interaction between simulation
and supporting tools/software, the intersection of simulation and the real world, the requirements
and utilization of compute infrastructure, the appropriate levels of fidelity within simulation,
and how simulation tools are critical to future safety and V&V concerns. In order for aviation based
companies to adequately pursue disruptive mobility within real-world environments, be it in air
or on the ground, modeling and simulation tools for autonomous vehicles provide key insights into
future development work and are essential technologies.
