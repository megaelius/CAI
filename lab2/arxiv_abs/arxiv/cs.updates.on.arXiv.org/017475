The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has severely impacted almost all countries
around the world. It not only has caused a tremendous burden on health-care providers to bear, but
it has also brought severe impacts on the economy and social life. The presence of reliable data and
the results of in-depth statistical analyses provide researchers and policymakers with invaluable
information to understand this pandemic and its growth pattern more clearly. This paper combines
and processes an extensive collection of publicly available datasets to provide a unified information
source for representing geographical regions with regards to their pandemic-related behavior.
The features are grouped into various categories to account for their impact based on the higher-level
concepts associated with them. This work uses several correlation analysis techniques to observe
value and order relationships between features, feature groups, and COVID-19 occurrences. Dimensionality
reduction techniques and projection methodologies are used to elaborate on individual and group
importance of these representative features. A specific RNN-based inference pipeline called
DoubleWindowLSTM-CP is proposed in this work for predictive event modeling. It utilizes sequential
patterns and enables concise record representation while using but a minimal amount of historical
data. The quantitative results of our statistical analytics indicated critical patterns reflecting
on many of the expected collective behavior and their associated outcomes. Predictive modeling
with DoubleWindowLSTM-CP instance exhibits efficient performance in quantitative and qualitative
assessments while reducing the need for extended and reliable historical information on the pandemic.
