Hyperparameter tuning is an active area of research in machine learning, where the aim is to identify
the optimal hyperparameters that provide the best performance on the validation set. Hyperparameter
tuning is often achieved using naive techniques, such as random search and grid search. However,
most of these methods seldom lead to an optimal set of hyperparameters and often get very expensive.
In this paper, we propose a bilevel solution method for solving the hyperparameter optimization
problem that does not suffer from the drawbacks of the earlier studies. The proposed method is general
and can be easily applied to any class of machine learning algorithms. The idea is based on the approximation
of the lower level optimal value function mapping, which is an important mapping in bilevel optimization
and helps in reducing the bilevel problem to a single level constrained optimization task. The single-level
constrained optimization problem is solved using the augmented Lagrangian method. We discuss
the theory behind the proposed algorithm and perform extensive computational study on two datasets
that confirm the efficiency of the proposed method. We perform a comparative study against grid
search, random search and Bayesian optimization techniques that shows that the proposed algorithm
is multiple times faster on problems with one or two hyperparameters. The computational gain is
expected to be significantly higher as the number of hyperparameters increase. Corresponding
to a given hyperparameter most of the techniques in the literature often assume a unique optimal
parameter set that minimizes loss on the training set. Such an assumption is often violated by deep
learning architectures and the proposed method does not require any such assumption.
