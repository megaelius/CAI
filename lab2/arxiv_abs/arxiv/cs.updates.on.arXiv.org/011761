The recent advancement in cyberphysical systems has led to an exponential growth in the use of automated
devices which in turn has created new security challenges. By manipulating cyberphysical components,
a potential attacker can modify the capacities of multiple edges so as to disrupt the network of interest.
Existing robust network flow models typically assume that the entire flow of an attacked edge gets
lost. However, in many practical systems, the flow of an attacked edge could potentially be rerouted
through adjacent edges with residual capacity. In order to address this feature, we propose a robust
and adaptive network flow model to effectively counter possible attacking behaviors of an adversary
operating under a budget constraint. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario generation approach
based on an iterative two-player game between a defender and an adversary. We assume that the adversary
always takes a best response (out of some feasible attacking scenarios) against the current flow
scenario prepared by the defender. On the other hand, we assume that the defender considers all the
attacking behaviors revealed by the adversary in previous iterations in order to generate a new
robust (maximin) flow strategy. This iterative game continues until the objectives of both the
players converge. We show that the robust and adaptive network flow problem is NP-hard and that the
complexity of the adversary's decision problem grows exponentially with the network size and the
adversary's budget value. We propose two principled heuristic approaches for solving the adversary's
problem at the scale of a large urban network. Extensive computational results on multiple synthetic
and real-world data sets demonstrate that the solution provided by the defender's problem significantly
increases the amount of flow pushed through the network over four state-of-the-art benchmark approaches.
