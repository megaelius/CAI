Physical retailers, who once led the way in tracking with loyalty cards and `reverse appends', now
lag behind online competitors. Yet we might be seeing these tables turn, as many increasingly deploy
technologies ranging from simple sensors to advanced emotion detection systems, even enabling
them to tailor prices and shopping experiences on a per-customer basis. Here, we examine these in-store
tracking technologies in the retail context, and evaluate them from both technical and regulatory
standpoints. We first introduce the relevant technologies in context, before considering privacy
impacts, the current remedies individuals might seek through technology and the law, and those
remedies' limitations. To illustrate challenging tensions in this space we consider the feasibility
of technical and legal approaches to both a) the recent `Go' store concept from Amazon which requires
fine-grained, multi-modal tracking to function as a shop, and b) current challenges in opting in
or out of increasingly pervasive passive Wi-Fi tracking. The `Go' store presents significant challenges
with its legality in Europe significantly unclear and unilateral, technical measures to avoid
biometric tracking likely ineffective. In the case of MAC addresses, we see a difficult-to-reconcile
clash between privacy-as-confidentiality and privacy-as-control, and suggest a technical framework
which might help balance the two. Significant challenges exist when seeking to balance personalisation
with privacy, and researchers must work together, including across the boundaries of preferred
privacy definitions, to come up with solutions that draw on both technology and the legal frameworks
to provide effective and proportionate protection. Retailers, simultaneously, must ensure that
their tracking is not just legal, but worthy of the trust of concerned data subjects.
