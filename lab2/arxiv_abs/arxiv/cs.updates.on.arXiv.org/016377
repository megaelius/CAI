Anonymous VoIP calls over the Internet holds great significance for privacy-conscious users,
whistle-blowers and political activists alike. Prior research deems popular anonymization systems
like Tor unsuitable for providing requisite performance guarantees that real-time applications
like VoIP need. Their claims are backed by studies that may no longer be valid due to constant advancements
in Tor. Moreover, we believe that these studies lacked the requisite diversity and comprehensiveness.
Thus, conclusions from these studies led them to propose novel and tailored solutions. However,
no such system is available for immediate use. Additionally, operating such new systems would incur
significant costs for recruiting users and volunteered relays, to provide the necessary anonymity
guarantees. It thus becomes imperative that the exact performance of VoIP over Tor be quantified
and analyzed so that the potential performance bottlenecks can be amended. We thus conducted an
extensive empirical study across various in-lab and real-world scenarios to shed light on VoIP
performance over Tor. In over 0.5 million measurements spanning 12 months, across seven countries
and covering about 6650 Tor relays, we observed that Tor supports good voice quality (Perceptual
Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) >3 and oneway delay <400ms) in more than 85% of cases. Further
analysis indicates that in general for most Tor relays, the contentions due to cross-traffic were
low enough to support VoIP calls, that are anyways transmitted at low rates (<120 Kbps). Our findings
are supported by concordant measurements using iperf that show more than the adequate available
bandwidth for most cases. Data published by the Tor Metrics also corroborates the same. Hence, unlike
prior efforts, our research reveals that Tor is suitable for supporting anonymous VoIP calls.
