We propose a generic mechanism to efficiently release differentially private synthetic versions
of high-dimensional datasets with high utility. The core technique in our mechanism is the use of
copulas. Specifically, we use the Gaussian copula to define dependencies of attributes in the input
dataset, whose rows are modelled as samples from an unknown multivariate distribution, and then
sample synthetic records through this copula. Despite the inherently numerical nature of Gaussian
correlations we construct a method that is applicable to both numerical and categorical attributes
alike. Our mechanism is efficient in that it only takes time proportional to the square of the number
of attributes in the dataset. We propose a differentially private way of constructing the Gaussian
copula without compromising computational efficiency. Through experiments on three real-world
datasets, we show that we can obtain highly accurate answers to the set of all one-way marginal, and
two-and three-way positive conjunction queries, with 99\% of the query answers having absolute
(fractional) error rates between 0.01 to 3\%. Furthermore, for a majority of two-way and three-way
queries, we outperform independent noise addition through the well-known Laplace mechanism.
In terms of computational time we demonstrate that our mechanism can output synthetic datasets
in around 6 minutes 47 seconds on average with an input dataset of about 200 binary attributes and
more than 32,000 rows, and about 2 hours 30 mins to execute a much larger dataset of about 700 binary
attributes and more than 5 million rows. To further demonstrate scalability, we ran the mechanism
on larger (artificial) datasets with 1,000 and 2,000 binary attributes (and 5 million rows) obtaining
synthetic outputs in approximately 6 and 19 hours, respectively.
