Conversational agents are exploding in popularity. However, much work remains in the area of social
conversation as well as free-form conversation over a broad range of domains and topics. To advance
the state of the art in conversational AI, Amazon launched the Alexa Prize, a 2.5-million-dollar
university competition where sixteen selected university teams were challenged to build conversational
agents, known as socialbots, to converse coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics
such as Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Fashion and Technology for 20 minutes. The Alexa Prize
offers the academic community a unique opportunity to perform research with a live system used by
millions of users. The competition provided university teams with real user conversational data
at scale, along with the user-provided ratings and feedback augmented with annotations by the Alexa
team. This enabled teams to effectively iterate and make improvements throughout the competition
while being evaluated in real-time through live user interactions. To build their socialbots,
university teams combined state-of-the-art techniques with novel strategies in the areas of Natural
Language Understanding, Context Modeling, Dialog Management, Response Generation, and Knowledge
Acquisition. To support the efforts of participating teams, the Alexa Prize team made significant
scientific and engineering investments to build and improve Conversational Speech Recognition,
Topic Tracking, Dialog Evaluation, Voice User Experience, and tools for traffic management and
scalability. This paper outlines the advances created by the university teams as well as the Alexa
Prize team to achieve the common goal of solving the problem of Conversational AI.
