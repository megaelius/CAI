Flood of information is produced in a daily basis through the global Internet usage arising from
the on-line interactive communications among users. While this situation contributes significantly
to the quality of human life, unfortunately it involves enormous dangers, since on-line texts with
high toxicity can cause personal attacks, on-line harassment and bullying behaviors. This has
triggered both industrial and research community in the last few years while there are several tries
to identify an efficient model for on-line toxic comment prediction. However, these steps are still
in their infancy and new approaches and frameworks are required. On parallel, the data explosion
that appears constantly, makes the construction of new machine learning computational tools for
managing this information, an imperative need. Thankfully advances in hardware, cloud computing
and big data management allow the development of Deep Learning approaches appearing very promising
performance so far. For text classification in particular the use of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) have recently been proposed approaching text analytics in a modern manner emphasizing in
the structure of words in a document. In this work, we employ this approach to discover toxic comments
in a large pool of documents provided by a current Kaggle's competition regarding Wikipedia's talk
page edits. To justify this decision we choose to compare CNNs against the traditional bag-of-words
approach for text analysis combined with a selection of algorithms proven to be very effective in
text classification. The reported results provide enough evidence that CNN enhance toxic comment
classification reinforcing research interest towards this direction.
