Despite significant advances in numerical modeling of brake squeal, the majority of industrial
research and design is still conducted experimentally. In this work we report on novel strategies
for handling data-intensive vibration testings and gaining better insights into brake system
vibrations. To this end, we propose machine learning-based methods to detect and characterize
vibrations, understand sensitivities and predict brake squeal. Our aim is to illustrate how interdisciplinary
approaches can leverage the potential of data science techniques for classical mechanical engineering
challenges. In the first part, a deep learning brake squeal detector is developed to identify several
classes of typical sounds in vibration recordings. The detection method is rooted in recent computer
vision techniques for object detection. It allows to overcome limitations of classical approaches
that rely on spectral properties of the recorded vibrations. Results indicate superior detection
and characterization quality when compared to state-of-the-art brake squeal detectors. In the
second part, deep recurrent neural networks are employed to learn the parametric patterns that
determine the dynamic stability of the brake system during operation. Given a set of multivariate
loading conditions, the models learn to predict the vibrational behavior of the structure. The
validated models represent virtual twins for the squeal behavior of a specific brake system. It
is found that those models can predict the occurrence and onset of brake squeal with high accuracy.
Hence, the deep learning models can identify the complicated patterns and temporal dependencies
in the loading conditions that drive the dynamical structure into regimes of instability. Large
data sets from commercial brake system testing are used to train and validate the deep learning models.
