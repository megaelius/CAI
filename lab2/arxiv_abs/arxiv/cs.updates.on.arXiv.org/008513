The simulation of heat flow through heterogeneous material is important for the design of structural
and electronic components. Classical analytical solutions to the heat equation PDE are not known
for many such domains, even those having simple geometries. The finite element method can provide
approximations to a weak form continuum solution, with increasing accuracy as the number of degrees
of freedom in the model increases. This comes at a cost of increased memory usage and computation
time; even when taking advantage of sparse matrix techniques for the finite element system matrix.
We summarize recent approaches in solving problems in structural mechanics and steady state heat
conduction which do not require the explicit assembly of any system matrices, and adapt them to a
method for solving the time-depended flow of heat. These approaches are highly parallelizable,
and can be performed on graphical processing units (GPUs). Furthermore, they lend themselves to
the simulation of heterogeneous material, with a minimum of added complexity. We present the mathematical
framework of assembly-free FEM approaches, through which we summarize the benefits of GPU computation.
We discuss our implementation using the OpenCL computing framework, and show how it is further adapted
for use on multiple GPUs. We compare the performance of single and dual GPUs implementations of our
method with previous GPU computing strategies from the literature and a CPU sparse matrix approach.
The utility of the novel method is demonstrated through the solution of a real-world coefficient
inverse problem that requires thousands of transient heat flow simulations, each of which involves
solving a 1 million degree of freedom linear system over hundreds of time steps.
