We focus on finite element method computations. We show that systems of linear equations resulting
from Galerkin discretizations with C1 test functions are algebraically equivalent to systems
of linear equations resulting from discretizations with piece-wise constant test functions.
We show that test functions that fulfill the partition of unity can be eliminated from the system
of linear equations. The rows of the system matrix can be combined, and the test functions can be sum
up to 1 using the partition of unity property at the quadrature points. The test functions in higher
continuity IGA can be set to piece-wise constants without losing any accuracy. It is equivalent
to testing with piece-wise constant basis functions, with supports span over some parts of the domain.
This observation has the following consequences. The numerical integration cost can be reduced
because we do not need to evaluate the test functions since they are equal to 1. This reduction of test
functions can be performed for an arbitrary linear differential operator resulting from the Galerkin
method applied to a PDE where we use C^1 continuity basis functions. This observation is valid for
any basis functions preserving the partition of unity property. It is independent of the problem
dimension and geometry of the computational domain. It also can be used in time-dependent problems,
e.g., in the explicit dynamics computations, where we can reduce the cost of generation of the right-hand
side. In particular, this observation works for any computational problem that can be solved using
the Galerkin method with isogeometric analysis with higher continuity test functions. The Galerkin
approximation with C1 continuity is equivalent to linear combinations of the collocations at points
and with weights resulting from applied quadrature, over the spans defined by supports of test functions.
