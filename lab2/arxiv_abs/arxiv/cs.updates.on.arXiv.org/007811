Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing has gained in popularity over the past decade, with over
12 million consumers to date. Given its increasing stature in society, along with weak regulatory
oversight, it is important to learn about actual consumers' testing experiences. Traditional
interviews or survey-based studies have been limited in that they had small sample sizes or lacked
detailed descriptions of personal experiences. Yet many people are now sharing their DTC genetic
testing experiences via online social media platforms. In this paper, we focused on one particularly
lively online discussion forum, \textit{r/23andme} subreddit, where, as of before March 2018,
5,857 users published 37,183 posts. We applied topic modeling to the posts and examined the identified
topics and temporal posting trends. We further applied regression analysis to learn the association
between the attention that a submission received, in terms of votes and comments, and the posting
content. Our findings indicate that bursts of the increase of such online discussion in 2017 may
correlate with the Food and Drug Administration's authorization for marketing of 23andMe genetic
test on health risks, as well as the hot sale of 23andMe's products on Black Friday. While ancestry
composition was a popular subject, kinship was steadily growing towards a major online discussion
topic. Moreover, compared with other topics, health and kinship were more likely to receive attention,
in terms of votes, while testing reports were more likely to receive attention, in term of comments.
Our findings suggest that people may not always be prepared to deal with the unexpected consequences
of DTC genetic testing. Moreover, it appears that the users in this subreddit might not sufficiently
consider privacy when taking a test or seeking an interpretation from a third-party service provider.
