The $1|B,r_j|\sum w_jU_j$ scheduling problem takes as input a batch setup time $\Delta$ and a set
of $n$ jobs, each having a processing time, a release date, a weight, and a due date; the task is to find
a sequence of batches that minimizes the weighted number of tardy jobs. This problem was introduced
by Hochbaum and Landy in 1994; as a wide generalization of {\sc Knapsack}, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard.
In this work we provide a multivariate complexity analysis of the $1|B,r_j|\sum w_jU_j$ problem
with respect to several natural parameters. That is, we establish a thorough classification into
fixed-parameter tractable and $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard problems, for parameter combinations of
(i) $\#p$ = distinct number of processing times, (ii) $\#w$ = number of distinct weights, (iii) $\#d$
= number of distinct due dates, (iv) $\#r$ = number of distinct release dates, and (v) $b$ = batch sizes.
Thereby, we significantly extend the work of Hermelin et al. (2018) who analyzed the parameterized
complexity of the non-batch variant of this problem without release dates. As one of our key results,
we prove that $1|B,r_j|\sum w_jU_j$ is $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard parameterized by the number of distinct
processing times and distinct due dates. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first parameterized
intractability results for scheduling problems with few distinct processing times. Further,
we show that $1|B,r_j|\sum w_jU_j$ is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to parameter $\#p+\#d+\#r$
and with respect to parameter $\#w+\#d$ if there is just a single release date. Both results hold
even if the number of jobs per batch is limited by some integer $b$.
