The search problem of computing a \textit{leader-follower equilibrium} has been widely investigated
in the scientific literature in, almost exclusively, the single-follower setting. Although the
\textit{optimistic} and \ textit{pessimistic} versions of the problem are solved with different
methodologies, both cases allow for efficient, polynomial-time algorithms based on linear programming.
The situation is different with multiple followers, where results are only sporadic and depend
strictly on the nature of the followers' game. In this paper, we investigate the setting of a normal-form
game with a single leader and multiple followers who, after observing the leader's commitment,
play a Nash equilibrium. The corresponding search problem, both in the optimistic and pessimistic
versions, is known to be not in Poly-$\textsf{APX}$ unless $\textsf{P}=\textsf{NP}$ and exact
algorithms are known only for the optimistic case. We focus on the case where the followers play in
pure strategies under the assumption of pessimism. After casting this search problem as a \italic{pessimistic
bilevel programming problem}, we show that, with two followers, the problem is $\textsf{NP}$-hard
and, with three or more followers, it is not in Poly-$\textsf{APX}$ unless $\textsf{P}=\textsf{NP}$.
We propose a single-level mathematical programming reformulation which calls for the maximisation
of a nonconcave quadratic function over an unbounded nonconvex feasible region defined by linear
and quadratic constraints. Since, due to admitting a supremum but not a maximum, only a restricted
version of this formulation can be solved to optimality with state-of-the-art methods, we propose
an exact \textit{ad hoc} algorithm, which we also embed within a branch-and-bound scheme, capable
of computing the supremum of the problem.
