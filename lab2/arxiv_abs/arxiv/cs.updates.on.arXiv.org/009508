In this paper we identify a new class of sparse near-quadratic random Boolean matrices that have
full row rank over $\mathbb{F}_2=\{0,1\}$ with high probability and can be transformed into echelon
form in almost linear time by a simple version of Gauss elimination. The random matrix with dimensions
$n(1-\varepsilon) \times n$ is generated as follows: In each row, identify a block of length $L=O((\log
n)/\varepsilon)$ at a random position. The entries outside the block are 0, the entries inside the
block are given by fair coin tosses. Sorting the rows according to the positions of the blocks transforms
the matrix into a kind of band matrix, on which, as it turns out, Gauss elimination works very efficiently
with high probability. For the proof, the effects of Gauss elimination are interpreted as a ("coin-flipping")
variant of Robin Hood hashing, whose behaviour can be captured in terms of a simple Markov model from
queuing theory. Bounds for expected construction time and high success probability follow from
results in this area. By employing hashing, this matrix family leads to a new implementation of a
retrieval data structure, which represents an arbitrary function $f\colon S \to \{0,1\}$ for some
set $S$ of $m=(1-\varepsilon)n$ keys. It requires $m/(1-\varepsilon)$ bits of space, construction
takes $O(m/\varepsilon^2$) expected time on a word RAM, while queries take $O(1/\varepsilon)$
time and access only one contiguous segment of $O((\log m)/\varepsilon)$ bits in the representation.
The method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. By well-established methods the retrieval
data structure leads to efficient constructions of (static) perfect hash functions and (static)
Bloom filters with almost optimal space and very local storage access patterns for queries.
