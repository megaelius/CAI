Collision checking is a well known bottleneck in sampling-based motion planning due to its computational
expense and the large number of checks required. To alleviate this bottleneck, we present a fast
neural network collision checking heuristic, ClearanceNet, and incorporate it within a planning
algorithm, ClearanceNet-RRT (CN-RRT). ClearanceNet takes as input a robot pose and the location
of all obstacles in the workspace and learns to predict the clearance, i.e., distance to nearest
obstacle. CN-RRT then efficiently computes a motion plan by leveraging three key features of ClearanceNet.
First, as neural network inference is massively parallel, CN-RRT explores the space via a parallel
RRT, which expands nodes in parallel, allowing for thousands of collision checks at once. Second,
CN-RRT adaptively relaxes its clearance threshold for more difficult problems. Third, to repair
errors, CN-RRT shifts states towards higher clearance through a gradient-based approach that
uses the analytic gradient of ClearanceNet. Once a path is found, any errors are repaired via RRT
over the misclassified sections, thus maintaining the theoretical guarantees of sampling-based
motion planning. We evaluate the collision checking speed, planning speed, and motion plan efficiency
in configuration spaces with up to 30 degrees of freedom. The collision checking achieves speedups
of more than two orders of magnitude over traditional collision detection methods. Sampling-based
planning over multiple robotic arms in new environment configurations achieves speedups of up
to 51% over a baseline, with paths up to 25% more efficient. Experiments on a physical Fetch robot
reaching into shelves in a cluttered environment confirm the feasibility of this method on real
robots.
