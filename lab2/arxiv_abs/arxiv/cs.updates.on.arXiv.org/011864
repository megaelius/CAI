We introduce a restricted second-order logic $\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$ for finite structures
where second-order quantification ranges over relations of size at most poly-logarithmic in the
size of the structure. We demonstrate the relevance of this logic and complexity class by several
problems in database theory. We then prove a Fagin's style theorem showing that the Boolean queries
which can be expressed in the existential fragment of $\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$ corresponds
exactly to the class of decision problems that can be computed by a non-deterministic Turing machine
with random access to the input in time $O((\log n)^k)$ for some $k \ge 0$, i.e., to the class of problems
computable in non-deterministic poly-logarithmic time. It should be noted that unlike Fagin's
theorem which proves that the existential fragment of second-order logic captures NP over arbitrary
finite structures, our result only holds over ordered finite structures, since $\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$
is too weak as to define a total order of the domain. Nevertheless $\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$
provides natural levels of expressibility within poly-logarithmic space in a way which is closely
related to how second-order logic provides natural levels of expressibility within polynomial
space. Indeed, we show an exact correspondence between the quantifier prefix classes of $\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$
and the levels of the non-deterministic poly-logarithmic time hierarchy, analogous to the correspondence
between the quantifier prefix classes of second-order logic and the polynomial-time hierarchy.
Our work closely relates to the constant depth quasipolynomial size AND/OR circuits and corresponding
restricted second-order logic defined by David A. Mix Barrington in 1992. We explore this relationship
in detail.
