In [20] Goldwasser, Grossman and Holden introduced pseudo-deterministic interactive proofs
for search problems where a powerful prover can convince a probabilistic polynomial time verifier
that a solution to a search problem is canonical. They studied search problems for which polynomial
time algorithms are not known and for which many solutions are possible. They showed that whereas
there exists a constant round pseudo deterministic proof for graph isomorphism where the canonical
solution is the lexicographically smallest isomorphism, the existence of pseudo-deterministic
interactive proofs for NP-hard problems would imply the collapse of the polynomial time hierarchy.
In this paper, we turn our attention to studying doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proofs
for polynomial time search problems: pseudo-deterministic proofs with the extra requirement
that the prover runtime is polynomial and the verifier runtime to verify that a solution is canonical
is significantly lower than the complexity of finding any solution, canonical or otherwise. Naturally
this question is particularly interesting for search problems for which a lower bound on its worst
case complexity is known or has been widely conjectured. We show doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic
algorithms for a host of natural problems whose complexity has long been conjectured. In particular,
we show a doubly efficient pseudo-deterministic NP proof for linear programming, 3-SUM and problems
reducible to 3-SUM, the hitting set problem, and the Zero Weight Triangle problem and show a doubly-efficient
pseudo-deterministic MA proof for the Orthogonal Vectors problem and the $k$-Clique problem.
