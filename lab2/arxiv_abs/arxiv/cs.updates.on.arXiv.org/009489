Eye movements play a vital role in perceiving the world. Eye gaze can give a direct indication of the
users point of attention, which can be useful in improving human-computer interaction. Gaze estimation
in a non-intrusive manner can make human-computer interaction more natural. Eye tracking can be
used for several applications such as fatigue detection, biometric authentication, disease diagnosis,
activity recognition, alertness level estimation, gaze-contingent display, human-computer
interaction, etc. Even though eye-tracking technology has been around for many decades, it has
not found much use in consumer applications. The main reasons are the high cost of eye tracking hardware
and lack of consumer level applications. In this work, we attempt to address these two issues. In
the first part of this work, image-based algorithms are developed for gaze tracking which includes
a new two-stage iris center localization algorithm. We have developed a new algorithm which works
in challenging conditions such as motion blur, glint, and varying illumination levels. A person
independent gaze direction classification framework using a convolutional neural network is
also developed which eliminates the requirement of user-specific calibration. In the second part
of this work, we have developed two applications which can benefit from eye tracking data. A new framework
for biometric identification based on eye movement parameters is developed. A framework for activity
recognition, using gaze data from a head-mounted eye tracker is also developed. The information
from gaze data, ego-motion, and visual features are integrated to classify the activities.
