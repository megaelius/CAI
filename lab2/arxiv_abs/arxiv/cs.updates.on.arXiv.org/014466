The low-level details and high-level semantics are both essential to the semantic segmentation
task. However, to speed up the model inference, current approaches almost always sacrifice the
low-level details, which leads to a considerable accuracy decrease. We propose to treat these spatial
details and categorical semantics separately to achieve high accuracy and high efficiency for
realtime semantic segmentation. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective architecture
with a good trade-off between speed and accuracy, termed Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet
V2). This architecture involves: (i) a Detail Branch, with wide channels and shallow layers to capture
low-level details and generate high-resolution feature representation; (ii) a Semantic Branch,
with narrow channels and deep layers to obtain high-level semantic context. The Semantic Branch
is lightweight due to reducing the channel capacity and a fast-downsampling strategy. Furthermore,
we design a Guided Aggregation Layer to enhance mutual connections and fuse both types of feature
representation. Besides, a booster training strategy is designed to improve the segmentation
performance without any extra inference cost. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed architecture performs favourably against a few state-of-the-art
real-time semantic segmentation approaches. Specifically, for a 2,048x1,024 input, we achieve
72.6% Mean IoU on the Cityscapes test set with a speed of 156 FPS on one NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti card,
which is significantly faster than existing methods, yet we achieve better segmentation accuracy.
