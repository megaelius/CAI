The celebrated Cheeger's Inequality \cite{am85,a86} establishes a bound on the expansion of a
graph via its spectrum. This inequality is central to a rich spectral theory of graphs, based on studying
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs.
It has remained open to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be used
to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph. In this paper we introduce a new
hypergraph Laplacian operator (generalizing the Laplacian matrix of graphs)and study its spectra.
We prove a Cheeger-type inequality for hypergraphs, relating the second smallest eigenvalue of
this operator to the expansion of the hypergraph. We bound other hypergraph expansion parameters
via higher eigenvalues of this operator. We give bounds on the diameter of the hypergraph as a function
of the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian operator. The Markov process underlying the
Laplacian operator can be viewed as a dispersion process on the vertices of the hypergraph that might
be of independent interest. We bound the {\em Mixing-time} of this process as a function of the second
smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian operator. All these results are generalizations of the corresponding
results for graphs. We show that there can be no linear operator for hypergraphs whose spectra captures
hypergraph expansion in a Cheeger-like manner. For any $k$, we give a polynomial time algorithm
to compute an approximation to the $k^{th}$ smallest eigenvalue of the operator. We show that this
approximation factor is optimal under the SSE hypothesis (introduced by \cite{rs10}) for constant
values of $k$. Finally, using the factor preserving reduction from vertex expansion in graphs to
hypergraph expansion, we show that all our results for hypergraphs extend to vertex expansion in
graphs.
