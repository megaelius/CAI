Given a loop-free graph $H$, the reconfiguration problem for homomorphisms to $H$ (also called
$H$-colourings) asks: given two $H$-colourings $f$ of $g$ of a graph $G$, is it possible to transform
$f$ into $g$ by a sequence of single-vertex colour changes such that every intermediate mapping
is an $H$-colouring? This problem is known to be polynomial-time solvable for a wide variety of graphs
$H$ (e.g. all $C_4$-free graphs) but only a handful of hard cases are known. We prove that this problem
is PSPACE-complete whenever $H$ is a $K_{2,3}$-free quadrangulation of the $2$-sphere (equivalently,
the plane) which is not a $4$-cycle. From this result, we deduce an analogous statement for non-bipartite
$K_{2,3}$-free quadrangulations of the projective plane. This include several interesting classes
of graphs, such as odd wheels, for which the complexity was known, and $4$-chromatic generalized
Mycielski graphs, for which it was not. If we instead consider graphs $G$ and $H$ with loops on every
vertex (i.e. reflexive graphs), then the reconfiguration problem is defined in a similar way except
that a vertex can only change its colour to a neighbour of its current colour. In this setting, we use
similar ideas to show that the reconfiguration problem for $H$-colourings is PSPACE-complete
whenever $H$ is a reflexive $K_{4}$-free triangulation of the $2$-sphere which is not a reflexive
triangle. This proof applies more generally to reflexive graphs which, roughly speaking, resemble
a triangulation locally around a particular vertex. This provides the first graphs for which $H$-Recolouring
is known to be PSPACE-complete for reflexive instances.
