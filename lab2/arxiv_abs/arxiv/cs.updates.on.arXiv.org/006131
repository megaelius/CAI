After reviewing models and mitigation strategies for interchannel nonlinear interference (NLI),
we focus on the frequency-resolved logarithmic perturbation model to study the coherence properties
of NLI. Based on this study, we devise an NLI mitigation strategy which exploits the synergic effect
of phase and polarization noise compensation (PPN) and subcarrier multiplexing with symbol-rate
optimization. This synergy persists even for high-order modulation alphabets and Gaussian symbols.
A particle method for the computation of the resulting achievable information rate and spectral
efficiency (SE) is presented and employed to lower-bound the channel capacity. The dependence
of the SE on the link length, amplifier spacing, and presence or absence of inline dispersion compensation
is studied. Single-polarization and dual-polarization scenarios with either independent or
joint processing of the two polarizations are considered. Numerical results show that, in links
with ideal distributed amplification, an SE gain of about 1 bit/s/Hz/polarization can be obtained
(or, in alternative, the system reach can be doubled at a given SE) with respect to single-carrier
systems without PPN mitigation. The gain is lower with lumped amplification, increases with the
number of spans, decreases with the span length, and is further reduced by in-line dispersion compensation.
For instance, considering a dispersion-unmanaged link with lumped amplification and an amplifier
spacing of 60 km, the SE after 80 spans can be be increased from 4.5 to 4.8 bit/s/Hz/polarization,
or the reach raised up to 100 spans (+25%) for a fixed SE.
