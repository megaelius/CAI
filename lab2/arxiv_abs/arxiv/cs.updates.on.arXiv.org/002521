Enhancing noisy speech is an important task to restore its quality and to improve its intelligibility.
In traditional non-machine-learning (ML) based approaches the parameters required for noise
reduction are estimated blindly from the noisy observation while the actual filter functions are
derived analytically based on statistical assumptions. Even though such approaches generalize
well to many different acoustic conditions, the noise suppression capability in transient noises
is low. To amend this shortcoming, machine-learning (ML) methods such as deep learning have been
employed for speech enhancement. However, due to their data-driven nature, the generalization
of ML based approaches to unknown noise types is still discussed. To improve the generalization
of ML based algorithms and to enhance the noise suppression of non-ML based methods, we propose a
combination of both approaches. For this, we employ the a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the a posteriori SNR estimated as input features in a deep neural network (DNN) based enhancement
scheme. We show that this approach allows ML based speech estimators to generalize quickly to unknown
noise types even if only few noise conditions have been seen during training. Further, the proposed
features outperform a competing approach where an estimate of the noise power spectral density
is appended to the noisy spectra. Instrumental measures such as Perceptual Evaluation of Speech
Quality (PESQ) and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) indicate strong improvements
in unseen conditions when the proposed features are used. Listening experiments confirm the improved
generalization of our proposed combination.
