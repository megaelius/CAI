The electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, minimally restrictive, and relatively
low cost measure of mesoscale brain dynamics with high temporal resolution. Although signals recorded
in parallel by multiple, near-adjacent EEG scalp electrode channels are highly-correlated and
combine signals from many different sources, biological and non-biological, independent component
analysis (ICA) has been shown to isolate the various source generator processes underlying those
recordings. Independent components (IC) found by ICA decomposition can be manually inspected,
selected, and interpreted, but doing so requires both time and practice as ICs have no particular
order or intrinsic interpretations and therefore require further study of their properties. Alternatively,
sufficiently-accurate automated IC classifiers can be used to classify ICs into broad source categories,
speeding the analysis of EEG studies with many subjects and enabling the use of ICA decomposition
in near-real-time applications. While many such classifiers have been proposed recently, this
work presents the ICLabel project comprised of (1) an IC dataset containing spatiotemporal measures
for over 200,000 ICs from more than 6,000 EEG recordings, (2) a website for collecting crowdsourced
IC labels and educating EEG researchers and practitioners about IC interpretation, and (3) the
automated ICLabel classifier. The classifier improves upon existing methods in two ways: by improving
the accuracy of the computed label estimates and by enhancing its computational efficiency. The
ICLabel classifier outperforms or performs comparably to the previous best publicly available
method for all measured IC categories while computing those labels ten times faster than that classifier
as shown in a rigorous comparison against all other publicly available EEG IC classifiers.
