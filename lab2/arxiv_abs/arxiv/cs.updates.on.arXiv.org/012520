Simulation-to-simulation and simulation-to-real world transfer of neural network models have
been a difficult problem. To close the reality gap, prior methods to simulation-to-real world transfer
focused on domain adaptation, decoupling perception and dynamics and solving each problem separately,
and randomization of agent parameters and environment conditions to expose the learning agent
to a variety of conditions. While these methods provide acceptable performance, the computational
complexity required to capture a large variation of parameters for comprehensive scenarios on
a given task such as autonomous driving or robotic manipulation is high. Our key contribution is
to theoretically prove and empirically demonstrate that a deep attention convolutional neural
network (DACNN) with specific visual sensor configuration performs as well as training on a dataset
with high domain and parameter variation at lower computational complexity. Specifically, the
attention network weights are learned through policy optimization to focus on local dependencies
that lead to optimal actions, and does not require tuning in real-world for generalization. Our
new architecture adapts perception with respect to the control objective, resulting in zero-shot
learning without pre-training a perception network. To measure the impact of our new deep network
architecture on domain adaptation, we consider autonomous driving as a use case. We perform an extensive
set of experiments in simulation-to-simulation and simulation-to-real scenarios to compare
our approach to several baselines including the current state-of-art models.
