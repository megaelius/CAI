The (ultra-)dense deployment of small-cell base stations (SBSs) endowed with cloud-like computing
functionalities paves the way for pervasive mobile edge computing (MEC), enabling ultra-low latency
and location-awareness for a variety of emerging mobile applications and the Internet of Things.
To handle spatially uneven computation workloads in the network, cooperation among SBSs via workload
peer offloading is essential to avoid large computation latency at overloaded SBSs and provide
high quality of service to end users. However, performing effective peer offloading faces many
unique challenges in small cell networks due to limited energy resources committed by self-interested
SBS owners, uncertainties in the system dynamics and co-provisioning of radio access and computing
services. This paper develops a novel online SBS peer offloading framework, called OPEN, by leveraging
the Lyapunov technique, in order to maximize the long-term system performance while keeping the
energy consumption of SBSs below individual long-term constraints. OPEN works online without
requiring information about future system dynamics, yet provides provably near-optimal performance
compared to the oracle solution that has the complete future information. In addition, this paper
formulates a novel peer offloading game among SBSs, analyzes its equilibrium and efficiency loss
in terms of the price of anarchy in order to thoroughly understand SBSs' strategic behaviors, thereby
enabling decentralized and autonomous peer offloading decision making. Extensive simulations
are carried out and show that peer offloading among SBSs dramatically improves the edge computing
performance.
