In chemical reaction networks (CRNs) with stochastic semantics based on continuous-time Markov
chains (CTMCs), the typically large populations of species cause combinatorially large state
spaces. This makes the analysis very difficult in practice and represents the major bottleneck
for the applicability of minimization techniques based, for instance, on lumpability. In this
paper we present syntactic Markovian bisimulation (SMB), a notion of bisimulation developed in
the Larsen-Skou style of probabilistic bisimulation, defined over the structure of a CRN rather
than over its underlying CTMC. SMB identifies a lumpable partition of the CTMC state space a priori,
in the sense that it is an equivalence relation over species implying that two CTMC states are lumpable
when they are invariant with respect to the total population of species within the same equivalence
class. We develop an efficient partition-refinement algorithm which computes the largest SMB
of a CRN in polynomial time in the number of species and reactions. We also provide an algorithm for
obtaining a quotient network from an SMB that induces the lumped CTMC directly, thus avoiding the
generation of the state space of the original CRN altogether. In practice, we show that SMB allows
significant reductions in a number of models from the literature. Finally, we study SMB with respect
to the deterministic semantics of CRNs based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where
each equation gives the time-course evolution of the concentration of a species. SMB implies forward
CRN bisimulation, a recently developed behavioral notion of equivalence for the ODE semantics,
in an analogous sense: it yields a smaller ODE system that keeps track of the sums of the solutions
for equivalent species.
