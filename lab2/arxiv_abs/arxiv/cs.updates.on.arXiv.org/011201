Noninvasive MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatments are promising alternatives to
the surgical removal of malignant tumors. A significant challenge is assessing the treated tissue
immediately after MRgFUS procedures. Although current clinical assessment uses the immediate
nonperfused volume (NPV) biomarker derived from contrast enhanced imaging, the use of contrast
agent prevents continuing MRgFUS treatment if margins are not adequate. In addition, the NPV has
been shown to provide variable accuracy for the true treatment outcome as evaluated by follow-up
biomarkers. This work presents a novel, noncontrast, learned multiparametric MR biomarker that
is conducive for intratreatment assessment. MRgFUS ablations were performed in a rabbit VX2 tumor
model. Multiparametric MRI was obtained both during and immediately after the MRgFUS ablation,
as well as during follow-up imaging. Segmentation of the NPV obtained during follow-up imaging
was used to train a neural network on noncontrast multiparametric MR images. The NPV follow-up segmentation
was registered to treatment-day images using a novel volume-conserving registration algorithm,
allowing a voxel-wise correlation between imaging sessions. Contrasted with state-of-the-art
registration algorithms that change the average volume by 16.8%, the presented volume-conserving
registration algorithm changes the average volume by only 0.28%. After registration, the learned
multiparametric MR biomarker predicted the follow-up NPV with an average DICE coefficient of 0.71,
outperforming the DICE coefficient of 0.53 from the current standard of NPV obtained immediately
after the ablation treatment. Noncontrast multiparametric MR imaging can provide a more accurate
prediction of treated tissue immediately after treatment. Noncontrast assessment of MRgFUS procedures
will potentially lead to more efficacious MRgFUS ablation treatments.
