There are various teaching methods developed in order to attain successful delivery of a subject
without prior knowledge of the interaction among the students in a class. Social network analysis
can be used to identify individual, intermediate and group measures of interaction in a classroom.
The idea is on identifying ways to boost the students performance by means of lecturers intervention
based on their interaction. The case study was conducted involving third year batch that consisted
of 76 female and 24 male students. A friendship network was drawn based on the information obtained
at the end of semester 5 and it was investigated based on two metrics namely centrality measures and
Girvan Newman algorithm. At the end of semester 5, grades were added as the attributes of the network.
12 clusters were found in this batch and a distinct pattern was identified between performing and
poor achieving students. At the beginning of the 6th semester, the students were given the option
to choose between 2 groups. Group 1 was unperturbed without any lecturers intervention whereas
the performing students clusters in Group 1 were preserved but the students in poor performing clusters
were distributed among performing clusters. The students were then asked to carry out assignments
and quizzes in their respective groups. The final grades indicated that the performance of the students
of Group 1 was much superior and there was clear evidence that those poor performing students in the
5th semester performed much better in semester 6. This shows that by understanding the students
interaction and incorporating instructors minimal intervention, the performance of the students
can be improved by creating a social contagion effect through group assignment clustering.
