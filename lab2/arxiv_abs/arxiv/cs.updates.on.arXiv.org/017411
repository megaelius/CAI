Geological settings with reservoir characteristics include fractures with different material
and geometrical properties. Hence, numerical simulations in applied geophysics demands for computational
frameworks which efficiently allow to integrate various fracture geometries in a porous medium
matrix. This study presents a modeling approach for single-phase flow in fractured porous media
and its application to different types of non-conforming mesh models. We propose a combination
of the Lagrange multiplier method with variational transfer to allow for complex non-conforming
geometries as well as hybrid- and equi-dimensional models and discretizations of flow through
fractured porous media. The variational transfer is based on the $L^2$-projection and enables
an accurate and highly efficient parallel projection of fields between non-conforming meshes
(e.g.,\ between fracture and porous matrix domain). We present the different techniques as a unified
mathematical framework with a practical perspective. By means of numerical examples we discuss
both, performance and applicability of the particular strategies. Comparisons of finite element
simulation results to widely adopted 2D benchmark cases show good agreement and the dual Lagrange
multiplier spaces show good performance. In an extension to 3D fracture networks, we first provide
complementary results to a recently developed benchmark case, before we explore a complex scenario
which leverages the different types of fracture meshes. Complex and highly conductive fracture
networks are found more suitable in combination with embedded hybrid-dimensional fractures.
However, thick and blocking fractures are better approximated by equi-dimensional embedded fractures
and the equi-dimensional mortar method, respectively.
