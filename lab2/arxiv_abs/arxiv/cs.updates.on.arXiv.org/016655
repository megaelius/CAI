Single-molecule localization fluorescence microscopy constructs super-resolution images
by sequential imaging and computational localization of sparsely activated fluorophores. Accurate
and efficient fluorophore localization algorithms are key to the success of this computational
microscopy method. We present a novel localization algorithm based on deep learning which significantly
improves upon the state of the art. Our contributions are a novel network architecture for simultaneous
detection and localization, and new loss function which phrases detection and localization as
a Bayesian inference problem, and thus allows the network to provide uncertainty-estimates. In
contrast to standard methods which independently process imaging frames, our network architecture
uses temporal context from multiple sequentially imaged frames to detect and localize molecules.
We demonstrate the power of our method across a variety of datasets, imaging modalities, signal
to noise ratios, and fluorophore densities. While existing localization algorithms can achieve
optimal localization accuracy at low fluorophore densities, they are confounded by high densities.
Our method is the first deep-learning based approach which achieves state-of-the-art on the SMLM2016
challenge. It achieves the best scores on 12 out of 12 data-sets when comparing both detection accuracy
and precision, and excels at high densities. Finally, we investigate how unsupervised learning
can be used to make the network robust against mismatch between simulated and real data. The lessons
learned here are more generally relevant for the training of deep networks to solve challenging
Bayesian inverse problems on spatially extended domains in biology and physics.
