Understanding the meaning of existing SQL queries is critical for code maintenance and reuse. Yet
SQL can be hard to read, even for expert users or the original creator of a query. We conjecture that
it is possible to capture the logical intent of queries in \emph{automatically-generated visual
diagrams} that can help users understand the meaning of queries faster and more accurately than
SQL text alone. We present initial steps in that direction with visual diagrams that are based on
the first-order logic foundation of SQL and can capture the meaning of deeply nested queries. Our
diagrams build upon a rich history of diagrammatic reasoning systems in logic and were designed
using a large body of human-computer interaction best practices: they are \emph{minimal} in that
no visual element is superfluous; they are \emph{unambiguous} in that no two queries with different
semantics map to the same visualization; and they \emph{extend} previously existing visual representations
of relational schemata and conjunctive queries in a natural way. An experimental evaluation involving
42 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk shows that with only a 2--3 minute static tutorial, participants
could interpret queries meaningfully faster with our diagrams than when reading SQL alone. Moreover,
we have evidence that our visual diagrams result in participants making fewer errors than with SQL.
We believe that more regular exposure to diagrammatic representations of SQL can give rise to a \emph{pattern-based}
and thus more intuitive use and re-use of SQL. All details on the experimental study, the evaluation
stimuli, raw data, and analyses, and source code are available at https://osf.io/mycr2
