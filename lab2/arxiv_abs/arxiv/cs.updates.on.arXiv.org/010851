Recent advances in medical imaging techniques have led to significant improvements in the management
of prostate cancer (PCa). In particular, multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) continues to gain clinical
acceptance as the preferred imaging technique for non-invasive detection and grading of PCa. However,
the machine learning-based diagnosis systems for PCa are often constrained by the limited access
to accurate lesion ground truth annotations for training. The performance of the machine learning
system is highly dependable on both quality and quantity of lesion annotations associated with
histopathologic findings, resulting in limited scalability and clinical validation. Here, we
propose the baseline MRI model to alternatively learn the appearance of mp-MRI using radiology-confirmed
negative MRI cases via weakly supervised learning. Since PCa lesions are case-specific and highly
heterogeneous, it is assumed to be challenging to synthesize PCa lesions using the baseline MRI
model, while it would be relatively easier to synthesize the normal appearance in mp-MRI. We then
utilize the baseline MRI model to infer the pixel-wise suspiciousness of PCa by comparing the original
and synthesized MRI with two distance functions. We trained and validated the baseline MRI model
using 1,145 negative prostate mp-MRI scans. For evaluation, we used separated 232 mp-MRI scans,
consisting of both positive and negative MRI cases. The 116 positive MRI scans were annotated by
radiologists, confirmed with post-surgical whole-gland specimens. The suspiciousness map was
evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for PCa lesions versus non-PCa
regions classification and free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis
for PCa localization. Our proposed method achieved 0.84 area under the ROC curve and 77.0% sensitivity
at one false positive per patient in FROC analysis.
