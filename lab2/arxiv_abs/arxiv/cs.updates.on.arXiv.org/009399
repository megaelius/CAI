Convolutional neural network (CNN) based segmentation methods provide an efficient and automated
way for clinicians to assess the structure and function of the heart in cardiac MR images. While CNNs
can generally perform the segmentation tasks with high accuracy when training and test images come
from the same domain (e.g. same scanner or site), their performance often degrades dramatically
on images from different scanners or clinical sites. We propose a simple yet effective way for improving
the network generalization ability by carefully designing data normalization and augmentation
strategies to accommodate common scenarios in multi-site, multi-scanner clinical imaging data
sets. We demonstrate that a neural network trained on a single-site single-scanner dataset from
the UK Biobank can be successfully applied to segmenting cardiac MR images across different sites
and different scanners without substantial loss of accuracy. Specifically, the method was trained
on a large set of 3,975 subjects from the UK Biobank. It was then directly tested on 600 different subjects
from the UK Biobank for intra-domain testing and two other sets for cross-domain testing: the ACDC
dataset (100 subjects, 1 site, 2 scanners) and the BSCMR-AS dataset (599 subjects, 6 sites, 9 scanners).
The proposed method produces promising segmentation results on the UK Biobank test set which are
comparable to previously reported values in the literature, while also performing well on cross-domain
test sets, achieving a mean Dice metric of 0.90 for the left ventricle, 0.81 for the myocardium and
0.82 for the right ventricle on the ACDC dataset; and 0.89 for the left ventricle, 0.83 for the myocardium
on the BSCMR-AS dataset. The proposed method offers a potential solution to improve CNN-based model
generalizability for the cross-scanner and cross-site cardiac MR image segmentation task.
