Behavioral malware detectors promise to expose previously unknown malware and are an important
security primitive. However, even the best behavioral detectors suffer from high false positives
and negatives. In this paper, we address the challenge of aggregating weak per-device behavioral
detectors in noisy communities (i.e., ones that produce alerts at unpredictable rates) into an
accurate and robust global anomaly detector (GD). Our system - Shape GD - combines two insights:
Structural: actions such as visiting a website (waterhole attack) or membership in a shared email
thread (phishing attack) by nodes correlate well with malware spread, and create dynamic neighborhoods
of nodes that were exposed to the same attack vector; and Statistical: feature vectors corresponding
to true and false positives of local detectors have markedly different conditional distributions.
We use neighborhoods to amplify the transient low-dimensional structure that is latent in high-dimensional
feature vectors - but neighborhoods vary unpredictably, and we use shape to extract robust neighborhood-level
features that identify infected neighborhoods. Unlike prior works that aggregate local detectors'
alert bitstreams or cluster the feature vectors, Shape GD analyzes the feature vectors that led
to local alerts (alert-FVs) to separate true and false positives. Shape GD first filters these alert-FVs
into neighborhoods and efficiently maps a neighborhood's alert-FVs' statistical shapes into
a scalar score. Shape GD then acts as a neighborhood level anomaly detector - training on benign program
traces to learn the ShapeScore of false positive neighborhoods, and classifying neighborhoods
with anomalous ShapeScores as malicious. Shape GD detects malware early (~100 infected nodes in
a ~100K node system for waterhole and ~10 of 1000 for phishing) and robustly (with ~100% global TP
and ~1% global FP rates).
