The statistic of World Health Organization shows at one year about 287000 women died most of them
during and following pregnancy and childbirth in Africa and south Asia. This paper suggests system
for serving pregnant women using open source based on Android technology, the proposed system works
based on mobile GIS to select closest care centre or hospital maternity on Google map for the pregnant
woman, which completed an online registration by sending SMS via GPRS network (or internet) contains
her name and phone number and region (Longitude and Latitude) and other required information the
server will save the information in server database then find the closest care centre and call her
for first review at the selected care centre, the proposed system allowed the pregnant women from
her location (home, market, etc) can send a help request in emergency cases (via SMS by click one button)
contains the ID for this pregnant woman, and her coordinates (Longitude and Latitude) via GPRS network,
then the server will locate the pregnant on Google map and retrieve the pregnant information from
the database. This information will be used by the server to send succoring to pregnant woman at her
location and at the same time notify the nearest hospital and moreover, the server will send SMS over
IP to inform her husband and the hospital doctors. Implement and applied this proposed system of
pregnant women shows more effective cost than other systems because it works in economic mode (SMS),
and the services of proposed system are flexible (open source platform) as well as rapidly (mobile
GIS based on Android) achieved locally registration, succoring in emergency cases, change the
review date of pregnant woman, addition to different types of advising according to pregnancy.
