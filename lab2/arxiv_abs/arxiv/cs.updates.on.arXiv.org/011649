In the contemporary world, with the incubation of advanced technologies and tremendous outbursts
of research works, analyzing big data to incorporate research strategies becomes more helpful
using the tools and techniques presented in the current research scenario. This paper indeed tries
to tackle the most prominent challenges relating to big data analysis by utilizing a text mining
approach to analyze research data published in the field of production management as a case to begin
with. The study has been conducted by considering research data of International Journal of Production
Research (IJPR) indexed in Scopus between 1961-2017 by dividing the analysis incurred into 3 fragments
being 1961-1990, 1991-2010 and finally 2011-2017 as a case to highlight the focus of journal. This
has indeed provided multi-faceted benefits such as increasing the effectiveness of the procured
data with well-established comparisons between R and Python Programming along with providing
detailed research trends on the research work incubated. The results of the study highlighted some
most prominent topics in the existing IJPR literature such as system's optimization, supplier
selection, process design, etc. providing well-established details relating to ongoing research
works. The study also compared both languages suiting to a particular field of study for better comprehension
and vastness of the research topics. The current research work is one of the part of a copyright work
with registration number SW-10310/2018 titled Program for Analyzing Key Trends in Research Data-set.
It has been designed in Python for carrying out detailed content analysis based on the available
research database in bib format as in the current context it has been applied for IJPR journal and
can be replicated on articles of any domain found using keyword search.
