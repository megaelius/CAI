Objective: Participation in a physical therapy program is considered one of the greatest predictors
of successful conservative management of common shoulder disorders. However, adherence to these
protocols is often poor and typically worse for unsupervised home exercise programs. Currently,
there are limited tools available for objective measurement of adherence in the home setting. The
goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the potential for performing home shoulder physiotherapy
monitoring using a commercial smartwatch. Approach: Twenty healthy adult subjects with no prior
shoulder disorders performed seven exercises from an evidence-based rotator cuff physiotherapy
protocol, while 6-axis inertial sensor data was collected from the active extremity. Within an
activity recognition chain (ARC) framework, four supervised learning algorithms were trained
and optimized to classify the exercises: k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), random forest (RF), support
vector machine classifier (SVC), and a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). Algorithm
performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation stratified first temporally and then
by subject. Main Results: Categorical classification accuracy was above 94% for all algorithms
on the temporally stratified cross validation, with the best performance achieved by the CRNN algorithm
(99.4%). The subject stratified cross validation, which evaluated classifier performance on
unseen subjects, yielded lower accuracies scores again with CRNN performing best (88.9%). Significance:
This proof of concept study demonstrates the technical feasibility of a smartwatch device and supervised
machine learning approach to more easily monitor and assess the at-home adherence of shoulder physiotherapy
exercise protocols.
