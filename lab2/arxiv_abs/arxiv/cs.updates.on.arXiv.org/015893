Graph learning (GL) can dynamically capture the distribution structure (graph structure) of data
based on graph convolutional networks (GCN), and the learning quality of the graph structure directly
influences GCN for semi-supervised classification. Existing methods mostly combine the computational
layer and the related losses into GCN for exploring the global graph(measuring graph structure
from all data samples) or local graph (measuring graph structure from local data samples). Global
graph emphasises on the whole structure description of the inter-class data, while local graph
trend to the neighborhood structure representation of intra-class data. However, it is difficult
to simultaneously balance these graphs of the learning process for semi-supervised classification
because of the interdependence of these graphs. To simulate the interdependence, deep graph learning(DGL)
is proposed to find the better graph representation for semi-supervised classification. DGL can
not only learn the global structure by the previous layer metric computation updating, but also
mine the local structure by next layer local weight reassignment. Furthermore, DGL can fuse the
different structures by dynamically encoding the interdependence of these structures, and deeply
mine the relationship of the different structures by the hierarchical progressive learning for
improving the performance of semi-supervised classification. Experiments demonstrate the DGL
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets (Citeseer,Cora, and Pubmed)
for citation networks and two benchmark datasets (MNIST and Cifar10) for images.
