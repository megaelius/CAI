Medical imaging is crucial in modern clinics to guide the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Medical
image reconstruction is one of the most fundamental and important components of medical imaging,
whose major objective is to acquire high-quality medical images for clinical usage at the minimal
cost and risk to the patients. Mathematical models in medical image reconstruction or, more generally,
image restoration in computer vision, have been playing a prominent role. Earlier mathematical
models are mostly designed by human knowledge or hypothesis on the image to be reconstructed, and
we shall call these models handcrafted models. Later, handcrafted plus data-driven modeling started
to emerge which still mostly relies on human designs, while part of the model is learned from the observed
data. More recently, as more data and computation resources are made available, deep learning based
models (or deep models) pushed the data-driven modeling to the extreme where the models are mostly
based on learning with minimal human designs. Both handcrafted and data-driven modeling have their
own advantages and disadvantages. One of the major research trends in medical imaging is to combine
handcrafted modeling with deep modeling so that we can enjoy benefits from both approaches. The
major part of this article is to provide a conceptual review of some recent works on deep modeling
from the unrolling dynamics viewpoint. This viewpoint stimulates new designs of neural network
architectures with inspirations from optimization algorithms and numerical differential equations.
Given the popularity of deep modeling, there are still vast remaining challenges in the field, as
well as opportunities which we shall discuss at the end of this article.
