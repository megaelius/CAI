Recommender systems are widely used to predict personalized preferences of goods or services using
users' past activities, such as item ratings or purchase histories. If collections of such personal
activities were made publicly available, they could be used to personalize a diverse range of services,
including targeted advertisement or recommendations. However, there would be an accompanying
risk of privacy violations. The pioneering work of Narayanan et al.\ demonstrated that even if the
identifiers are eliminated, the public release of user ratings can allow for the identification
of users by those who have only a small amount of data on the users' past ratings. In this paper, we assume
the following setting. A collector collects user ratings, then anonymizes and distributes them.
A recommender constructs a recommender system based on the anonymized ratings provided by the collector.
Based on this setting, we exhaustively list the models of recommender systems that use anonymized
ratings. For each model, we then present an item-based collaborative filtering algorithm for making
recommendations based on anonymized ratings. Our experimental results show that an item-based
collaborative filtering based on anonymized ratings can perform better than collaborative filterings
based on 5--10 non-anonymized ratings. This surprising result indicates that, in some settings,
privacy protection does not necessarily reduce the usefulness of recommendations. From the experimental
analysis of this counterintuitive result, we observed that the sparsity of the ratings can be reduced
by anonymization and the variance of the prediction can be reduced if $k$, the anonymization parameter,
is appropriately tuned. In this way, the predictive performance of recommendations based on anonymized
ratings can be improved in some settings.
