Density estimation is a versatile technique underlying many data mining tasks and techniques,ranging
from exploration and presentation of static data, to probabilistic classification, or identifying
changes or irregularities in streaming data. With the pervasiveness of embedded systems and digitisation,
this latter type of streaming and evolving data becomes more important. Nevertheless, research
in density estimation has so far focused on stationary data, leaving the task of of extrapolating
and predicting density at time points outside a training window an open problem. For this task, Temporal
Density Extrapolation (TDX) is proposed. This novel method models and predicts gradual monotonous
changes in a distribution. It is based on the expansion of basis functions, whose weights are modelled
as functions of compositional data over time by using an isometric log-ratio transformation. Extrapolated
density estimates are then obtained by extrapolating the weights to the requested time point, and
querying the density from the basis functions with back-transformed weights. Our approach aims
for broad applicability by neither being restricted to a specific parametric distribution, nor
relying on cluster structure in the data.It requires only two additional extrapolation-specific
parameters, for which reasonable defaults exist. Experimental evaluation on various data streams,
synthetic as well as from the real-world domains of credit scoring and environmental health, shows
that the model manages to capture monotonous drift patterns accurately and better than existing
methods. Thereby, it requires not more than 1.5-times the run time of a corresponding static density
estimation approach.
