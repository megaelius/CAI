Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the subject of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, is a technology
for determining the 3-D structure of macromolecules from many noisy 2-D projections of instances
of these macromolecules, whose orientations and positions are unknown. The molecular structures
are not rigid objects, but flexible objects involved in dynamical processes. The different conformations
are exhibited by different instances of the macromolecule observed in a cryo-EM experiment, each
of which is recorded as a particle image. The range of conformations and the conformation of each
particle are not known a priori; one of the great promises of cryo-EM is to map this conformation space.
Remarkable progress has been made in determining rigid structures from homogeneous samples of
molecules in spite of the unknown orientation of each particle image and significant progress has
been made in recovering a few distinct states from mixtures of rather distinct conformations, but
more complex heterogeneous samples remain a major challenge. We introduce the ``hyper-molecule''
framework for modeling structures across different states of heterogeneous molecules, including
continuums of states. The key idea behind this framework is representing heterogeneous macromolecules
as high-dimensional objects, with the additional dimensions representing the conformation space.
This idea is then refined to model properties such as localized heterogeneity. In addition, we introduce
an algorithmic framework for recovering such maps of heterogeneous objects from experimental
data using a Bayesian formulation of the problem and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms
to address the computational challenges in recovering these high dimensional hyper-molecules.
We demonstrate these ideas in a prototype applied to synthetic data.
