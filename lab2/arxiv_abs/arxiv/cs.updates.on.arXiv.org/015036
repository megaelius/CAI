Directed Steiner Tree (DST) is a central problem in combinatorial optimization and theoretical
computer science: Given a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ with edge costs $c \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^E$,
a root $r \in V$ and $k$ terminals $K\subseteq V$, we need to output the minimum-cost arborescence
in $G$ that contains an $r$\textrightarrow $t$ path for every $t \in K$. Recently, Grandoni, Laekhanukit
and Li, and independently Ghuge and Nagarajan, gave quasi-polynomial time $O(\log^2k/\log \log
k)$-approximation algorithms for the problem, which are tight under popular complexity assumptions.
In this paper, we consider the more general Degree-Bounded Directed Steiner Tree (DB-DST) problem,
where we are additionally given a degree bound $d_v$ on each vertex $v \in V$, and we require that every
vertex $v$ in the output tree has at most $d_v$ children. We give a quasi-polynomial time $(O(\log
n \log k), O(\log^2 n))$-bicriteria approximation: The algorithm produces a solution with cost
at most $O(\log n\log k)$ times the cost of the optimum solution that violates the degree constraints
by at most a factor of $O(\log^2n)$. This is the first non-trivial result for the problem. While our
cost-guarantee is nearly optimal, the degree violation factor of $O(\log^2n)$ is an $O(\log n)$-factor
away from the approximation lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ from the set-cover hardness. The hardness
result holds even on the special case of the {\em Degree-Bounded Group Steiner Tree} problem on trees
(DB-GST-T). With the hope of closing the gap, we study the question of whether the degree violation
factor can be made tight for this special case. We answer the question in the affirmative by giving
an $(O(\log n\log k), O(\log n))$-bicriteria approximation algorithm for DB-GST-T.
