Detectability is a basic property of dynamic systems: when it holds one can use the observed output
signal produced by a system to reconstruct its current state. In this paper, we consider properties
of this type in the framework of discrete event systems modeled by labeled Petri nets and finite automata.
We first study weak approximate detectability. This property implies that there exists an evolution
of the system such that each corresponding observed output sequence with length greater than a given
value allows one to determine if the current state belongs to a given set. We show that the problem
of verifying this property is undecidable for labeled Petri nets, and PSPACE-complete for finite
automata. We also consider two new concepts called instant strong detectability and eventual strong
detectability. The former property implies that for each possible evolution the corresponding
observed output sequence allows one to reconstruct the current state. The latter implies that for
each possible evolution, there exists a value such that each corresponding observed output sequence
with length greater than than that value allows one to reconstruct the current state. We show that
for labeled Petri nets, the problems of verifying these two properties are both decidable and EXPSPACE-hard;
while for finite automata, both properties can be verified in polynomial time. In addition, we show
that strong detectability in the literature is strictly stronger than eventual strong detectability,
but strictly weaker than instant strong detectability, for both finite automata and labeled Petri
nets. In particular for deterministic finite au- tomata, eventual strong detectability is equivalent
to strong detectability.
