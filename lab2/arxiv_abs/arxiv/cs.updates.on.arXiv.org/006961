Convolutional neural networks are sensitive to unknown noisy condition in the test phase and so
their performance degrades for the noisy data classification task including noisy speech recognition.
In this research, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) model with data uncertainty handling;
referred as NCNN (Neutrosophic Convolutional Neural Network); is proposed for classification
task. Here, speech signals are used as input data and their noise is modeled as uncertainty. In this
task, using speech spectrogram, a definition of uncertainty is proposed in neutrosophic (NS) domain.
Uncertainty is computed for each Time-frequency point of speech spectrogram as like a pixel. Therefore,
uncertainty matrix with the same size of spectrogram is created in NS domain. In the next step, a two
parallel paths CNN classification model is proposed. Speech spectrogram is used as input of the
first path and uncertainty matrix for the second path. The outputs of two paths are combined to compute
the final output of the classifier. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, it has been
compared with conventional CNN on the isolated words of Aurora2 dataset. The proposed method achieves
the average accuracy of 85.96 in noisy train data. It is more robust against Car, Airport and Subway
noises with accuracies 90, 88 and 81 in test sets A, B and C, respectively. Results show that the proposed
method outperforms conventional CNN with the improvement of 6, 5 and 2 percentage in test set A, test
set B and test sets C, respectively. It means that the proposed method is more robust against noisy
data and handle these data effectively.
