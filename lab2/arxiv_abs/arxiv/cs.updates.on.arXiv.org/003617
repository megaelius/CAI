Confocal Laser Endomicroscope (CLE) is a novel handheld fluorescence imaging device that has shown
promise for rapid intraoperative diagnosis of brain tumor tissue. Currently CLE is capable of image
display only and lacks an automatic system to aid the surgeon in analyzing the images. The goal of
this project was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic approach for CLE imaging of human glioma
with feature localization function. Despite the tremendous progress in object detection and image
segmentation methods in recent years, most of such methods require large annotated datasets for
training. However, manual annotation of thousands of histopathological images by physicians
is costly and time consuming. To overcome this problem, we propose a Weakly-Supervised Learning
(WSL)-based model for feature localization that trains on image-level annotations, and then localizes
incidences of a class-of-interest in the test image. We developed a novel convolutional neural
network for diagnostic features localization from CLE images by employing a novel multiscale activation
map that is laterally inhibited and collaterally integrated. To validate our method, we compared
proposed model's output to the manual annotation performed by four neurosurgeons on test images.
Proposed model achieved 88% mean accuracy and 86% mean intersection over union on intermediate
features and 87% mean accuracy and 88% mean intersection over union on restrictive fine features,
while outperforming other state of the art methods tested. This system can improve accuracy and
efficiency in characterization of CLE images of glioma tissue during surgery, augment intraoperative
decision-making process regarding tumor margin and affect resection rates.
