In the implementation and use of research information systems (RIS) in scientific institutions,
text data mining and semantic technologies are a key technology for the meaningful use of large amounts
of data. It is not the collection of data that is difficult, but the further processing and integration
of the data in RIS. Data is usually not uniformly formatted and structured, such as texts and tables
that cannot be linked. These include various source systems with their different data formats such
as project and publication databases, CERIF and RCD data model, etc. Internal and external data
sources continue to develop. On the one hand, they must be constantly synchronized and the results
of the data links checked. On the other hand, the texts must be processed in natural language and certain
information extracted. Using text data mining, the quality of the metadata is analyzed and this
identifies the entities and general keywords. So that the user is supported in the search for interesting
research information. The information age makes it easier to store huge amounts of data and increase
the number of documents on the internet, in institutions' intranets, in newswires and blogs is overwhelming.
Search engines should help to specifically open up these sources of information and make them usable
for administrative and research purposes. Against this backdrop, the aim of this paper is to provide
an overview of text data mining techniques and the management of successful data quality for RIS
in the context of open data and open science in scientific institutions and libraries, as well as
to provide ideas for their application. In particular, solutions for the RIS will be presented.
