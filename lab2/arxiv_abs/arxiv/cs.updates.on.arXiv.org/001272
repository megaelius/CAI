Interactive-proof-based approaches are widely used in verifiable computation outsourcing.
The verifier models a computationally-constrained client and the provers model powerful service
providers. In classical interactive-proof models with multiple provers, the provers' interests
either perfectly align (e.g. MIP) or directly conflict (e.g. refereed games). However, service
providers participating in outsourcing applications may not meet such extremes. Instead, each
provider may be paid for his service, while he acts solely in his own best interest. An active research
area in this context is rational interactive proofs (RIP), in which the provers try to maximize their
payment. However, existing works consider either a single prover, or multiple provers who cooperate
to maximize their total payment. None of them truly capture the strategic nature of multiple service
providers. How to define and design non-cooperative rational interactive proofs is a well-known
open problem. We introduce a multi-prover interactive-proof model in which the provers are rational
and non-cooperative. That is, each prover acts individually so as to maximize his own payment in
the resulting game. This model generalizes single-prover rational interactive proofs as well
as cooperative multi-prover rational proofs. This new model better reflects the strategic nature
of service providers from a game-theoretic viewpoint. To design and analyze non-cooperative rational
interactive proofs (ncRIP), we define a new solution concept for extensive-form games with imperfect
information, strong sequential equilibrium. Our technical results focus on protocols which give
strong guarantees on utility gap, which is analogous to soundness gap in classical interactive
proofs. We give tight characterizations of the class of ncRIP protocols with constant, noticeable,
and negligible gap.
