In this paper, we propose deep learning algorithms for ranking response surfaces, with applications
to optimal stopping problems in financial mathematics. The problem of ranking response surfaces
is motivated by estimating optimal feedback policy maps in stochastic control problems, aiming
to efficiently find the index associated to the minimal response across the entire continuous input
space $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. By considering points in $\mathcal{X}$ as pixels
and indices of the minimal surfaces as labels, we recast the problem as an image segmentation problem,
which assigns a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain
characteristics. This provides an alternative method for efficiently solving the problem instead
of using sequential design in our previous work [R. Hu and M. Ludkovski, SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty
Quantification, 5 (2017), 212--239]. Deep learning algorithms are scalable, parallel and model-free,
i.e., no parametric assumptions needed on the response surfaces. Considering ranking response
surfaces as image segmentation allows one to use a broad class of deep neural networks, e.g., UNet,
SegNet, DeconvNet, which have been widely applied and numerically proved to possess high accuracy
in the field. We also systematically study the dependence of deep learning algorithms on the input
data generated on uniform grids or by sequential design sampling, and observe that the performance
of deep learning is {\it not} sensitive to the noise and locations (close to/away from boundaries)
of training data. We present a few examples including synthetic ones and the Bermudan option pricing
problem to show the efficiency and accuracy of this method.
