With the rapid increase of threats on the Internet, people are continuously seeking privacy and
anonymity. Services such as Bitcoin and Tor were introduced to provide anonymity for online transactions
and Web browsing. Due to its pseudonymity model, Bitcoin lacks retroactive operational security,
which means historical pieces of information could be used to identify a certain user. We investigate
the feasibility of deanonymizing users of Tor hidden services who rely on Bitcoin as a payment method
by exploiting public information leaked from online social networks, the Blockchain, and onion
websites. This, for example, allows an adversary to link a user with @alice Twitter address to a Tor
hidden service with private.onion address by finding at least one past transaction in the Blockchain
that involves their publicly declared Bitcoin addresses. To demonstrate the feasibility of this
deanonymization attack, we carried out a real-world experiment simulating a passive, limited
adversary. We crawled 1.5K hidden services and collected 88 unique Bitcoin addresses. We then crawled
5B tweets and 1M BitcoinTalk forum pages and collected 4.2K and 41K unique Bitcoin addresses, respectively.
Each user address was associated with an online identity along with its public profile information.
By analyzing the transactions in the Blockchain, we were able to link 125 unique users to 20 Tor hidden
services, including sensitive ones, such as The Pirate Bay and Silk Road. We also analyzed two case
studies in detail to demonstrate the implications of the resulting information leakage on user
anonymity. In particular, we confirm that Bitcoin addresses should always be considered exploitable,
as they can be used to deanonymize users retroactively. This is especially important for Tor hidden
service users who actively seek and expect privacy and anonymity.
