In this work, we investigate how the governance features of a managed currency (e.g., a fiat currency)
can be built into a cryptocurrency in order to leverage potential benefits found in the use of blockchain
technology and smart contracts. The resulting managed cryptocurrency can increase transparency
and integrity, while potentially enabling the emergence of novel monetary instruments. It has
similarities to cash in that it enables the general public to immediately transfer funds to a recipient
without intermediary systems being involved. However, our system is account-based, unlike circulating
bank notes that are self-contained. Our design would allow one to satisfy know your customer laws
and be subject to law enforcement actions following legal due process (e.g., account freezing and
fund seizure), while mitigating counterparty risk with checks and balances. Funds can thus be transferred
only between approved and authenticated users. Our system has on-chain governance capabilities
using smart contracts deployed on a dedicated, permissioned blockchain that has different sets
of control mechanisms for who can read data, write data, and publish blocks. To enable the governance
features, only authorized identity proofed entities can submit transactions. To enable privacy,
only the block publishers can read the blockchain; the publishers maintain dedicated nodes that
provide access controlled partial visibility of the blockchain data. Being permissioned, we can
use a simple consensus protocol with no transaction fees. A separate security layer prevents denial
of service and a balance of power mechanism prevents any small group of entities from having undue
control. While permissioned, we ensure that no one entity controls the blockchain data or block
publishing capability through a voting system with publicly visible election outcomes.
