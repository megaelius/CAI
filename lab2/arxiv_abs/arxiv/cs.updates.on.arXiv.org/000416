We contribute to the program of proving lower bounds on the size of branching programs solving the
Tree Evaluation Problem introduced by Cook et. al. (2012). Proving a super-polynomial lower bound
for the size of nondeterministic thrifty branching programs (NTBP) would separate $NL$ from $P$
for thrifty models solving the tree evaluation problem. First, we show that {\em Read-Once NTBPs}
are equivalent to whole black-white pebbling algorithms thus showing a tight lower bound (ignoring
polynomial factors) for this model. We then introduce a weaker restriction of NTBPs called {\em
Bitwise Independence}. The best known NTBPs (of size $O(k^{h/2+1})$) for the tree evaluation problem
given by Cook et. al. (2012) are Bitwise Independent. As our main result, we show that any Bitwise
Independent NTBP solving $TEP_{2}^{h}(k)$ must have at least $\frac{1}{2}k^{h/2}$ states. Prior
to this work, lower bounds were known for NTBPs only for fixed heights $h=2,3,4$ (See Cook et. al.
(2012)). We prove our results by associating a fractional black-white pebbling strategy with any
bitwise independent NTBP solving the Tree Evaluation Problem. Such a connection was not known previously
even for fixed heights. Our main technique is the entropy method introduced by Jukna and Z{\'a}k
(2001) originally in the context of proving lower bounds for read-once branching programs. We also
show that the previous lower bounds given by Cook et. al. (2012) for deterministic branching programs
for Tree Evaluation Problem can be obtained using this approach. Using this method, we also show
tight lower bounds for any $k$-way deterministic branching program solving Tree Evaluation Problem
when the instances are restricted to have the same group operation in all internal nodes.
