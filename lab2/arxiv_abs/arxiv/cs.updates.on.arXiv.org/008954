We propose a novel multi-tier fog and cloud computing architecture that enables edge nodes to cooperate
in sharing computing and radio resources so as to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile
users subject to their delay requirements. We first formulate the joint task offloading and resource
allocation optimization problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP). Due to the
combination of binary (offloading decisions) and real variables (resource allocations), the
problem is an NP-hard and computationally intractable. To circumvent, we relax the binary decision
variables to transform the MINLP to a relaxed optimization problem with real variables. After proving
that the relaxed problem is a convex one, we propose three solutions namely ROP, IBBA, and FFBD. In
ROP, the solution of the relaxing problem is converted to the integer one and used as the final solution.
In IBBA, the branch-and-bound method is combined with different offloading priority policies
yielding two variants IBBA-LFC and IBBA-LCF. Note that the branch and bound method like IBBA may
require exponential complexity in the worst case. As such, we develop a distributed approach, namely
feasibility-finding Benders decomposition (FFBD), that decomposes the original problem into
a master problem for the offloading decision and subproblems for resource allocation. These (simpler)
subproblems can be solved in parallel at fog nodes, thus help reduce both the complexity and the computational
time. FFBD has two different versions (FFBD-S and FFBD-F) is a distributed algorithm based on Benders
decomposition. The numerical results show that IBBA-LFC/LCF and FFBD-S/F gain the optimal solution
minimizing the total energy consumption and meet all delay requirements for mobile users. The FFBD-F
with the fast solution detection method also has the least computation time of four algorithms IBBA-LFC/LCF
and FFBD-S/F.
