In recent years, histopathology images have been increasingly used as a diagnostic tool in the medical
field. The process of accurately diagnosing a biopsy sample requires significant expertise in
the field, and as such can be time-consuming and is prone to uncertainty and error. With the advent
of digital pathology, using image recognition systems to highlight problem areas or locate similar
images can aid pathologists in making quick and accurate diagnoses. In this paper, we specifically
consider the encoded local projections (ELP) algorithm, which has previously shown some success
as a tool for classification and recognition of histopathology images. We build on the success of
the ELP algorithm as a means for image classification and recognition by proposing a modified algorithm
which captures the local frequency information of the image. The proposed algorithm estimates
local frequencies by quantifying the changes in multiple projections in local windows of greyscale
images. By doing so we remove the need to store the full projections, thus significantly reducing
the histogram size, and decreasing computation time for image retrieval and classification tasks.
Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of applying our method to histopathology images
which have been digitally separated into their hematoxylin and eosin stain components. The proposed
algorithm is tested on the publicly available invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) data set. The histograms
are used to train an SVM to classify the data. The experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms
the original ELP algorithm in image retrieval tasks. On classification tasks, the results are found
to be comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning methods and better than many handcrafted features
from the literature.
