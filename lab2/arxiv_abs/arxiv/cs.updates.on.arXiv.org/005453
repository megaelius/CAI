Shared edge computing platforms deployed at the radio access network are expected to significantly
improve quality of service delivered by Application Service Providers (ASPs) in a flexible and
economic way. However, placing edge service in every possible edge site by an ASP is practically
infeasible due to the ASP's prohibitive budget requirement. In this paper, we investigate the edge
service placement problem of an ASP under a limited budget, where the ASP dynamically rents computing/storage
resources in edge sites to host its applications in close proximity to end users. Since the benefit
of placing edge service in a specific site is usually unknown to the ASP a priori, optimal placement
decisions must be made while learning this benefit. We pose this problem as a novel combinatorial
contextual bandit learning problem. It is "combinatorial" because only a limited number of edge
sites can be rented to provide the edge service given the ASP's budget. It is "contextual" because
we utilize user context information to enable finer-grained learning and decision making. To solve
this problem and optimize the edge computing performance, we propose SEEN, a Spatial-temporal
Edge sErvice placemeNt algorithm. Furthermore, SEEN is extended to scenarios with overlapping
service coverage by incorporating a disjunctively constrained knapsack problem. In both cases,
we prove that our algorithm achieves a sublinear regret bound when it is compared to an oracle algorithm
that knows the exact benefit information. Simulations are carried out on a real-world dataset,
whose results show that SEEN significantly outperforms benchmark solutions.
