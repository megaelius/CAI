Segmentation of abdominal computed tomography(CT) provides spatial context, morphological
properties, and a framework for tissue-specific radiomics to guide quantitative Radiological
assessment. A 2015 MICCAI challenge spurred substantial innovation in multi-organ abdominal
CT segmentation with both traditional and deep learning methods. Recent innovations in deep methods
have driven performance toward levels for which clinical translation is appealing. However, continued
cross-validation on open datasets presents the risk of indirect knowledge contamination and could
result in circular reasoning. Moreover, 'real world' segmentations can be challenging due to the
wide variability of abdomen physiology within patients. Herein, we perform two data retrievals
to capture clinically acquired deidentified abdominal CT cohorts with respect to a recently published
variation on 3D U-Net (baseline algorithm). First, we retrieved 2004 deidentified studies on 476
patients with diagnosis codes involving spleen abnormalities (cohort A). Second, we retrieved
4313 deidentified studies on 1754 patients without diagnosis codes involving spleen abnormalities
(cohort B). We perform prospective evaluation of the existing algorithm on both cohorts, yielding
13% and 8% failure rate, respectively. Then, we identified 51 subjects in cohort A with segmentation
failures and manually corrected the liver and gallbladder labels. We re-trained the model adding
the manual labels, resulting in performance improvement of 9% and 6% failure rate for the A and B cohorts,
respectively. In summary, the performance of the baseline on the prospective cohorts was similar
to that on previously published datasets. Moreover, adding data from the first cohort substantively
improved performance when evaluated on the second withheld validation cohort.
