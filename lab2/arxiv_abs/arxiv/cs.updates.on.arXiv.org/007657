The increase in demand for spectrum-based services forms a bottleneck in wireless networks. Device-to-Device
(D2D) caching networks tackle this problem by exploiting user's behavior predictability and the
possibility of sharing data between them to alleviate the network congestion. However, capturing
mobility statistics allows Service Providers (SPs) to enhance their caching strategies. In this
work, we introduce a mobility-aware D2D caching network where SP harnesses user demand and mobility
statistics to minimize the incurred service cost through an optimal caching policy. We investigate
two caching schemes: centralized and decentralized caching schemes. In the centralized caching
scheme, SP makes the caching decision towards its cost minimization to increase its profit. However,
the complexity of optimal caching policy grows exponentially with the number of users. Therefore,
we discuss a greedy caching algorithm which has a polynomial order complexity. We also use this greedy
algorithm to establish upper and lower bounds on the proactive service gain achieved by the optimal
caching policy. In the decentralized caching scheme, users take over and make their caching decisions,
in a distributed fashion affected by the SP pricing policy, towards their payment minimization.
We formulated the tension between the SP and users as a Stackelberg game. The Best response analysis
was used to identify a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) between users. The optimal solution
of proposed model was found to depend on the SP reward preference, which affects the assigned memory
in users' devices. We found some regimes for the reward value where the SPNE was non-unique. A fair
allocation caching policy was adopted to choose one of these SPNEs. To understand the impact of user
behavior, we investigated some special cases to explore how user's mobility statistics affect
their caching decision.
