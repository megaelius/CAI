Densification and multi-band operation in 5G and beyond pose an unprecedented challenge for mobility
management, particularly for inter-frequency handovers. The challenge is aggravated by the fact
that the impact of key inter-frequency mobility parameters, namely A5 time to trigger (TTT), A5
threshold1 and A5 threshold2 on the system's performance is not fully understood. These parameters
are fixed to a gold standard value or adjusted through hit and trial. This paper presents a first study
to analyze and optimize A5 parameters for jointly maximizing two key performance indicators (KPIs):
Reference signal received power (RSRP) and handover success rate (HOSR). As analytical modeling
cannot capture the system-level complexity, a data driven approach is used. By developing XGBoost
based model, that outperforms other models in terms of accuracy, we first analyze the concurrent
impact of the three parameters on the two KPIs. The results reveal three key insights: 1) there exist
optimal parameter values for each KPI; 2) these optimal values do not necessarily belong to the current
gold standard; 3) the optimal parameter values for the two KPIs do not overlap. We then leverage the
Sobol variance-based sensitivity analysis to draw some insights which can be used to avoid the parametric
conflict while jointly maximizing both KPIs. We formulate the joint RSRP and HOSR optimization
problem, show that it is non-convex and solve it using the genetic algorithm (GA). Comparison with
the brute force-based results show that the proposed data driven GA-aided solution is 48x faster
with negligible loss in optimality.
