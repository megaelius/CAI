This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications and design aspects of the
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the future wireless networks. Conventionally, the network
optimization has been limited to transmission control at two endpoints, i.e., end users and network
controller. The fading wireless channel is uncontrollable and becomes one of the main limiting
factors for performance improvement. The IRS is composed of a large array of scattering elements,
which can be individually configured to generate additional phase shifts to the signal reflections.
Hence, it can actively control the signal propagation properties in favor of signal reception,
and thus realize the notion of a smart radio environment. As such, the IRS's phase control combined
with the conventional transmission control can potentially bring performance gain compared to
the conventional wireless networks without using the IRS. In this survey, we first introduce basic
concepts of the IRS and the realizations of its reconfigurability. Then, we focus on applications
of the IRS in wireless communications. We overview different performance metrics and analytical
approaches to characterize the performance improvement of IRS-assisted wireless networks. To
exploit the performance gain, we discuss the joint optimization of the IRS's phase control and the
transceivers' transmission control in different network design problems, e.g., rate maximization
and power minimization problems. Furthermore, we extend the discussion of IRS-assisted wireless
networks to some emerging wireless applications. Finally, we highlight important practical challenges
and future research directions of realizing IRS-assisted wireless communications in beyond 5G
networks.
