Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used for screening and staging prostate cancer. However,
many prostate cancers have subtle features which are not easily identifiable on MRI, resulting
in missed diagnoses and alarming variability in radiologist interpretation. Machine learning
models have been developed in an effort to improve cancer identification, but current models localize
cancer using MRI-derived features, while failing to consider the disease pathology characteristics
observed on resected tissue. In this paper, we propose CorrSigNet, an automated two-step model
that localizes prostate cancer on MRI by capturing the pathology features of cancer. First, the
model learns MRI signatures of cancer that are correlated with corresponding histopathology features
using Common Representation Learning. Second, the model uses the learned correlated MRI features
to train a Convolutional Neural Network to localize prostate cancer. The histopathology images
are used only in the first step to learn the correlated features. Once learned, these correlated
features can be extracted from MRI of new patients (without histopathology or surgery) to localize
cancer. We trained and validated our framework on a unique dataset of 75 patients with 806 slices
who underwent MRI followed by prostatectomy surgery. We tested our method on an independent test
set of 20 prostatectomy patients (139 slices, 24 cancerous lesions, 1.12M pixels) and achieved
a per-pixel sensitivity of 0.81, specificity of 0.71, AUC of 0.86 and a per-lesion AUC of $0.96 \pm
0.07$, outperforming the current state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting prostate cancer using
MRI.
