Data clustering is a common unsupervised learning method frequently used in exploratory data analysis.
However, identifying relevant structures in unlabeled, high-dimensional data is nontrivial,
requiring iterative experimentation with clustering parameters as well as data features and instances.
The space of possible clusterings for a typical dataset is vast, and navigating in this vast space
is also challenging. The absence of ground-truth labels makes it impossible to define an optimal
solution, thus requiring user judgment to establish what can be considered a satisfiable clustering
result. Data scientists need adequate interactive tools to effectively explore and navigate the
large space of clusterings so as to improve the effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis.
We introduce \textit{Clustrophile 2}, a new interactive tool for guided clustering analysis.
\textit{Clustrophile 2} guides users in clustering-based exploratory analysis, adapts user
feedback to improve user guidance, facilitates the interpretation of clusters, and helps quickly
reason about differences between clusterings. To this end, \textit{Clustrophile 2} contributes
a novel feature, the clustering tour, to help users choose clustering parameters and assess the
quality of different clustering results in relation to current analysis goals and user expectations.
We evaluate \textit{Clustrophile 2} through a user study with 12 data scientists, who used our tool
to explore and interpret sub-cohorts in a dataset of Parkinson's disease patients. Results suggest
that \textit{Clustrophile 2} improves the speed and effectiveness of exploratory clustering
analysis for both experts and non-experts.
