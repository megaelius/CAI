Navigating spaces is an embodied experience. Examples can vary from rescue workers trying to save
people from natural disasters; a tourist finding their way to the nearest coffee shop, or a gamer
solving a maze. Virtual reality allows these experiences to be simulated in a controlled virtual
environment. However, virtual reality users remain anchored in the real world and the conventions
by which the virtual environment is deployed influence user performance. There is currently a need
to evaluate the degree of influence imposed by extrinsic factors and virtual reality hardware on
its users. Traditionally, virtual reality experiences have been deployed using Head-Mounted
Displays with powerful computers rendering the graphical content of the virtual environment;
however, user input has been facilitated using an array of human interface devices including Keyboards,
Mice, Trackballs, Touchscreens, Joysticks, Gamepads, Motion detecting cameras and Webcams.
Some of these HIDs have also been introduced for non-immersive video games and general computing.
Due to this fact, a subset of virtual reality users has greater familiarity than others in using these
HIDs. Virtual reality experiences that utilize gamepads (controllers) to navigate virtual environments
may introduce a bias towards usability among virtual reality users previously exposed to video-gaming.
This article presents an evaluative user study conducted using our ubiquitous virtual reality
framework with general audiences. Among our findings, we reveal a usability bias among virtual
reality users who are predominantly video gamers. Beyond this, we found a statistical difference
in user behavior between untethered immersive virtual reality experiences compared to untethered
non-immersive virtual reality experiences.
