In this paper we address the problem of matching patterns in the so-called verification setting
in which a novel, query pattern is verified against a single training pattern: the decision sought
is whether the two match (i.e. belong to the same class) or not. Unlike previous work which has universally
focused on the development of more discriminative distance functions between patterns, here we
consider the equally important and pervasive task of selecting a distance threshold which fits
a particular operational requirement - specifically, the target false positive rate (FPR). First,
we argue on theoretical grounds that a data-driven approach is inherently ill-conditioned when
the desired FPR is low, because by the very nature of the challenge only a small portion of training
data affects or is affected by the desired threshold. This leads us to propose a general, statistical
model-based method instead. Our approach is based on the interpretation of an inter-pattern distance
as implicitly defining a pattern embedding which approximately distributes patterns according
to an isotropic multi-variate normal distribution in some space. This interpretation is then used
to show that the distribution of training inter-pattern distances is the non-central chi2 distribution,
differently parameterized for each class. Thus, to make the class-specific threshold choice we
propose a novel analysis-by-synthesis iterative algorithm which estimates the three free parameters
of the model (for each class) using task-specific constraints. The validity of the premises of our
work and the effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by applying the method to the
task of set-based face verification on a large database of pseudo-random head motion videos.
