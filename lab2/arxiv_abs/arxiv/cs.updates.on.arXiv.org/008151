The humanity has been facing a plethora of challenges associated with infectious diseases, which
kill more than 6 million people a year. Although continuous efforts have been applied to relieve
the potential damages from such misfortunate events, it is unquestionable that there are many persisting
challenges yet to overcome. One related issue we particularly address here is the assessment and
prediction of such epidemics. In this field of study, traditional and ad-hoc models frequently
fail to provide proper predictive situation awareness (PSAW), characterized by understanding
the current situations and predicting the future situations. Comprehensive PSAW for infectious
disease can support decision making and help to hinder disease spread. In this paper, we develop
a computing system platform focusing on collective intelligence causal modeling, in order to support
PSAW in the domain of infectious disease. Analyses of global epidemics require integration of multiple
different data and models, which can be originated from multiple independent researchers. These
models should be integrated to accurately assess and predict the infectious disease in terms of
holistic view. The system shall provide three main functions: (1) collaborative causal modeling,
(2) causal model integration, and (3) causal model reasoning. These functions are supported by
subject-matter expert and artificial intelligence (AI), with uncertainty treatment. Subject-matter
experts, as collective intelligence, develop causal models and integrate them as one joint causal
model. The integrated causal model shall be used to reason about: (1) the past, regarding how the
causal factors have occurred; (2) the present, regarding how the spread is going now; and (3) the
future, regarding how it will proceed. Finally, we introduce one use case of predictive situation
awareness for the Ebola virus disease.
