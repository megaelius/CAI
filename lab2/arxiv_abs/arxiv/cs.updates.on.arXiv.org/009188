The transistors used to construct Integrated Circuits (ICs) continue to shrink. While this shrinkage
improves performance and density, it also reduces trust: the price to build leading-edge fabrication
facilities has skyrocketed, forcing even nation states to outsource the fabrication of high-performance
ICs. Outsourcing fabrication presents a security threat because the black-box nature of a fabricated
IC makes comprehensive inspection infeasible. Since prior work shows the feasibility of fabrication-time
attackers' evasion of existing post-fabrication defenses, IC designers must be able to protect
their physical designs before handing them off to an untrusted foundry. To this end, recent work
suggests methods to harden IC layouts against attack. Unfortunately, no tool exists to assess the
effectiveness of the proposed defenses---meaning gaps may exist. This paper presents an extensible
IC layout security analysis tool called IC Attack Surface (ICAS) that quantifies defensive coverage.
For researchers, ICAS identifies gaps for future defenses to target, and enables the quantitative
comparison of existing and future defenses. For practitioners, ICAS enables the exploration of
the impact of design decisions on an IC's resilience to fabrication-time attack. ICAS takes a set
of metrics that encode the challenge of inserting a hardware Trojan into an IC layout, a set of attacks
that the defender cares about, and a completed IC layout and reports the number of ways an attacker
can add each attack to the design. While the ideal score is zero, practically, our experience is that
lower scores correlate with increased attacker effort.
