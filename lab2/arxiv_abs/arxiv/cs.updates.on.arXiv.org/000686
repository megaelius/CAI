We consider the optimal design of a scheduling policy for adaptive video streaming in a wireless
network formed by several users and helpers. A feature of such networks is that any user is typically
in the range of multiple helpers. Hence, in order to cope with user-helper association, load balancing
and inter-cell interference, an efficient streaming policy should allow the users to dynamically
select the helper node to download from, and determine adaptively the video quality level of the
download. In order to obtain a tractable formulation, we follow a "divide and conquer" approach:
i) Assuming that each video packet (chunk) is delivered within its playback delay ("smooth streaming
regime"), the problem is formulated as a network utility maximization (NUM), subject to queue stability,
where the network utility function is a concave and componentwise non-decreasing function of the
users' video quality measure. ii) We solve the NUM problem by using a Lyapunov Drift Plus Penalty
approach, obtaining a scheme that naturally decomposes into two sub-policies referred to as "congestion
control" (adaptive video quality and helper station selection) and "transmission scheduling"
(dynamic allocation of the helper-user physical layer transmission rates).Our solution is provably
optimal with respect to the proposed NUM problem, in a strong per-sample path sense. iii) Finally,
we propose a method to adaptively estimate the maximum queuing delays, such that each user can calculate
its pre-buffering and re-buffering time in order to cope with the fluctuations of the queuing delays.
Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm under realistic assumptions
of a network with densely deployed helper nodes, and demonstrate the per-sample path optimality
of the proposed solution by considering a non-stationary non-ergodic scenario with user mobility,
VBR video coding.
