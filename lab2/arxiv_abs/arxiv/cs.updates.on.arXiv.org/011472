In this paper, we introduce the concept of an assortment auction, where a seller is selling substitute
products/services with fixed prices (as in assortment optimization), and buyers compete for a
limited supply of these products in an auction. Each buyer reports a ranked list of products she is
willing to purchase, after which the seller allocates products to buyers using a truthful mechanism,
subject to a supply constraint on the total number of products allocated. The seller collects revenues
equal to the prices of the products allocated, and would like to design a mechanism to maximize total
revenue, when the buyers' lists are drawn independently from known distributions. When there is
one buyer, our mechanism design problem reduces to the assortment optimization problem, which
is known to be tractable for lists drawn from a Markov Chain choice model. We extend this result and
compute the optimal auction, when there are multiple buyers with heterogeneous Markov chains.
Moreover, we show that the optimal auction is structurally ``Myersonian'', in that each buyer is
assigned a virtual valuation based on her report and distribution, after which the mechanism maximizes
virtual surplus. Since Markov chains capture the classical notion of a valuation distribution,
our optimal assortment auction generalizes the classical Myerson's auction. Finally, we show
that without the Markov chain assumption, the optimal assortment auction may be structurally non-Myersonian.
To conclude, we apply our theory in online assortment problems. First, we use the virtual valuations
for Markov Chain choice models to derive personalized assortment policies. Moreover, we show that
the optimal assortment auction provides a tighter benchmark than the commonly-used ``deterministic
LP'' for online assortment, leading to the first approximation guarantees for these problems which
break the ``barrier'' of 1-1/e.
