The problem "Given a Boolean function $f$ of $n$ variables by its truth table vector. Find (if exists)
a vector $\alpha \in \{0,1\}^n$ of maximal (or minimal) weight, such that $f(\alpha)= 1$." is important
for modern cryptography, coding theory, digital circuit theory, etc. To find effective solutions
to this problem, we explore the orders of the vectors of the $n$-dimensional Boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$
in accordance with their weights. The notion of "$k$-th layer" of $\{0,1\}^n$ is involved in the
definition and examination of the "weight order" relation. It is compared with the known relation
"precedes". The maximum chains for both relations are enumerated. One special order (among the
numerous weight orders) is defined and examined in detail. The lexicographic order is chosen as
a second criterion for an ordinance the vectors of equal weights. So a total order called Weight-Lexicographic
Order (WLO) is obtained. It is represented by the serial numbers of the vectors instead of the vectors
themselves. An algorithm that generates the vectors of $\{0,1\}^n$ in WLO for a given natural number
$n$ is developed. Its time and space complexities are $\Theta (2^n)$, which is of linear type with
respect to the size of the output. The results obtained by the WLO algorithm were used in creating
the sequence A294648 in the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The experimental
results show that an algorithm for solving the considered problem by using WLO becomes hundreds
of times faster than the usual exhaustive search when $n$ grows. The WLO algorithm has other useful
applications, for example, in generating combinatorial configurations.
