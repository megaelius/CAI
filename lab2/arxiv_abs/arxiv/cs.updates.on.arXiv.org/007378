Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning framework for artificially intelligent systems
to solve a variety of complex problems. Recent years has seen a surge of successes solving challenging
games and smaller domain problems, including simple though non-specific robotic manipulation
and grasping tasks. Rapid successes in RL have come in part due to the strong collaborative effort
by the RL community to work on common, open-sourced environment simulators such as OpenAI's Gym
that allow for expedited development and valid comparisons between different, state-of-art strategies.
In this paper, we aim to bridge the RL and the surgical robotics communities by presenting the first
open-sourced reinforcement learning environments for surgical robotics, called dVRL. Through
the proposed RL environment, which are functionally equivalent to Gym, we show that it is easy to
prototype and implement state-of-art RL algorithms on surgical robotics problems that aim to introduce
autonomous robotic precision and accuracy to assisting, collaborative, or repetitive tasks during
surgery. Learned policies are furthermore successfully transferable to a real robot. Finally,
combining dVRL with the over 40+ international network of da Vinci Surgical Research Kits in active
use at academic institutions, we see dVRL as enabling the broad surgical robotics community to fully
leverage the newest strategies in reinforcement learning, and for reinforcement learning scientists
with no knowledge of surgical robotics to test and develop new algorithms that can solve the real-world,
high-impact challenges in autonomous surgery.
