To protect from attacks, networks need to enforce ingress filtering. Despite the importance, the
existing studies do not allow to infer the extent of ingress filtering at Internet-scale, providing
results with only a limited coverage: they can either measure networks that operate servers with
faulty network-stack implementations, or require installation of the measurement software by
volunteers, or assume specific properties, like traceroute loops, which are challenging to reproduce
in practice. Improving coverage of the spoofing measurements is critical. In this work we present
the Spoofing Mapper (SMap): the first scanner for performing Internet-wide studies of enforcement
of ingress filtering. The SMap measurement methodology utilises standard protocols' behaviour
that are present in almost any network. SMap not only provides better coverage of ingress-filtering
measurements, but it is also more effective than the previous approaches. We applied SMap for Internet-wide
measurements: we found that 21% of all the Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet do not filter
spoofed packets, in contrast to 2.5% ASes identified by the most recent study with volunteers (of
the Spoofer Project), as well as 13173 new spoofable ASes, which were not detected by the other tools.
Our study with SMap provides the most comprehensive view of ingress filtering deployment in the
Internet and remediation in filtering spoofed packets over a period of six months until February
2020. SMap is simple to use and does not require installation on the tested network nor coordination
with the tested networks. We set up a web service at this http URL which reports statistics from SMap
evaluations and enables continual Internet-wide data collection and analysis. We also make our
datasets as well as the SMap tool publicly available to enable researchers to reproduce and validate
the results.
