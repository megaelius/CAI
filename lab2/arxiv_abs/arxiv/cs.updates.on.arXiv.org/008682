We propose to reduce the original well-posed problem of compressive sensing to weighted-MAX-SAT.
Compressive sensing is a novel randomized data acquisition approach that linearly samples sparse
or compressible signals at a rate much below the Nyquist-Shannon sampling rate. The original problem
of compressive sensing in sparse recovery is NP-hard; therefore, in addition to restrictions for
the uniqueness of the sparse solution, the coding matrix has also to satisfy additional stringent
constraints -usually the restricted isometry property (RIP)- so we can handle it by its convex or
nonconvex relaxations. In practice, such constraints are not only intractable to be verified but
also invalid in broad applications. We first divide the well-posed problem of compressive sensing
into relaxed sub-problems and represent them as separate SAT instances in conjunctive normal form
(CNF). After merging the resulting sub-problems, we assign weights to all clauses in such a way that
the aggregated weighted-MAX-SAT can guarantee successful recovery of the original signal. The
only requirement in our approach is the solution uniqueness of the associated problems, which is
notably looser. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in tackling
the original problem of binary compressive sensing with binary design matrices. Experimental
results demonstrate the supremacy of the proposed SAT-based compressive sensing over the $\ell_1$-minimization
in the robust recovery of sparse binary signals. SAT-based compressive sensing on average requires
8.3% fewer measurements for exact recovery of highly sparse binary signals ($s/N\approx 0.1$).
When $s/N \approx 0.5$, the $\ell_1$-minimization on average requires 22.2% more measurements
for exact reconstruction of the binary signals. Thus, the proposed SAT-based compressive sensing
is less sensitive to the sparsity of the original signals.
