We comparatively analyzed the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
and SARS outbreaks to understand their epidemiological characteristics. Methodologically,
we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability
and Hubbell (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al. (2015)
HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)] to approximate the
metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis suggested that the coronaviruses
appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding
2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their
potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter (M0) (i.e., infection critical
threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and
public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the infection
level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and below which infections follow
uniform distribution and may die off if M0 coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found
that COVID-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection threshold
may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival
and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating
metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\theta} and M, borrowed
from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of infection through local
contagion vs. infection through migration, both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds,
and particularly public-health interventions.
