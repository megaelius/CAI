We give the first outlier-robust efficient algorithm for clustering a mixture of $k$ statistically
separated d-dimensional Gaussians (k-GMMs). Concretely, our algorithm takes input an $\epsilon$-corrupted
sample from a $k$-GMM and whp in $d^{\text{poly}(k/\eta)}$ time, outputs an approximate clustering
that misclassifies at most $k^{O(k)}(\epsilon+\eta)$ fraction of the points whenever every pair
of mixture components are separated by $1-\exp(-\text{poly}(k/\eta)^k)$ in total variation
(TV) distance. Such a result was not previously known even for $k=2$. TV separation is the statistically
weakest possible notion of separation and captures important special cases such as mixed linear
regression and subspace clustering. Our main conceptual contribution is to distill two simple
analytic properties - (certifiable) hypercontractivity and anti-concentration - that are necessary
and sufficient for mixture models to be (efficiently) clusterable. As a consequence, our results
extend to clustering mixtures of arbitrary affine transforms of the uniform distribution on the
$d$-dimensional unit sphere. Even the information theoretic clusterability of separated distributions
satisfying these two analytic assumptions was not known prior to our work and is likely to be of independent
interest. Our algorithms build on the recent sequence of works relying on certifiable anti-concentration
first introduced in [KKK'19,RY'20]. Our techniques expand the sum-of-squares toolkit to show
robust certifiability of TV-separated Gaussian clusters in data. This involves giving a low-degree
sum-of-squares proof of statements that relate parameter (i.e. mean and covariances) distance
to total variation distance by relying only on hypercontractivity and anti-concentration.
