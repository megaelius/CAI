LoRaWAN promises to provide wide-area network access to low-cost devices that can operate for up
to 10 years on a single 1000 mAh battery. This makes LoRaWAN particularly suited to data collection
applications (e.g. monitoring applications), where device lifetime is a key performance metric.
However, when supporting a large number of devices, LoRaWAN suffers from a scalability issue due
to the high collision probability of its Aloha-based MAC layer. The performance worsens further
when using acknowledged transmissions due to the duty cycle restriction at the gateway. For this,
we propose FREE, a fine-grained scheduling scheme for reliable and energy-efficient data collection
in LoRaWAN. FREE takes advantage of applications that do not have hard delay requirements on data
delivery by supporting synchronized bulk data transmission. This means data is buffered for transmission
in scheduled time slots instead of transmitted straight away. FREE allocates spreading factors,
transmission powers, frequency channels, time slots, and schedules slots in frames for LoRaWAN
end-devices. As a result, FREE overcomes the scalability problem of LoRaWAN by eliminating collisions
and grouping acknowledgments. We evaluate the performance of FREE versus different legacy LoRaWAN
configurations. The numerical results show that FREE scales well and achieves almost 100% data
delivery and the device lifetime is estimated to over 10 years independent of traffic type and network
size. Comparing to poor scalability, low data delivery and device lifetime of fewer than 2 years
for acknowledged data traffic in the standard LoRaWAN configurations.
