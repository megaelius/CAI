We prove a structure theorem for the feasible solutions of the Arora-Rao-Vazirani SDP relaxation
on low threshold rank graphs and on small-set expanders. We show that if G is a graph of bounded threshold
rank or a small-set expander, then an optimal solution of the Arora-Rao-Vazirani relaxation (or
of any stronger version of it) can be almost entirely covered by a small number of balls of bounded
radius. Then, we show that, if k is the number of balls, a solution of this form can be rounded with an
approximation factor of O(sqrt {log k}) in the case of the Arora-Rao-Vazirani relaxation, and with
a constant-factor approximation in the case of the k-th round of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy starting
at the Arora-Rao-Vazirani relaxation. The structure theorem and the rounding scheme combine to
prove the following result, where G=(V,E) is a graph of expansion \phi(G), \lambda_k is the k-th
smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian of G, and \phi_k(G) = \min_{disjoint S_1,...,S_k}
\max_{1 <= i <= k} \phi(S_i) is the largest expansion of any k disjoint subsets of V: if either
\lambda_k >> log^{2.5} k \cdot phi(G) or \phi_{k} (G) >> log k \cdot sqrt{log n}\cdot
loglog n\cdot \phi(G), then the Arora-Rao-Vazirani relaxation can be rounded in polynomial time
with an approximation ratio O(sqrt{log k}). Stronger approximation guarantees are achievable
in time exponential in k via relaxations in the Lasserre hierarchy. Guruswami and Sinop [GS13] and
Arora, Ge and Sinop [AGS13] prove that 1+eps approximation is achievable in time 2^{O(k)} poly(n)
if either \lambda_k > \phi(G)/ poly(eps), or if SSE_{n/k} > sqrt{log k log n} \cdot \phi(G)/
poly(eps), where SSE_s is the minimal expansion of sets of size at most s.
