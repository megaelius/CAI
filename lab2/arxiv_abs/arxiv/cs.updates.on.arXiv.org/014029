A series of recent papers have shown that placing communication channels in a coherent superposition
of alternative configurations can boost the transmission of information beyond the limits of standard
quantum Shannon theory. Instances of this phenomenon are the communication advantages arising
from the superposition of causal orderings of communication devices [Ebler et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
120 (2018) [1]; Salek et al., arXiv:1809.06655 (2018) [2]; Chiribella et al., arXiv:1810.10457
(2018) [3]], and from the superposition of information carriers' trajectories [Gisin et al., Phys.
Rev. A 72 (2005) [4]; Abbott et al., arXiv:1810.09826 (2018) [5]; Chiribella & Kristj\'ansson,
Proc. R. Soc. A 475 (2019) [6]]. The nature of these communication advantages has been the subject
of recent debate. It was argued that the communication advantages presented in [1-3] were not a genuine
consequence of indefinite causal order because similar advantages could be obtained with the coherent
control of communication devices [5] or encoding/decoding operations [Gu\'erin et al., Phys.
Rev. A 99 (2019) [7]]. Here, we point out (1) that these arguments set up an uneven comparison between
different types of quantum superpositions, and (2) that [1-3] did not claim that superposing causal
orders was the only way to obtain communication advantages. To shed light on this discussion, we
cast different models of communication in the form of resource theories, specifying the communication
resources and the allowed operations on them. We argue that any reasonable resource theory of communication
must prohibit the generation of side-channels, which allow a sender and a receiver to communicate
independently of the communication channels initially available to them. While the communication
models studied in [1-6] are compatible with such a requirement, the counterexamples proposed in
[7] generate side-channels.
