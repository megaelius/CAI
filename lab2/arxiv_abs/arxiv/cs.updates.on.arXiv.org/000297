The notion of {\em highly dynamic networks} encompasses many real-world contexts. The need to categorize
and understand them led the engineering community to design a variety of mobility models, based
on which experiments can be reproduced and solutions fairly compared. The theoretical analogues
of mobility models are the logical properties of the network dynamics that allow the taxonomy of
various of classes of dynamic graphs. In this paper we study the relationship between three classes
of (highly) dynamic networks by means of studying the feasibility of several variants of the broadcast,
namely {\em shortest}, {\em fastest}, and {\em foremost} broadcast. We focus on those graphs in
which re-appearance of the edges is either {\em recurrent} (class \RG), {\em bounded-recurrent}
(\BG), or {\em periodic} (\PG), together with the knowledge of $n$ (the number of nodes), $\Delta$
(a bound on the recurrence time), or $p$ (the period). By studying the feasibility of shortest, fastest,
and foremost broadcasts within these classes, we show their computational power forms a {\em strict}
hierarchy. In fact, we show that $\PP(\RG_n)\subsetneq\PP(\BG_\Delta)\subsetneq\PP(\PG_p)$,
where $\PP({\cal C}_k)$ is the set of problems one can solve in class ${\cal C}$ with knowledge $k$.
Interestingly, we also find that all three variants of the broadcast have distinct features relative
to feasibility (and to a lesser extent complexity), which suggests some order of difficulty among
them. Two distinct orders can actually be proposed depending on whether the parameter of interest
is the mere {\em feasibility} or also involves the {\em reusability} of a solution (i.e., in this
paper, the broadcast tree).
