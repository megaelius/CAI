In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient hybrid precoding design for integrated multicast-unicast
millimeter wave (mmWave) system, where the simultaneous wireless information and power transform
is considered at receivers. We adopt two sparse radio frequency chain antenna structures at the
base station (BS), i.e., fully-connected and subarray structures, and design the codebook-based
analog precoding according to the different structures. Then, we formulate a joint digital multicast,
unicast precoding and power splitting ratio optimization problem to maximize the energy efficiency
of the system, while the maximum transmit power at the BS and minimum harvested energy at receivers
are considered. Due to its difficulty to directly solve the formulated problem, we equivalently
transform the fractional objective function into a subtractive form one and propose a two-loop
iterative algorithm to solve it. For the outer loop, the classic Bi-section iterative algorithm
is applied. For the inner loop, we transform the formulated problem into a convex one by successive
convex approximation techniques and propose an iterative algorithm to solve it. Meanwhile, to
reduce the complexity of the inner loop, we develop a zero forcing (ZF) technique-based low complexity
iterative algorithm. Specifically, the ZF technique is applied to cancel the inter-unicast interference
and the first order Taylor approximation is used for the convexification of the non-convex constraints
in the original problem. Finally, simulation results are provided to compare the performance of
the proposed algorithms under different schemes.
