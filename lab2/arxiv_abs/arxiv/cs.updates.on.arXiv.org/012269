An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a key cybersecurity tool for network administrators as it
identifies malicious traffic and cyberattacks. With the recent successes of machine learning
techniques such as deep learning, more and more IDS are now using machine learning algorithms to
detect attacks faster. However, these systems lack robustness when facing previously unseen types
of attacks. With the increasing number of new attacks, especially against Internet of Things devices,
having a robust IDS able to spot unusual and new attacks becomes necessary. This work explores the
possibility of leveraging generative adversarial models to improve the robustness of machine
learning based IDS. More specifically, we propose a new method named SIGMA, that leverages adversarial
examples to strengthen IDS against new types of attacks. Using Generative Adversarial Networks
(GAN) and metaheuristics, SIGMA %Our method consists in generates adversarial examples, iteratively,
and uses it to retrain a machine learning-based IDS, until a convergence of the detection rate (i.e.
until the detection system is not improving anymore). A round of improvement consists of a generative
phase, in which we use GANs and metaheuristics to generate instances ; an evaluation phase in which
we calculate the detection rate of those newly generated attacks ; and a training phase, in which
we train the IDS with those attacks. We have evaluated the SIGMA method for four standard machine
learning classification algorithms acting as IDS, with a combination of GAN and a hybrid local-search
and genetic algorithm, to generate new datasets of attacks. Our results show that SIGMA can successfully
generate adversarial attacks against different machine learning based IDS. Also, using SIGMA,
we can improve the performance of an IDS to up to 100\% after as little as two rounds of improvement.
