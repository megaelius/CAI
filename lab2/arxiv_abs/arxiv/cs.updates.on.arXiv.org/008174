In many applications, projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) have demonstrated the ability
to provide rapid approximate solutions to high-fidelity full-order models (FOMs). However, there
is no a priori assurance that these approximate solutions are accurate; their accuracy depends
on the ability of the low-dimensional trial basis to represent the FOM solution. As a result, ROMs
can generate inaccurate approximate solutions, e.g., when the FOM solution at the online prediction
point is not well represented by training data used to construct the trial basis. To address this
fundamental deficiency of standard model-reduction approaches, this work proposes a novel online-adaptive
mechanism for efficiently enriching the trial basis in a manner that ensures convergence of the
ROM to the FOM, yet does not incur any FOM solves. The mechanism is based on the previously proposed
adaptive $h$-refinement method for ROMs [12], but improves upon this work in two crucial ways. First,
the proposed method enables basis refinement with respect to any orthogonal basis (not just the
Kronecker basis), thereby generalizing the refinement mechanism and enabling it to be tailored
to the physics characterizing the problem at hand. Second, the proposed method provides a fast online
algorithm for periodically compressing the enriched basis via an efficient proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) method, which does not incur any operations that scale with the FOM dimension.
These two features allow the proposed method to serve as (1) a failsafe mechanism for ROMs, as the
method enables the ROM to satisfy any prescribed error tolerance online (even in the case of inadequate
training), and (2) an efficient online basis-adaptation mechanism, as the combination of basis
enrichment and compression enables the basis to adapt online while controlling its dimension.
