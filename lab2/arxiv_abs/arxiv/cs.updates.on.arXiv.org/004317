This work seeks to determine how modern machine learning techniques may be applied to the previously
unexplored topic of melanoma diagnostics using digital pathology. We curated a new dataset of 50
patient cases of cutaneous melanoma using digital pathology. We provide gold standard annotations
for three tissue types (tumour, epidermis, and dermis) which are important for the prognostic measurements
known as Breslow thickness and Clark level. Then, we devised a novel multi-stride fully convolutional
network (FCN) architecture that outperformed other networks trained and evaluated using the same
data according to standard metrics. Finally, we trained a model to detect and localize the target
tissue types. When processing previously unseen cases, our model's output is qualitatively very
similar to the gold standard. In addition to the standard metrics computed as a baseline for our approach,
we asked three additional pathologists to measure the Breslow thickness on the network's output.
Their responses were diagnostically equivalent to the ground truth measurements, and when removing
cases where a measurement was not appropriate, inter-rater reliability (IRR) between the four
pathologists was 75.0%. Given the qualitative and quantitative results, it is possible to overcome
the discriminative challenges of the skin and tumour anatomy for segmentation using modern machine
learning techniques, though more work is required to improve the network's performance on dermis
segmentation. Further, we show that it is possible to achieve a level of accuracy required to manually
perform the Breslow thickness measurement.
