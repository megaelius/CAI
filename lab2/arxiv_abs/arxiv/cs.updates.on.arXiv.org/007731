The research on aerial manipulation systems has been increased rapidly in recent years. These systems
are very attractive for a wide range of applications due to their unique features. However, dynamics,
control and manipulation tasks of such systems are quite challenging because they are naturally
unstable, have very fast dynamics, have strong nonlinearities, are very susceptible to parameters
variations due to carrying a payload besides the external disturbances, and have complex inverse
kinematics. In addition, the manipulation tasks require estimating (applying) a certain force
of (at) the end-effector as well as the accurate positioning of it. Thus, in this article, a robust
force estimation and impedance control scheme is proposed to address these issues. The robustness
is achieved based on the Disturbance Observer (DOb) technique. Then, a tracking and performance
low computational linear controller is used. For teleoperation purpose, the contact force needs
to be identified. However, the current developed techniques for force estimation have limitations
because they are based on ignoring some dynamics and/or requiring of an indicator of the environment
contact. Unlike these techniques, we propose a technique based on linearization capabilities
of DOb and a Fast Tracking Recursive Least Squares (FTRLS) algorithm. The complex inverse kinematics
problem of such a system is solved by a Jacobin based algorithm. The stability analysis of the proposed
scheme is presented. The algorithm is tested to achieve tracking of task space reference trajectories
besides the impedance control. The efficiency of the proposed technique is enlightened via numerical
simulation.
