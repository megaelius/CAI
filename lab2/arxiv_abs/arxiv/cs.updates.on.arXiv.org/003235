The coded caching scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen considers the delivery of files in a given
content library to users through a deterministic error-free network where a common multicast message
is sent to all users at a fixed rate, independent of the number of users. In order to apply this paradigm
to a wireless network, it is important to make sure that the common multicast rate does not vanish
as the number of users increases. This paper focuses on a variant of coded caching successively proposed
for the so-called combination network, where the multicast message is further encoded by a Maximum
Distance Separable (MDS) code and the MDS-coded blocks are simultaneously transmitted from different
Edge Nodes (ENs) (e.g., base stations or access points). Each user is equipped with multiple antennas
and can select to decode a desired number of EN transmissions, while either nulling of treating as
noise the others, depending on their strength. The system is reminiscent of the so-called evolved
Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS), in the sense that the fundamental underlying
transmission mechanism is multipoint multicasting, where each user can independently and individually
(in a user-centric manner) decide which EN to decode, without any explicit association of users
to ENs. We study the performance of the proposed system when users and ENs are distributed according
to homogeneous Poisson Point Processes in the plane and the propagation is affected by Rayleigh
fading and distance dependent pathloss. Our analysis allows the system optimization with respect
to the MDS coding rate. Also, we show that the proposed system is fully scalable, in the sense that
it can support an arbitrarily large number of users, while maintaining a non-vanishing per-user
delivery rate.
