Context: Coordination is a fundamental tenet of software engineering. Coordination is required
also for identifying discovered and disclosed software vulnerabilities with Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVEs). Motivated by recent practical challenges, this paper examines the coordination
of CVEs for open source projects through a public mailing list. Objective: The paper observes the
historical time delays between the assignment of CVEs on a mailing list and the later appearance
of these in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Drawing from research on software engineering
coordination, software vulnerabilities, and bug tracking, the delays are modeled through three
dimensions: social networks and communication practices, tracking infrastructures, and the
technical characteristics of the CVEs coordinated. Method: Given a period between 2008 and 2016,
a sample of over five thousand CVEs is used to model the delays with nearly fifty explanatory metrics.
Regression analysis is used for the modeling. Results: The results show that the CVE coordination
delays are affected by different abstractions for noise and prerequisite constraints. These abstractions
convey effects from the social network and infrastructure dimensions. Particularly strong effect
sizes are observed for annual and monthly control metrics, a control metric for weekends, the degrees
of the nodes in the CVE coordination networks, and the number of references given in NVD for the CVEs
archived. Smaller but visible effects are present for metrics measuring the entropy of the emails
exchanged, traces to bug tracking systems, and other related aspects. The empirical signals are
weaker for the technical characteristics. Conclusion: [...]
