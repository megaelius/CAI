The Internet of Things is anticipated to participate in the execution of a variety of complex tasks
in the near future. IoT objects capable of handling multiple sensing and actuating functions are
the cornerstone of smart applications such as smart buildings, smart factories, home automation,
and healthcare automation. These smart applications express their demands in terms of high-level
requests. These requests are characterised by the different requirements of sensing actuating
functions, processing and memory needs, activation zones, latency, etc. In service-oriented
architecture-based IoT, application requests are translated into a business process BP workflow.
In this study, we model such a BP as a virtual network containing a set of virtual nodes and links connected
in a specific topology. These virtual nodes represent the requested processing and location where
sensing or actuation are needed. The virtual links capture the requested communication requirements
between nodes. In this paper, we introduce a framework, optimised using mixed integer linear programming
MILP, that embeds the BPs from the virtual layer into a lower-level implementation at the IoT physical
layer. The proposed framework results in a physical plan that optimally allocates the processing
needed and provisions the sensing and actuation at the required locations requirements to an appropriate
set of IoT nodes. The optimisation goal is to minimise the IoT layer total power consumption and optimise
the traffic distribution in a manner that minimises the traffic latency of each IoT node. Our results
show that the proposed framework enhances the network performance by reducing the power consumption
and latency.
