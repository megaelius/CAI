For mobile robots navigating on sidewalks, it is essential to be able to safely cross street intersections.
Most existing approaches rely on the recognition of the traffic light signal to make an informed
crossing decision. Although these approaches have been crucial enablers for urban navigation,
the capabilities of robots employing such approaches are still limited to navigating only on streets
containing signalized intersections. In this paper, we address this challenge and propose a multimodal
convolutional neural network framework to predict the safety of a street intersection for crossing.
Our architecture consists of two subnetworks; an interaction-aware trajectory estimation stream
IA-TCNN, that predicts the future states of all observed traffic participants in the scene, and
a traffic light recognition stream AtteNet. Our IA-TCNN utilizes dilated causal convolutions
to model the behavior of the observable dynamic agents in the scene without explicitly assigning
priorities to the interactions among them. While AtteNet utilizes Squeeze-Excitation blocks
to learn a content-aware mechanism for selecting the relevant features from the data, thereby improving
the noise robustness. Learned representations from the traffic light recognition stream are fused
with the estimated trajectories from the motion prediction stream to learn the crossing decision.
Furthermore, we extend our previously introduced Freiburg Street Crossing dataset with sequences
captured at different types of intersections, demonstrating complex interactions among the traffic
participants. Extensive experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets and our proposed
dataset demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance for each of the subtasks,
as well as for the crossing safety prediction.
