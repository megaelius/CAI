Noise in quantum information processing is often viewed as a disruptive and difficult-to-avoid
feature, especially in near-term quantum technologies. However, noise has often played beneficial
roles, from enhancing weak signals in stochastic resonance to protecting the privacy of data in
differential privacy. It is then natural to ask, can we harness the power of quantum noise that is
beneficial to quantum computing? An important current direction for quantum computing is its application
to machine learning, such as classification problems. One outstanding problem in machine learning
for classification is its sensitivity to adversarial examples. These are small, undetectable
perturbations from the original data where the perturbed data is completely misclassified in otherwise
extremely accurate classifiers. They can also be considered as `worst-case' perturbations by
unknown noise sources. We show that by taking advantage of depolarisation noise in quantum circuits
for classification, a robustness bound against adversaries can be derived where the robustness
improves with increasing noise. This robustness property is intimately connected with an important
security concept called differential privacy which can be extended to quantum differential privacy.
For the protection of quantum data, this is the first quantum protocol that can be used against the
most general adversaries. Furthermore, we show how the robustness in the classical case can be sensitive
to the details of the classification model, but in the quantum case the details of classification
model are absent, thus also providing a potential quantum advantage for classical data that is independent
of quantum speedups. This opens the opportunity to explore other ways in which quantum noise can
be used in our favour, as well as identifying other ways quantum algorithms can be helpful that is
independent of quantum speedups.
