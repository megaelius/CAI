Satellites enable widespread, regional or global surveillance of volcanoes and can provide the
first indication of volcanic unrest or eruption. Here we consider Interferometric Synthetic Aperture
Radar (InSAR), which can be employed to detect surface deformation with a strong statistical link
to eruption. The ability of machine learning to automatically identify signals of interest in these
large InSAR datasets has already been demonstrated, but data-driven techniques, such as convolutional
neutral networks (CNN) require balanced training datasets of positive and negative signals to
effectively differentiate between real deformation and noise. As only a small proportion of volcanoes
are deforming and atmospheric noise is ubiquitous, the use of machine learning for detecting volcanic
unrest is more challenging. In this paper, we address this problem using synthetic interferograms
to train the AlexNet. The synthetic interferograms are composed of 3 parts: 1) deformation patterns
based on a Monte Carlo selection of parameters for analytic forward models, 2) stratified atmospheric
effects derived from weather models and 3) turbulent atmospheric effects based on statistical
simulations of correlated noise. The AlexNet architecture trained with synthetic data outperforms
that trained using real interferograms alone, based on classification accuracy and positive predictive
value (PPV). However, the models used to generate the synthetic signals are a simplification of
the natural processes, so we retrain the CNN with a combined dataset consisting of synthetic models
and selected real examples, achieving a final PPV of 82%. Although applying atmospheric corrections
to the entire dataset is computationally expensive, it is relatively simple to apply them to the
small subset of positive results. This further improves the detection performance without a significant
increase in computational burden.
