Background: A critical step in effective care and treatment planning for severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the assessment of the severity of disease progression.
Chest x-rays (CXRs) are often used to assess SARS-CoV-2 severity, with two important assessment
metrics being extent of lung involvement and degree of opacity. In this proof-of-concept study,
we assess the feasibility of computer-aided scoring of CXRs of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity
using a deep learning system. Materials and Methods: Data consisted of 396 CXRs from SARS-CoV-2
positive patient cases. Geographic extent and opacity extent were scored by two board-certified
expert chest radiologists (with 20+ years of experience) and a 2nd-year radiology resident. The
deep neural networks used in this study, which we name COVIDNet-S, are based on a COVID-Net network
architecture. 100 versions of the network were independently learned (50 to perform geographic
extent scoring and 50 to perform opacity extent scoring) using random subsets of CXRs from the study,
and evaluated the networks using stratified Monte Carlo cross-validation experiments. Findings:
The COVIDNet-S deep neural networks yielded R$^2$ of 0.664 $\pm$ 0.001 and 0.635 $\pm$ 0.002 between
predicted scores and radiologist scores for geographic extent and opacity extent, respectively,
in stratified Monte Carlo cross-validation experiments. The best performing networks achieved
R$^2$ of 0.739 and 0.741 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for geographic extent
and opacity extent, respectively. Interpretation: The results are promising and suggest that
the use of deep neural networks on CXRs could be an effective tool for computer-aided assessment
of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity, although additional studies are needed before adoption for
routine clinical use.
