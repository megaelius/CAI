The problem of planar registration consists in finding the transformation that better aligns two
point sets. In our setting, the search domain is the set of planar rigid transformations and the objective
function is the sum of the distances between each point of the transformed source set and the destination
set. We consider a Branch and Bound (BnB) method for finding the globally optimal solution. The algorithm
recursively splits the search domain into boxes and computes an upper and a lower bound for the minimum
value of the restricted problem. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel
lower bound, the relaxation bound, which corresponds to the solution of a concave relaxation of
the objective function based on the linearization of the distance. In the BnB we also employ the so
called cheap bound, equal to to the sum of the minimum distances between each point of source point
set, transformed according to current box, and all the candidate points in the destination point
set. We prove, both theoretically and practically, that the novel relaxation bound dominates the
cheap bound over small boxes. More precisely, from the theoretical point of view, we prove that the
relaxation bound is a second-order approximation of the minimum value, i.e., its distance from
the minimum value decreases quadratically with respect to the diameter of the box (see Theorem 1),
while the cheap bound is a first-order one (see Proposition 3). From the practical point of view,
we show through different computational experiments that the addition of the relaxation bound
considerably enhances the performance of the BnB algorithm, compensating the higher cost of its
computation with respect to the cheap bound with a strong reduction of the number of BnB nodes to be
explored.
