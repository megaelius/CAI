We study multi-budgeted variants of the classic minimum cut problem and graph separation problems
that turned out to be important in parameterized complexity: Skew Multicut and Directed Feedback
Arc Set. In our generalization, we assign colors $1,2,...,\ell$ to some edges and give separate
budgets $k_{1},k_{2},...,k_{\ell}$. Let $E_{i}$ be the set of edges of color $i$. The solution
$C$ for the multi-budgeted variant of a graph separation problem not only needs to satisfy the usual
separation requirements, but also needs to satisfy that $|C\cap E_{i}|\leq k_{i}$ for every $i\in
\{1,...,\ell\}$. Contrary to the classic minimum cut problem, the multi-budgeted variant turns
out to be NP-hard even for $\ell = 2$. We propose FPT algorithms parameterized by $k=k_{1}+...+k_{\ell}$
for all three problems. To this end, we develop a branching procedure for the multi-budgeted minimum
cut problem that measures the progress of the algorithm not by reducing $k$ as usual, by but elevating
the capacity of some edges and thus increasing the size of maximum source-to-sink flow. Using the
fact that a similar strategy is used to enumerate all important separators of a given size, we merge
this process with the flow-guided branching and show an FPT bound on the number of (appropriately
defined) important multi-budgeted separators. This allows us to extend our algorithm to the Skew
Multicut and Directed Feedback Arc Set problems. Furthermore, we show connections of the multi-budgeted
variants with weighted variants of the directed cut problems and the Chain $\ell$-SAT problem,
whose parameterized complexity remains an open problem. We show that these problems admit a bounded-in-parameter
number of "maximally pushed" solutions (in a similar spirit as important separators are maximally
pushed), giving somewhat weak evidence towards their tractability.
