Network security has become an area of significant importance more than ever as highlighted by the
eye-opening numbers of data breaches, attacks on critical infrastructure, and malware/ransomware/cryptojacker
attacks that are reported almost every day. Increasingly, we are relying on networked infrastructure
and with the advent of IoT, billions of devices will be connected to the internet, providing attackers
with more opportunities to exploit. Traditional machine learning methods have been frequently
used in the context of network security. However, such methods are more based on statistical features
extracted from sources such as binaries, emails, and packet flows. On the other hand, recent years
witnessed a phenomenal growth in computer vision mainly driven by the advances in the area of convolutional
neural networks. At a glance, it is not trivial to see how computer vision methods are related to network
security. Nonetheless, there is a significant amount of work that highlighted how methods from
computer vision can be applied in network security for detecting attacks or building security solutions.
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of such work under three topics; i) phishing attempt
detection, ii) malware detection, and iii) traffic anomaly detection. Next, we review a set of such
commercial products for which public information is available and explore how computer vision
methods are effectively used in those products. Finally, we discuss existing research gaps and
future research directions, especially focusing on how network security research community and
the industry can leverage the exponential growth of computer vision methods to build much secure
networked systems.
