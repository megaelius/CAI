The challenge in controlling stochastic systems in which random events can set the system on catastrophic
trajectories is to develop a robust ability to respond to such events without significantly compromising
the optimality of the baseline control policy. Drug resistance can emerge from random and variable
mutations in targeted cell populations; in the absence of an appropriate dosing policy, emergent
resistant subpopulations can proliferate and lead to treatment failure. Dynamic feedback dosage
control holds promise in combatting this phenomenon, but cell population evolutionary dynamics
are complex, stochastic, and often high-dimensional, posing significant challenges to system
control. This paper presents CelluDose, a deep reinforcement learning closed-loop dynamic control
prototype for automated precision drug dosing targeting stochastic and heterogeneous cell proliferation.
Developing optimal dosing schedules for preventing therapy-induced drug resistance involves
a tradeoff between the effective suppression of emergent resistant cell subpopulations and the
use of conservative dosages and a preference for first-line drugs. CelluDose is trained on model
simulations of cell population evolutionary dynamics that combine a system of stochastic differential
equations and the additional occurrence of random perturbing events. Both the single-drug and
combination therapy policies obtained in training exhibit a 100% success rate at suppressing simulated
heterogeneous harmful cell growth and responding to diverse system fluctuations and perturbations
within the alloted time and using conservative dosing. The policies obtained were found to be highly
robust to model parameter changes and fluctuations not introduced during training.
