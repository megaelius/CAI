Cardiovascular disorders account for nearly 1 in 3 deaths in the United States. Care for these disorders
are often determined during visits to acute care facilities, such as hospitals. While the length
of stay in these settings represents just a small proportion of patients' lives, they account for
a disproportionately large amount of decision making. To overcome this bias towards data from acute
care settings, there is a need for longitudinal monitoring in patients with cardiovascular disorders.
Longitudinal monitoring can provide a more comprehensive picture of patient health, allowing
for more informed decision making. This work surveys the current field of sensing technologies
and machine learning analytics that exist in the field of remote monitoring for cardiovascular
disorders. We highlight three primary needs in the design of new smart health technologies: 1) the
need for sensing technology that can track longitudinal trends in signs and symptoms of the cardiovascular
disorder despite potentially infrequent, noisy, or missing data measurements; 2) the need for
new analytic techniques that model data captured in a longitudinal, continual fashion to aid in
the development of new risk prediction techniques and in tracking disease progression; and 3) the
need for machine learning techniques that are personalized and interpretable, allowing for advancements
in shared clinical decision making. We highlight these needs based upon the current state-of-the-art
in smart health technologies and analytics and discuss the ample opportunities that exist in addressing
all three needs in the development of smart health technologies and analytics applied to the field
of cardiovascular disorders and care.
