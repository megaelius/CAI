This paper is concerned with a compositional approach for the construction of finite abstractions
(a.k.a. finite Markov decision processes) for networks of discrete-time stochastic control systems
that are not necessarily stabilizable. The proposed approach leverages the interconnection topology
and finite-step stochastic storage functions, that describe joint dissipativity-type properties
of subsystems and their abstractions, in order to establish a finite-step stochastic simulation
function between the network and its abstraction. In comparison with the existing notions of simulation
functions, a finite-step stochastic simulation function needs to decay only after some finite
numbers of steps instead of at each time step. In the first part of the paper, we develop a new type of
compositional conditions, which is less conservative than the existing ones, for quantifying
the probabilistic error between the interconnection of stochastic control subsystems and that
of their abstractions. In particular, using this relaxation via a finite-step stochastic simulation
function, it is possible to construct finite abstractions such that stabilizability of each subsystem
is not required. In the second part of the paper, we propose an approach to construct finite Markov
decision processes (MDPs) together with their corresponding finite-step storage functions for
general discrete-time stochastic control systems satisfying an incremental passivablity property.
We show that for a particular class of stochastic control systems, the aforementioned property
can be readily checked by matrix inequalities. We also construct finite MDPs together with their
storage functions for a particular class of nonlinear stochastic control systems. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approaches, we apply our results on three different case studies.
