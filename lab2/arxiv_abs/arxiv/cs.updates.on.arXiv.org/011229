Taking photographs in low light using a mobile phone is challenging and rarely produces pleasing
results. Aside from the physical limits imposed by read noise and photon shot noise, these cameras
are typically handheld, have small apertures and sensors, use mass-produced analog electronics
that cannot easily be cooled, and are commonly used to photograph subjects that move, like children
and pets. In this paper we describe a system for capturing clean, sharp, colorful photographs in
light as low as 0.3~lux, where human vision becomes monochromatic and indistinct. To permit handheld
photography without flash illumination, we capture, align, and combine multiple frames. Our system
employs "motion metering", which uses an estimate of motion magnitudes (whether due to handshake
or moving objects) to identify the number of frames and the per-frame exposure times that together
minimize both noise and motion blur in a captured burst. We combine these frames using robust alignment
and merging techniques that are specialized for high-noise imagery. To ensure accurate colors
in such low light, we employ a learning-based auto white balancing algorithm. To prevent the photographs
from looking like they were shot in daylight, we use tone mapping techniques inspired by illusionistic
painting: increasing contrast, crushing shadows to black, and surrounding the scene with darkness.
All of these processes are performed using the limited computational resources of a mobile device.
Our system can be used by novice photographers to produce shareable pictures in a few seconds based
on a single shutter press, even in environments so dim that humans cannot see clearly.
