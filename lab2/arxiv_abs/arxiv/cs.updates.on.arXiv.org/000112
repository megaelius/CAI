The widespread use and popularity of collaborative content sites (e.g., IMDB, Amazon, Yelp, etc.)
has created rich resources for users to consult in order to make purchasing decisions on various
products such as movies, e-commerce products, restaurants, etc. Products with desirable tags
(e.g., modern, reliable, etc.) have higher chances of being selected by prospective customers.
This creates an opportunity for product designers to design better products that are likely to attract
desirable tags when published. In this paper, we investigate how to mine collaborative tagging
data to decide the attribute values of new products and to return the top-k products that are likely
to attract the maximum number of desirable tags when published. Given a training set of existing
products with their features and user-submitted tags, we first build a Naive Bayes Classifier for
each tag. We show that the problem of is NP-complete even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used
for tag prediction. We present a suite of algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact two tier
algorithm(based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force
algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a set of approximation algorithms
for larger problem instances: a novel polynomial-time approximation algorithm with provable
error bound and a practical hill-climbing heuristic. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic
and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms,
as well as show how product designers can benefit by leveraging collaborative tagging information.
