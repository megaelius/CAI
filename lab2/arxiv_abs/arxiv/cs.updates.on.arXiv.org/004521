Malicious software, or malware, presents a continuously evolving challenge in computer security.
These embedded snippets of code in the form of malicious files or hidden within legitimate files
cause a major risk to systems with their ability to run malicious command sequences. Malware authors
even use polymorphism to reorder these commands and create several malicious variations. However,
if executed in a secure environment, one can perform early malware detection on emulated command
sequences. The models presented in this paper leverage this sequential data derived via emulation
in order to perform Neural Malware Detection. These models target the core of the malicious operation
by learning the presence and pattern of co-occurrence of malicious event actions from within these
sequences. Our models can capture entire event sequences and be trained directly using the known
target labels. These end-to-end learning models are powered by two commonly used structures - Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Previously proposed
sequential malware classification models process no more than 200 events. Attackers can evade
detection by delaying any malicious activity beyond the beginning of the file. We present specialized
models that can handle extremely long sequences while successfully performing malware detection
in an efficient way. We present an implementation of the Convoluted Partitioning of Long Sequences
approach in order to tackle this vulnerability and operate on long sequences. We present our results
on a large dataset consisting of 634,249 file sequences, with extremely long file sequences.
