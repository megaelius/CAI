Designing novel materials that possess desired properties is a central need across many manufacturing
industries. Driven by that industrial need, a variety of algorithms and tools have been developed
that combine AI (machine learning and analytics) with domain knowledge in physics, chemistry,
and materials science. AI-driven materials design can be divided to mainly two stages; the first
one is the modeling stage, where the goal is to build an accurate regression or classification model
to predict material properties (e.g. glass transition temperature) or attributes (e.g. toxic/non-toxic).
The next stage is design, where the goal is to assemble or tune material structures so that they can
achieve user-demanded target property values based on a prediction model that is trained in the
modeling stage. For maximum benefit, these two stages should be architected to form a coherent workflow.
Today there are several emerging services and tools for AI-driven material design, however, most
of them provide only partial technical components (e.g. data analyzer, regression model, structure
generator, etc.), that are useful for specific purposes, but for comprehensive material design,
those components need to be orchestrated appropriately. Our material design system provides an
end-to-end solution to this problem, with a workflow that consists of data input, feature encoding,
prediction modeling, solution search, and structure generation. The system builds a regression
model to predict properties, solves an inverse problem on the trained model, and generates novel
chemical structure candidates that satisfy the target properties. In this paper we will introduce
the methodology of our system, and demonstrate a simple example of inverse design generating new
chemical structures that satisfy targeted physical property values.
