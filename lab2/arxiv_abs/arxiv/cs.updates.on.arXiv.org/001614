High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDE) appear in a number of models from the financial
industry, such as in derivative pricing models, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) models, or portfolio
optimization models. The PDEs in such applications are high-dimensional as the dimension corresponds
to the number of financial assets in a portfolio. Moreover, such PDEs are often fully nonlinear due
to the need to incorporate certain nonlinear phenomena in the model such as default risks, transaction
costs, volatility uncertainty (Knightian uncertainty), or trading constraints in the model.
Such high-dimensional fully nonlinear PDEs are exceedingly difficult to solve as the computational
effort for standard approximation methods grows exponentially with the dimension. In this work
we propose a new method for solving high-dimensional fully nonlinear second-order PDEs. Our method
can in particular be used to sample from high-dimensional nonlinear expectations. The method is
based on (i) a connection between fully nonlinear second-order PDEs and second-order backward
stochastic differential equations (2BSDEs), (ii) a merged formulation of the PDE and the 2BSDE
problem, (iii) a temporal forward discretization of the 2BSDE and a spatial approximation via deep
neural nets, and (iv) a stochastic gradient descent-type optimization procedure. Numerical results
obtained using ${\rm T{\small ENSOR}F{\small LOW}}$ in ${\rm P{\small YTHON}}$ illustrate the
efficiency and the accuracy of the method in the cases of a $100$-dimensional Black-Scholes-Barenblatt
equation, a $100$-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and a nonlinear expectation
of a $ 100 $-dimensional $ G $-Brownian motion.
