The stakeholders of a system are legitimately interested in whether and how its architecture reflects
their respective concerns at each point of its development and maintenance processes. Having such
knowledge available at all times would enable them to continually adjust their systems structure
at each juncture and reduce the buildup of technical debt that can be hard to reduce once it has persisted
over many iterations. Unfortunately, software systems often lack reliable and current documentation
about their architecture. In order to remedy this situation, researchers have conceived a number
of architectural recovery methods, some of them concern-oriented. However, the design choices
forming the bases of most existing recovery methods make it so none of them have a complete set of desirable
qualities for the purpose stated above. Tailoring a recovery to a system is either not possible or
only through iterative experiments with numeric parameters. Furthermore, limitations in their
scalability make it prohibitive to apply the existing techniques to large systems. Finally, since
several current recovery methods employ non-deterministic sampling, their inconsistent results
do not lend themselves well to tracking a systems course over several versions, as needed by its stakeholders.
RELAX (RELiable Architecture EXtraction), a new concern-based recovery method that uses text
classification, addresses these issues efficiently by (1) assembling the overall recovery result
from smaller, independent parts, (2) basing it on an algorithm with linear time complexity and (3)
being tailorable to the recovery of a single system or a sequence thereof through the selection of
meaningfully named, semantic topics. An intuitive, informative architectural visualization
rounds out RELAX's contributions. RELAX is illustrated on a number of existing open-source systems
and compared to other recovery methods.
