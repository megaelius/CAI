There is a great concern about the potential for people to leak private information on OSNs, but few
quantitative studies on this. This research explores the activity of sharing mobile numbers on
OSNs, via public profiles and posts. We attempt to understand the characteristics and risks of mobile
numbers sharing behaviour on OSNs and focus on Indian mobile numbers. We collected 76,347 unique
mobile numbers posted by 85905 users on Twitter and Facebook and analysed 2997 numbers, prefixed
with +91. We observed, most users shared their own mobile numbers to spread urgent information;
and to market products and escort business. Fewer female users shared mobile numbers on OSNs. Users
utilized other OSN platforms and third party applications like Twitterfeed, to post mobile numbers
on multiple OSNs. In contrast to the user's perception of numbers spreading quickly on OSN, we observed
that except for emergency, most numbers did not diffuse deep. To assess risks associated with mobile
numbers exposed on OSNs, we used numbers to gain sensitive information about their owners (e.g.
name, Voter ID) by collating publicly available data from OSNs, Truecaller, OCEAN. On using the
numbers on WhatApp, we obtained a myriad of sensitive details (relationship status, BBM pins) of
the number owner. We communicated the observed risks to the owners by calling. Few users were surprised
to know about the online presence of their number, while a few others intentionally posted it online
for business purposes. We observed, 38.3% of users who were unaware of the online presence of their
number have posted their number themselves on the social network. With these observations, we highlight
that there is a need to monitor leakage of mobile numbers via profile and public posts. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first exploratory study to critically investigate the exposure of
Indian mobile numbers on OSNs.
