We study the assortment optimization problem under the \emph{Sequential Multinomial Logit} (SML),
a discrete choice model that generalizes the multinomial logit (MNL). Under the SML model, products
are partitioned into two levels, to capture differences in attractiveness, brand awareness and,
or visibility of the products in the market. When a consumer is presented with an assortment of products,
she first considers products in the first level and, if none of them is purchased, products in the
second level are considered. This model is a special case of the Perception Adjusted Luce Model (PALM)
recently proposed by Echenique et al (2013). It can explain many behavioral phenomena such as the
attraction, compromise, and similarity effects which cannot be explained by the MNL model or any
discrete choice model based on random utility. In particular, the SML model allows violations to
the \emph{regularity condition} which states that the probability of choosing a product cannot
increase if the offer set is enlarged. This paper shows that the seminal concept of revenue-ordered
assortment sets, which contain an optimal assortment under the MNL model, can be generalized to
the SML model. More precisely, the paper proves that all optimal assortments under the SML are revenue-ordered
by level, a natural generalization of revenue-ordered assortments that contains, at most, a quadratic
number of assortments. As a corollary, assortment optimization under the SML is polynomial-time
solvable. This result is particularly interesting given that the SML model does not satisfy the
regularity condition and, therefore, it can explain choice behaviours that cannot be explained
by any choice model based on random utility.
