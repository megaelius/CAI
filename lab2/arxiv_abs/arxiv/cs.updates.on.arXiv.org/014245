In this paper, we consider the binary hypothesis testing problem with two observers. There are two
possible states of nature (or hypotheses). Observations are collected by two observers. The observations
are statistically related to the true state of nature. Given the observations, the objective of
both observers is to find out what is the true state of nature. We present four different approaches
to address the problem. In the first (centralized) approach, the observations collected by both
observers are sent to a central coordinator where hypothesis testing is performed. In the second
approach, each observer performs hypothesis testing based on locally collected observations.
Then they exchange binary information to arrive at a consensus. In the third approach, each observer
constructs an aggregated probability space based on the observations collected by it and the decision
it receives from the alternate observer and performs hypothesis testing in the new probability
space. In this approach also they exchange binary information to arrive at consensus. In the fourth
approach, if observations collected by the observers are independent conditioned on the hypothesis
we show the construction of the aggregated sample space can be skipped. In this case, the observers
exchange real-valued information to achieve consensus. Given the same fixed number of samples,
n, n sufficiently large, for the centralized (first) and decentralized (second) approaches, it
has been shown that if the observations collected by the observers are independent conditioned
on the hypothesis, then the minimum probability that the two observers agree and are wrong in the
decentralized approach is upper bounded by the minimum probability of error achieved in the centralized
approach.
