We address the fundamental network design problem of constructing approximate minimum spanners.
Our contributions are for the distributed setting, providing both algorithmic and hardness results.
Our main hardness result shows that an $\alpha$-approximation for the minimum directed $k$-spanner
problem for $k \geq 5$ requires $\Omega(n /\sqrt{\alpha}\log{n})$ rounds using deterministic
algorithms or $\Omega(\sqrt{n }/\sqrt{\alpha}\log{n})$ rounds using randomized ones, in the
CONGEST model of distributed computing. Combined with the constant-round $O(n^{\epsilon})$-approximation
algorithm in the LOCAL model of [Barenboim, Elkin and Gavoille, 2016], as well as a polylog-round
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm in the LOCAL model that we show here, our lower bounds
for the CONGEST model imply a strict separation between the LOCAL and CONGEST models. Notably, to
the best of our knowledge, this is the first separation between these models for a local approximation
problem. Similarly, a separation between the directed and undirected cases is implied. We also
prove a nearly-linear lower bound for the minimum weighted $k$-spanner problem for $k \geq 4$, and
we show lower bounds for the weighted 2-spanner problem. On the algorithmic side, apart from the
aforementioned $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for minimum $k$-spanners, our main
contribution is a new distributed construction of minimum 2-spanners that uses only polynomial
local computations. Our algorithm has a guaranteed approximation ratio of $O(\log(m/n))$ for
a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, which matches the best known ratio for polynomial time sequential
algorithms [Kortsarz and Peleg, 1994], and is tight if we restrict ourselves to polynomial local
computations. Our approach allows us to extend our algorithm to work also for the directed, weighted,
and client-server variants of the problem.
