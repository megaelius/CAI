We first recall in this chapter to what extent simulation models are an absolute necessity in social
sciences and humanities, which can only very exceptionally require to experimental sciences methods
to construct their knowledge. The formalisation through mathematical models able to offer analytical
solutions being most often not possible in order to provide satisfying representations of social
complexity, computational models based on agents are more and more used. For long the limited computational
capabilities of computer have forbidden to program models taking into account interactions between
large numbers of entities geographically localized (individuals or territories). In principle
these models should inform on the possibilities and conditions of the emergence of given configurations
defined at a macro-geographical level from interactions occurring at a micro-geographical level,
within systems with a too much complex behavior to be understood by a human brain. This however requires
to study the dynamical behavior of these models including non-linear feedback effects and verify
they produce plausible results at all stages of their simulation. This necessary stage of the exploration
of the dynamics of algorithms remained rather rudimentary until the end of the last decade, when
algorithms including more sophisticated methods such as evolutionary computation and the use
of distributed high performance computing have allowed a significant qualitative leap forward
in the validation of models, and even an epistemological turn for social sciences and humanities,
as suggest the latest applications realized with the OpenMOLE platform described here.
