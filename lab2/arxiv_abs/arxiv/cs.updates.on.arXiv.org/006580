This paper uses the weather forecasting as an application background to illustrate the technique
of \textit{deep uncertainty learning} (DUL). Weather forecasting has great significance throughout
human history and is traditionally approached through numerical weather prediction (NWP) in which
the atmosphere is modelled as differential equations. However, due to the instability of these
differential equations in the presence of uncertainties, weather forecasting through numerical
simulations may not be reliable. This paper explores weather forecasting as a data mining problem.
We build a deep prediction interval (DPI) model based on sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) that predicts
spatio-temporal patterns of meteorological variables in the future 37 hours, which incorporates
the informative knowledge of NWP. A big contribution and surprising finding in the training process
of DPI is that training by mean variance error (MVE) loss instead of mean square error loss can significantly
improve the generalization of point estimation, which has never been reported in previous researches.
We think this phenomenon can be regarded as a new kind of regularization which can not only be on a par
with the famous Dropout but also provide more uncertainty information, and hence comes into win-win
situation. Based on single DPI, we then build deep ensemble. We evaluate our method on dataset from
10 realistic weather stations in Beijing of China. Experimental results shown DPI has better generalization
than traditional point estimation and deep ensemble can further improve the performance. The deep
ensemble method also achieved top-2 online score ranking in the competition of AI Challenger 2018.
It can dramatically decrease up to 56\% error compared with NWP.
