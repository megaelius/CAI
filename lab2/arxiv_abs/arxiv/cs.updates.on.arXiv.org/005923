Often the challenge associated with tasks like fraud and spam detection is the lack of all likely
patterns needed to train suitable supervised learning models. This problem accentuates when the
fraudulent patterns are not only scarce, they also change over time. Change in fraudulent pattern
is because fraudsters continue to innovate novel ways to circumvent measures put in place to prevent
fraud. Limited data and continuously changing patterns makes learning significantly difficult.
We hypothesize that good behavior does not change with time and data points representing good behavior
have consistent spatial signature under different groupings. Based on this hypothesis we are proposing
an approach that detects outliers in large data sets by assigning a consistency score to each data
point using an ensemble of clustering methods. Our main contribution is proposing a novel method
that can detect outliers in large datasets and is robust to changing patterns. We also argue that
area under the ROC curve, although a commonly used metric to evaluate outlier detection methods
is not the right metric. Since outlier detection problems have a skewed distribution of classes,
precision-recall curves are better suited because precision compares false positives to true
positives (outliers) rather than true negatives (inliers) and therefore is not affected by the
problem of class imbalance. We show empirically that area under the precision-recall curve is a
better than ROC as an evaluation metric. The proposed approach is tested on the modified version
of the Landsat satellite dataset, the modified version of the ann-thyroid dataset and a large real
world credit card fraud detection dataset available through Kaggle where we show significant improvement
over the baseline methods.
