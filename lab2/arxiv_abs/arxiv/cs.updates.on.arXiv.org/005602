This paper summarizes some of the technical background, research ideas, and possible development
strategies for achieving machine common sense. Machine common sense has long been a critical-but-missing
component of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent advances in machine learning have resulted
in new AI capabilities, but in all of these applications, machine reasoning is narrow and highly
specialized. Developers must carefully train or program systems for every situation. General
commonsense reasoning remains elusive. The absence of common sense prevents intelligent systems
from understanding their world, behaving reasonably in unforeseen situations, communicating
naturally with people, and learning from new experiences. Its absence is perhaps the most significant
barrier between the narrowly focused AI applications we have today and the more general, human-like
AI systems we would like to build in the future. Machine common sense remains a broad, potentially
unbounded problem in AI. There are a wide range of strategies that could be employed to make progress
on this difficult challenge. This paper discusses two diverse strategies for focusing development
on two different machine commonsense services: (1) a service that learns from experience, like
a child, to construct computational models that mimic the core domains of child cognition for objects
(intuitive physics), agents (intentional actors), and places (spatial navigation); and (2) service
that learns from reading the Web, like a research librarian, to construct a commonsense knowledge
repository capable of answering natural language and image-based questions about commonsense
phenomena.
