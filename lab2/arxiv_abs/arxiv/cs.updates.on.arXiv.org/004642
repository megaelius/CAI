Most real-world optimization problems often come with multiple global optima or local optima.
Therefore, increasing niching metaheuristic algorithms, which devote to finding multiple optima
in a single run, are developed to solve these multimodal optimization problems. However, there
are two difficulties urgently to be solved for most existing niching metaheuristic algorithms:
how to set the optimal values of niching parameters for different optimization problems, and how
to jump out of the local optima efficiently. These two difficulties limited their practicality
largely. Based on Whale Swarm Algorithm (WSA) we proposed previously, this paper presents a new
multimodal optimizer named WSA with Iterative Counter (WSA-IC) to address these two difficulties.
In the one hand, WSA-IC improves the iteration rule of the original WSA for multimodal optimization,
which removes the need of specifying different values of attenuation coefficient for different
problems to form multiple subpopulations, without introducing any niching parameter. In the other
hand, WSA-IC enables the identification of extreme point during iterations relying on two new parameters
(i.e., stability threshold Ts and fitness threshold Tf), to jump out of the located extreme point.
Moreover, the convergence of WSA-IC is proved. Finally, the proposed WSA-IC is compared with several
niching metaheuristic algorithms on CEC2015 niching benchmark test functions and five additional
classical multimodal functions with high dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate that
WSA-IC statistically outperforms other niching metaheuristic algorithms on most test functions.
