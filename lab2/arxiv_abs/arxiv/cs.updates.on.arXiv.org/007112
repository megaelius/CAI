In this work, we aim to explore connections between dynamical systems techniques and combinatorial
optimization problems. In particular, we construct heuristic approaches for the traveling salesman
problem (TSP) based on embedding the relaxed discrete optimization problem into appropriate manifolds.
We explore multiple embedding techniques -- namely, the construction of new dynamical systems
on the manifold of orthogonal matrices and associated Procrustes approximations of the TSP cost
function. Using these dynamical systems, we analyze the local neighborhood around the optimal
TSP solutions (which are equilibria) using computations to approximate the associated \emph{stable
manifolds}. We find that these flows frequently converge to undesirable equilibria. However,
the solutions of the dynamical systems and the associated Procrustes approximation provide an
interesting biasing approach for the popular Lin--Kernighan heuristic which yields fast convergence.
The Lin--Kernighan heuristic is typically based on the computation of edges that have a `high probability'
of being in the shortest tour, thereby effectively pruning the search space. Our new approach, instead,
relies on a natural relaxation of the combinatorial optimization problem to the manifold of orthogonal
matrices and the subsequent use of this solution to bias the Lin--Kernighan heuristic. Although
the initial cost of computing these edges using the Procrustes solution is higher than existing
methods, we find that the Procrustes solution, when coupled with a homotopy computation, contains
valuable information regarding the optimal edges. We explore the Procrustes based approach on
several TSP instances and find that our approach often requires fewer $k$-opt moves than existing
approaches. Broadly, we hope that this work initiates more work in the intersection of dynamical
systems theory and combinatorial optimization.
