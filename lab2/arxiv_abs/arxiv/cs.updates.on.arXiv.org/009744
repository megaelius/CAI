Improved search quality enhances users' satisfaction, which directly impacts sales growth of
an E-Commerce (E-Com) platform. Learning to Rank (LTR) algorithms require relevance judgments
on products for learning. In real commercial scenarios, getting such judgments poses an immense
challenge in application of LTR algorithms. In the literature, it is proposed to employ user feedback
signals such as clicks, orders etc to generate relevance judgments. It is done by aggregating the
logged data and calculating click rate, order rate etc of products, for each query in the logs. In
this paper, we advocate counterfactual risk minimization (CRM) approach which circumvents the
need of such data pre-processing and is better suited for learning from logged data, i.e. contextual
bandit feedback. Due to unavailability of public E-Com LTR dataset, we provide Mercateo dataset
from our E-Com platform. This dataset contains information of queries from real users, actions
taken by the policy running on the system, probability of these actions and feedback of users on those
actions. Our commercial dataset contains more than 10 million click log entries and 1 million order
logs from a catalogue of about 3.5 million products and 3000 queries. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work which examines effectiveness of CRM approach in learning ranking model from
real-world logged data. Our empirical evaluation shows that CRM approach is able to learn directly
from logged contextual-bandit feedback. Our method outperforms full-information loss on deep
neural network model as well as traditional ranking models like LambdaMART. These findings have
significant implications for improving the quality of search in E-Com platforms.
