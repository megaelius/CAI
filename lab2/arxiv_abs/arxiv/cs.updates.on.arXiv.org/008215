The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's
disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques
has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. Here we systematically reviewed publications,
where deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data were used for diagnostic classification
of AD. A PubMed and google scholar search was performed to find deep learning papers for AD published
between January 2013 and July 2018, which were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithms
and neuroimaging types, and findings were summarized. The diagnostic classification of AD using
deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data was examined in 16 studies. The approach to combine
traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection
has produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion
from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches such
as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) using neuroimaging data
without preprocessing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification
and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. Furthermore, the best classification performance was
obtained when multimodal neuroimaging data as well as fluid biomarkers were integrated. Deep learning
approaches without preprocessing neuroimaging data for feature selection, a major bottleneck
of traditional machining learning in high-dimensional data, continue to improve their performance
and to show great promise in the diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging
data.
