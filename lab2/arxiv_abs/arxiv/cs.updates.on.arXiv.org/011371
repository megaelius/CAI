When compiling databases, for example to meet the needs of healthcare establishments, there is
quite a common problem with the introduction and further processing of names and last names of doctors
and patients that are highly specialized both in terms of pronunciation and writing. This is because
names and last names of people cannot be unique, their notation is not subject to any rules of phonetics,
while their length in different languages may not match. With the advent of the Internet, this situation
has become generally critical and can lead to that multiple copies of e-mails are sent to one address.
It is possible to solve the specified problem by using phonetic algorithms for comparing words Daitch-Mokotoff,
Soundex, NYSIIS, Polyphone, and Metaphone, as well as the Levenshtein and Jaro algorithms, Q-gram-based
algorithms, which make it possible to find distances between words. The most widespread among them
are the Soundex and Metaphone algorithms, which are designed to index the words based on their sound,
taking into consideration the rules of pronunciation. By applying the Metaphone algorithm, an
attempt has been made to optimize the phonetic search processes for tasks of fuzzy coincidence,
for example, at data deduplication in various databases and registries, in order to reduce the number
of errors of incorrect input of last names. An analysis of the most common last names reveals that
some of them are of the Ukrainian or Russian origin. At the same time, the rules following which the
names are pronounced and written, for example in Ukrainian, differ radically from basic algorithms
for English and differ quite significantly for the Russian language. That is why a phonetic algorithm
should take into consideration first of all the peculiarities in the formation of Ukrainian last
names, which is of special relevance now.
