We present a certified two-step parameterized Model Order Reduction (pMOR) technique for wave
equation and elastodynamic Partial Differential Equations (PDE). pMOR techniques for parameterized
time domain PDEs offer opportunities for faster solution estimation. However, due to the curse
of dimensionality, basic pMOR techniques fail to provide sufficiently accurate approximation
when applied for large geometric domains with multiple localized excitations. Moreover, considering
the time domain PDE for the construction of the reduced basis greatly increases the computational
cost of the offline stage and treatment of hyperbolic PDEs suffers from pessimistic error bounds.
Therefore, within the context of linear hyperbolic time domain PDEs for large domains with localized
sources, it is of great interest to develop a pMOR approach that provides relatively low-dimensional
spaces and which guarantees sufficiently accurate approximations. Towards that end, we develop
a two-step Port-Reduced Reduced-Basis Component approach (PR-RBC) for linear hyperbolic time
domain PDEs. First, our approach takes advantage of the domain decomposition technique to develop
reduced bases for subdomains, which, when assembled, form the domain of interest. This reduces
the effective dimensionality of the parameter spaces and solves the curse of dimensionality issue.
Moreover, the time domain solution is the inverse Laplace transform of a frequency domain function.
Therefore, we can approximate the time domain solution as a linear combination of the PR-RBC solutions
to the frequency domain PDE. Hence, we first apply the PR-RBC method on the elliptic frequency domain
PDE. Second, we consider the resulting approximations to form a reduced space that is used for the
time solver. We also provide an a posteriori error estimate for the two-step PR-RBC approach based
on the time-frequency duality.
