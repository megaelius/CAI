Tactile sensing or fabric hand plays a critical role in an individual's decision to buy a certain
fabric from the range of available fabrics for a desired application. Therefore, textile and clothing
manufacturers have long been in search of an objective method for assessing fabric hand, which can
then be used to engineer fabrics with a desired hand. Recognizing textures and materials in real-world
images has played an important role in object recognition and scene understanding. In this paper,
we explore how to computationally characterize apparent or latent properties (e.g., surface smoothness)
of materials, i.e., computational material surface characterization, which moves a step further
beyond material recognition. We formulate the problem as a very fine-grained texture classification
problem, and study how deep learning-based texture representation techniques can help tackle
the task. We introduce a new, large-scale challenging microscopic material surface dataset (CoMMonS),
geared towards an automated fabric quality assessment mechanism in an intelligent manufacturing
system. We then conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods
for texture classification using CoMMonS. Additionally, we propose a multi-level texture encoding
and representation network (MuLTER), which simultaneously leverages low- and high-level features
to maintain both texture details and spatial information in the texture representation. Our results
show that, in comparison with the state-of-the-art deep texture descriptors, MuLTER yields higher
accuracy not only on our CoMMonS dataset for material characterization, but also on established
datasets such as MINC-2500 and GTOS-mobile for material recognition.
