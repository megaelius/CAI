Abstract argumentation has emerged as a method for non-monotonic reasoning that has gained tremendous
traction in the symbolic artificial intelligence community. In the literature, the different
approaches to abstract argumentation that were refined over the years are typically evaluated
from a logics perspective; an analysis that is based on models of ideal, rational decision-making
does not exist. In this paper, we work towards addressing this issue by analyzing abstract argumentation
from the perspective of the rational man paradigm in microeconomic theory. To assess under which
conditions abstract argumentation-based decision-making can be considered economically rational,
we derive reference independence as a non-monotonic inference property from a formal model of economic
rationality and create a new argumentation principle that ensures compliance with these properties.
We then compare the reference independence principle with other reasoning principles, in particular
with cautious monotony and rational monotony. We show that the argumentation semantics as proposed
in Dung's classical paper, as well as other semantics we evaluate--with the exception of the SCC-recursive
CF2 semantics--do not comply with the reference independence principle. Consequently, we investigate
how structural properties of argumentation frameworks impact the reference independence principle,
and identify cyclic expansions (both even and odd cycles) as the root of the problem. Finally, we
put reference independence into the context of preference-based argumentation and show that for
this argumentation variant, which explicitly models preferences, reference independence cannot
be ensured in a straight-forward manner.
