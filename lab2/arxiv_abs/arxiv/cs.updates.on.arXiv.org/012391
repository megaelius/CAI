The existing distributed TDMA-scheduling techniques can be classified as either static or dynamic.
The primary purpose of static TDMA-scheduling algorithms is to improve the channel utilization
by generating a schedule of shorter length. But, they usually take a longer time to schedule, and
hence, are not suitable for WSNs, in which the network topology changes dynamically. On the other
hand, dynamic TDMA-scheduling algorithms generate a schedule quickly, but they are not efficient
in terms of generated schedule length. In this paper, we propose a new approach to TDMA scheduling
for WSNs, that bridges the gap between the above two extreme types of TDMA-scheduling techniques,
by providing the flexibility to trade-off between the schedule length and the time required to generate
the schedule (scheduling time). The proposed TDMA scheduling works in two phases. In the first phase,
we generate a TDMA schedule quickly, which need not have to be very efficient in terms of schedule
length. In the second phase, we iteratively reduce the schedule length in a manner, such that the
process of schedule length reduction can be terminated after the execution of an arbitrary number
of iterations, and still be left with a valid schedule. This step provides the capability to trade-off
between schedule length and scheduling time. We have used Castalia network simulator to evaluate
the performance of proposed TDMA-scheduling scheme. The simulation result together with theoretical
analysis shows that in addition to the advantage of trading-off the schedule length with scheduling
time, the proposed TDMA scheduling approach achieves better performance than existing algorithms
in terms of schedule length and scheduling time.
