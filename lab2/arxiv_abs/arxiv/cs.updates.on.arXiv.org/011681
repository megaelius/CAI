Cross-correlations in fluctuations of the daily exchange rates within the basket of the 100 highest-capitalization
cryptocurrencies over the period October 1, 2015, through March 31, 2019, are studied. The corresponding
dynamics predominantly involve one leading eigenvalue of the correlation matrix, while the others
largely coincide with those of Wishart random matrices. However, the magnitude of the principal
eigenvalue, and thus the degree of collectivity, strongly depends on which cryptocurrency is used
as a base. It is largest when the base is the most peripheral cryptocurrency; when more significant
ones are taken into consideration, its magnitude systematically decreases, nevertheless preserving
a sizable gap with respect to the random bulk, which in turn indicates that the organization of correlations
becomes more heterogeneous. This finding provides a criterion for recognizing which currencies
or cryptocurrencies play a dominant role in the global crypto-market. The present study shows that
over the period under consideration, the Bitcoin (BTC) predominates, hallmarking exchange rate
dynamics at least as influential as the US dollar. The BTC started dominating around the year 2017,
while further cryptocurrencies, like the Ethereum (ETH) and even Ripple (XRP), assumed similar
trends. At the same time, the USD, an original value determinant for the cryptocurrency market,
became increasingly disconnected, its related characteristics eventually approaching those
of a fictitious currency. These results are strong indicators of incipient independence of the
global cryptocurrency market, delineating a self-contained trade resembling the Forex.
