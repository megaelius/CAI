While image analysis of chest computed tomography (CT) for COVID-19 diagnosis has been intensively
studied, little work has been performed for image-based patient outcome prediction. Management
of high-risk patients with early intervention is a key to lower the fatality rate of COVID-19 pneumonia,
as a majority of patients recover naturally. Therefore, an accurate prediction of disease progression
with baseline imaging at the time of the initial presentation can help in patient management. In
lieu of only size and volume information of pulmonary abnormalities and features through deep learning
based image segmentation, here we combine radiomics of lung opacities and non-imaging features
from demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory findings to predict need for intensive care
unit (ICU) admission. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses holistic information of
a patient including both imaging and non-imaging data for outcome prediction. The proposed methods
were thoroughly evaluated on datasets separately collected from three hospitals, one in the United
States, one in Iran, and another in Italy, with a total 295 patients with reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay positive COVID-19 pneumonia. Our experimental results demonstrate
that adding non-imaging features can significantly improve the performance of prediction to achieve
AUC up to 0.884 and sensitivity as high as 96.1%, which can be valuable to provide clinical decision
support in managing COVID-19 patients. Our methods may also be applied to other lung diseases including
but not limited to community acquired pneumonia.
