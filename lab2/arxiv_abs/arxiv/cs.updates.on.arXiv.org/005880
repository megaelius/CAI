The solution of (generalized) eigenvalue problems for symmetric or Hermitian matrices is a common
subtask of many numerical calculations in electronic structure theory or materials science. Solving
the eigenvalue problem can easily amount to a sizeable fraction of the whole numerical calculation.
For researchers in the field of computational materials science, an efficient and scalable solution
of the eigenvalue problem is thus of major importance. The ELPA-library is a well-established dense
direct eigenvalue solver library, which has proven to be very efficient and scalable up to very large
core counts. In this paper, we describe the latest optimizations of the ELPA-library for new HPC
architectures of the Intel Skylake processor family with an AVX-512 SIMD instruction set, or for
HPC systems accelerated with recent GPUs. We also describe a complete redesign of the API in a modern
modular way, which, apart from a much simpler and more flexible usability, leads to a new path to access
system-specific performance optimizations. In order to ensure optimal performance for a particular
scientific setting or a specific HPC system, the new API allows the user to influence in straightforward
way the internal details of the algorithms and of performance-critical parameters used in the ELPA-library.
On top of that, we introduced an autotuning functionality, which allows for finding the best settings
in a self-contained automated way. In situations where many eigenvalue problems with similar settings
have to be solved consecutively, the autotuning process of the ELPA-library can be done "on-the-fly".
Practical applications from materials science which rely on so-called self-consistency iterations
can profit from the autotuning. On some examples of scientific interest, simulated with the FHI-aims
application, the advantages of the latest optimizations of the ELPA-library are demonstrated.
