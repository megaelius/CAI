Atrial fibrillation is a cardiac arrhythmia that affects an estimated 33.5 million people globally
and is the potential cause of 1 in 3 strokes in people over the age of 60. Detection and diagnosis of
atrial fibrillation (AFIB) is done noninvasively in the clinical environment through the evaluation
of electrocardiograms (ECGs). Early research into automated methods for the detection of AFIB
in ECG signals focused on traditional bio-medical signal analysis to extract important features
for use in statistical classification models. Artificial intelligence models have more recently
been used that employ convolutional and/or recurrent network architectures. In this work, significant
time and frequency domain characteristics of the ECG signal are extracted by applying the short-time
Fourier trans-form and then visually representing the information in a spectrogram. Two different
classification approaches were investigated that utilized deep features in the spectrograms
construct-ed from ECG segments. The first approach used a pretrained DenseNet model to extract
features that were then classified using Support Vector Machines, and the second approach used
the spectrograms as direct input into a convolutional network. Both approaches were evaluated
against the MIT-BIH AFIB dataset, where the convolutional network approach achieved a classification
accuracy of 93.16%. While these results do not surpass established automated atrial fibrillation
detection methods, they are promising and warrant further investigation given they did not require
any noise prefiltering, hand-crafted features, nor a reliance on beat detection.
