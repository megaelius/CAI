Time- and pitch-scale modifications of speech signals find important applications in speech synthesis,
playback systems, voice conversion, learning/hearing aids, etc.. There is a requirement for computationally
efficient and real-time implementable algorithms. In this paper, we propose a high quality and
computationally efficient time- and pitch-scaling methodology based on the glottal closure instants
(GCIs) or epochs in speech signals. The proposed algorithm, termed as epoch-synchronous overlap-add
time/pitch-scaling (ESOLA-TS/PS), segments speech signals into overlapping short-time frames
and then the adjacent frames are aligned with respect to the epochs and the frames are overlap-added
to synthesize time-scale modified speech. Pitch scaling is achieved by resampling the time-scaled
speech by a desired sampling factor. We also propose a concept of epoch embedding into speech signals,
which facilitates the identification and time-stamping of samples corresponding to epochs and
using them for time/pitch-scaling to multiple scaling factors whenever desired, thereby contributing
to faster and efficient implementation. The results of perceptual evaluation tests reported in
this paper indicate the superiority of ESOLA over state-of-the-art techniques. ESOLA significantly
outperforms the conventional pitch synchronous overlap-add (PSOLA) techniques in terms of perceptual
quality and intelligibility of the modified speech. Unlike the waveform similarity overlap-add
(WSOLA) or synchronous overlap-add (SOLA) techniques, the ESOLA technique has the capability
to do exact time-scaling of speech with high quality to any desired modification factor within a
range of 0.5 to 2. Compared to synchronous overlap-add with fixed synthesis (SOLAFS), the ESOLA
is computationally advantageous and at least three times faster.
