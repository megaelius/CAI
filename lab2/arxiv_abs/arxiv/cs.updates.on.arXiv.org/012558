Combinatorial optimization problems arise in a wide range of applications from diverse domains.
Many of these problems are NP-hard and designing efficient heuristics for them requires considerable
time and experimentation. On the other hand, the number of optimization problems in the industry
continues to grow. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been explored to address this
gap. We propose a framework for leveraging machine learning techniques to scale-up exact combinatorial
optimization algorithms. In contrast to the existing approaches based on deep-learning, reinforcement
learning and restricted Boltzmann machines that attempt to directly learn the output of the optimization
problem from its input (with limited success), our framework learns the relatively simpler task
of pruning the elements in order to reduce the size of the problem instances. In addition, our framework
uses only interpretable learning models based on intuitive features and thus the learning process
provides deeper insights into the optimization problem and the instance class, that can be used
for designing better heuristics. For the classical maximum clique enumeration problem, we show
that our framework can prune a large fraction of the input graph (around 99 % of nodes in case of sparse
graphs) and still detect almost all of the maximum cliques. This results in several fold speedups
of state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the model used in our framework highlights that
the chi-squared value of neighborhood degree has a statistically significant correlation with
the presence of a node in a maximum clique, particularly in dense graphs which constitute a significant
challenge for modern solvers. We leverage this insight to design a novel heuristic for this problem
outperforming the state-of-the-art. Our heuristic is also of independent interest for maximum
clique detection and enumeration.
