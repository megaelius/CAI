The traditional kinematic calibration method for manipulators requires precise three-dimensional
measuring instruments to measure the end pose, which is not only expensive due to the high cost of
the measuring instruments but also not applicable to all manipulators. Another calibration method
uses a camera, but the system error caused by the camera's parameters affects the calibration accuracy
of the kinematics of the robot arm. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for calibrating the geometric
parameters of a kinematic model of a manipulator based on monocular vision. Firstly, the classic
Denavit-Hartenberg(D-H) modeling method is used to establish the kinematic parameters of the
manipulator. Secondly, nonlinear optimization and parameter compensation are performed. The
three-dimensional positions of the feature points of the calibration plate under each manipulator
attitude corresponding to the actual kinematic model and the classic D-H kinematic model are mapped
into the pixel coordinate system, and the sum of Euclidean distance errors of the pixel coordinates
of the two is used as the objective function to be optimized. The experimental results show that the
pixel deviation of the end pose corresponding to the optimized D-H kinematic model proposed in this
paper and the end pose corresponding to the actual kinematic model in the pixel coordinate system
is 0.99 pixels. Compared with the 7.9 deviation pixels between the pixel coordinates calculated
by the classic D-H kinematic model and the actual pixel coordinates, the deviation is reduced by
nearly 7 pixels for an 87% reduction in error. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively avoid
system errors caused by camera parameters in visual calibration, can improve the absolute positioning
accuracy of the end of the robotic arm, and has good economy and universality.
