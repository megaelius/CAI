In numerical time-integration with implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods, a within-step adaptable
decomposition called residual balanced decomposition is introduced. This decomposition allows
any residual occurring in the implicit equation of the implicit-step to be moved into the explicit
part of the decomposition. By balancing the residual, the accuracy of the local truncation error
of the time-stepping method becomes independent from the accuracy by which the implicit equation
is solved. In this way, the requirement of a small enough residual in an iterative solver is relieved
in favor of overall computational efficiency. In order to balance the residual, the original IMEX
decomposition is adjusted after the iterative solver has been stopped. For this to work, the traditional
IMEX time-stepping algorithm needs to be changed. We call this new method the shortcut-IMEX (SIMEX).
SIMEX can gain computational efficiency by exploring the trade-off between the computational
effort placed in solving the implicit equation and the size of the numerically stable time-step.
Typically, increasing the number of solver iterations increases the largest stable step-size.
Both multi-step and Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are suitable for use with SIMEX. Here, we explore the
efficiency of a SIMEX-RK method in overcoming parabolic stiffness by applying it to a nonlinear
reaction-advection-diffusion equation. In order to define a stability region for SIMEX, a region
in the complex plane is depicted by applying SIMEX to a suitable PDE model containing diffusion and
dispersion. A myriad of stability regions can be reached by changing the RK tableau and the solver.
