Seed maturity in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) determines economic return to a producer because
of its impact on seed weight (yield), and critically influences seed vigor and other quality characteristics.
During seed development, the inner mesocarp layer of the pericarp (hull) transitions in color from
white to black as the seed matures. The maturity assessment process involves the removal of the exocarp
of the hull and visually categorizing the mesocarp color into varying color classes from immature
(white, yellow, orange) to mature (brown, and black). This visual color classification is time
consuming because the exocarp must be manually removed. In addition, the visual classification
process involves human assessment of colors, which leads to large variability of color classification
from observer to observer. A more objective, digital imaging approach to peanut maturity is needed,
optimally without the requirement of removal of the hull's exocarp. This study examined the use
of a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) process to determine pod maturity with intact pericarps. The HSI
method leveraged spectral differences between mature and immature pods within a classification
algorithm to identify the mature and immature pods. The results showed a high classification accuracy
with consistency using samples from different years and cultivars. In addition, the proposed method
was capable of estimating a continuous-valued, pixel-level maturity value for individual peanut
pods, allowing for a valuable tool that can be utilized in seed quality research. This new method
solves issues of labor intensity and subjective error that all current methods of peanut maturity
determination have.
