We study optimal delivery strategies of one common and $K$ independent messages from a source to
multiple users in wireless environments. In particular, we consider a two-layered superposition
of broadcast/multicast and unicast signals in a downlink multiuser OFDMA system that is the main
multiple access technology in the 4G and 5G mobile standards. In the literature and industry, the
two-layer superposition is often considered as a pragmatic approach to make a compromise between
the simple but suboptimal orthogonal multiplexing (OM) and the optimal but complex fully-layered
non-orthogonal multiplexing. In this work, we show that only two-layers are necessary to achieve
the maximum sum-rate when the common message has higher priority than the $K$ individual unicast
messages, and OM cannot be sum-rate optimal in general. We develop an algorithm that finds the optimal
power allocation over the two-layers and across the OFDMA radio resources. The considered two-layer
architecture is sum-rate optimal, enhances the cell-edge user performance, and retains decoding
simplicity at the receivers. Two main use-cases are considered: i) Multicast and unicast multiplexing
when $K$ users with uplink capabilities request both common and independent messages, and ii) broadcast
and unicast multiplexing when the common message targets receive-only devices and $K$ users with
uplink capabilities additionally request independent messages. Finally, we develop a transceiver
design for broadcast/multicast and unicast superposition based on LTE-A-Pro physical layer and
show with numerical evaluations that the capacity improvements can be translated into significant
practical performance gains compared to the orthogonal schemes included in the 3GPP specifications.
