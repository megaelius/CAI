Graphs provide a natural mathematical abstraction for systems with pairwise interactions, and
thus have become a prevalent tool across various scientific domains. However, as uncertainty permeates
data-acquisition methods, and the size of relational datasets continues to grow, traditional
graph-based approaches are increasingly replaced by more flexible modeling paradigms. A promising
framework in this regard is that of graphons, which provide an overarching class of non-parametric
random graph models. While the theory of graphons is already well developed, some prominent tools
in network analysis still have no counterpart within the realm of graphons. In particular, node
centrality measures, which have been successfully employed in various applications to reveal
important nodes in a network, have so far not been defined for graphons. A key motivation for closing
this gap is that centrality measures defined at the modeling level of graphons will be inherently
robust to stochastic variations of specific graph realizations. In this work we introduce formal
definitions of centrality measures for graphons and establish their connections to centrality
measures defined on finite graphs. In particular, we build on the theory of linear integral operators
to define degree, eigenvector, and Katz centrality functions for graphons. We further establish
concentration inequalities showing that these centrality functions arise naturally as limits
of their analogous counterparts defined on sequences of converging graphs of increasing size.
Moreover, we provide high-probability bounds on the distance between the graphon centrality function
and the centrality measures realized in any sampled graph. We discuss and exemplify several strategies
for computing graphon centrality functions and illustrate the aforementioned concentration
inequalities through numerical experiments.
