Stochastic dynamics of several systems can be modeled via piecewise deterministic time evolution
of the state, interspersed by random discrete events. Within this general class of systems, we consider
time-triggered stochastic hybrid systems (TTSHS), where the state evolves continuously according
to a linear time-varying dynamical system. Discrete events occur based on an underlying renewal
process (timer), and the intervals between successive events follow an arbitrary continuous probability
density function. Moreover, whenever the event occurs, the state is reset based on a linear affine
transformation that allows for the inclusion of state-dependent and independent noise terms.
Our key contribution is derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of
statistical moments, along with exact analytical expressions for the steady-state moments. These
results are illustrated on an example from cell biology, where deterministic synthesis and decay
of a gene product (RNA or protein) is coupled to random timing of cell-division events. As experimentally
observed, cell-division events occur based on an internal timer that measures the time elapsed
since the start of cell cycle (i.e., last event). Upon division, the gene product level is halved,
together with a state-dependent noise term that arises due to randomness in the partitioning of
molecules between two daughter cells. We show that the TTSHS framework is conveniently suited to
capture the time evolution of gene product levels, and derive unique formulas connecting its mean
and variance to underlying model parameters and noise mechanisms. Systematic analysis of the formulas
reveal counterintuitive insights, such as, if the partitioning noise is large then making the timing
of cell division more random reduces noise in gene product levels.
