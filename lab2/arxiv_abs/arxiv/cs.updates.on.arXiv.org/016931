Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is known to improve the quality of life of affected
individuals. However, diagnosis is often delayed even in wealthier countries including the US,
largely due to the fact that gold standard diagnostic tools such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) are time consuming and require
expertise to administer. This trend is even more pronounced lower resources settings due to a lack
of trained experts. As a result, alternative, less technical methods that leverage the unique ways
in which children with ASD react to visual stimulation in a controlled environment have been developed
to help facilitate early diagnosis. Previous studies have shown that, when exposed to a video that
presents both social and abstract scenes side by side, a child with ASD will focus their attention
towards the abstract images on the screen to a greater extent than a child without ASD. Such differential
responses make it possible to implement an algorithm for the rapid diagnosis of ASD based on eye tracking
against different visual stimuli. Here we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm
for gaze prediction using images extracted from a one-minute stimulus video. Our model achieved
a high accuracy rate and robustness for prediction of gaze direction with independent persons and
employing a different camera than the one used during testing. In addition to this, the proposed
algorithm achieves a fast response time, providing a near real-time evaluation of ASD. Thereby,
by applying the proposed method, we could significantly reduce the diagnosis time and facilitate
the diagnosis of ASD in low resource regions.
