Purpose: Science is subject to a normative structure that includes how the contributions and interactions
between scientists are rewarded. Authorship and citations have been the key elements within the
reward system of science, whereas acknowledgements, despite being a well-established element
in scholarly communication, have not received the same attention. This paper aims to put forward
the bearing of acknowledgements in the humanities to bring to the foreground contributions and
interactions that, otherwise, would remain invisible through traditional indicators of research
performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive framework to
understanding acknowledgements as part of the reward system with a special focus on its value in
the humanities as a reflection of intellectual indebtedness. The distinctive features of research
in the humanities are outlined and the role of acknowledgements as a source of contributorship information
is reviewed to support these assumptions. Findings: Peer interactive communication is the prevailing
support thanked in the acknowledgements of humanities, so the notion of acknowledgements as super-citations
can make special sense in this area. Since single-authored papers still predominate as publishing
pattern in this domain, the study of acknowledgements might help to understand social interactions
and intellectual influences that lie behind a piece of research and are not visible through authorship.
Originality/value: Previous works have proposed and explored the prevailing acknowledgement
types by domain. This paper focuses on the humanities to show the role of acknowledgements within
the reward system and highlight publication patterns and inherent research features which make
acknowledgements particularly interesting in the area as reflection of the socio-cognitive structure
of research.
