We define and develop two-level type theory (2LTT), a version of Martin-L\"of type theory which
combines two different type theories. We refer to them as the inner and the outer type theory. In our
case of interest, the inner theory is homotopy type theory (HoTT) which may include univalent universes
and higher inductive types. The outer theory is a traditional form of type theory validating uniqueness
of identity proofs (UIP). One point of view on it is as internalised meta-theory of the inner type
theory. There are two motivations for 2LTT. Firstly, there are certain results about HoTT which
are of meta-theoretic nature, such as the statement that semisimplicial types up to level $n$ can
be constructed in HoTT for any externally fixed natural number $n$. Such results cannot be expressed
in HoTT itself, but they can be formalised and proved in 2LTT, where $n$ will be a variable in the outer
theory. This point of view is inspired by observations about conservativity of presheaf models.
Secondly, 2LTT is a framework which is suitable for formulating additional axioms that one might
want to add to HoTT. This idea is heavily inspired by Voevodsky's Homotopy Type System (HTS), which
constitutes one specific instance of a 2LTT. HTS has an axiom ensuring that the type of natural numbers
behaves like the external natural numbers, which allows the construction of a universe of semisimplicial
types. In 2LTT, this axiom can be stated simply be asking the inner and outer natural numbers to be
isomorphic. After defining 2LTT, we set up a collection of tools with the goal of making 2LTT a convenient
language for future developments. As a first such application, we develop the theory of Reedy fibrant
diagrams in the style of Shulman. Continuing this line of thought, we suggest a definition of (infinity,1)-category
and give some examples.
