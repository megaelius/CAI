Background In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19, countries have adopted
Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and full lockdown. An objective
and quantitative means of monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level
is urgently required. Here we explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile
health platform RADAR-base as a toolbox to test the effect and response to NPIs aimed at limiting
the spread of COVID-19. Methods We included 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark,
the UK, and the Netherlands. We derived features from the phone and wearable device for length of
time spent at home, distance travelled from home, heart rate, sleep, and patterns of phone use. We
visualised data using time series plots and performed statistical tests to assess differences
in behaviour during baseline, pre-, and post-lockdown periods. Findings We found significant
changes in behaviours between baseline/pre-lockdown and post-lockdown for all features except
total sleep duration. In general, participants spent more time at home, travelled much less, and
were more active on their phones, interacting with others by using social apps. Nevertheless, the
response across nations differed with Denmark showing attenuated changes in behaviour. Interpretation
Differences in the extracted features by country may reflect variations in communication and implementation
of different NPIs as well as cultural differences. We have demonstrated that generalised open-source
mobile health monitoring platforms such as RADAR-base which leverages data from wearables and
mobile technologies are valuable tools for helping understand the behavioural impact of public
health interventions implemented in response to infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19.
