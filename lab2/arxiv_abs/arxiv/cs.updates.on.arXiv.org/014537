Quantification of myocardial perfusion has the potential to improve detection of regional and
global flow reduction. Significant effort has been made to automate the workflow, where one essential
step is the arterial input function (AIF) extraction. Since failure here invalidates quantification,
high accuracy is required. For this purpose, this study presents a robust AIF detection method using
the convolutional neural net (CNN) model. CNN models were trained by assembling 25,027 scans (N=12,984
patients) from three hospitals, seven scanners. A test set of 5,721 scans (N=2,805 patients) evaluated
model performance. The 2D+T AIF time series was inputted into CNN. Two variations were investigated:
a) Two Classes (2CS) for background and foreground (LV mask); b) Three Classes (3CS) for background,
foreground LV and RV. Final model was deployed on MR scanners via the Gadgetron InlineAI. Model loading
time on MR scanner was ~340ms and applying it took ~180ms. The 3CS model successfully detect LV for
99.98% of all test cases (1 failed out of 5,721 cases). The mean Dice ratio for 3CS was 0.87+/-0.08
with 92.0% of all test cases having Dice ratio >0.75, while the 2CS model gave lower Dice of 0.82+/-0.22
(P<1e-5). Extracted AIF signals using CNN were further compared to manual ground-truth for foot-time,
peak-time, first-pass duration, peak value and area-under-curve. No significant differences
were found for all features (P>0.2). This study proposed, validated, and deployed a robust CNN solution
to detect the LV for the extraction of the AIF signal used in fully automated perfusion flow mapping.
A very large data cohort was assembled and resulting models were deployed to MR scanners for fully
inline AI in clinical hospitals.
