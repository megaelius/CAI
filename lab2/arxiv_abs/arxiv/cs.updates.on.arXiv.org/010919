There exists an increasing demand for a flexible and computationally efficient controller for
micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) due to a high degree of environmental perturbations. In this work,
an evolving neuro-fuzzy controller, namely Parsimonious Controller (PAC) is proposed. It features
fewer network parameters than conventional approaches due to the absence of rule premise parameters.
PAC is built upon a recently developed evolving neuro-fuzzy system known as parsimonious learning
machine (PALM) and adopts new rule growing and pruning modules derived from the approximation of
bias and variance. These rule adaptation methods have no reliance on user-defined thresholds,
thereby increasing the PAC's autonomy for real-time deployment. PAC adapts the consequent parameters
with the sliding mode control (SMC) theory in the single-pass fashion. The boundedness and convergence
of the closed-loop control system's tracking error and the controller's consequent parameters
are confirmed by utilizing the LaSalle-Yoshizawa theorem. Lastly, the controller's efficacy
is evaluated by observing various trajectory tracking performance from a bio-inspired flapping-wing
micro aerial vehicle (BI-FWMAV) and a rotary wing micro aerial vehicle called hexacopter. Furthermore,
it is compared to three distinctive controllers. Our PAC outperforms the linear PID controller
and feed-forward neural network (FFNN) based nonlinear adaptive controller. Compared to its predecessor,
G-controller, the tracking accuracy is comparable, but the PAC incurs significantly fewer parameters
to attain similar or better performance than the G-controller.
