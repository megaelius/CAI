The Directed Rural Postman Problem (DRPP) can be formulated as follows: given a strongly connected
directed multigraph $D=(V,A)$ with nonnegative integral weights on the arcs, a subset $R$ of $A$
and a nonnegative integer $\ell$, decide whether $D$ has a closed directed walk containing every
arc of $R$ and of total weight at most $\ell$. Let $k$ be the number of weakly connected components
in the the subgraph of $D$ induced by $R$. Sorge et al. (2012) ask whether the DRPP is fixed-parameter
tractable (FPT) when parameterized by $k$, i.e., whether there is an algorithm of running time $O^*(f(k))$
where $f$ is a function of $k$ only and the $O^*$ notation suppresses polynomial factors. Sorge et
al. (2012) note that this question is of significant practical relevance and has been open for more
than thirty years. Using an algebraic approach, we prove that DRPP has a randomized algorithm with
false negatives of running time $O^*(2^k)$ when $\ell$ is bounded by a polynomial in the number of
vertices in $D$. We also show that the same result holds for the undirected version of DRPP, where
$D$ is a connected undirected multigraph. In an attempt to solve DRPP, Sorge et al. (2012) introduced
the following Conjoining Bipartite Matching (CBM) problem: given a bipartite graph $B$ with nonnegative
integral weights on its edges, a partition $V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_t$ of vertices of $B$, a nonnegative
integer $\ell$, and a graph $(\{1,\ldots, t\},F)$, decide whether $B$ contains a perfect matching
$M$ of total weight at most $\ell$ such that for each $ij\in F$ there is an edge $uv\in M$ such that $u\in
V_i$ and $v\in V_j$. Sorge et al. (2012) ask whether CBM is fixed-parameter tractable. We prove that
there is a randomized algorithm with false negatives for CBM of running time $O^*(2^{|F|})$, provided
$\ell$ is bounded by a polynomial in the number of vertices in $B$.
