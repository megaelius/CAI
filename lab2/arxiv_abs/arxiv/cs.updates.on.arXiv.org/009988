For datacenter computing workloads, previous work reports that they have extremely low floating
point operation intensity. Our experiments also show that the average FLOPS efficiency of the DC
workloads is only 0.1%. The FLOPS gap is 12X between the two systems equipped with Intel Xeon or Intel
Atom processors, but the average user-perceived performance gap of the DC workloads is only 7.4X
between them. These observations imply that FLOPS (Floating-point Operations per Second) is inappropriate
to evaluate DC computing systems. To address the above issue, we propose BOPS (Basic OPerations
per Second), which is the average number of BOPs (Basic OPerations) completed per second, as a new
computation-centric metric. BOPs include the integer and floating point computations of arithmetic,
logical, comparing and array addressing. The number of BOPs is independent of the underlying system
and hardware implementation, and can be calculated through automatically analyzing the source
code of the workload. Based on the BOPS metric, an upper bound performance model, named DC-Roofline,
is proposed for DC computing. In our experiments, three typical systems equipped with different
Intel processors are evaluated using 17 typical DC workloads. The bias between the BOPS gap and the
average user-perceived performance gap is no more than 11%, and the BOPS efficiency of the Sort workload
achieves 32%. We optimize the typical DC kernel workloads under the guidance of the DC-Roofline
model, and all workloads have achieved performance improvements ranging from 1.1X to 4.4X. Furthermore,
as the real DC workload always has million lines of codes and tens of thousands of functions, it is
not easy to use the DC-Roofline model directly. We propose an optimization methodology for the real-world
DC workloads. Under the guidance of the proposed methodology, we optimize Redis by 1.2X.
