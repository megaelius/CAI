This work investigates the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology for measurement
of rock fragmentation without placement of scale objects in the scene to determine image scale.
Commonly practiced image-based rock fragmentation analysis requires a technician to walk to a
rock pile, place a scale object of known size in the area of interest, and capture individual 2D images.
Our previous work has used UAV technology for the first time to acquire real-time rock fragmentation
data and has shown comparable quality of results; however, it still required the (potentially dangerous)
placement of scale objects, and continued to make the assumption that the rock pile surface is planar
and that the scale objects lie on the surface plane. This work improves our UAV-based approach to
enable rock fragmentation measurement without placement of scale objects and without the assumption
of planarity. This is achieved by first generating a point cloud of the rock pile from 2D images, taking
into account intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, and then taking 2D images for fragmentation
analysis. This work represents an important step towards automating post-blast rock fragmentation
analysis. In experiments, a rock pile with known size distribution was photographed by the UAV with
and without using scale objects. For fragmentation analysis without scale objects, a point cloud
of the rock pile was generated and used to compute image scale. Comparison of the rock size distributions
show that this point-cloud-based method enables producing measurements with better or comparable
accuracy (within 10% of the ground truth) to the manual method with scale objects.
