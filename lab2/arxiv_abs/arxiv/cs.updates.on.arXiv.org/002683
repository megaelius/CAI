In index coding, a server broadcasts multiple messages to their respective receivers, each with
some side information that can be utilized to reduce the amount of communication from the server.
Distributed index coding is an extension of index coding in which the messages are now broadcast
from multiple servers, each storing different subsets of the messages. In this paper, the optimal
tradeoff among the message rates and the server broadcast rates, which is defined formally as the
capacity region, is studied for a general distributed index coding problem. Inner and outer bounds
on the capacity region are established that have matching sum-rates for all 218 non-isomorphic
four-message problems with equal link capacities. The proposed inner bound is built on a distributed
composite coding scheme that outperforms the existing schemes by incorporating more flexible
decoding configurations and fractional rate allocations into two-stage composite coding, a scheme
that was originally introduced for centralized index coding. The proposed outer bound is built
on the polymatroidal axioms of entropy, as well as functional dependences such as the $\rm{fd}$-separation
introduced by the multi-server nature of the problem. This outer bound utilizes general groupings
of servers with different levels of granularity, which allows a natural tradeoff between computational
complexity and tightness of the bound, and includes and improves upon all existing outer bounds
for distributed index coding. Specific features of the proposed inner and outer bounds are demonstrated
through concrete examples with four or five messages.
