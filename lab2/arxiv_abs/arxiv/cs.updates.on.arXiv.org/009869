Goal: In this work, we develop a robust, extensible tool to automatically and accurately count retinal
ganglion cell axons in images of optic nerve tissue from various animal models of glaucoma. Methods:
The U-Net convolutional neural network architecture was adapted to learn pixelwise axon count
density estimates, which were then integrated over the image area to determine axon counts. The
tool, termed AxoNet, was trained and evaluated using a dataset containing images of optic nerve
regions randomly selected from complete cross sections of intact rat optic nerves and manually
annotated for axon count and location. Both control and damaged optic nerves were used. This rat-trained
network was then applied to a separate dataset of non-human primate (NHP) optic nerve images. AxoNet
was then compared to two existing automated axon counting tools, AxonMaster and AxonJ, using both
datasets. Results: AxoNet outperformed the existing tools on both the rat and NHP optic nerve datasets
as judged by mean absolute error, R2 values when regressing automated vs. manual counts, and Bland-Altman
analysis. Conclusion: The proposed tool allows for accurate quantification of axon numbers as
a measure of glaucomatous damage. AxoNet is robust to variations in optic nerve tissue damage extent,
image quality, and species of mammal. Significance: The deep learning method does not rely on hand-crafted
image features for axon recognition. Therefore, this approach is not species-specific and can
be extended to quantify additional optic nerve features. It will aid evaluation of optic nerve changes
in glaucoma and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases.
