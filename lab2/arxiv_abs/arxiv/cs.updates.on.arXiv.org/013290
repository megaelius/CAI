Search patterns of randomly oriented steps of different lengths have been observed on all scales
of the biological world, ranging from the microscopic to the ecological, including in protein motors,
bacteria, T-cells, honeybees, marine predators, and more. Through different models, it has been
demonstrated that adopting a variety in the magnitude of the step lengths can greatly improve the
search efficiency. However, the precise connection between the search efficiency and the number
of step lengths in the repertoire of the searcher has not been identified. Motivated by biological
examples in one-dimensional terrains, a recent paper studied the best cover time on an n-node cycle
that can be achieved by a random walk process that uses k step lengths. By tuning the lengths and corresponding
probabilities the authors therein showed that the best cover time is roughly n 1+$\Theta$(1/k).
While this bound is useful for large values of k, it is hardly informative for small k values, which
are of interest in biology. In this paper, we provide a tight bound for the cover time of such a walk,
for every integer k > 1. Specifically, up to lower order polylogarithmic factors, the upper bound
on the cover time is a polynomial in n of exponent 1+ 1/(2k--1). For k = 2, 3, 4 and 5 the exponent is thus
4/3 , 6/5 , 8/7 , and 10/9 , respectively. Informally, our result implies that, as long as the number
of step lengths k is not too large, incorporating an additional step length to the repertoire of the
process enables to improve the cover time by a polynomial factor, but the extent of the improvement
gradually decreases with k.
