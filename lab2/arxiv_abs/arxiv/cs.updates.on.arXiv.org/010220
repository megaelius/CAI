Purpose: To acquire the real-time interactive temperature map for aqueous and adipose tissue,
the problems of long acquisition and processing time must be addressed. To overcome these major
challenges, this paper proposes a cascaded convolutional neural network (CNN) framework and multi-echo
gradient echo (meGRE) with a single reference variable flip angle (srVFA). Methods: To optimize
the echo times for each method, MR images are acquired using a meGRE sequence; meGRE images with two
flip angles (FAs) and meGRE images with a single FA are acquired during the pretreatment and treatment
stages, respectively. These images are then processed and reconstructed by a cascaded CNN, which
consists of two CNNs. The first CNN (called DeepACCnet) performs HR complex MR image reconstruction
from the LR MR image acquired during the treatment stage, which is improved by the HR magnitude MR
image acquired during the pretreatment stage. The second CNN (called DeepPROCnet) copes with T1
mapping. Results: Measurements of temperature and T1 changes obtained by meGRE combined with srVFA
and cascaded CNNs were achieved in an agarose gel phantom, ex vivo porcine muscle, and ex vivo porcine
muscle with fat layers (heating tests), and in vivo human prostate and brain (non-heating tests).
In the heating test, the maximum differences between fiber-optic sensor and samples are less than
1 degree Celcius. In all cases, temperature mapping using the cascaded CNN achieved the best results
in all cases. The acquisition and processing times for the proposed method are 0.8 s and 32 ms, respectively.
Conclusions: Real-time interactive HR MR temperature mapping for simultaneously measuring aqueous
and adipose tissue is feasible by combining a cascaded CNN with meGRE and srVFA.
