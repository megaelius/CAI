Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures aim to reduce costly data transfers by performing arithmetic
and logic operations in memory and hence relieve the pressure due to the memory wall. However, determining
whether a given workload can really benefit from CiM, which memory hierarchy and what device technology
should be adopted by a CiM architecture requires in-depth study that is not only time consuming but
also demands significant expertise in architectures and compilers. This paper presents an energy
evaluation framework, Eva-CiM, for systems based on CiM architectures. Eva-CiM encompasses a
multi-level (from device to architecture) comprehensive tool chain by leveraging existing modeling
and simulation tools such as GEM5, McPAT [2] and DESTINY [3]. To support high-confidence prediction,
rapid design space exploration and ease of use, Eva-CiM introduces several novel modeling/analysis
approaches including models for capturing memory access and dependency-aware ISA traces, and
for quantifying interactions between the host CPU and CiM modules. Eva-CiM can readily produce
energy estimates of the entire system for a given program, a processor architecture, and the CiM
array and technology specifications. Eva-CiM is validated by comparing with DESTINY [3] and [4],
and enables findings including practical contributions from CiM-supported accesses, CiM-sensitive
benchmarking as well as the pros and cons of increased memory size for CiM. Eva-CiM also enables exploration
over different configurations and device technologies, showing 1.3-6.0X energy improvement
for SRAM and 2.0-7.9X for FeFET-RAM, respectively.
