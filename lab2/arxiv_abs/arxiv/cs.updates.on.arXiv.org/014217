We present new complexity results for several algorithms that approximately solve the regularized
optimal transport (OT) problem between two discrete probability measures with at most $n$ atoms.
First, we show that a greedy variant of the classical Sinkhorn algorithm, known as the \textit{Greenkhorn}
algorithm, achieves the complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2\varepsilon^{-2})$,
which improves the best known bound $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2\varepsilon^{-3})$. Notably,
this matches the best known complexity bound of the Sinkhorn algorithm and explains the superior
performance of the Greenkhorn algorithm in practice. Furthermore, we generalize an adaptive primal-dual
accelerated gradient descent (APDAGD) algorithm with mirror mapping $\phi$ and show that the resulting
\textit{adaptive primal-dual accelerated mirror descent} (APDAMD) algorithm achieves the complexity
bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2\sqrt{\delta}\varepsilon^{-1})$ where $\delta>0$
depends on $\phi$. We point out that an existing complexity bound for the APDAGD algorithm is not
valid in general using a simple counterexample and then establish the complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{5/2}\varepsilon^{-1})$
by exploiting the connection between the APDAMD and APDAGD algorithms. Moreover, we introduce
accelerated Sinkhorn and Greenkhorn algorithms that achieve the complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{7/3}\varepsilon^{-1})$,
which improves on the complexity bounds $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2\varepsilon^{-2})$ of
Sinkhorn and Greenkhorn algorithms in terms of $\varepsilon$. Experimental results on synthetic
and real datasets demonstrate the favorable performance of new algorithms in practice.
