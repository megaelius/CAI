Accurate localization of brain regions responsible for language and cognitive functions in Epilepsy
patients should be carefully determined prior to surgery. Electrocorticography (ECoG)-based
Real Time Functional Mapping (RTFM) has been shown to be a safer alternative to the electrical cortical
stimulation mapping (ESM), which is currently the clinical/gold standard. Conventional methods
for analyzing RTFM signals are based on statistical comparison of signal power at certain frequency
bands. Compared to gold standard (ESM), they have limited accuracies when assessing channel responses.
In this study, we address the accuracy limitation of the current RTFM signal estimation methods
by analyzing the full frequency spectrum of the signal and replacing signal power estimation methods
with machine learning algorithms, specifically random forest (RF), as a proof of concept. We train
RF with power spectral density of the time-series RTFM signal in supervised learning framework
where ground truth labels are obtained from the ESM. Results obtained from RTFM of six adult patients
in a strictly controlled experimental setup reveal the state of the art detection accuracy of $\approx
78\%$ for the language comprehension task, an improvement of $23\%$ over the conventional RTFM
estimation method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study exploring the use of machine
learning approaches for determining RTFM signal characteristics, and using the whole-frequency
band for better region localization. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of machine learning
based RTFM signal analysis method over the full spectrum to be a clinical routine in the near future.
