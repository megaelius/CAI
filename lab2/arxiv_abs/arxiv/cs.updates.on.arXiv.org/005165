Detecting whether a news article is fake or genuine is a crucial task in today's digital world where
it's easy to create and spread a misleading news article. This is especially true of news stories
shared on social media since they don't undergo any stringent journalistic checking associated
with main stream media. Given the inherent human tendency to share information with their social
connections at a mouse-click, fake news articles masquerading as real ones, tend to spread widely
and virally. The presence of echo chambers (people sharing same beliefs) in social networks, only
adds to this problem of wide-spread existence of fake news on social media. In this paper, we tackle
the problem of fake news detection from social media by exploiting the very presence of echo chambers
that exist within the social network of users to obtain an efficient and informative latent representation
of the news article. By modeling the echo-chambers as closely-connected communities within the
social network, we represent a news article as a 3-mode tensor of the structure - <News, User, Community>
and propose a tensor factorization based method to encode the news article in a latent embedding
space preserving the community structure. We also propose an extension of the above method, which
jointly models the community and content information of the news article through a coupled matrix-tensor
factorization framework. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our method for the task of
Fake News Detection over two real-world datasets. Further, we validate the generalization of the
resulting embeddings over two other auxiliary tasks, namely: \textbf{1)} News Cohort Analysis
and \textbf{2)} Collaborative News Recommendation. Our proposed method outperforms appropriate
baselines for both the tasks, establishing its generalization.
