The next frontier in communications is the telemanipulation of remote environments. Compared
to conventional network-based applications, telemanipulation poses widely different requirements,
which demand a significant redesign of conventional networking techniques as well as their performance
metrics. Telemanipulation along with a host of other applications requiring transportation under
extremely low latencies is termed as Tactile Internet (TI). To support TI, enormous advancements
are being made to improve network techniques. On the contrary, performance metrics have barely
garnered any research attention. The lack of metrics majorly impedes the overall progress of TI.
In this paper, we present our first step towards developing a quantitative metric for TI. We propose
a method that characterizes TI in an end-to-end fashion to obtain fine-grained performance in terms
of delay and precision. We take Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as the basis of our work and identify its
shortcomings for evaluating TI. To circumvent them, we build upon DTW and propose two new concepts:
Effective Time-Offset (ETO) and Effective Value-Offset (EVO). The primary strength of the proposed
concepts, together referred to as ETVO, lies in the fact that they can quantitatively characterize
the performance of any end-to-end TI system in a manner that is agnostic to underlying implementation
details. We present the mathematical framework involved in the design of ETVO. Through rigorous
experiments conducted on a realistic TI setup, we compare the performances of DTW and ETVO. Our findings
show that ETVO results in 62.5x less time noise for up to 34% increased RMSE compared to DTW.
