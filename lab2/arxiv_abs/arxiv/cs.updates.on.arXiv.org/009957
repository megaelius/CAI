Purpose: To develop and validate a deep learning model for automatic segmentation of geographic
atrophy (GA) in color fundus images (CFIs) and its application to study growth rate of GA. Participants:
409 CFIs of 238 eyes with GA from the Rotterdam Study (RS) and the Blue Mountain Eye Study (BMES) for
model development, and 5,379 CFIs of 625 eyes from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) for
analysis of GA growth rate. Methods: A deep learning model based on an ensemble of encoder-decoder
architectures was implemented and optimized for the segmentation of GA in CFIs. Four experienced
graders delineated GA in CFIs from RS and BMES. These manual delineations were used to evaluate the
segmentation model using 5-fold cross-validation. The model was further applied to CFIs from the
AREDS to study the growth rate of GA. Linear regression analysis was used to study associations between
structural biomarkers at baseline and GA growth rate. A general estimate of the progression of GA
area over time was made by combining growth rates of all eyes with GA from the AREDS set. Results: The
model obtained an average Dice coefficient of 0.72 $\pm$ 0.26 on the BMES and RS. An intraclass correlation
coefficient of 0.83 was reached between the automatically estimated GA area and the graders' consensus
measures. Eight automatically calculated structural biomarkers (area, filled area, convex area,
convex solidity, eccentricity, roundness, foveal involvement and perimeter) were significantly
associated with growth rate. Combining all growth rates indicated that GA area grows quadratically
up to an area of around 12 mm$^{2}$, after which growth rate stabilizes or decreases. Conclusion:
The presented deep learning model allowed for fully automatic and robust segmentation of GA in CFIs.
These segmentations can be used to extract structural characteristics of GA that predict its growth
rate.
