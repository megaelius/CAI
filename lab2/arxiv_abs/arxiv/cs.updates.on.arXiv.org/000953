Describing the dynamics of a city is a crucial step to both understanding the human activity in urban
environments and to planning and designing cities accordingly. Here we describe the collective
dynamics of New York City and surrounding areas as seen through the lens of Twitter usage. In particular,
we observe and quantify the patterns that emerge naturally from the hourly activities in different
areas of New York City, and discuss how they can be used to understand the urban areas. Using a dataset
that includes more than 6 million geolocated Twitter messages we construct a movie of the geographic
density of tweets. We observe the diurnal "heartbeat" of the NYC area. The largest scale dynamics
are the waking and sleeping cycle and commuting from residential communities to office areas in
Manhattan. Hourly dynamics reflect the interplay of commuting, work and leisure, including whether
people are preoccupied with other activities or actively using Twitter. Differences between weekday
and weekend dynamics point to changes in when people wake and sleep, and engage in social activities.
We show that by measuring the average distances to the heart of the city one can quantify the weekly
differences and the shift in behavior during weekends. We also identify locations and times of high
Twitter activity that occur because of specific activities. These include early morning high levels
of traffic as people arrive and wait at air transportation hubs, and on Sunday at the Meadowlands
Sports Complex and Statue of Liberty. We analyze the role of particular individuals where they have
large impacts on overall Twitter activity. Our analysis points to the opportunity to develop insight
into both geographic social dynamics and attention through social media analysis.
