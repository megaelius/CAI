This paper investigates the message complexity of distributed information spreading (a.k.a gossip
or token dissemination) in adversarial dynamic networks, where the goal is to spread $k$ tokens
of information to every node on an $n$-node network. We consider the amortized (average) message
complexity of spreading a token, assuming that the number of tokens is large. Our focus is on token-forwarding
algorithms, which do not manipulate tokens in any way other than storing, copying, and forwarding
them. We consider two types of adversaries that arbitrarily rewire the network while keeping it
connected: the adaptive adversary that is aware of the status of all the nodes and the algorithm (including
the current random choices), and the oblivious adversary that is oblivious to the random choices
made by the algorithm. The central question that motivates our work is whether one can achieve subquadratic
amortized message complexity for information spreading. We present two sets of results depending
on how nodes send messages to their neighbors: (1) Local broadcast: We show a tight lower bound of
$\Omega(n^2)$ on the number of amortized local broadcasts, which is matched by the naive flooding
algorithm, (2) Unicast: We study the message complexity as a function of the number of dynamic changes
in the network. To facilitate this, we introduce a natural complexity measure for analyzing dynamic
networks called adversary-competitive message complexity where the adversary pays a unit cost
for every topological change. Under this model, it is shown that if $k$ is sufficiently large, we
can obtain an optimal amortized message complexity of $O(n)$. We also present a randomized algorithm
that achieves subquadratic amortized message complexity when the number of tokens is not large
under an oblivious adversary.
