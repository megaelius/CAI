Road accidents are an important issue of our modern societies, responsible for millions of deaths
and injuries every year in the world. In Quebec only, in 2018, road accidents are responsible for
359 deaths and 33 thousands of injuries. In this paper, we show how one can leverage open datasets
of a city like Montreal, Canada, to create high-resolution accident prediction models, using big
data analytics. Compared to other studies in road accident prediction, we have a much higher prediction
resolution, i.e., our models predict the occurrence of an accident within an hour, on road segments
defined by intersections. Such models could be used in the context of road accident prevention,
but also to identify key factors that can lead to a road accident, and consequently, help elaborate
new policies. We tested various machine learning methods to deal with the severe class imbalance
inherent to accident prediction problems. In particular, we implemented the Balanced Random Forest
algorithm, a variant of the Random Forest machine learning algorithm in Apache Spark. Interestingly,
we found that in our case, Balanced Random Forest does not perform significantly better than Random
Forest. Experimental results show that 85% of road vehicle collisions are detected by our model
with a false positive rate of 13%. The examples identified as positive are likely to correspond to
high-risk situations. In addition, we identify the most important predictors of vehicle collisions
for the area of Montreal: the count of accidents on the same road segment during previous years, the
temperature, the day of the year, the hour and the visibility.
