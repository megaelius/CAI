The recent rise of cloud applications, representinglarge complex modern distributed services,
has made perfor-mance monitoring a major issue and a critical process for bothcloud providers and
cloud customers. Many different monitoringtechniques are used for such applications, from simply
measuringresource consumption, to application-specific measures whichinstrument the application
or platform, to analyzing messageexchanges. In all these cases, the information to be analyzed
islogged at the host nodes on which the application is deployed,and from there either analyzed on
site or forwarded to analyzingtools. Using new trends such as Software Defined Networking(SDN)
shows promise to move some of the logging functionalityinto the network as a lot of information can
be extracted frommessages exchanged between application components. This raisesthe potential
for the cloud infrastructure to provide aMonitoringas a Serviceto cloud applications in a transparent
manneravoiding software instrumentation and allowing for a moreflexible placement of logging
functionality. To better understandthe feasibility of this approach, this paper explores severalapproaches
how application monitoring can be integrated intoSDN. In particular, we combine port mirroring
with tunneling toenable message filtering and reformatting, and we propose a cus-tomized port
sniffing approach. We provide their implementationbased on OVS, analyze their advantages and
disadvantages, andprovide a comprehensive performance evaluation to understandthe trade-offs
and to show that moving application monitoringto the network is an attractive option.
