The purposes of the CoPaSul toolkit are (1) automatic prosodic annotation and (2) prosodic feature
extraction from syllable to utterance level. CoPaSul stands for contour-based, parametric, superpositional
intonation stylization. In this framework intonation is represented as a superposition of global
and local contours that are described parametrically in terms of polynomial coefficients. On the
global level (usually associated but not necessarily restricted to intonation phrases) the stylization
serves to represent register in terms of time-varying F0 level and range. On the local level (e.g.
accent groups), local contour shapes are described. From this parameterization several features
related to prosodic boundaries and prominence can be derived. Furthermore, by coefficient clustering
prosodic contour classes can be obtained in a bottom-up way. Next to the stylization-based feature
extraction also standard F0 and energy measures (e.g. mean and variance) as well as rhythmic aspects
can be calculated. At the current state automatic annotation comprises: segmentation into interpausal
chunks, syllable nucleus extraction, and unsupervised localization of prosodic phrase boundaries
and prominent syllables. F0 and partly also energy feature sets can be derived for: standard measurements
(as median and IQR), register in terms of F0 level and range, prosodic boundaries, local contour
shapes, bottom-up derived contour classes, Gestalt of accent groups in terms of their deviation
from higher level prosodic units, as well as for rhythmic aspects quantifying the relation between
F0 and energy contours and prosodic event rates.
