Online social networks are often subject to influence campaigns by malicious actors through the
use of automated accounts known as bots. We consider the problem of detecting bots in online social
networks and assessing their impact on the opinions of individuals. We begin by analyzing the behavior
of bots in social networks and identify that they exhibit heterophily, meaning they interact with
humans more than other bots. We use this property to develop a detection algorithm based on the Ising
model from statistical physics. The bots are identified by solving a minimum cut problem. We show
that this Ising model algorithm can identify bots with higher accuracy while utilizing much less
data than other state of the art methods. We then develop a a function we call generalized harmonic
influence centrality to estimate the impact bots have on the opinions of users in social networks.
This function is based on a generalized opinion dynamics model and captures how the activity level
and network connectivity of the bots shift equilibrium opinions. To apply generalized harmonic
influence centrality to real social networks, we develop a deep neural network to measure the opinions
of users based on their social network posts. Using this neural network, we then calculate the generalized
harmonic influence centrality of bots in multiple real social networks. For some networks we find
that a limited number of bots can cause non-trivial shifts in the population opinions. In other networks,
we find that the bots have little impact. Overall we find that generalized harmonic influence centrality
is a useful operational tool to measure the impact of bots in social networks.
