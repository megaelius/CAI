We consider the problem of modeling competitive diffusion in real world social networks via the
notion of ChoiceGAPs which combine choice logic programs due to Sacca` and Zaniolo and Generalized
Annotated Programs due to Kifer and Subrahmanian. We assume that each vertex in a social network
is a player in a multi-player game (with a huge number of players) - the choice part of the ChoiceGAPs
describe utilities of players for acting in various ways based on utilities of their neighbors in
those and other situations. We define multi-player Nash equilibrium for such programs - but because
they require some conditions that are hard to satisfy in the real world, we introduce a new model-theoretic
concept of strong equilibrium. We show that stable equilibria can capture all Nash equilibria.
We prove a host of complexity (intractability) results for checking existence of strong equilibria
(as well as related counting complexity results), together with algorithms to find them. We then
identify a class of ChoiceGAPs for which stable equilibria can be polynomially computed. We develop
algorithms for computing these equilibria under various restrictions. We come up with the important
concept of an estimation query which can compute quantities w.r.t. a given strong equilibrium,
and approximate ranges of values (answers) across the space of strong equilibria. Even though we
show that computing range answers to estimation queries exactly is intractable, we are able to identify
classes of estimation queries that can be answered in polynomial time. We report on experiments
we conducted with a real-world FaceBook data set surrounding the 2013 Italian election showing
that our algorithms have good predictive accuracy with an Area Under a ROC Curve that, on average,
is over 0.76.
