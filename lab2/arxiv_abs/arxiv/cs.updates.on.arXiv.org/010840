Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is an emerging engineering discipline which is concerned
with the analysis and prediction of equipment health and performance. One of the key challenges
in PHM is to accurately predict impending failures in the equipment. In recent years, solutions
for failure prediction have evolved from building complex physical models to the use of machine
learning algorithms that leverage the data generated by the equipment. However, failure prediction
problems pose a set of unique challenges that make direct application of traditional classification
and prediction algorithms impractical. These challenges include the highly imbalanced training
data, the extremely high cost of collecting more failure samples, and the complexity of the failure
patterns. Traditional oversampling techniques will not be able to capture such complexity and
accordingly result in overfitting the training data. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel algorithm for failure prediction using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN-FP).
GAN-FP first utilizes two GAN networks to simultaneously generate training samples and build an
inference network that can be used to predict failures for new samples. GAN-FP first adopts an infoGAN
to generate realistic failure and non-failure samples, and initialize the weights of the first
few layers of the inference network. The inference network is then tuned by optimizing a weighted
loss objective using only real failure and non-failure samples. The inference network is further
tuned using a second GAN whose purpose is to guarantee the consistency between the generated samples
and corresponding labels. GAN-FP can be used for other imbalanced classification problems as well.
