Deblurring is a fundamental inverse problem in bioimaging. It requires modelling the point spread
function (PSF), which captures the optical distortions entailed by the image formation process.
The PSF limits the spatial resolution attainable for a given microscope. However, recent applications
require a higher resolution, and have prompted the development of super-resolution techniques
to achieve sub-pixel accuracy. This requirement restricts the class of suitable PSF models to analog
ones. In addition, deblurring is computationally intensive, hence further requiring computationally
efficient models. A custom candidate fitting both requirements is the Gaussian model. However,
this model cannot capture the rich tail structures found in both theoretical and empirical PSFs.
In this paper, we aim at improving the reconstruction accuracy beyond the Gaussian model, while
preserving its computational efficiency. We introduce a new class of analog PSF models based on
Gaussian mixtures. The number of Gaussian kernels controls both the modelling accuracy and the
computational efficiency of the model: the lower the number of kernels, the lower accuracy and the
higher efficiency. To explore the accuracy--efficiency trade-off, we propose a variational formulation
of the PSF calibration problem, where a convex sparsity-inducing penalty on the number of Gaussian
kernels allows trading accuracy for efficiency. We derive an efficient algorithm based on a fully-split
formulation of alternating split Bregman. We assess our framework on synthetic and real data and
demonstrate a better reconstruction accuracy in both geometry and photometry in point source localisation---a
fundamental inverse problem in fluorescence microscopy.
