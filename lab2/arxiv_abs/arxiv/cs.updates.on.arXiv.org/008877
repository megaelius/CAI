Fault localization is a crucial step of automated program repair, because accurately identifying
program locations that are most closely implicated with a fault greatly affects the effectiveness
of the patching process. An ideal fault localization technique would provide precise information
while requiring moderate computational resources---to best support an efficient search for correct
fixes. In contrast, most automated program repair tools use standard fault localization techniques---which
are not tightly integrated with the overall program repair process, and hence deliver only subpar
efficiency. In this paper, we present retrospective fault localization: a novel fault localization
technique geared to the requirements of automated program repair. A key idea of retrospective fault
localization is to reuse the outcome of failed patch validation to support mutation-based dynamic
analysis---providing accurate fault localization information without incurring onerous computational
costs. We implemented retrospective fault localization in a tool called Restore---based on the
Jaid Java program repair system. Experiments involving faults from the Defects4J standard benchmark
indicate that retrospective fault localization can boost automated program repair: Restore efficiently
explores a large fix space, delivering state-of-the-art effectiveness (41 Defects4J bugs correctly
fixed, 7 more than any other automated repair tools for Java) while simultaneously boosting performance
(speedup over 3 compared to Jaid). Retrospective fault localization is applicable to any automated
program repair techniques that rely on fault localization and dynamic validation of patches.
