In the past two decades, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) have become increasingly advanced.
ECC, with much smaller key sizes, offers equivalent security when compared to other asymmetric
cryptosystems. In this survey, an comprehensive overview of hardware implementations of ECC is
provided. We first discuss different elliptic curves, point multiplication algorithms and underling
finite field operations over binary fields F2m and prime fields Fp which are used in the literature
for hardware implementation. Then methods, steps and considerations of ECC implementation are
presented. The implementations of the ECC are categorized in two main groups based on implementation
technologies consist of field programmable gate array (FPGA) based implementations and application
specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations. Therefore, in these categories to have a
better presentation and comparison, the implementations are presented and distinguished based
on type of finite fields. The best and newest structures in the literature are described in more details
for overall presentation of architectures and approaches in each group of implementations. High-speed
implementation is an important factor in the ECC applications such as network servers. Also in smart
cards, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags require
to low-cost and lightweight implementations. Therefore, implementation methods related to these
applications are explored. In addition, a classification of the previous works in terms of scalability,
flexibility, performance and cost effectiveness is provided. Finally, some words and techniques
about future works that should be considered are provided.
