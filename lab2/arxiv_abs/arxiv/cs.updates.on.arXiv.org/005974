Despite the importance of predicting evacuation mobility dynamics after large scale disasters
for effective first response and disaster relief, our general understanding of evacuation behavior
remains limited because of the lack of empirical evidence on the evacuation movement of individuals
across multiple disaster instances. Here we investigate the GPS trajectories of a total of more
than 1 million anonymized mobile phone users whose positions are tracked for a period of 2 months
before and after four of the major earthquakes that occurred in Japan. Through a cross comparative
analysis between the four disaster instances, we find that in contrast with the assumed complexity
of evacuation decision making mechanisms in crisis situations, the individuals' evacuation probability
is strongly dependent on the seismic intensity that they experience. In fact, we show that the evacuation
probabilities in all earthquakes collapse into a similar pattern, with a critical threshold at
around seismic intensity 5.5. This indicates that despite the diversity in the earthquakes profiles
and urban characteristics, evacuation behavior is similarly dependent on seismic intensity.
Moreover, we found that probability density functions of the distances that individuals evacuate
are not dependent on seismic intensities that individuals experience. These insights from empirical
analysis on evacuation from multiple earthquake instances using large scale mobility data contributes
to a deeper understanding of how people react to earthquakes, and can potentially assist decision
makers to simulate and predict the number of evacuees in urban areas with little computational time
and cost, by using population density information and seismic intensity which can be observed instantaneously
after the shock.
