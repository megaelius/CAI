Chromosome enumeration is an essential but tedious procedure in karyotyping analysis. To automate
the enumeration process, we develop a chromosome enumeration framework, DeepACEv2, based on the
region based object detection scheme. The framework is developed following three steps. Firstly,
we take the classical ResNet-101 as the backbone and attach the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to
the backbone. The FPN takes full advantage of the multiple level features, and we only output the
level of feature map that most of the chromosomes are assigned to. Secondly, we enhance the region
proposal network's ability by adding a newly proposed Hard Negative Anchors Sampling to extract
unapparent but essential information about highly confusing partial chromosomes. Next, to alleviate
serious occlusion problems, besides the traditional detection branch, we novelly introduce an
isolated Template Module branch to extract unique embeddings of each proposal by utilizing the
chromosome's geometric information. The embeddings are further incorporated into the No Maximum
Suppression (NMS) procedure to improve the detection of overlapping chromosomes. Finally, we
design a Truncated Normalized Repulsion Loss and add it to the loss function to avoid inaccurate
localization caused by occlusion. In the newly collected 1375 metaphase images that came from a
clinical laboratory, a series of ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed
module. Combining them, the proposed DeepACEv2 outperforms all the previous methods, yielding
the Whole Correct Ratio(WCR)(%) with respect to images as 71.39, and the Average Error Ratio(AER)(%)
with respect to chromosomes as about 1.17.
