We investigate the size complexity of proofs in $Res(s)$ -- an extension of Resolution working on
$s$-DNFs instead of clauses -- for families of contradictions given in the {\em unusual binary}
encoding. A motivation of our work is size lower bounds of refutations in Resolution for families
of contradictions in the usual unary encoding. Our main interest is the $k$-Clique Principle, whose
Resolution complexity is still unknown. Our main result is a $n^{\Omega(k)}$ lower bound for the
size of refutations of the binary $k$-Clique Principle in $Res(\lfloor \frac{1}{2}\log \log n\rfloor)$.
This improves the result of Lauria, Pudl\'ak et al. [24] who proved the lower bound for Resolution,
that is $Res(1)$. Our second lower bound proves that in $RES(s)$ for $s\leq \log^{\frac{1}{2-\epsilon}}(n)$,
the shortest proofs of the $BinPHP^m_n$, requires size $2^{n^{1-\delta}}$, for any $\delta>0$.
Furthermore we prove that $BinPHP^m_n$ can be refuted in size $2^{\Theta(n)}$ in treelike $Res(1)$,
contrasting with the unary case, where $PHP^m_n$ requires treelike $RES(1)$ \ refutations of size
$2^{\Omega(n \log n)}$ [9,16]. Furthermore we study under what conditions the complexity of refutations
in Resolution will not increase significantly (more than a polynomial factor) when shifting between
the unary encoding and the binary encoding. We show that this is true, from unary to binary, for propositional
encodings of principles expressible as a $\Pi_2$-formula and involving {\em total variable comparisons}.
We then show that this is true, from binary to unary, when one considers the \emph{functional unary
encoding}. Finally we prove that the binary encoding of the general Ordering principle $OP$ -- with
no total ordering constraints -- is polynomially provable in Resolution.
