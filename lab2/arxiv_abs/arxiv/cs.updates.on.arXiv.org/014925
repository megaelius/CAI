Advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), dynamic data driven application
systems (DDDAS), and hierarchical cloud-fog-edge computing paradigm provide opportunities
for enhancing multi-domain systems performance. As one example that represents multi-domain
scenario, a "fly-by-feel" system utilizes DDDAS framework to support autonomous operations and
improve maneuverability, safety and fuel efficiency. The DDDAS "fly-by-feel" avionics system
can enhance multi-domain coordination to support domain specific operations. However, conventional
enabling technologies rely on a centralized manner for data aggregation, sharing and security
policy enforcement, and it incurs critical issues related to bottleneck of performance, data provenance
and consistency. Inspired by the containerized microservices and blockchain technology, this
paper introduces BLEM, a hybrid BLockchain-Enabled secure Microservices fabric to support decentralized,
secure and efficient data fusion and multi-domain operations for avionics systems. Leveraging
the fine-granularity and loose-coupling features of the microservices architecture, multidomain
operations and security functionalities are decoupled into multiple containerized microservices.
A hybrid blockchain fabric based on two-level committee consensus protocols is proposed to enable
decentralized security architecture and support immutability, auditability and traceability
for data provenience in existing multi-domain avionics system. Our evaluation results show the
feasibility of the proposed BLEM mechanism to support decentralized security service and guarantee
immutability, auditability and traceability for data provenience across domain boundaries.
