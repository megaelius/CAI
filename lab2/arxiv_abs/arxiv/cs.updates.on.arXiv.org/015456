Developing products, services and vertical applications for the future digitized society in the
6G era requires a multidisciplinary approach and a re-definition of how we create, deliver and consume
network resources, data and services for both communications and sensing purposes. This development
will change and disrupt the traditional business models and ecosystem roles of digital service
providers, as well as open the market for key stakeholders in the 6G era like digital service operators,
cloud operators and resource brokers. White paper discusses unprecedented opportunities of enabling
and empowering multiple stakeholders to have a more active participation in the future 6G ecosystem
via novel sustainable open ecosystemic business models with flexible integration of long tail
services with tailored performance attributes. This research adopts a qualitative scenario planning
method and portrays three scenario themes resulting in a total of 12 scenarios for the futures of
the 6G business. By focusing on key trends, their interactions, and irreducible uncertainties,
scenario building generates perspectives for the futures within which alternative 6G business
strategies were developed and assessed for a traditional incumbent mobile network operator and
a novel 6G digital service provider stemming from redefined sustainable economics. Value-capture
in the 6G era requires understanding the dynamics of platforms and ecosystems. Results indicate
that, to reach some of the preferred futures, we should pay attention to the privacy and security
issues related to business and regulation needs; public/governmental, corporate, community
and user(s) perspectives to and aims of governance; ecosystem configuration related to users,
decentralized business models and platforms; user empowerment; and the role of location-specificity
of services.
