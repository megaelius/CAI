Background and Object: In China, body constitution is highly related to physiological and pathological
functions of human body and determines the tendency of the disease, which is of great importance
for treatment in clinical medicine. Tongue diagnosis, as a key part of Traditional Chinese Medicine
inspection, is an important way to recognize the type of constitution.In order to deploy tongue
image constitution recognition system on non-invasive mobile device to achieve fast, efficient
and accurate constitution recognition, an efficient method is required to deal with the challenge
of this kind of complex environment. Methods: In this work, we perform the tongue area detection,
tongue area calibration and constitution classification using methods which are based on deep
convolutional neural network. Subject to the variation of inconstant environmental condition,
the distribution of the picture is uneven, which has a bad effect on classification performance.
To solve this problem, we propose a method based on the complexity of individual instances to divide
dataset into two subsets and classify them separately, which is capable of improving classification
accuracy. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on three sizes
of tongue datasets, in which deep convolutional neural network method and traditional digital
image analysis method are respectively applied to extract features for tongue images. The proposed
method is combined with the base classifier Softmax, SVM, and DecisionTree respectively. Results:
As the experiments results shown, our proposed method improves the classification accuracy by
1.135% on average and achieves 59.99% constitution classification accuracy. Conclusions: Experimental
results on three datasets show that our proposed method can effectively improve the classification
accuracy of tongue constitution recognition.
