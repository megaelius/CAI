Nowadays, all major web browsers have a private browsing mode. However, the mode's benefits and
limitations are not particularly understood. Through the use of survey studies, prior work has
found that most users are either unaware of private browsing or do not use it. Further, those who do
use private browsing generally have misconceptions about what protection it provides. However,
prior work has not investigated \emph{why} users misunderstand the benefits and limitations of
private browsing. In this work, we do so by designing and conducting a three-part study: (1) an analytical
approach combining cognitive walkthrough and heuristic evaluation to inspect the user interface
of private mode in different browsers; (2) a qualitative, interview-based study to explore users'
mental models of private browsing and its security goals; (3) a participatory design study to investigate
why existing browser disclosures, the in-browser explanations of private browsing mode, do not
communicate the security goals of private browsing to users. Participants critiqued the browser
disclosures of three web browsers: Brave, Firefox, and Google Chrome, and then designed new ones.
We find that the user interface of private mode in different web browsers violates several well-established
design guidelines and heuristics. Further, most participants had incorrect mental models of private
browsing, influencing their understanding and usage of private mode. Additionally, we find that
existing browser disclosures are not only vague, but also misleading. None of the three studied
browser disclosures communicates or explains the primary security goal of private browsing. Drawing
from the results of our user study, we extract a set of design recommendations that we encourage browser
designers to validate, in order to design more effective and informative browser disclosures related
to private mode.
