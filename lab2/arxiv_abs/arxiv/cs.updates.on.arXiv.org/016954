With ongoing developments in digitalization and advances in the field of autonomous driving, on-demand
ride pooling is a mobility service with the potential to disrupt the urban mobility market. Nevertheless,
to apply this kind of service successfully efficient algorithms have to be implemented for effective
fleet management to exploit the benefits associated with this mobility service. Especially real
time computation of finding beneficial assignments is a problem not solved for large problem sizes
until today. In this study, we show the importance of using advanced algorithms by comparing a fast,
but simple insertion heuristic algorithm with a state-of-the-art multi-step matching algorithm.
We test the algorithms in various scenarios based on private vehicle trip OD-data for Munich, Germany.
Results indicate that in the tested scenarios by using the multi-step algorithm up to 8$\%$ additional
requests could be served while also 10$\%$ additional driven distance could be saved. However,
computational time for finding optimal assignments in the advanced algorithm exceeds real time
rather fast as problem size increases. Therefore, several aspects to reduce the computational
time by decreasing redundant checks of the advanced multi step algorithm are introduced. Finally,
a refined vehicle selection heuristic based on three rules is presented to furthermore reduce the
computational effort. In the tested scenarios this heuristic can speed up the most cost intensive
algorithm step by a factor of over 8, while keeping the number of served requests almost constant
and maintaining around 70$\%$ of the driven distance saved in the system. Considering all algorithm
steps, an overall speed up of 2.5 could be achieved.
