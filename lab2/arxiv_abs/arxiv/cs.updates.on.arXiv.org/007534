We present a principal-agent model of a one-shot, shallow, systems engineering process. The process
is one-shot in the sense that decisions are made during one time step and that they are final. The term
shallow refers to a one-layer hierarchy of the process. Specifically, we assume that the systems
engineer has already decomposed the problem in subsystems, and that each subsystem is assigned
to a different subsystem engineer. Each subsystem engineer works independently to maximize their
own expected payoff. The goal of the systems engineer is to maximize the system-level payoff by incentivizing
the subsystem engineers. We restrict our attention to requirement-based system-level payoffs,
i.e., the systems engineer makes a profit only if all the design requirements are met. We illustrate
the model using the design of an Earth-orbiting satellite system where the systems engineer determines
the optimum incentive structures and requirements for two subsystems: the propulsion subsystem
and the power subsystem. The model enables the analysis of a systems engineer's decisions about
optimal passed-down requirements and incentives for sub-system engineers under different levels
of task difficulty and associated costs. Sample results, for the case of risk-neutral systems and
subsystems engineers, show that it is not always in the best interest of the systems engineer to pass
down the true requirements. As expected, the model predicts that for small to moderate task uncertainties
the optimal requirements are higher than the true ones, effectively eliminating the probability
of failure for the systems engineer. In contrast, the model predicts that for large task uncertainties
the optimal requirements should be smaller than the true ones in order to lure the subsystem engineers
into participation.
