The dispersion problem on graphs asks $k\leq n$ robots placed initially arbitrarily on the nodes
of an $n$-node anonymous graph to reposition autonomously to reach a configuration in which each
robot is on a distinct node of the graph. This problem is of significant interest due to its relationship
to other fundamental robot coordination problems, such as exploration, scattering, load balancing
etc. In this paper, we consider dispersion in the {\em global communication} model where a robot
can communicate with any other robot in the graph (but the graph is unknown to robots). We provide
three novel deterministic algorithms, two for arbitrary graphs and one for arbitrary trees, in
a synchronous setting where all robots perform their actions in every time step. For arbitrary graphs,
our first algorithm is based on a DFS traversal and guarantees $O(\min(m,k\Delta))$ steps runtime
using $\Theta(\log (\max(k,\Delta)))$ bits at each robot, where $m$ is the number of edges and $\Delta$
is the maximum degree of the graph. The second algorithm for arbitrary graphs is based on a BFS traversal
and guarantees $O( \max(D,k) \Delta (D+\Delta))$ steps runtime using $O(\max(D,\Delta \log k))$
bits at each robot, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph. The algorithm for arbitrary trees is also
based on a BFS travesal and guarantees $O(D\max(D,k))$ steps runtime using $O(\max(D,\Delta \log
k))$ bits at each robot. Our results are significant improvements compared to the existing results
established in the {\em local communication} model where a robot can communication only with other
robots present at the same node. Particularly, the DFS-based algorithm is optimal for both memory
and time in constant-degree arbitrary graphs. The BFS-based algorithm for arbitrary trees is optimal
with respect to runtime when $k\leq O(D)$.
