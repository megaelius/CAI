Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire new skills much more quickly,
by leveraging prior experience to learn how to learn. However, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement
learning focuses on task distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used meta-reinforcement
learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a simulated robot as different tasks.
When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize
to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable faster
acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently
broad to enable generalization to new behaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated
benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct
robotic manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop algorithms that generalize
to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new, held-out tasks. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art
meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly,
while each task and its variations (e.g., with different object positions) can be learned with reasonable
success, these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple tasks at the same time, even with as few
as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis and open-source environments pave the way for future
research in multi-task learning and meta-learning that can enable meaningful generalization,
thereby unlocking the full potential of these methods.
