This paper proposes improved methods for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the equivalent
number of looks $L$. This parameter has a meaningful interpretation in the context of polarimetric
synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. Due to the presence of coherent illumination in their
processing, PolSAR systems generate images which present a granular noise called speckle. As a
potential solution for reducing such interference, the parameter $L$ controls the signal-noise
ratio. Thus, the proposal of efficient estimation methodologies for $L$ has been sought. To that
end, we consider firstly that a PolSAR image is well described by the scaled complex Wishart distribution.
In recent years, Anfinsen et al. derived and analyzed estimation methods based on the ML and on trace
statistical moments for obtaining the parameter $L$ of the unscaled version of such probability
law. This paper generalizes that approach. We present the second-order bias expression proposed
by Cox and Snell for the ML estimator of this parameter. Moreover, the formula of the profile likelihood
modified by Barndorff-Nielsen in terms of $L$ is discussed. Such derivations yield two new ML estimators
for the parameter $L$, which are compared to the estimators proposed by Anfinsen et al. The performance
of these estimators is assessed by means of Monte Carlo experiments, adopting three statistical
measures as comparison criterion: the mean square error, the bias, and the coefficient of variation.
Equivalently to the simulation study, an application to actual PolSAR data concludes that the proposed
estimators outperform all the others in homogeneous scenarios.
