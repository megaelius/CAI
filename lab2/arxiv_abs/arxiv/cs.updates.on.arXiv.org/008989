Next generation batteries based on lithium (Li) metal anodes have been plagued by the dendritic
electrodeposition of Li metal on the anode during cycling, resulting in short circuit and capacity
loss. Suppression of dendritic growth through the use of solid electrolytes has emerged as one of
the most promising strategies for enabling the use of Li metal anodes. We perform a computational
screening of over 12,000 inorganic solids based on their ability to suppress dendrite initiation
in contact with Li metal anode. Properties for mechanically isotropic and anisotropic interfaces
that can be used in stability criteria for determining the propensity of dendrite initiation are
usually obtained from computationally expensive first-principles methods. In order to obtain
a large dataset for screening, we use machine learning models to predict the mechanical properties
of several new solid electrolytes. We train a convolutional neural network on the shear and bulk
moduli purely on structural features of the material. We use AdaBoost, Lasso and Bayesian ridge
regression to train the elastic constants, where the choice of the model depended on the size of the
training data and the noise that it can handle. Our models give us direct interpretability by revealing
the dominant structural features affecting the elastic constants. The stiffness is found to increase
with a decrease in volume per atom, increase in minimum anion-anion separation, and increase in
sublattice (all but Li) packing fraction. Cross-validation/test performance suggests our models
generalize well. We predict over 20 mechanically anisotropic interfaces between Li metal and 6
solid electrolytes which can be used to suppress dendrite growth. Our screened candidates are generally
soft and highly anisotropic, and present opportunities for simultaneously obtaining dendrite
suppression and high ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes.
