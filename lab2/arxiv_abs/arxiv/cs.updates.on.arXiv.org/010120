This paper explores, by using suitable quantitative techniques, to what extent the intellectual
proximity among scholarly journals is also a proximity in terms of social communities gathered
around the journals. Three fields are considered: statistics, economics and information and library
sciences. Co-citation networks (CC) represent the intellectual proximity among journals. The
academic communities around the journals are represented by considering the networks of journals
generated by authors writing in more than one journal (interlocking authorship: IA), and the networks
generated by scholars sitting in the editorial board of more than one journal (interlocking editorship:
IE). For comparing the whole structure of the networks, the dissimilarity matrices are considered.
The CC, IE and IA networks appear to be correlated for the three fields. The strongest correlations
is between CC and IA for the three fields. Lower and similar correlations are obtained for CC and IE,
and for IE and IA. The CC, IE and IA networks are then partitioned in communities. Information and
library sciences is the field where communities are more easily detectable, while the most difficult
field is economics. The degrees of association among the detected communities show that they are
not independent. For all the fields, the strongest association is between CC and IA networks; the
minimum level of association is between IE and CC. Overall, these results indicate that the intellectual
proximity is also a proximity among authors and among editors of the journals. Thus, the three maps
of editorial power, intellectual proximity and authors communities tell similar stories.
