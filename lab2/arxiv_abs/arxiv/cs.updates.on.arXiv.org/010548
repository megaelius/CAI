With the growth of computer vision based applications and services, an explosive amount of images
have been uploaded to cloud servers which host such computer vision algorithms, usually in the form
of deep learning models. JPEG has been used as the {\em de facto} compression and encapsulation method
before one uploads the images, due to its wide adaptation. However, standard JPEG configuration
does not always perform well for compressing images that are to be processed by a deep learning model,
e.g., the standard quality level of JPEG leads to 50\% of size overhead (compared with the best quality
level selection) on ImageNet under the same inference accuracy in popular computer vision models
including InceptionNet, ResNet, etc. Knowing this, designing a better JPEG configuration for
online computer vision services is still extremely challenging: 1) Cloud-based computer vision
models are usually a black box to end-users; thus it is difficult to design JPEG configuration without
knowing their model structures. 2) JPEG configuration has to change when different users use it.
In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based JPEG configuration framework. In particular,
we design an agent that adaptively chooses the compression level according to the input image's
features and backend deep learning models. Then we train the agent in a reinforcement learning way
to adapt it for different deep learning cloud services that act as the {\em interactive training
environment} and feeding a reward with comprehensive consideration of accuracy and data size.
In our real-world evaluation on Amazon Rekognition, Face++ and Baidu Vision, our approach can reduce
the size of images by 1/2 -- 1/3 while the overall classification accuracy only decreases slightly.
