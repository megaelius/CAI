The real estate market is exposed to many fluctuations in prices because of existing correlations
with many variables, some of which cannot be controlled or might even be unknown. Housing prices
can increase rapidly (or in some cases, also drop very fast), yet the numerous listings available
online where houses are sold or rented are not likely to be updated that often. In some cases, individuals
interested in selling a house (or apartment) might include it in some online listing, and forget
about updating the price. In other cases, some individuals might be interested in deliberately
setting a price below the market price in order to sell the home faster, for various reasons. In this
paper, we aim at developing a machine learning application that identifies opportunities in the
real estate market in real time, i.e., houses that are listed with a price substantially below the
market price. This program can be useful for investors interested in the housing market. We have
focused in a use case considering real estate assets located in the Salamanca district in Madrid
(Spain) and listed in the most relevant Spanish online site for home sales and rentals. The application
is formally implemented as a regression problem that tries to estimate the market price of a house
given features retrieved from public online listings. For building this application, we have performed
a feature engineering stage in order to discover relevant features that allows for attaining a high
predictive performance. Several machine learning algorithms have been tested, including regression
trees, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and neural networks, identifying advantages
and handicaps of each of them.
