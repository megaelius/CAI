Under increasing economic and environmental pressure, airlines are constantly seeking new technologies
and optimizing flight operations to reduce fuel consumption. However, the current policy on fuel
loading, which has a significant impact on aircraft weight, leaves room for improvement. Excess
fuel is loaded by dispatchers and(or) pilots to ensure safety because of fuel consumption uncertainties,
primarily caused by flight time uncertainties, which cannot be predicted by current Flight Planning
Systems (FPS). In this paper, we develop a novel spatial weighted recurrent neural network model
to provide better flight time predictions by capturing air traffic information at a national scale
based on multiple data sources, including Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast, Meteorological
Airdrome Reports, and airline records. In this model, we adopt recurrent neural network layers
to extract spatiotemporal correlations between features utilizing the repetitive traffic patterns
and interacting elements in aviation traffic networks. A spatial weighted layer is introduced
to learn origin-destination (OD) specific features, and a two-step training procedure is introduced
to integrate individual OD models into one model for a national air traffic network. This model was
trained and tested using one year of historical data from real operations. Results show that our
model can provide a more accurate flight time predictions than the FPS and the LASSO methods, especially
for flights with extreme delays. We also show that with the improved flight time prediction, fuel
loading can be optimized to reduce fuel consumption by 0.83% for an example airline's fleet without
increasing the fuel depletion risk.
