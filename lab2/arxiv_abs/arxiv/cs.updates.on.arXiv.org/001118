Increasingly more people use computers and create content using keyboards (even with leading edge
touch-screen technology). As in the most part of the world, in Latvia also conventional "Qwerty"
keyboard is used. Though for Latvian it is much worse than for English, especially due to enormous
load to little fingers. It causes repetitive strain injuries and affects productivity of workers
with extensive keyboard usage, especially for data input operators, call centers, inquiry office
workers, etc. Improving computer keyboard layout decrease stress to hands and fingers thus minimizing
exhaustion and injuries. With analysis of English and Latvian public domain novels and modern texts,
letter appearance an sequence distribution for Latvian language was found. Qualities of alternative
layouts for English (Dvorak, Colemak, Hallinstad) were investigated and open source carpalx simulation
tool was adjusted according to the findings. Then carpalx was used to check more than 25 million keyboard
layouts, measuring finger/hand effort, stroke typing convenience etc., to find the best one. It
was proved that existing "\v{S}usildatec" (classic Latvian Ergonomic standard) keyboard is only
slightly better than "Qwerty" for Latvian, though it is much worse for English. After computer simulation,
several best layouts were tried practically for more than 6 months and most convenient one was promoted
as a new "Latvian Modern" keyboard. Its typing effort is less than for "\v{S}usildatec", load is
distributed according to finger strength, and typing strokes are alternating better between hands
and fingers. Comparing to "Qwerty" keyboard new layout is better not only for Latvian but for English
also. Keyboard drivers are developed for Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems and are
