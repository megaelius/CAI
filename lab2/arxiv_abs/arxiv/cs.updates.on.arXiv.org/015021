Deep learning-based scene text detection methods have progressed substantially over the past
years. However, there remain several problems to be solved. Generally, long curve text instances
tend to be fragmented because of the limited receptive field size of CNN. Besides, simple representations
using rectangle or quadrangle bounding boxes fall short when dealing with more challenging arbitrary-shaped
texts. In addition, the scale of text instances varies greatly which leads to the difficulty of accurate
prediction through a single segmentation network. To address these problems, we innovatively
propose a two-stage segmentation based arbitrary text detector named \textit{NASK} (\textbf{N}eed
\textbf{A} \textbf{S}econd loo\textbf{K}). Specifically, \textit{NASK} consists of a Text
Instance Segmentation network namely \textit{TIS} (\(1^{st}\) stage), a Text RoI Pooling module
and a Fiducial pOint eXpression module termed as \textit{FOX} (\(2^{nd}\) stage). Firstly, \textit{TIS}
conducts instance segmentation to obtain rectangle text proposals with a proposed Group Spatial
and Channel Attention module (\textit{GSCA}) to augment the feature expression. Then, Text RoI
Pooling transforms these rectangles to the fixed size. Finally, \textit{FOX} is introduced to
reconstruct text instances with a more tighter representation using the predicted geometrical
attributes including text center line, text line orientation, character scale and character orientation.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks including \textit{Total-Text} and \textit{SCUT-CTW1500}
have demonstrated that the proposed \textit{NASK} achieves state-of-the-art results.
