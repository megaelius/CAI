In this paper, we introduce some interesting features of a memristor CNN (Cellular Neural Network).
We first show that there is the similarity between the dynamics of memristors and neurons. That is,
some kind of flux-controlled memristors can not respond to the sinusoidal voltage source quickly,
namely, they can not switch `on' rapidly. Furthermore, these memristors have refractory period
after switch `on', which means that it can not respond to further sinusoidal inputs until the flux
is decreased. We next show that the memristor-coupled two-cell CNN can exhibit chaotic behavior.
In this system, the memristors switch `off' and `on' at irregular intervals, and the two cells are
connected when either or both of the memristors switches `on'. We then propose the modified CNN model,
which can hold a binary output image, even if all cells are disconnected and no signal is supplied
to the cell after a certain point of time. However, the modified CNN requires power to maintain the
output image, that is, it is volatile. We next propose a new memristor CNN model. It can also hold a
binary output state (image), even if all cells are disconnected, and no signal is supplied to the
cell, by memristor's switching behavior. Furthermore, even if we turn off the power of the system
during the computation, it can resume from the previous average output state, since the memristor
CNN has functions of both short-term (volatile) memory and long-term (non-volatile) memory. The
above suspend and resume feature are useful when we want to save the current state, and continue work
later from the previous state. Finally, we show that the memristor CNN can exhibit interesting two-dimensional
waves, if an inductor is connected to each memristor CNN cell.
