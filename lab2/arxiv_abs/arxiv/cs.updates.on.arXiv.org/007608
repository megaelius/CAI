3D objects, modeled using Computer Aided Geometric Design tools, are traditionally represented
using a boundary representation (B-rep), and typically use spline functions to parameterize these
boundary surfaces. However, recent development in physical analysis, in isogeometric analysis
(IGA) in specific, necessitates a volumetric parametrization of the interior of the object. IGA
is performed directly by integrating over the spline spaces of the volumetric spline representation
of the object. Typically, tensor-product B-spline trivariates are used to parameterize the volumetric
domain. A general 3D object, that can be modeled in contemporary B-rep CAD tools, is typically represented
using trimmed B-spline surfaces. In order to capture the generality of the contemporary B-rep modeling
space, while supporting IGA needs, Massarwi and Elber (2016) proposed the use of trimmed trivariates
volumetric elements. However, the use of trimmed geometry makes the integration process more difficult
since integration over trimmed B-spline basis functions is a highly challenging task. In this work,
we propose an algorithm that precisely decomposes a trimmed B-spline trivariate into a set of (singular
only on the boundary) tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that can be utilized to simplify the
integration process in IGA. The trimmed B-spline trivariate is first subdivided into a set of trimmed
B\'ezier trivariates, at all its internal knots. Then, each trimmed B\'ezier trivariate, is decomposed
into a set of mutually exclusive tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that precisely cover the
entire trimmed domain. This process, denoted untrimming, can be performed in either the Euclidean
space or the parametric space of the trivariate. We present examples on complex trimmed trivariates'
based geometry, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying IGA over the (untrimmed)
results.
