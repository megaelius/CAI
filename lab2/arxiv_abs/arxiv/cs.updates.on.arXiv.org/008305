Immunotherapy has recently shown important clinical successes in a substantial number of oncology
indications. Additionally, the tumor somatic mutation load has been shown to associate with response
to these therapeutic agents, and specific mutational signatures are hypothesized to improve this
association, including signatures related to pathogen insults. We sought to study in silico the
validity of these observations and how they relate to each other. We first addressed whether somatic
mutations typically involved in cancer may increase, in a statistically meaningful manner, the
similarity between common pathogens and the human exome. Our study shows that common mutagenic
processes increase, in the upper range of biologically plausible frequencies, the similarity
between cancer exomes and pathogen DNA at a scale of 12-16 nucleotide sequences and established
that this increased similarity is due to the specific mutation distribution of the considered mutagenic
processes. Next, we studied the impact of mutation rate and showed that increasing mutation rate
generally results in an increased similarity between the cancer exome and pathogen DNA, at a scale
of 4-5 amino acids. Finally, we investigated whether the considered mutational processes result
in amino-acid changes with functional relevance that are more likely to be immunogenic. We showed
that functional tolerance to mutagenic processes across species generally suggests more resilience
to mutagenic processes that are due to exposure to elements of nature than to mutagenic processes
that are due to exposure to cancer-causing artificial substances. These results support the idea
that recognition of pathogen sequences as well as differential functional tolerance to mutagenic
processes may play an important role in the immune recognition process involved in tumor infiltration
by lymphocytes.
