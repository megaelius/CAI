The notion of directed treewidth was introduced by Johnson, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas [Journal
of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, Vol 82, 2001] as a first step towards an algorithmic metatheory
for digraphs. They showed that some NP-complete properties such as Hamiltonicity can be decided
in polynomial time on digraphs of constant directed treewidth. Nevertheless, despite more than
one decade of intensive research, the list of hard combinatorial problems that are known to be solvable
in polynomial time when restricted to digraphs of constant directed treewidth has remained scarce.
In this work we enrich this list by providing for the first time an algorithmic metatheorem connecting
the monadic second order logic of graphs to directed treewidth. We show that most of the known positive
algorithmic results for digraphs of constant directed treewidth can be reformulated in terms of
our metatheorem. Additionally, we show how to use our metatheorem to provide polynomial time algorithms
for two classes of combinatorial problems that have not yet been studied in the context of directed
width measures. More precisely, for each fixed $k,w \in \mathbb{N}$, we show how to count in polynomial
time on digraphs of directed treewidth $w$, the number of minimum spanning strong subgraphs that
are the union of $k$ directed paths, and the number of maximal subgraphs that are the union of $k$ directed
paths and satisfy a given minor closed property. To prove our metatheorem we devise two technical
tools which we believe to be of independent interest. First, we introduce the notion of tree-zig-zag
number of a digraph, a new directed width measure that is at most a constant times directed treewidth.
Second, we introduce the notion of $z$-saturated tree slice language, a new formalism for the specification
and manipulation of infinite sets of digraphs.
