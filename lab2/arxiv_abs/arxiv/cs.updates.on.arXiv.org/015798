Touristic cities will suffer from COVID-19 emergency because of its economic impact on their communities.
The first emergency phases involved a wide closure of such areas to support "social distancing"
measures (i.e. travels limitation; lockdown of (over)crowd-prone activities). In the second
phase, individual's risk-mitigation strategies (facial masks) could be properly linked to "social
distancing" to ensure re-opening touristic cities to visitors. Simulation tools could support
the effectiveness evaluation of risk-mitigation measures to look for an economic and social optimum
for activities restarting. This work modifies an existing Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus
spreading in touristic areas, including tourists and residents' behaviours, movement and virus
effects on them according to a probabilistic approach. Consolidated proximity-based and exposure-time-based
contagion spreading rules are included according to international health organizations and previous
calibration through experimental data. Effects of tourists' capacity (as "social distancing"-based
measure) and other strategies (i.e. facial mask implementation) are evaluated depending on virus-related
conditions (i.e. initial infector percentages). An idealized scenario representing a significant
case study has been analysed to demonstrate the tool capabilities and compare the effectiveness
of those solutions. Results show that "social distancing" seems to be more effective at the highest
infectors' rates, although represents an extreme measure with important economic effects. This
measure loses its full effectiveness (on the community) as the infectors' rate decreases and individuals'
protection measures become predominant (facial masks). The model could be integrated to consider
other recurring issues on tourist-related fruition and schedule of urban spaces and facilities
(e.g. cultural/leisure buildings).
