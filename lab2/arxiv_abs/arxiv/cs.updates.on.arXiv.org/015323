For decades, two-player (antagonistic) games on graphs have been a framework of choice for many
important problems in theoretical computer science. A notorious one is controller synthesis,
which can be rephrased through the game-theoretic metaphor as the quest for a winning strategy of
the system in a game against its antagonistic environment. Depending on the specification, optimal
strategies might be simple or quite complex, for example having to use (possibly infinite) memory.
Hence, research strives to understand which settings allow for simple strategies. In 2005, Gimbert
and Zielonka provided a complete characterization of preference relations (a formal framework
to model specifications and game objectives) that admit memoryless optimal strategies for both
players. In the last fifteen years however, practical applications have driven the community toward
games with complex or multiple objectives, where memory -- finite or infinite -- is almost always
required. Despite much effort, the exact frontiers of the class of preference relations that admit
finite-memory optimal strategies still elude us. In this work, we establish a complete characterization
of preference relations that admit optimal strategies using arena-independent finite memory,
generalizing the work of Gimbert and Zielonka to the finite-memory case. We also prove an equivalent
to their celebrated corollary of great practical interest: if both players have optimal (arena-independent-)finite-memory
strategies in all one-player games, then it is also the case in all two-player games. Finally, we
pinpoint the boundaries of our results with regard to the literature: our work completely covers
the case of arena-independent memory (e.g., multiple parity objectives, lower- and upper-bounded
energy objectives), and paves the way to the arena-dependent case (e.g., multiple lower-bounded
energy objectives).
