We study mechanism design for combinatorial cost sharing. Imagine that multiple items or services
are available to be shared among a set of interested agents. The outcome of a mechanism in this setting
consists of an assignment, determining for each item the set of players who are granted service,
together with respective payments. Although there are several works studying specialized versions
of such problems, there has been almost no progress for general combinatorial cost sharing domains
until recently \cite{DobzinskiO17}. The main goal of our work is to further understand this interplay
in terms of budget balance and social cost approximation. Towards this, we provide a refinement
of cross-monotonicity (trace-monotonicity) that is applicable to iterative mechanisms. The
trace here refers to the order in which players become finalized. On top of this, we also provide two
parameterizations of cost functions which capture the behavior of their average cost-shares.
Based on our trace-monotonicity property, we design a scheme of ascending cost sharing mechanisms
which is applicable to the combinatorial cost sharing setting with symmetric submodular valuations.
Using our first cost function parameterization, we identify conditions under which our mechanism
is weakly group-strategyproof, $O(1)$-budget-balanced and $O(H_n)$-approximate with respect
to the social cost. Finally, we consider general valuation functions and exploit our second parameterization
to derive a more fine-grained analysis of the Sequential Mechanism introduced by Moulin. This mechanism
is budget balanced by construction, but in general only guarantees a poor social cost approximation
of $n$. We identify conditions under which the mechanism achieves improved social cost approximation
guarantees.
