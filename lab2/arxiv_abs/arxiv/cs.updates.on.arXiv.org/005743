Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an important new class of users in the fifth generation
(5G) and beyond 5G cellular networks. In particular, there are emerging UAV applications such as
aerial photograph and data relaying that require high-speed communications between the UAVs and
the ground base stations (GBSs). Due to the high UAV altitude, the strong line-of-sight (LoS) links
generally dominate the channels between the UAVs and GBSs, which brings both opportunities and
challenges in the design of future wireless networks supporting both terrestrial and aerial users.
Although each UAV can associate with more GBSs for communication as compared to terrestrial users
thanks to the LoS-dominant channels, it also causes/suffers more severe interference to/from
the terrestrial communications in the uplink/downlink. This paper studies the uplink communication
from a multi-antenna UAV to a set of GBSs within its signal coverage by considering a practical yet
challenging scenario when the number of antennas at the UAV is smaller than that of co-channel GBSs.
To achieve high-rate transmission yet avoid interfering with any of the existing terrestrial communications
at the co-channel GBSs, we propose a novel multi-beam transmission strategy by exploiting the non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) technique. Specifically, the UAV sends each data stream to a selected subset
of the GBSs, which can decode the UAV's signals and then cancel them before decoding the messages
of their served terrestrial users, and in the meanwhile nulls its interference at the other GBSs
via zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming. To draw essential insight, we first characterize in closed-form
the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) under the proposed strategy. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm
to maximize the UAV's transmit rate subject to the interference avoidance constraints for protecting
the terrestrial users.
