Fast data acquisition in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is vastly in demand and scan time directly
depends on the number of acquired k-space samples. Recently, the deep learning-based MRI reconstruction
techniques were suggested to accelerate MR image acquisition. The most common issues in any deep
learning-based MRI reconstruction approaches are generalizability and transferability. For
different MRI scanner configurations using these approaches, the network must be trained from
scratch every time with new training dataset, acquired under new configurations, to be able to provide
good reconstruction performance. Here, we propose a new generalized parallel imaging method based
on deep neural networks called NLDpMRI to reduce any structured aliasing ambiguities related to
the different k-space undersampling patterns for accelerated data acquisition. Two loss functions
including non-regularized and regularized are proposed for parallel MRI reconstruction using
deep network optimization and we reconstruct MR images by optimizing the proposed loss functions
over the network parameters. Unlike any deep learning-based MRI reconstruction approaches, our
method doesn't include any training step that the network learns from a large number of training
samples and it only needs the single undersampled multi-coil k-space data for reconstruction.
Also, the proposed method can handle k-space data with different undersampling patterns, and the
different number of coils. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the
current state-of-the-art GRAPPA method and the deep learning-based variational network method.
