Recently, cache-enabled heterogeneous cellular networks (C-HetNets) have been emerged as a promising
solution for next-generation wireless networks to cope with exponentially increasing demands
for high data rate and low latency multimedia services. In this paper, we design both the caching
and the delivery policies in the downlink of an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based
C-HetNet which operates in two phases: caching phase and delivery phase. In the caching phase, we
propose novel transmission-aware caching policies by coupling the cache placement strategy and
physical-layer transmission to exploit the benefits of flexible physical transmission opportunities
for access and backhaul links, simultaneously. We specifically apply a joint optimization of cache
placement and ergodic radio resource allocation for both the access and backhaul links to extend
the flexibility of the cache placement strategies and cover each time period of the delivery phase.
Since most of the current research efforts in cache-assisted wireless networks neglected the fair
treatment of mobile users (MUs), in this work, we propose two schemes called proportional fairness
and min-max fairness schemes. In the proportional fairness scheme, we minimize the total weighted
latency of MUs while in the min-max fairness scheme, we minimize the maximal latency of MUs in each
cell. In numerical assessments, we investigate the effect of the proposed fairness and transmission-aware
caching policies compared to the conventional proactive caching strategies which are only based
on the contents popularity and storage capacities.
