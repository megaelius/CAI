Random (dv,dc)-regular LDPC codes are well-known to achieve the Shannon capacity of the binary
symmetric channel (for sufficiently large dv and dc) under exponential time decoding. However,
polynomial time algorithms are only known to correct a much smaller fraction of errors. One of the
most powerful polynomial-time algorithms with a formal analysis is the LP decoding algorithm of
Feldman et al. which is known to correct an Omega(1/dc) fraction of errors. In this work, we show that
fairly powerful extensions of LP decoding, based on the Sherali-Adams and Lasserre hierarchies,
fail to correct much more errors than the basic LP-decoder. In particular, we show that: 1) For any
values of dv and dc, a linear number of rounds of the Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy cannot correct more
than an O(1/dc) fraction of errors on a random (dv,dc)-regular LDPC code. 2) For any value of dv and
infinitely many values of dc, a linear number of rounds of the Lasserre SDP hierarchy cannot correct
more than an O(1/dc) fraction of errors on a random (dv,dc)-regular LDPC code. Our proofs use a new
stretching and collapsing technique that allows us to leverage recent progress in the study of the
limitations of LP/SDP hierarchies for Maximum Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Max-CSPs).
The problem then reduces to the construction of special balanced pairwise independent distributions
for Sherali-Adams and special cosets of balanced pairwise independent subgroups for Lasserre.
Some of our techniques are more generally applicable to a large class of Boolean CSPs called Min-Ones.
In particular, for k-Hypergraph Vertex Cover, we obtain an improved integrality gap of $k-1-\epsilon$
that holds after a \emph{linear} number of rounds of the Lasserre hierarchy, for any k = q+1 with q
an arbitrary prime power. The best previous gap for a linear number of rounds was equal to $2-\epsilon$
and due to Schoenebeck.
