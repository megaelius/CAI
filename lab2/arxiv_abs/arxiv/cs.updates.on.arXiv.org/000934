Interactive consistency is the problem in which n nodes, where up to t may be byzantine, each with
its own private value, run an algorithm that allows all non-faulty nodes to infer the values of each
other node. This problem is relevant to critical applications that rely on the combination of the
opinions of multiple peers to provide a service. Examples include monitoring a content source to
prevent equivocation or to track variability in the content provided, and reliable time-stamping
of events in state machine replication. Previous algorithms assume a synchronous system, where
one can make assumptions regarding message delivery delays and/or detection of absent messages.
Practical, real world systems are mainly asynchronous in nature, thus requiring a different approach.
In this paper, we present the first study on practical asynchronous interactive consistency. We
leverage the vast prior work on broadcast and byzantine consensus algorithms to design, implement
and evaluate a suite of algorithms, each with its own unique trade-off regarding processing overhead
and message complexity, that can be used to achieve interactive consistency in real distributed
systems. We provide a complete, open-source implementation of each proposed interactive consistency
algorithm by building a multi-layered stack of protocols that include several broadcast protocols,
as well as a binary and a multi-valued consensus protocol. Most of these protocols have been proposed,
but never been implemented and evaluated in a real system before. We analyze the performance of our
suite of algorithms empirically by engaging in both single instance and multiple parallel instances
of each alternative.
