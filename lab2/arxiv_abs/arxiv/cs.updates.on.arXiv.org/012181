Software developers use a variety of social media channels and tools in order to keep themselves
up to date, collaborate with other developers, and find projects to contribute to. Meetup is one
of such social media used by software developers to organize community gatherings. Liu et al. characterized
Meetup as an event-based social network (EBSN) which contains valuable offline social interactions
in addition to online interactions. Recently, Storey et al. found out that Meetup was one of the social
channels used by developers. We in this work investigate in detail the dynamics of Meetup groups
and events related to software development, which has not been done in any of the previous works.
First, we identified 6,317 Meetup groups related to software development and extracted 185,758
events organized by them. Then we took a statistically significant sample of 452 events on which
we performed open coding, based on which we were able to develop 9 categories of events (8 main categories
+ Others). Next, we did a popularity analysis of the categories of events and found that Talks by Domain
Experts, Hands-on Sessions, and Open Discussions are the most popular categories of events organized
by Meetup groups related to software development. Our findings show that more popular categories
are those where developers can learn and gain knowledge. On doing a diversity analysis of Meetup
groups we found 19.82% of the members on an average are female, which is a larger proportion as compared
to numbers reported in previous studies on other social media. From a broader software development
community point of view information from this new forum can be valuable to identify and understand
emerging topics and associations among them which can be helpful to identify future trends as well
as current best practices.
