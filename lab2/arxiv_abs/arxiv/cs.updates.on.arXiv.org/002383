This article proposes a comprehensive investigation of the automatic classification of functional
gait disorders based solely on ground reaction force (GRF) measurements. The aim of the study is
twofold: (1) to investigate the suitability of stateof-the-art GRF parameterization techniques
(representations) for the discrimination of functional gait disorders; and (2) to provide a first
performance baseline for the automated classification of functional gait disorders for a large-scale
dataset. The utilized database comprises GRF measurements from 279 patients with gait disorders
(GDs) and data from 161 healthy controls (N). Patients were manually classified into four classes
with different functional impairments associated with the "hip", "knee", "ankle", and "calcaneus".
Different parameterizations are investigated: GRF parameters, global principal component analysis
(PCA)-based representations and a combined representation applying PCA on GRF parameters. The
discriminative power of each parameterization for different classes is investigated by linear
discriminant analysis (LDA). Based on this analysis, two classification experiments are pursued:
(1) distinction between healthy and impaired gait (N vs. GD) and (2) multi-class classification
between healthy gait and all four GD classes. Experiments show promising results and reveal among
others that several factors, such as imbalanced class cardinalities and varying numbers of measurement
sessions per patient have a strong impact on the classification accuracy and therefore need to be
taken into account. The results represent a promising first step towards the automated classification
of gait disorders and a first performance baseline for future developments in this direction.
