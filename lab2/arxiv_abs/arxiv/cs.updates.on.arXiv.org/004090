The cohesive interactions between fine metal powder particles crucially influence their flow
behavior, which is in turn important to many powder-based manufacturing processes including emerging
methods for powder-based metal additive manufacturing (AM). The present work proposes a novel
modeling and characterization approach for micron-scale metal powders, with a special focus on
characteristics of importance to powder-bed AM. The model is based on the discrete element method
(DEM), and the considered particle-to-particle and particle-to-wall interactions involve frictional
contact, rolling resistance and cohesive forces. Special emphasis lies on the modeling of cohesion.
The proposed adhesion force law is defined by the pull-off force resulting from the surface energy
of powder particles in combination with a van-der-Waals force curve regularization. The model
is applied to predict the angle of repose (AOR) of exemplary spherical Ti-6Al-4V powders, and the
surface energy value underlying the adhesion force law is calibrated by fitting the corresponding
angle of repose values from numerical and experimental funnel tests. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, this is the first work providing an experimental estimate for the effective surface
energy of the considered class of metal powders. By this approach, an effective surface energy of
$0.1mJ/m^2$ is found for the investigated Ti-6Al-4V powder. This value is considerably lower than
typical experimental values for flat metal contact surfaces in the range of $30-50 mJ/m^2$, indicating
the crucial influence of factors such as surface roughness and chemical surface contamination
on fine metal powders. More importantly, the present study demonstrates that a neglect of the related
cohesive forces leads to a drastical underestimation of the AOR and, consequently, to an insufficient
representation of the bulk powder behavior.
