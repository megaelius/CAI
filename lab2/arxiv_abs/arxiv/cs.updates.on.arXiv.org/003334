Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is fast becoming the preferred method for protein structure
determination. Particle picking is a significant bottleneck in the solving of protein structures
from single particle cryoEM. Hand labeling sufficient numbers of particles can take months of effort
and current computationally based approaches are often ineffective. Here, we frame particle picking
as a positive-unlabeled classification problem in which we seek to learn a convolutional neural
network (CNN) to classify micrograph regions as particle or background from a small number of labeled
positive examples and many unlabeled examples. However, model fitting with very few labeled data
points is a challenging machine learning problem. To address this, we develop a novel objective
function, GE-binomial, for learning model parameters in this context. This objective uses a newly-formulated
generalized expectation criteria to learn effectively from unlabeled data when using minibatched
stochastic gradient descent optimizers. On a high-quality publicly available cryoEM dataset
and a difficult unpublished dataset supplied by the Shapiro lab, we show that CNNs trained with this
objective classify particles accurately with very few positive training examples and outperform
EMAN2's byRef method by a large margin even with fewer labeled training examples. Furthermore,
we show that incorporating an autoencoder improves generalization when very few labeled data points
are available. We also compare our GE-binomial method with other positive-unlabeled learning
methods never before applied to particle picking. We expect our particle picking tool, Topaz, based
on CNNs trained with GE-binomial, to be an essential component of single particle cryoEM analysis
and our GE-binomial objective function to be widely applicable to positive-unlabeled classification
problems.
