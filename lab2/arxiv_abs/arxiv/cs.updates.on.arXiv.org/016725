Events are occurrences in specific locations, time, and semantics that nontrivially impact either
our society or the nature, such as civil unrest, system failures, and epidemics. It is highly desirable
to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance in order to reduce the potential
social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively
challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth.
There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including
heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Most existing
event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though
the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different
domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different
domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This paper
aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations
of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing
techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques
and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization
and summary of major application domains are provided. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized
and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers,
and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions
for this promising and important domain are elucidated and discussed.
