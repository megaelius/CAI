The article presents a study using attacks such as a fake access point and a phishing page. The previous
publications on social engineering have been reviewed, statistics of break-ups are analyzed and
directions and mechanism of realization of attacks having elements of social engineering are analyzed.
The data from the research in three different places were collected and analyzed and the content
statistics were provided. For comparison, three categories of higher education institutions
were chosen: technical, humanitarian and mixed profiles. Since the research was conducted in educational
institutions during the week, most students in the experiment and graduate students took part in
the experiment. For each educational institution, a registration form template was created that
mimicked the design of the main pages. Examples of hardware and software implementation of a typical
stand for attack, data collection and analysis are given. In order to construct a test stand, widely
available components were chosen to show how easy it is to carry out attacks of this kind without significant
initial costs and special skills. The article provides statistics on the number of connections,
permission to use the address of the e-mail and password, as well as permission to automatically
transfer service data to the browser (cookies). The statistics are processed using specially written
algorithms. The proposed approaches to solving the problem of socio-technical attacks can be used
and implemented for operation on any objects of information activity. As a result of the experiments,
it is clear that the awareness of users of even technical specialties is not enough, so one needs to
pay particular attention to the development of methods for raising awareness of users and reducing
the number of potential attacks on objects of information activity.
