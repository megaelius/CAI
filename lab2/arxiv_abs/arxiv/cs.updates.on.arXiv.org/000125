The high bandwidth demand of Internet applications has recently driven the need of increasing the
residential download speed. A practical solution to the problem has been proposed aggregating
the bandwidth of 802.11 Access Points (APs) backhauls in range via 802.11 connections. Since 802.11
devices are usually single-radio, the communication to multiple APs on different radio-channels
requires the introduction of a time-division multiple access (TDMA) policy at the client station.
Current investigation in this area supposes that there is a sufficient number of TCP flows to saturate
the Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) behind the APs. However, this may be not guaranteed
according to the user traffic pattern. As a consequence, a TDMA policy introduces additional delays
in the end-to-end transmissions that will cause degradation of the TCP throughput and an under-utilization
of the AP backhauls. In this paper, we first perform an in-depth experimental analysis with a customized
802.11 driver of how the usage of multi-AP TDMA affects the observed Round-Trip-Time (RTT) of TCP
flows. Then, we introduce a simple analytical model that accurately predicts the TCP RTT when accessing
the wireless medium with a Multi-AP TDMA policy. Based on this model, we propose a resource allocation
algorithm that runs locally at the station and it greatly reduces the observed TCP RTT with a very
low computational cost. Our proposed scheme can improve up to 1:5 times the aggregate throughput
observed by the station compared to state-of-the-art multi-AP TDMA allocations. We also show that
the throughput performance of the algorithm is very close to the theoretical upper-bound in key
simulation scenarios.
