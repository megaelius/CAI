Handling change is an increasingly important challenge for software engineers. Our focus is on
changes caused by uncertainties in the operating conditions of a system, such as changes in the availability
of resources in a highly dynamic environment. To deal with such uncertainties, an external feedback
loop system can be added to the system that collects additional data during operation to resolve
the uncertainties and adapt the system to achieve particular quality requirements (i.e., adaptation
goals); this approach is commonly referred to as self-adaptation. To ensure that the system complies
with the adaptation goals, recent research suggests the use of formal techniques at runtime. Existing
approaches have three shortcomings that limit their practical applicability: (i) they ignore
correctness of the behavior of the feedback loop, (ii) they apply exhaustive verification at runtime
to select adaptation options to realize the adaptation goals, which is very resource demanding,
and (iii) they provide limited or no support for changing adaptation goals at runtime. To tackle
these shortcomings, we present ActivFORMS (Active FORmal Models for Self-adaptation). ActivFORMS:
(i) provides guarantees for the correct behavior of the feedback loop with respect to a set of correctness
properties at design time and preserves the guarantees at runtime by directly executing the verified
models of the feedback loop, (ii) guides the adaptation of the system by selecting adaptation options
that realize the adaptation goals in an efficient manner using statistical model checking at runtime,
and (iii) offers basic support for changing adaptation goals and updating verified models of the
feedback loop on-the-fly to meet the new goals. To validate ActivFORMS, we present a tool-supported
instance of the approach that we apply to an IoT application for building security monitoring deployed
in Leuven.
