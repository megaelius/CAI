Slender marine structures such as deep-water marine risers are subjected to currents and will normally
experience Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV), which can cause fast accumulation of fatigue damage.
The ocean current is often three-dimensional (3D), i.e., the direction and magnitude of the current
vary throughout the water column. Today, semi-empirical tools are used by the industry to predict
VIV induced fatigue on risers. The load model and hydrodynamic parameters in present VIV prediction
tools are developed based on two-dimensional (2D) flow conditions, as it is challenging to consider
the effect of 3D flow along the risers. Accordingly, the current profiles must be purposely made
2D during the design process, which leads to significant uncertainty in the prediction results.
Further, due to the limitations in the laboratory, VIV model tests are mostly carried out under 2D
flow conditions and thus little experimental data exist to document VIV response of riser subjected
to varying directions of the current. However, a few experiments have been conducted with 3D current.
We have used results from one of these experiments to investigate how well 1) traditional and 2) an
alternative method based on a data driven prediction can describe VIV in 3D currents. Data driven
modelling is particularly suited for complicated problems with many parameters and non-linear
relationships. We have applied a data clustering algorithm to the experimental 3D flow data in order
to identify measurable parameters that can influence responses. The riser responses are grouped
based on their statistical characteristics, which relate to the direction of the flow. Furthermore
we fit a random forest regression model to the measured VIV response and compare its performance
with the predictions of existing VIV prediction tools (VIVANA-FD).
