We propose ROI regularization (ROIreg) as a semi-supervised learning method for image classification.
ROIreg focuses on the maximum probability of a posterior probability distribution g(x) obtained
when inputting an unlabeled data sample x into a convolutional neural network (CNN). ROIreg divides
the pixel set of x into multiple blocks and evaluates, for each block, its contribution to the maximum
probability. A masked data sample x_ROI is generated by replacing blocks with relatively small
degrees of contribution with random images. Then, ROIreg trains CNN so that g(x_ROI ) does not change
as much as possible from g(x). Therefore, ROIreg can be said to refine the classification ability
of CNN more. On the other hand, Virtual Adverserial Training (VAT), which is an excellent semi-supervised
learning method, generates data sample x_VAT by perturbing x in the direction in which g(x) changes
most. Then, VAT trains CNN so that g(x_VAT ) does not change from g(x) as much as possible. Therefore,
VAT can be said to be a method to improve CNN's weakness. Thus, ROIreg and VAT have complementary training
effects. In fact, the combination of VAT and ROIreg improves the results obtained when using VAT
or ROIreg alone. This combination also improves the state-of-the-art on "SVHN with and without
data augmentation" and "CIFAR-10 without data augmentation". We also propose a method called ROI
augmentation (ROIaug) as a method to apply ROIreg to data augmentation in supervised learning.
However, the evaluation function used there is different from the standard cross-entropy. ROIaug
improves the performance of supervised learning for both SVHN and CIFAR-10. Finally, we investigate
the performance degradation of VAT and VAT+ROIreg when data samples not belonging to classification
classes are included in unlabeled data.
