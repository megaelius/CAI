For a set of $n$ points in the plane, this paper presents simple kinetic data structures (KDS's) for
solutions to some fundamental proximity problems, namely, the all nearest neighbors problem,
the closest pair problem, and the Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) problem. Also, the paper
introduces KDS's for maintenance of two well-studied sparse proximity graphs, the Yao graph and
the Semi-Yao graph. We use sparse graph representations, the Pie Delaunay graph and the Equilateral
Delaunay graph, to provide new solutions for the proximity problems. Then we design KDS's that efficiently
maintain these sparse graphs on a set of $n$ moving points, where the trajectory of each point is assumed
to be an algebraic function of constant maximum degree $s$. We use the kinetic Pie Delaunay graph
and the kinetic Equilateral Delaunay graph to create KDS's for maintenance of the Yao graph, the
Semi-Yao graph, all the nearest neighbors, the closest pair, and the EMST. Our KDS's use $O(n)$ space
and $O(n\log n)$ preprocessing time. We provide the first KDS's for maintenance of the Semi-Yao
graph and the Yao graph. Our KDS processes $O(n^2\beta_{2s+2}(n))$ (resp. $O(n^3\beta_{2s+2}^2(n)\log
n)$) events to maintain the Semi-Yao graph (resp. the Yao graph); each event can be processed in time
$O(\log n)$ in an amortized sense. Here, $\beta_s(n)$ is an extremely slow-growing function. Our
KDS for maintenance of all the nearest neighbors and the closest pair processes $O(n^2\beta^2_{2s+2}(n)\log
n)$ events. For maintenance of the EMST, our KDS processes $O(n^3\beta_{2s+2}^2(n)\log n)$ events.
For all three of these problems, each event can be handled in time $O(\log n)$ in an amortized sense.
We improve the previous randomized kinetic algorithm for maintenance of all the nearest neighbors
by Agarwal, Kaplan, and Sharir, and the previous EMST KDS by Rahmati and Zarei.
