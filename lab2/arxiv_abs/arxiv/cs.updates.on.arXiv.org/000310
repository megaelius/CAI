The modelling, analysis, and visualisation of dynamic geospatial phenomena has been identified
as a key developmental challenge for next-generation Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In
this context, the envisaged paradigmatic extensions to contemporary foundational GIS technology
raises fundamental questions concerning the ontological, formal representational, and (analytical)
computational methods that would underlie their spatial information theoretic underpinnings.
We present the conceptual overview and architecture for the development of high-level semantic
and qualitative analytical capabilities for dynamic geospatial domains. Building on formal methods
in the areas of commonsense reasoning, qualitative reasoning, spatial and temporal representation
and reasoning, reasoning about actions and change, and computational models of narrative, we identify
concrete theoretical and practical challenges that accrue in the context of formal reasoning about
`space, events, actions, and change'. With this as a basis, and within the backdrop of an illustrated
scenario involving the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban narratives, we address specific problems
and solutions techniques chiefly involving `qualitative abstraction', `data integration and
spatial consistency', and `practical geospatial abduction'. From a broad topical viewpoint,
we propose that next-generation dynamic GIS technology demands a transdisciplinary scientific
perspective that brings together Geography, Artificial Intelligence, and Cognitive Science.
