It is widely believed that one's peers influence product adoption behaviors. This relationship
has been linked to the number of signals a decision-maker receives in a social network, but it is unclear
if these same principles hold when the "pattern" by it receives these signals vary and when potential
decisions have different utilities. To investigate that, we manipulate social signal exposure
in an online controlled experiment with human participants. Each participant in the game makes
a decision among choices with differing utilities. We observe the following: (1) even in the presence
of monetary risks and previously acquired knowledge of the choices, decision-makers tend to deviate
from the obvious optimal decision when their peers make similar decision which we call the influence
decision, (2) when the quantity of social signals vary over time, the forwarding probability of
the influence decision and therefore being responsive to social influence does not necessarily
correlate proportionally to the absolute quantity of signals. To better understand how social
influence affects an individual's uncertainty which cannot always be observed in experiments
of decision making, we use our behavioral findings to simulate dynamics in real world case studies
through multi-agent models. We specifically try to measure the effect of the influence decision
towards suboptimal choice adoption in real world diffusion; in this case rumor spreading. Our simulation
results indicate that while sequential peer effects from the influence decision overcome individual
uncertainty to guide faster diffusion over time, the control that peer influence has over decision
making can itself be affected when influence is delayed and user uncertainty comes into play.
