The ability to predict patient-specific soft tissue deformations is key for computer-integrated
surgery systems and the core enabling technology for a new era of personalized medicine. Element-Free
Galerkin (EFG) methods are better suited for solving soft tissue deformation problems than the
finite element method (FEM) due to their capability of handling large deformation while also eliminating
the necessity of creating a complex predefined mesh. Nevertheless, meshless methods based on EFG
formulation, exhibit three major limitations: i) meshless shape functions using higher order
basis cannot always be computed for arbitrarily distributed nodes (irregular node placement is
crucial for facilitating automated discretization of complex geometries); ii) imposition of
the Essential Boundary Conditions (EBC) is not straightforward; and, iii) numerical (Gauss) integration
in space is not exact as meshless shape functions are not polynomial. This paper presents a suite
of Meshless Total Lagrangian Explicit Dynamics (MTLED) algorithms incorporating a Modified Moving
Least Squares (MMLS) method for interpolating scattered data both for visualization and for numerical
computations of soft tissue deformation, a novel way of imposing EBC for explicit time integration,
and an adaptive numerical integration procedure within the Meshless Total Lagrangian Explicit
Dynamics algorithm. The appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated
using comparisons with the established non-linear procedures from commercial finite element
software ABAQUS and experiments with very large deformations. To demonstrate the translational
benefits of MTLED we also present a realistic brain-shift computation.
