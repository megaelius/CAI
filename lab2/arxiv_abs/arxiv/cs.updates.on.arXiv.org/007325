Navantia, one of Europe's largest shipbuilders, is creating a fog computing-based Industrial
Cyber-Physical System (ICPS) for remote monitoring in real-time of their pipe workshops. Such
a monitoring process, which involves pipe traceability and tracking, is a unique industrial challenge,
given their metallic content, massive quantity and heterogeneous typology, as well as to the number
of complex processes involved. Pipe improved location, from production and through their lifetime,
can provide significant productivity and safety benefits to shipyards and foster innovative applications
in process planning. Bluetooth 5 represents a cost-effective opportunity to cope with this harsh
environment, since it has been significantly enhanced in terms of low power consumption, range,
speed and broadcasting capacity. Thus, this article proposes a Bluetooth 5 fog computing-based
ICPS architecture that is designed to support physically-distributed and low-latency Industry
4.0 applications that off-load network traffic and computational resource consumption from the
cloud. In order to validate the proposed ICPS design, one of Navantia's pipe workshops has been modeled
through an in-house-developed 3D ray launching radio planning simulator that considers three
main intrinsic characteristics: the number of pipes, the main working areas with their corresponding
machines, and the daily workforce. The radio propagation results obtained by the simulation tool
are validated through empirical measurements. These results aim to provide guidelines for ICPS
developers, network operators and planners to investigate further complex industrial deployments
based on Bluetooth 5.
