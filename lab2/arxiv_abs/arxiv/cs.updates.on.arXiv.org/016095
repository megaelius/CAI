We propose a new regularisation strategy within the classical ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI)
framework for estimating parameters in PDEs. The regularisation strategy consists of: (i) an adaptive
choice for the regularisation/inflation parameter in the update formula in EKI, and (ii) criteria
for the early stopping of the scheme. Our main contribution is the selection of the regularisation
parameter which, in contrast to existing approaches, it does not rely on further parameters which
often have severe effects on the efficiency of EKI. The proposed approach is aimed at providing EKI
with computational efficiency and robustness for addressing problems where the unknown is a heterogeneous
physical property with possibly sharp discontinuities arising from the presence of anomalies/defects.
In these settings, for EKI to produce accurate estimates of the truth, the unknown needs to be suitably
characterised via a parameterisation that often increases the complexity of the identification
problem. We show numerically that the proposed approach can produce efficient, robust and accurate
estimates under those challenging conditions which tend to require larger ensembles and more iterations
to converge. We test our framework using various parameterisations including one that combines
a truncated Whittle-Matern (WM) level-set function with other WM fields to characterise spatial
variability of the physical property on each region. We use these parameterisations to solve PDE-constrained
identification problems arising in (i) medical imaging where the aim is to detect the existence
and properties of diseased tissue and (ii) non-destructive testing (NDT) of materials from data
collected during manufacturing processes. We provide comparisons against a standard method and
demonstrate that the proposed method is viable choice to address computational efficiency of EKI
in practical/operational settings.
