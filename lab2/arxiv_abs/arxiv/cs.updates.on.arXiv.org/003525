The aetiology of polygenic obesity is multifactorial, which indicates that life-style and environmental
factors may influence multiples genes to aggravate this disorder. Several low-risk single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with BMI. However, identified loci only explain a small
proportion of the variation ob-served for this phenotype. The linear nature of genome wide association
studies (GWAS) used to identify associations between genetic variants and the phenotype have had
limited success in explaining the heritability variation of BMI and shown low predictive capacity
in classification studies. GWAS ignores the epistatic interactions that less significant variants
have on the phenotypic outcome. In this paper we utilise a novel deep learning-based methodology
to reduce the high dimensional space in GWAS and find epistatic interactions between SNPs for classification
purposes. SNPs were filtered based on the effects associations have with BMI. Since Bonferroni
adjustment for multiple testing is highly conservative, an important proportion of SNPs involved
in SNP-SNP interactions are ignored. Therefore, only SNPs with p-values < 1x10-2 were considered
for subsequent epistasis analysis using stacked auto encoders (SAE). This allows the nonlinearity
present in SNP-SNP interactions to be discovered through progressively smaller hidden layer units
and to initialise a multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) classifier. The classifier
is fine-tuned to classify extremely obese and non-obese individuals. The best results were obtained
with 2000 compressed units (SE=0.949153, SP=0.933014, Gini=0.949936, Lo-gloss=0.1956, AUC=0.97497
and MSE=0.054057). Using 50 compressed units it was possible to achieve (SE=0.785311, SP=0.799043,
Gini=0.703566, Logloss=0.476864, AUC=0.85178 and MSE=0.156315).
