A plane topological graph $G=(V,E)$ is a graph drawn in the plane whose vertices are points in the
plane and whose edges are simple curves that do not intersect, except at their endpoints. Given a
plane topological graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $C_G$ of parity constraints, in which every vertex has
assigned a parity constraint on its degree, either even or odd, we say that $G$ is \emph{topologically
augmentable} to meet $C_G$ if there exits a plane topological graph $H$ on the same set of vertices,
such that $G$ and $H$ are edge-disjoint and their union is a plane topological graph that meets all
parity constraints. In this paper, we prove that the problem of deciding if a plane topological graph
is topologically augmentable to meet parity constraints is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete, even if
the set of vertices that must change their parities is $V$ or the set of vertices with odd degree. In
particular, deciding if a plane topological graph can be augmented to a Eulerian plane topological
graph is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete. Analogous complexity results are obtained, when the augmentation
must be done by a plane topological perfect matching between the vertices not meeting their parities.
We extend these hardness results to planar graphs, when the augmented graph must be planar, and to
plane geometric graphs (plane topological graphs whose edges are straight-line segments). In
addition, when it is required that the augmentation is made by a plane geometric perfect matching
between the vertices not meeting their parities, we also prove that this augmentation problem is
$\mathcal{NP}$-complete for plane geometric trees and paths. For the particular family of maximal
outerplane graphs, we characterize maximal outerplane graphs that are topological augmentable
to satisfy a set of parity constraints.
