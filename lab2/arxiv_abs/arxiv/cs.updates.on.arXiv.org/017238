The dissemination of fake news intended to deceive people, influence public opinion and manipulate
social outcomes, has become a pressing problem on social media. Moreover, information sharing
on social media facilitates diffusion of viral information cascades. In this work, we focus on understanding
and leveraging diffusion dynamics of false and legitimate contents in order to facilitate network
interventions for fake news mitigation. We analyze real-world Twitter datasets comprising fake
and true news cascades, to understand differences in diffusion dynamics and user behaviours with
regards to fake and true contents. Based on the analysis, we model the diffusion as a mixture of Independent
Cascade models (MIC) with parameters $\theta_T, \theta_F$ over the social network graph; and derive
unsupervised inference techniques for parameter estimation of the diffusion mixture model from
observed, unlabeled cascades. Users influential in the propagation of true and fake contents are
identified using the inferred diffusion dynamics. Characteristics of the identified influential
users reveal positive correlation between influential users identified for fake news and their
relative appearance in fake news cascades. Identified influential users tend to be related to topics
of more viral information cascades than less viral ones; and identified fake news influential users
have relatively fewer counts of direct followers, compared to the true news influential users.
Intervention analysis on nodes and edges demonstrates capacity of the inferred diffusion dynamics
in supporting network interventions for mitigation.
