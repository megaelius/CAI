The concept of bounded highway dimension was developed to capture observed properties of the metrics
of road networks. We show that a metric with bounded highway dimension and a distinguished point
(the depot) can be embedded into a a graph of bounded treewidth in such a way that the distance between
$u$ and $v$ is preserved up to an additive error of $\epsilon$ times the distance from $u$ or $v$ to
the depot. We show that this theorem yields a PTAS for Bounded-Capacity Vehicle Routing in metrics
of bounded highway dimension. In this problem, the input specifies a depot and a set of client locations;
the output is a set of depot-to-depot tours, where each tour is responsible for visiting at most $Q$
client locations. Our PTAS can be extended to handle penalties for unvisited clients. We extend
this embedding in a case where there is a set $S$ of distinguished points. The treewidth depends on
$|S|$, and the distance between $u$ and $v$ is preserved up to an additive error of $\epsilon$ times
the distance from $u$ and $v$ to $S$. This embedding implies a PTAS for Multiple Depot Bounded-Capacity
Vehicle Routing: the tours can go from one depot to an other. The embedding also implies that, for
fixed $k$, there is a PTAS for $k$-Center in metrics of bounded highway dimension. In this problem,
the goal is to minimize $d$ such that there exist $k$ points (the centers) such that every point is
within distance $d$ of some center. Similarly, for fixed $k$, there is a PTAS for $k$-Median in metrics
of bounded highway dimension. In this problem, the goal is to minimize the sum of distances to the
$k$ centers.
