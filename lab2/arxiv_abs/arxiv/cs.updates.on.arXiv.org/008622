This work examines the expected computational cost to determine an approximate global minimum
of a class of cost functions characterized by the variance of coefficients. The cost function takes
$N$-dimensional binary states as arguments and has many local minima. Iterations in the order of
$2^N$ are required to determine an approximate global minimum using random search. This work analytically
and numerically demonstrates that the selection and crossover algorithm with random initialization
can reduce the required computational cost (i.e., number of iterations) for identifying an approximate
global minimum to the order of $\lambda^N$ with $\lambda$ less than 2. The two best solutions, referred
to as parents, are selected from a pool of randomly sampled states. Offspring generated by crossovers
of the parents' states are distributed with a mean cost lower than that of the original distribution
that generated the parents. It is revealed that in contrast to the mean, the variance of the cost of
the offspring is asymptotically the same as that of the original distribution. Consequently, sampling
from the offspring's distribution leads to a higher chance of determining an approximate global
minimum than sampling from the original distribution, thereby accelerating the global search.
This feature is distinct from the distribution obtained by a mixture of a large population of favorable
states, which leads to a lower variance of offspring. These findings demonstrate the advantage
of the crossover between two favorable states over a mixture of many favorable states for an efficient
determination of an approximate global minimum.
