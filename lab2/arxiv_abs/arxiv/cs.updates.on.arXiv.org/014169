Szilard's now-famous single-molecule engine was only the first of three constructions he introduced
in 1929 to resolve several paradoxes arising from Maxwell's demon. We analyze Szilard's remaining
two demon models. We show that the second one, though a markedly different implementation employing
a population of distinct molecular species and semi-permeable membranes, is informationally
and thermodynamically equivalent to an ideal gas of the single-molecule engines. Since it is a gas
of noninteracting particles one concludes, following Boyd and Crutchfield, that (i) it reduces
to a chaotic dynamical system---called the Szilard Map, a composite of three piecewise linear maps
that implement the thermodynamic transformations of measurement, control, and erasure; (ii)
its transitory functioning as an engine that converts disorganized heat energy to work is governed
by the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate; (iii) the demon's minimum necessary "intelligence" for
optimal functioning is given by the engine's statistical complexity, and (iv) its functioning
saturates thermodynamic bounds and so it is a minimal, optimal implementation. We show that Szilard's
third model is rather different and addresses the fundamental issue, raised by the first two, of
measurement in and by thermodynamic systems and entropy generation. Taken together, Szilard's
suite of constructions lays out a range of possible realizations of Maxwellian demons that anticipated
by almost two decades Shannon's and Wiener's concept of information as surprise and cybernetics'
notion of functional information. This, in turn, gives new insight into engineering implementations
of novel nanoscale information engines that leverage microscopic fluctuations and into the diversity
of thermodynamic mechanisms and intrinsic computation harnessed in physical, molecular, biochemical,
and biological systems.
