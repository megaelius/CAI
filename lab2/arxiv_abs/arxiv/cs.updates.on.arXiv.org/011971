We consider weighted tree automata (wta) over strong bimonoids and their initial algebra semantics
and their run semantics. There are wta for which these semantics are different; however, for bottom-up
deterministic wta and for wta over semirings, the difference vanishes. A wta is crisp-deterministic
if it is bottom-up deterministic and each transition is weighted by one of the unit elements of the
strong bimonoid. We prove that the class of weighted tree languages recognized by crisp-deterministic
wta is the same as the class of recognizable step mappings. Moreover, we investigate the following
two crisp-determinization problems: for a given wta ${\cal A}$, (a) is there a crisp-deterministic
wta which computes the initial algebra semantics of ${\cal A}$ and (b) is there a crisp-deterministic
wta which computes the run semantics of ${\cal A}$? We show that the finiteness of the Nerode algebra
${\cal N}({\cal A})$ of ${\cal A}$ implies a positive answer for (a), and that the finite order property
of ${\cal A}$ implies a positive answer for (b). We show a sufficient condition which guarantees
the finiteness of ${\cal N}({\cal A})$ and a sufficient condition which guarantees the finite order
property of ${\cal A}$. Also, we provide an algorithm for the construction of the crisp-deterministic
wta according to (a) if ${\cal N}({\cal A})$ is finite, and similarly for (b) if ${\cal A}$ has finite
order property. We prove that it is undecidable whether an arbitrary wta ${\cal A}$ is crisp-determinizable.
We also prove that both, the finiteness of ${\cal N}({\cal A})$ and the finite order property of ${\cal
A}$ are undecidable.
