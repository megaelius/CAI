Face alignment (or facial landmarking) is an important task in many face-related applications,
ranging from registration, tracking and animation to higher-level classification problems such
as face, expression or attribute recognition. While several solutions have been presented in the
literature for this task so far, reliably locating salient facial features across a wide range of
posses still remains challenging. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel method
for automatic facial landmark localization in 3D face data designed specifically to address appearance
variability caused by significant pose variations. Our method builds on recent cascaded-regression-based
methods to facial landmarking and uses a gating mechanism to incorporate multiple linear cascaded
regression models each trained for a limited range of poses into a single powerful landmarking model
capable of processing arbitrary posed input data. We develop two distinct approaches around the
proposed gating mechanism: i) the first uses a gated multiple ridge descent (GRID) mechanism in
conjunction with established (hand-crafted) HOG features for face alignment and achieves state-of-the-art
landmarking performance across a wide range of facial poses, ii) the second simultaneously learns
multiple-descent directions as well as binary features (SMUF) that are optimal for the alignment
tasks and in addition to competitive landmarking results also ensures extremely rapid processing.
We evaluate both approaches in rigorous experiments on several popular datasets of 3D face images,
i.e., the FRGCv2 and Bosphorus 3D Face datasets and image collections F and G from the University
of Notre Dame. The results of our evaluation show that both approaches are competitive in comparison
to the state-of-the-art, while exhibiting considerable robustness to pose variations.
