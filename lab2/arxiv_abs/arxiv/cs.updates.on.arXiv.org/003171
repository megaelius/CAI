With an increased interest in applications that require a clean background image, such as video
surveillance, object tracking, street view imaging and location-based services on web-based
maps, multiple algorithms have been developed to reconstruct a background image from cluttered
scenes. Traditionally, statistical measures and existing image quality techniques have been
applied for evaluating the quality of the reconstructed background images. Though these quality
assessment methods have been widely used in the past, their performance in evaluating the perceived
quality of the reconstructed background image has not been verified. In this work, we discuss the
shortcomings in existing metrics and propose a full reference Reconstructed Background image
Quality Index (RBQI) that combines color and structural information at multiple scales using a
probability summation model to predict the perceived quality in the reconstructed background
image given a reference image. To compare the performance of the proposed quality index with existing
image quality assessment measures, we construct two different datasets consisting of reconstructed
background images and corresponding subjective scores. The quality assessment measures are evaluated
by correlating their objective scores with human subjective ratings. The correlation results
show that the proposed RBQI outperforms all the existing approaches. Additionally, the constructed
datasets and the corresponding subjective scores provide a benchmark to evaluate the performance
of future metrics that are developed to evaluate the perceived quality of reconstructed background
images.
