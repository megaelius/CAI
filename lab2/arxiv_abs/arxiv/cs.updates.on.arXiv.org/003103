Robotic algorithms typically depend on various parameters, the choice of which significantly
affects the robot's performance. While an initial guess for the parameters may be obtained from
dynamic models of the robot, parameters are usually tuned manually on the real system to achieve
the best performance. Optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization, have been used
to automate this process. However, these methods may evaluate unsafe parameters during the optimization
process that lead to safety-critical system failures. Recently, a safe Bayesian optimization
algorithm, called SafeOpt, has been developed, which guarantees that the performance of the system
never falls below a critical value; that is, safety is defined based on the performance function.
However, coupling performance and safety is often not desirable in robotics. For example, high-gain
controllers might achieve low average tracking error (performance), but can overshoot and violate
input constraints. In this paper, we present a generalized algorithm that allows for multiple safety
constraints separate from the objective. Given an initial set of safe parameters, the algorithm
maximizes performance but only evaluates parameters that satisfy safety for all constraints with
high probability. To this end, it carefully explores the parameter space by exploiting regularity
assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process prior. Moreover, we show how context variables can be
used to safely transfer knowledge to new situations and tasks. We provide a theoretical analysis
and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables fast, automatic, and safe optimization of
tuning parameters in experiments on a quadrotor vehicle.
