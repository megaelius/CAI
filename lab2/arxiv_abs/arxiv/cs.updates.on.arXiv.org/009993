This document is one of the deliverable reports created for the ESCAPE project. ESCAPE stands for
Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather Prediction at Exascale. The project develops
world-class, extreme-scale computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather
prediction and future climate models. This is done by identifying weather & climate dwarfs which
are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit of the Berkeley dwarfs).
These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware architectures (single and multi-node)
and alternative algorithms are explored. Performance portability is addressed through the use
of domain specific languages. This deliverable contains the description of the characteristics
of the weather & climate dwarfs that form key functional components of prediction models in terms
of the science that they encapsulate and in terms of computational cost they impose on the forecast
production. The ESCAPE work flow between work packages centres on these dwarfs and hence their selection,
their performance assessment, code adaptation and optimization is crucial for the success of the
project. At this stage of ESCAPE, a selection of established and new dwarfs has been made, their documentation
been compiled and the software been made available on the software exchange platform. The selection
of dwarfs will be extended throughout the course of the project (see Deliverable D1.2). The current
selection includes the spectral transforms, the cloud microphysics scheme, two and three-dimensional
elliptic solvers, a bi-Fourier spectral transform, an interpolation needed for the semi-Lagrangian
advection scheme and a first version of the semi-Lagrangian advection scheme itself. This deliverable
includes their scientific description and the guidance for installation, execution and testing.
