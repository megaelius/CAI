Many IoT use cases involve constrained battery-powered devices offering services in a RESTful
manner to their communication partners. Such services may involve, e.g., costly computations
or actuator/sensor usage, which may have significant influence on the power consumption of the
service Providers. Remote attackers may excessively use those services in order to exhaust the
Providers' batteries, which is a form of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Previous work proposed
solutions based on lightweight symmetric authentication. These solutions scale poorly due to
requiring pre-shared keys and do not provide protection against compromised service Requesters.
In contrast, we consider more powerful attackers even capable of compromising legit Requesters.
We propose a method that combines attacker detection and throttling, conducted by a third trusted
Backend, with a lightweight authentication protocol. For attacker detection and throttling,
we propose a novel approach using rate limitation algorithms. In addition, we propose and formally
verify two authentication protocols suitable for different, widely used IoT network topologies.
Our protocols ensure service availability for benign Requesters even if Providers are under a battery
exhaustion attack. The protocols do neither require pre-shared keys between Requesters and Providers,
nor the usage of asymmetric cryptography and public key infrastructures on the Provider. This makes
our protocols suitable for a variety of IoT deployments involving constrained devices and constrained
networks. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method through a simulation and a proof of concept
implementation.
