Principal Component Regression (PCR) is a simple, but powerful and ubiquitously utilized method.
Its effectiveness is well established when the covariates exhibit low-rank structure. However,
its ability to handle settings with noisy, missing, and mixed-valued covariates is not understood
and remains an important open challenge. As the main contribution of this work we establish the robustness
of PCR in this respect and provide meaningful finite-sample analysis. In the process, we establish
that PCR is equivalent to performing Linear Regression after pre-processing the covariate matrix
via Hard Singular Value Thresholding (HSVT). That is, PCR is equivalent to the recently proposed
robust variant of the Synthetic Control method in the context of counterfactual analysis using
observational data. As an immediate consequence, we obtain finite-sample analysis of the Robust
Synthetic Control (RSC) estimator that was previously absent. As an important contribution to
the Synthetic Control literature, we establish that an (approximate) linear synthetic control
exists in the setting of a generalized factor model; traditionally, the existence of a synthetic
control needs to be assumed to exist as an axiom. We further discuss a surprising implication of the
robustness property of PCR with respect to noise, i.e., PCR can learn a good predictive model even
if the covariates are tactfully transformed to preserve differential privacy. Finally, this work
advances the state-of-the-art analysis for HSVT by establishing stronger guarantees with respect
to the $\ell_{2, \infty}$-norm rather than the Frobenius norm as is commonly done in the matrix estimation
literature, which may be of interest in its own right.
