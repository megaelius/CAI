In index coding, a server broadcasts multiple messages to their respective receivers, each with
some side information that can be utilized to reduce the amount of communication from the server.
Distributed index coding is an extension of index coding in which the messages are broadcast from
multiple servers, each storing different subsets of the messages. In this paper, the optimal tradeoff
among the message rates and the server broadcast rates, which is defined formally as the capacity
region, is studied for a general distributed index coding problem. Inner and outer bounds on the
capacity region are established that have matching sum-rates for all 218 non-isomorphic four-message
problems with equal link capacities for all the links from servers to receivers. The proposed inner
bound is built on a distributed composite coding scheme that outperforms the existing schemes by
incorporating more flexible decoding configurations and enhanced fractional rate allocations
into two-stage composite coding, a scheme that was originally introduced for centralized index
coding. The proposed outer bound is built on the polymatroidal axioms of entropy, as well as functional
dependences such as the $\rm{fd}$-separation introduced by the multi-server nature of the problem.
This outer bound utilizes general groupings of servers with different levels of granularity, which
allows a natural tradeoff between computational complexity and tightness of the bound, and includes
and improves upon all existing outer bounds for distributed index coding. Specific features of
the proposed inner and outer bounds are demonstrated through concrete examples with four or five
messages.
