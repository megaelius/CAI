Autonomous vehicular platoons will play an important role in improving on-road safety in tomorrow's
smart cities. Vehicles in an autonomous platoon can exploit vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications
to collect information, such as velocity and acceleration, from surrounding vehicles so as to maintain
the target velocity and inter-vehicle distance. However, due to the dynamic on-vehicle data processing
rate and the uncertainty of the wireless channel, V2V communications within a platoon will experience
a delay. Such delay can impair the vehicles' ability to stabilize the operation of the platoon. In
this paper, a novel framework is proposed to optimize a platoon's operation while jointly consider
the delay of the wireless network and the stability of the vehicle's control system. First, stability
analysis for the control system is performed and the maximum wireless system delay requirements
which can prevent the instability of the control system are derived. Then, delay analysis is conducted
to determine the end-to-end delay, including queuing, processing, and transmission delay for
the V2V link in the wireless network. Subsequently, using the derived delay, a lower bound and an
approximated expression of the reliability for the wireless system, defined as the probability
that the wireless system meets the control system's delay needs, are derived. Then, the control
parameters are optimized to maximize the derived wireless system reliability. Simulation results
corroborate the analytical derivations and study the impact of parameters, such as the platoon
size, on the reliability performance of the vehicular platoon. More importantly, the simulation
results disclose the benefits of integrating control system and wireless network design while
providing guidelines for designing autonomous platoons so as to realize the required wireless
network reliability and control system stability.
