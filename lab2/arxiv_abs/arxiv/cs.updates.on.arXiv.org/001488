Software companies that develop their products on a basis of service-oriented architecture (SOA)
can expect various improvements as a result of choreography. Current choreography practices,
however, are not yet used extensively in the embedded systems domain even though SOA is increasingly
used in this domain. The objective of this study is to identify current features of the use of choreography
in the embedded systems domain for practitioners and researchers by systematically analysing
current developments in the scientific literature, strategies for choreography adaption, choreography
specification and execution types, and implicit assumptions about choreography. To fulfil this
objective, a systematic literature review of scientific publications that focus on the use of choreography
in the embedded systems domain was carried out. After screening, 48 publications were selected
as primary studies and analysed using thematic synthesis. The main results of the study showed that
there are differences in how choreography is used in embedded and non-embedded systems domain.
In the embedded systems domain, it is used to capture the service interactions of a single organisation,
while, for example, in the enterprise systems domain it captures the service interactions among
multiple organisations. Additionally, the results indicate that the use of choreography can lead
to improvements in system performance and that the languages that are used for choreography modelling
in the embedded systems domain are insufficiently expressive to capture the complexities that
are typical in this domain. The study results facilitate the work of practitioners by allowing them
to make informed decisions about the applicability of choreography in their organisations.
