We consider an optimization problem in which a (single) bat aims to exploit the nectar in a set of $n$
cacti with the objective of maximizing the expected total amount of nectar it drinks. Each cactus
$i \in [n]$ is characterized by a parameter $r_{i} > 0$ that determines the rate in which nectar accumulates
in $i$. In every round, the bat can visit one cactus and drink all the nectar accumulated there since
its previous visit. Furthermore, competition with other bats, that may also visit some cacti and
drink their nectar, is modeled by means of a stochastic process in which cactus $i$ is emptied in each
round (independently) with probability $0 < s_i < 1$. Our attention is restricted to purely-stochastic
strategies that are characterized by a probability vector $(p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ determining the
probability $p_i$ that the bat visits cactus $i$ in each round. We prove that for every $\epsilon
> 0$, there exists a purely-stochastic strategy that approximates the optimal purely-stochastic
strategy to within a multiplicative factor of $1 + \epsilon$, while exploiting only a small core
of cacti. Specifically, we show that it suffices to include at most $\frac{2 (1 - \sigma)}{\epsilon
\cdot \sigma}$ cacti in the core, where $\sigma = \min_{i \in [n]} s_{i}$. We also show that this upper
bound on core size is asymptotically optimal as a core of a significantly smaller size cannot provide
a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation of the optimal purely-stochastic strategy. This means that when
the competition is more intense (i.e., $\sigma$ is larger), a strategy based on exploiting smaller
cores will be favorable.
