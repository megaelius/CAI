With the advent of dedicated Deep Learning (DL) accelerators and neuromorphic processors, new
opportunities are emerging for applying deep and Spiking Neural Network (SNN) algorithms to healthcare
and biomedical applications at the edge. This can facilitate the advancement of the medical Internet
of Things (IoT) systems and Point of Care (PoC) devices. In this paper, we provide a tutorial describing
how various technologies ranging from emerging memristive devices, to established Field Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and mature Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology can
be used to develop efficient DL accelerators to solve a wide variety of diagnostic, pattern recognition,
and signal processing problems in healthcare. Furthermore, we explore how spiking neuromorphic
processors can complement their DL counterparts for processing biomedical signals. After providing
the required background, we unify the sparsely distributed research on neural network and neuromorphic
hardware implementations as applied to the healthcare domain. In addition, we benchmark various
hardware platforms by performing a biomedical electromyography (EMG) signal processing task
and drawing comparisons among them in terms of inference delay and energy. Finally, we provide our
analysis of the field and share a perspective on the advantages, disadvantages, challenges, and
opportunities that different accelerators and neuromorphic processors introduce to healthcare
and biomedical domains. This paper can serve a large audience, ranging from nanoelectronics researchers,
to biomedical and healthcare practitioners in grasping the fundamental interplay between hardware,
algorithms, and clinical adoption of these tools, as we shed light on the future of deep networks
and spiking neuromorphic processing systems as proponents for driving biomedical circuits and
systems forward.
