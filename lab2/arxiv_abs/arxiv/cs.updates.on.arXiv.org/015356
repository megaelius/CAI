We investigate adaptive strategies to robustly and optimally control the COVID-19 pandemic via
social distancing measures based on the example of Germany. Our goal is to minimize the number of
fatalities over the course of two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored
model of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and validate our approach.
Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control policy can significantly decrease the number
of fatalities when compared to simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge.
In a more realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy that updates
the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a reliable performance, even when
applied to a validation model with deviant parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based
feedback policy using interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously
and safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are inaccurate and
the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social distancing. Our theoretical findings
support various recent studies by showing that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to
reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak, 2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the
number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of social distancing measures
on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social distancing measures early on is more effective
and cheaper in the long run than opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.
