Data assimilation plays a key role in large-scale atmospheric weather forecasting, where the state
of the physical system is estimated from model outputs and observations, and is then used as initial
condition to produce accurate future forecasts. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) provides a practical
implementation of the statistical solution of the data assimilation problem and has gained wide
popularity as. This success can be attributed to its simple formulation and ease of implementation.
EnKF is a Monte-Carlo algorithm that solves the data assimilation problem by sampling the probability
distributions involved in Bayes theorem. Because of this, all flavors of EnKF are fundamentally
prone to sampling errors when the ensemble size is small. In typical weather forecasting applications,
the model state space has dimension $10^{9}-10^{12}$, while the ensemble size typically ranges
between $30-100$ members. Sampling errors manifest themselves as long-range spurious correlations
and have been shown to cause filter divergence. To alleviate this effect covariance localization
dampens spurious correlations between state variables located at a large distance in the physical
space, via an empirical distance-dependent function. The quality of the resulting analysis and
forecast is greatly influenced by the choice of the localization function parameters, e.g., the
radius of influence. The localization radius is generally tuned empirically to yield desirable
results.This work, proposes two adaptive algorithms for covariance localization in the EnKF framework,
both based on a machine learning approach. The first algorithm adapts the localization radius in
time, while the second algorithm tunes the localization radius in both time and space. Numerical
experiments carried out with the Lorenz-96 model, and a quasi-geostrophic model, reveal the potential
of the proposed machine learning approaches.
