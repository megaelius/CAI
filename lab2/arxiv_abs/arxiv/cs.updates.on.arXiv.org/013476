Herb recommendation plays a crucial role in the therapeutic process of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM),
which aims to recommend a set of herbs to treat the symptoms of a patient. While several machine learning
methods have been developed for herb recommendation, they are limited in modeling only the interactions
between herbs and symptoms, and ignoring the intermediate process of syndrome induction. When
performing TCM diagnostics, an experienced doctor typically induces syndromes from the patient's
symptoms and then suggests herbs based on the induced syndromes. As such, we believe the induction
of syndromes, an overall description of the symptoms, is important for herb recommendation and
should be properly handled. However, due to the ambiguity and complexity of syndrome induction,
most prescriptions lack the explicit ground truth of syndromes. In this paper, we propose a new method
that takes the implicit syndrome induction process into account for herb recommendation. Given
a set of symptoms to treat, we aim to generate an overall syndrome representation by effectively
fusing the embeddings of all the symptoms in the set, to mimic how a doctor induces the syndromes.
Towards symptom embedding learning, we additionally construct a symptom-symptom graph from the
input prescriptions for capturing the relations between symptoms; we then build graph convolution
networks(GCNs) on both symptom-symptom and symptom-herb graphs to learn symptom embedding. Similarly,
we construct a herb-herb graph and build GCNs on both herb-herb and symptom-herb graphs to learn
herb embedding, which is finally interacted with the syndrome representation to predict the scores
of herbs. In this way, more comprehensive representations can be obtained. We conduct extensive
experiments on a public TCM dataset, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art
herb recommendation methods.
