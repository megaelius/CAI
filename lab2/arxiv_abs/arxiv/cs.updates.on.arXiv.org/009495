Over the last few decades, many distinct lines of research aimed at automating mathematics have
been developed, including computer algebra systems (CASs) for mathematical modelling, automated
theorem provers for first-order logic, SAT/SMT solvers aimed at program verification, and higher-order
proof assistants for checking mathematical proofs. More recently, some of these lines of research
have started to converge in complementary ways. One success story is the combination of SAT solvers
and CASs (SAT+CAS) aimed at resolving mathematical conjectures. Many conjectures in pure and applied
mathematics are not amenable to traditional proof methods. Instead, they are best addressed via
computational methods that involve very large combinatorial search spaces. SAT solvers are powerful
methods to search through such large combinatorial spaces---consequently, many problems from
a variety of mathematical domains have been reduced to SAT in an attempt to resolve them. However,
solvers traditionally lack deep repositories of mathematical domain knowledge that can be crucial
to pruning such large search spaces. By contrast, CASs are deep repositories of mathematical knowledge
but lack efficient general search capabilities. By combining the search power of SAT with the deep
mathematical knowledge in CASs we can solve many problems in mathematics that no other known methods
seem capable of solving. We demonstrate the success of the SAT+CAS paradigm by highlighting many
conjectures that have been disproven, verified, or partially verified using our tool MathCheck.
These successes indicate that the paradigm is positioned to become a standard method for solving
problems requiring both a significant amount of search and deep mathematical reasoning. For example,
the SAT+CAS paradigm has recently been used by Heule, Kauers, and Seidl to find many new algorithms
for $3\times3$ matrix multiplication.
