Background: Breast implants have been increasingly popular over the last 20 years. There have been
growing concerns with the risks of breast implants. Meanwhile, media phenomenon called "breast
implant illness" (BII) has emerged. Objective: To identify and summarize key attributes of BII
using social media data. Materials and Methods: We conducted social media data analysis to better
understand the symptoms, signs, etc., that are associated with BII using Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and topic modeling. We extracted mentions related to signs/symptoms, diseases/disorders
and medical procedures using the Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES).
Extracted mentions are mapped to standard medical concepts. We summarized mapped concepts to topics
using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Results: Our analysis identified topics related to toxicity,
cancer and mental health issues that are highly associated with breast implant illness. We also
identified pains and other disorders commonly associated with breast implant illness. Discussion:
Our analysis suggests that breast implant illness can possibly lead to serious health issues such
as autoimmune disorders, cancer, pain, fatigue. We also find that toxicity from silicone implants
and mental health concerns are some underlying factors in BII. Our study could inspire future work
to further study the suggested symptoms and factors of BII. Conclusion: Our analysis over social
media data identifies mentions such as rupture, infection, pain and fatigue that are considered
common self-reported issues among the public. Our analysis also shows that cancers, autoimmune
disorders and mental health problems are emerging concerns, albeit less studied for breast implants.
