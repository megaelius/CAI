Monitoring the dynamics of traffic in major corridors can provide invaluable insight for traffic
planning purposes. An important requirement for this monitoring is the availability of methods
to automatically detect major traffic events and to annotate the abundance of travel data. This
paper introduces a machine learning based approach for reliable detection and characterization
of highway traffic congestion events from hundreds of hours of traffic speed data. Indeed, the proposed
approach is a generic approach for detection of changes in any given time series, which is the wireless
traffic sensor data in the present study. The speed data is initially time-windowed by a ten-hour
long sliding window and fed into three Neural Networks that are used to detect the existence and duration
of congestion events (slowdowns) in each window. The sliding window captures each slowdown event
multiple times and results in increased confidence in congestion detection. The training and parameter
tuning are performed on 17,483 hours of data that includes 168 slowdown events. This data is collected
and labeled as part of the ongoing probe data validation studies at the Center for Advanced Transportation
Technologies (CATT) at the University of Maryland. The Neural networks are carefully trained to
reduce the chances of over-fitting to the training data. The experimental results show that this
approach is able to successfully detect most of the congestion events, while significantly outperforming
a heuristic rule-based approach. Moreover, the proposed approach is shown to be more accurate in
estimation of the start-time and end-time of the congestion events.
