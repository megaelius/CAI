The increasing use of multiple sensors requires more efficient methods to represent and classify
multi-dimensional data, since these applications produce a large amount of data, demanding modern
techniques for data processing. Considering these observations, we present in this paper a new
method for multi-dimensional data classification which relies on two premises: 1) multi-dimensional
data are usually represented by tensors, due to benefits from multilinear algebra and the established
tensor factorization methods; and 2) this kind of data can be described by a subspace lying within
a vector space. Subspace representation has been consistently employed for pattern-set recognition,
and its tensor representation counterpart is also available in the literature. However, traditional
methods do not employ discriminative information of the tensors, which degrades the classification
accuracy. In this scenario, generalized difference subspace (GDS) may provide an enhanced subspace
representation by reducing data redundancy and revealing discriminative structures. Since GDS
is not able to directly handle tensor data, we propose a new projection called n-mode GDS, which efficiently
handles tensor data. In addition, n-mode Fisher score is introduced as a class separability index
and an improved metric based on the geodesic distance is provided to measure the similarity between
tensor data. To confirm the advantages of the proposed method, we address the problem of representing
and classifying tensor data for gesture and action recognition. The experimental results have
shown that the proposed approach outperforms methods commonly used in the literature without adopting
pre-trained models or transfer learning.
