We study the stable marriage problem in the partial information setting where the agents, although
they have an underlying true strict linear order, are allowed to specify partial orders. Specifically,
we focus on the case where the agents are allowed to submit strict weak orders and we try to address
the following questions from the perspective of a market-designer: i) How can a designer generate
matchings that are robust? ii) What is the trade-off between the amount of missing information and
the "quality" of solution one can get? With the goal of resolving these questions through a simple
and prior-free approach, we suggest looking at matchings that minimize the maximum number of blocking
pairs with respect to all the possible underlying true orders as a measure of "quality", and subsequently
provide results on finding such matchings. In particular, we first restrict our attention to matchings
that have to be stable with respect to at least one of the completions and show that in this case arbitrarily
filling-in the missing information and computing the resulting stable matching can give a non-trivial
approximation factor for our problem in certain cases. We complement this result by showing that,
even under severe restrictions on the preferences of the agents, the factor obtained is asymptotically
tight in many cases. We then investigate a special case, where only agents on one side provide strict
weak orders and all the missing information is at the bottom of their preference orders, and show
that here the negative result mentioned above can be circumvented in order to get a much better approximation
factor; this result, too, is tight in many cases. Finally, we move away from the restriction mentioned
above and show a general hardness of approximation result and also discuss one possible approach
that can lead us to a near-tight approximation bound.
