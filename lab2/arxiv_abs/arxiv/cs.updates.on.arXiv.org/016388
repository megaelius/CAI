Versatile robotic caregivers could benefit millions of people worldwide, including older adults
and people with disabilities. Recent work has explored how robotic caregivers can learn to interact
with people through physics simulations, yet transferring what has been learned to real robots
remains challenging. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to help bridge the gap between simulations
and the real world. We present Assistive VR Gym (AVR Gym), which enables real people to interact with
virtual assistive robots. We also provide evidence that AVR Gym can help researchers improve the
performance of simulation-trained assistive robots with real people. Prior to AVR Gym, we trained
robot control policies (Original Policies) solely in simulation for four robotic caregiving tasks
(robot-assisted feeding, drinking, itch scratching, and bed bathing) with two simulated robots
(PR2 from Willow Garage and Jaco from Kinova). With AVR Gym, we developed Revised Policies based
on insights gained from testing the Original policies with real people. Through a formal study with
eight participants in AVR Gym, we found that the Original policies performed poorly, the Revised
policies performed significantly better, and that improvements to the biomechanical models used
to train the Revised policies resulted in simulated people that better match real participants.
Notably, participants significantly disagreed that the Original policies were successful at
assistance, but significantly agreed that the Revised policies were successful at assistance.
Overall, our results suggest that VR can be used to improve the performance of simulation-trained
control policies with real people without putting people at risk, thereby serving as a valuable
stepping stone to real robotic assistance.
