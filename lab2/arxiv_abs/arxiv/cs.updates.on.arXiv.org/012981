One of the promising technologies for the next generation wireless networks is the reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs). This technology provides planar surfaces the capability to manipulate
the reflected waves of impinging signals, which leads to a more controllable wireless environment.
One potential use case of such technology is providing indirect line-of-sight (LoS) links between
mobile users and base stations (BSs) which do not have direct LoS channels. Objects that act as blockages
for the communication links, such as buildings or trees, can be equipped with RISs to enhance the
coverage probability of the cellular network through providing extra indirect LoS-links. In this
paper, we use tools from stochastic geometry to study the effect of large-scale deployment of RISs
on the performance of cellular networks. In particular, we model the blockages using the line Boolean
model. For this setup, we study how equipping a subset of the blockages with RISs will enhance the
performance of the cellular network. We first derive the ratio of the blind-spots to the total area.
Next, we derive the probability that a typical mobile user associates with a BS using an RIS. Finally,
we derive the probability distribution of the path-loss between the typical user and its associated
BS. We draw multiple useful system-level insights from the proposed analysis. For instance, we
show that deployment of RISs highly improves the coverage regions of the BSs. Furthermore, we show
that to ensure that the ratio of blind-spots to the total area is below 10^5, the required density
of RISs increases from just 6 RISs/km2 when the density of the blockages is 300 blockage/km^2 to 490
RISs/km^2 when the density of the blockages is 700 blockage/km^2.
