Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations, often surprising
the scientists who discover them. However, because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends
the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many
researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms
subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected
adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely
reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific
narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results
that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through
oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and
outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners
means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms
are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has
been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial
life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus
serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining
stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance
of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property
of all complex evolving systems.
