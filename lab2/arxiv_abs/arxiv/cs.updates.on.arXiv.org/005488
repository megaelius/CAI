Numerous problems consisting in identifying vertices in graphs using distances are useful in domains
such as network verification and graph isomorphism. Unifying them into a meta-problem may be of
main interest. We introduce here a promising solution named Distance Identifying Set. The model
contains Identifying Code (IC), Locating Dominating Set (LD) and their generalizations $r$-IC
and $r$-LD where the closed neighborhood is considered up to distance $r$. It also contains Metric
Dimension (MD) and its refinement $r$-MD in which the distance between two vertices is considered
as infinite if the real distance exceeds $r$. Note that while IC = 1-IC and LD = 1-LD, we have MD = $\infty$-MD;
we say that MD is not local In this article, we prove computational lower bounds for several problems
included in Distance Identifying Set by providing generic reductions from (Planar) Hitting Set
to the meta-problem. We mainly focus on two families of problem from the meta-problem: the first
one, called bipartite gifted local, contains $r$-IC, $r$-LD and $r$-MD for each positive integer
$r$ while the second one, called 1-layered, contains LD, MD and $r$-MD for each positive integer
$r$. We have: - the 1-layered problems are NP-hard even in bipartite apex graphs, - the bipartite
gifted local problems are NP-hard even in bipartite planar graphs, - assuming ETH, all these problems
cannot be solved in $2^{o(\sqrt{n})}$ when restricted to bipartite planar or apex graph, respectively,
and they cannot be solved in $2^{o(n)}$ on bipartite graphs, - even restricted to bipartite graphs,
they do not admit parameterized algorithms in $2^{O(k)}.n^{O(1)}$ except if W[0] = W[2]. Here $k$
is the solution size of a relevant identifying set. In particular, Metric Dimension cannot be solved
in $2^{o(n)}$ under ETH, answering a question of Hartung in 2013.
