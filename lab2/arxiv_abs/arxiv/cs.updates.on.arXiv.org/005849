Providing model-generated explanations in recommender systems is important to user experience.
State-of-the-art recommendation algorithms - especially collaborative filtering (CF)-based
approaches with shallow or deep models - usually work with various unstructured information sources
for recommendation, such as textual reviews, visual images, and various implicit or explicit feedbacks.
Though structured knowledge bases were considered in content-based approaches, they have been
largely ignored recently due to the research focus on CF approaches. However, structured knowledge
exhibit unique advantages in personalized recommendation systems. When the explicit knowledge
about users and items is considered for recommendation, the system could provide highly customized
recommendations based on users' historical behaviors and the knowledge is helpful for providing
informed explanations regarding the recommended items. A great challenge for using knowledge
bases for recommendation is how to integrate large-scale structured data, while taking advantage
of collaborative filtering for highly accurate performance. Recent achievements in knowledge-base
embedding (KBE) sheds light on this problem, which makes it possible to learn user and item representations
while preserving the structure of their relationship with external knowledge for explanation.
In this work, we propose to explain knowledge-base embeddings for explainable recommendation.
Specifically, we propose a knowledge-base representation learning framework to embed heterogeneous
entities for recommendation, and based on the embedded knowledge base, a soft matching algorithm
is proposed to generate personalized explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results
on real-world e-commerce datasets verified the superior recommendation performance and the explainability
power of our approach compared with state-of-the-art baselines.
