Preventing fake or duplicate digital identities (aka sybils) from joining a digital community
may be crucial to its survival, especially if it utilizes a consensus protocol among its members
or employs democratic governance, where sybils can undermine consensus, tilt decisions, or even
take over. Here, we explore the use of a trust-graph of identities, with edges representing trust
among identity owners, to allow a community to grow indefinitely without increasing its sybil penetration.
Since identities are admitted to the digital community based on their trust by existing digital
community members, corrupt identities, which may trust sybils, also pose a threat to the digital
community. Sybils and their corrupt perpetrators are together referred to as byzantines, and the
overarching aim is to limit their penetration into a digital community. We propose two alternative
tools to achieve this goal. One is graph conductance, which works under the assumption that honest
people are averse to corrupt ones and tend to distrust them. The second is vertex expansion, which
relies on the assumption that there are not too many corrupt identities in the community. Of particular
interest is keeping the fraction of byzantines below one third, as it would allow the use of Byzantine
Agreement [15] for consensus as well as for sybil-resilient social choice [19]. This paper considers
incrementally growing a trust graph and shows that, under its key assumptions and additional requirements,
including keeping the conductance or vertex expansion of the community trust graph sufficiently
high, a community may grow safely, indefinitely.
