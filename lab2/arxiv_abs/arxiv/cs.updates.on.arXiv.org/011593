The evolution of drug-resistant microbial species is one of the major challenges to global health.
The development of new antimicrobial treatments such as antimicrobial peptides needs to be accelerated
to combat this threat. However, the discovery of novel antimicrobial peptides is hampered by low-throughput
biochemical assays. Computational techniques can be used for rapid screening of promising antimicrobial
peptide candidates prior to testing in the wet lab. The vast majority of existing antimicrobial
peptide predictors are non-targeted in nature, i.e., they can predict whether a given peptide sequence
is antimicrobial, but they are unable to predict whether the sequence can target a particular microbial
species. In this work, we have developed a targeted antimicrobial peptide activity predictor that
can predict whether a peptide is effective against a given microbial species or not. This has been
made possible through zero-shot and few-shot machine learning. The proposed predictor called
AMP0 takes in the peptide amino acid sequence and any N/C-termini modifications together with the
genomic sequence of a target microbial species to generate targeted predictions. It is important
to note that the proposed method can generate predictions for species that are not part of its training
set. The accuracy of predictions for novel test species can be further improved by providing a few
example peptides for that species. Our computational cross-validation results show that the pro-posed
scheme is particularly effective for targeted antimicrobial prediction in comparison to existing
approaches and can be used for screening potential antimicrobial peptides in a targeted manner
especially for cases in which the number of training examples is small. The webserver of the method
