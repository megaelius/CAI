This study began with a research project, called DISCvR, conducted at the IBM-ILLINOIS Center for
Cognitive Computing Systems Reseach. The goal of DISCvR was to build a practical NLP based AI pipeline
for document understanding which will help us better understand the computation patterns and requirements
of modern computing systems. While building such a prototype, an early use case came to us thanks
to the 2017 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-50) Program Co-chairs,
Drs. Hillery Hunter and Jaime Moreno. They asked us if we can perform some data-driven analysis of
the past 50 years of MICRO papers and show some interesting historical perspectives on MICRO's 50
years of publication. We learned two important lessons from that experience: (1) building an AI
solution to truly understand unstructured data is hard in spite of the many claimed successes in
natural language understanding; and (2) providing a data-driven perspective on computer architecture
research is a very interesting and fun project. Recently we decided to conduct a more thorough study
based on all past papers of International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) from 1973 to
2018, which resulted this article. We recognize that we have just scratched the surface of natural
language understanding of unstructured data, and there are many more aspects that we can improve.
But even with our current study, we felt there were enough interesting findings that may be worthwhile
to share with the community. Hence we decided to write this article to summarize our findings so far
based only on ISCA publications. Our hope is to generate further interests from the community in
this topic, and we welcome collaboration from the community to deepen our understanding both of
the computer architecture research and of the challenges of NLP-based AI solutions.
