The traditional von Neumann computer architecture faces serious obstacles, both in terms of miniaturization
and in terms of heat production, with increasing performance. Artificial neural (neuromorphic)
substrates represent an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. A special subset of these
systems follow the principle of "physical modeling" as they directly use the physical properties
of the underlying substrate to realize computation with analog components. While these systems
are potentially faster and/or more energy efficient than conventional computers, they require
robust models that can cope with their inherent limitations in terms of controllability and range
of parameters. A natural source of inspiration for robust models is neuroscience as the brain faces
similar challenges. It has been recently suggested that sampling with the spiking dynamics of neurons
is potentially suitable both as a generative and a discriminative model for artificial neural substrates.
In this work we present the implementation of sampling with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons on
the BrainScaleS physical model system. We prove the sampling property of the network and demonstrate
its applicability to high-dimensional datasets. The required stochasticity is provided by a spiking
random network on the same substrate. This allows the system to run in a self-contained fashion without
external stochastic input from the host environment. The implementation provides a basis as a building
block in large-scale biologically relevant emulations, as a fast approximate sampler or as a framework
to realize on-chip learning on (future generations of) accelerated spiking neuromorphic hardware.
Our work contributes to the development of robust computation on physical model systems.
