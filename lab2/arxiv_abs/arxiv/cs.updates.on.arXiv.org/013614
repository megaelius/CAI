Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that work radically different from traditional cameras.
Instead of capturing images at a fixed rate, they measure per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously.
This results in a stream of events, which encode the time, location and sign of the brightness changes.
Event cameras posses outstanding properties compared to traditional cameras: very high dynamic
range (140 dB vs. 60 dB), high temporal resolution (in the order of microseconds), low power consumption,
and do not suffer from motion blur. Hence, event cameras have a large potential for robotics and computer
vision in challenging scenarios for traditional cameras, such as high speed and high dynamic range.
However, novel methods are required to process the unconventional output of these sensors in order
to unlock their potential. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of
event-based vision, with a focus on the applications and the algorithms developed to unlock the
outstanding properties of event cameras. We present event cameras from their working principle,
the actual sensors that are available and the tasks that they have been used for, from low-level vision
(feature detection and tracking, optic flow, etc.) to high-level vision (reconstruction, segmentation,
recognition). We also discuss the techniques developed to process events, including learning-based
techniques, as well as specialized processors for these novel sensors, such as spiking neural networks.
Additionally, we highlight the challenges that remain to be tackled and the opportunities that
lie ahead in the search for a more efficient, bio-inspired way for machines to perceive and interact
with the world.
