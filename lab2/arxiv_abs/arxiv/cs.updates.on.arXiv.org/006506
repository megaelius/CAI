NarrowBand-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is an emerging cellular-based technology that offers
a range of flexible configurations for massive IoT radio access from groups of devices with heterogeneous
requirements. A configuration specifies the amount of radio resource allocated to each group of
devices for random access and for data transmission. Assuming no knowledge of the traffic statistics,
there exists an important challenge in "how to determine the configuration that maximizes the long-term
average number of served IoT devices at each Transmission Time Interval (TTI) in an online fashion".
Given the complexity of searching for optimal configuration, we first develop real-time configuration
selection based on the tabular Q-learning (tabular-Q), the Linear Approximation based Q-learning
(LA-Q), and the Deep Neural Network based Q-learning (DQN) in the single-parameter single-group
scenario. Our results show that the proposed reinforcement learning based approaches considerably
outperform the conventional heuristic approaches based on load estimation (LE-URC) in terms of
the number of served IoT devices. This result also indicates that LA-Q and DQN can be good alternatives
for tabular-Q to achieve almost the same performance with much less training time. We further advance
LA-Q and DQN via Actions Aggregation (AA-LA-Q and AA-DQN) and via Cooperative Multi-Agent learning
(CMA-DQN) for the multi-parameter multi-group scenario, thereby solve the problem that Q-learning
agents do not converge in high-dimensional configurations. In this scenario, the superiority
of the proposed Q-learning approaches over the conventional LE-URC approach significantly improves
with the increase of configuration dimensions, and the CMA-DQN approach outperforms the other
approaches in both throughput and training efficiency.
