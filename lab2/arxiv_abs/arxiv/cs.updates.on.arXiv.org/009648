Planning for systems with dynamics is challenging as often there is no local planner available and
the only primitive to explore the state space is forward propagation of controls. In this context,
tree sampling-based planners have been developed, some of which achieve asymptotic optimality
by propagating random controls during each iteration. While desirable for the analysis, random
controls result in slow convergence to high quality trajectories in practice. This short position
statement first argues that if a kinodynamic planner has access to local maneuvers that appropriately
balance an exploitation-exploration trade-off, the planner's per iteration performance is significantly
improved. Generating such maneuvers during planning can be achieved by curating a large sample
of random controls. This is, however, computationally very expensive. If such maneuvers can be
generated fast, the planner's performance will also improve as a function of computation time.
Towards objective, this short position statement argues for the integration of modern machine
learning frameworks with state-of-the-art, informed and asymptotically optimal kinodynamic
planners. The proposed approach involves using using neural networks to infer local maneuvers
for a robotic system with dynamics, which properly balance the above exploitation-exploration
trade-off. In particular, a neural network architecture is proposed, which is trained to reflect
the choices of an online curation process, given local obstacle and heuristic information. The
planner uses these maneuvers to efficiently explore the underlying state space, while still maintaining
desirable properties. Preliminary indications in simulated environments and systems are promising
but also point to certain challenges that motivate further research in this direction.
