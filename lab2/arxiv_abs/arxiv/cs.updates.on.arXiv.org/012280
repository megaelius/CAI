Representation of a dynamical system in terms of simplifying modes is a central premise of reduced
order modelling and a primary concern of the increasingly popular DMD (dynamic mode decomposition)
empirical interpretation of Koopman operator analysis of complex systems. In the spirit of optimal
approximation and reduced order modelling the goal of DMD methods and variants are to describe the
dynamical evolution as a linear evolution in an appropriately transformed lower rank space, as
best as possible. However, as far as we know there has not been an in depth study regarding the underlying
geometry as related to an efficient representation. To this end we present that a good dictionary,
that quite different from other's constructions, we need only to construct optimal initial data
functions on a transverse co-dimension one set. Then the eigenfunctions on a subdomain follows
the method of characteristics. The underlying geometry of Koopman eigenfunctions involves an
extreme multiplicity whereby infinitely many eigenfunctions correspond to each eigenvalue that
we resolved by our new concept as a quotient set of functions, in terms of matched level sets. We call
this equivalence class of functions a ``primary eigenfunction" to further help us to resolve the
relationship between the large number of eigenfunctions in perhaps an otherwise low dimensional
phase space. This construction allows us to understand the geometric relationships between the
numerous eigenfunctions in a useful way. Aspects are discussed how the underlying spectral decomposition
as the point spectrum and continuous spectrum fundamentally rely on the domain.
