Ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) are being actively investigated with the potential
for in-memory computing (IMC) over other non-volatile memories (NVMs). Content Addressable Memories
(CAMs) are a form of IMC that performs parallel searches for matched entries over a memory array for
a given input query. CAMs are widely used for data-centric applications that involve pattern matching
and search functionality. To accommodate the ever expanding data, it is attractive to resort to
analog CAM for memory density improvement. However, the digital CAM design nowadays based on standard
CMOS or emerging nonvolatile memories (e.g., resistive storage devices) is already challenging
due to area, power, and cost penalties. Thus, it can be extremely expensive to achieve analog CAM
with those technologies due to added cell components. As such, we propose, for the first time, a universal
compact FeFET based CAM design, FeCAM, with search and storage functionality enabled in digital
and analog domain simultaneously. By exploiting the multi-level-cell (MLC) states of FeFET, FeCAM
can store and search inputs in either digital or analog domain. We perform a device-circuit co-design
of the proposed FeCAM and validate its functionality and performance using an experimentally calibrated
FeFET model. Circuit level simulation results demonstrate that FeCAM can either store continuous
matching ranges or encode 3-bit data in a single CAM cell. When compared with the existing digital
CMOS based CAM approaches, FeCAM is found to improve both memory density by 22.4X and energy saving
by 8.6/3.2X for analog/digital modes, respectively. In the CAM-related application, our evaluations
show that FeCAM can achieve 60.5X/23.1X saving in area/search energy compared with conventional
CMOS based CAMs.
