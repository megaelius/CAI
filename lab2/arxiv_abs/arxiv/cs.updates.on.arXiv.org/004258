This Ph.D. thesis deals with the optimization of several renewable energy resources development
as well as the improvement of facilities management in oceanic engineering and airports, using
computational hybrid methods belonging to AI to this end. Energy is essential to our society in order
to ensure a good quality of life. This means that predictions over the characteristics on which renewable
energies depend are necessary, in order to know the amount of energy that will be obtained at any time.
The second topic tackled in this thesis is related to the basic parameters that influence in different
marine activities and airports, whose knowledge is necessary to develop a proper facilities management
in these environments. Within this work, a study of the state-of-the-art Machine Learning have
been performed to solve the problems associated with the topics above-mentioned, and several contributions
have been proposed: One of the pillars of this work is focused on the estimation of the most important
parameters in the exploitation of renewable resources. The second contribution of this thesis
is related to feature selection problems. The proposed methodologies are applied to multiple problems:
the prediction of $H_s$, relevant for marine energy applications and marine activities, the estimation
of WPREs, undesirable variations in the electric power produced by a wind farm, the prediction of
global solar radiation in areas from Spain and Australia, really important in terms of solar energy,
and the prediction of low-visibility events at airports. All of these practical issues are developed
with the consequent previous data analysis, normally, in terms of meteorological variables.
