This paper provides a global picture about the deployment of networked processing services for
genomic data sets. Many current research make an extensive use genomic data, which are massive and
rapidly increasing over time. They are typically stored in remote databases, accessible by using
Internet. For this reason, a significant issue for effectively handling genomic data through data
networks consists of the available network services. A first contribution of this paper consists
of identifying the still unexploited features of genomic data that could allow optimizing their
networked management. The second and main contribution of this survey consists of a methodological
classification of computing and networking alternatives which can be used to offer what we call
the Genomic-as-a-Service (GaaS) paradigm. In more detail, we analyze the main genomic processing
applications, and classify not only the main computing alternatives to run genomics workflows
in either a local machine or a distributed cloud environment, but also the main software technologies
available to develop genomic processing services. Since an analysis encompassing only the computing
aspects would provide only a partial view of the issues for deploying GaaS system, we present also
the main networking technologies that are available to efficiently support a GaaS solution. We
first focus on existing service platforms, and analyze them in terms of service features, such as
scalability, flexibility, and efficiency. Then, we present a taxonomy for both wide area and datacenter
network technologies that may fit the GaaS requirements. It emerges that virtualization, both
in computing and networking, is the key for a successful large-scale exploitation of genomic data,
by pushing ahead the adoption of the GaaS paradigm. Finally, the paper illustrates a short and long-term
vision on future research challenges in the field.
