Click-through rate (CTR) prediction of advertisements on online social network platforms to optimize
advertising is of much interest. Prior works build machine learning models that take a user-centric
approach in terms of training -- using predominantly user data to classify whether a user will click
on an advertisement or not. While this approach has proven effective, it is inaccessible to most
entities and relies heavily on user data. To accommodate for this, we first consider a large set of
advertisement data on Facebook and use natural language processing (NLP) to extract key concepts
that we call conceptual nodes. To predict the value of CTR for a combination of conceptual nodes,
we use the advertisement data to train four machine learning (ML) models. We then cast the problem
of finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes as an optimization problem. Given a certain
budget $k$, we are interested in finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes that maximize
the CTR. A discussion of the hardness and possible NP-hardness of the optimization problem is provided.
Then, we propose a greedy algorithm and a genetic algorithm to find near-optimal combinations of
conceptual nodes in polynomial time, with the genetic algorithm nearly matching the optimal solution.
We observe that Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor exhibit the highest Pearson
correlation coefficients w.r.t. click predictions and real click values. Additionally, we find
that the conceptual nodes of "politics", "celebrity", and "organization" are notably more influential
than other considered conceptual nodes.
