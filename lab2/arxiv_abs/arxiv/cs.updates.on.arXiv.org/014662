The world is currently witnessing dangerous shifts in the epidemic of emerging SARS-CoV-2, the
causative agent of (COVID-19) coronavirus. The infection, and death numbers reported by World
Health Organization (WHO) about this epidemic forecasts an increasing threats to the lives of people
and the economics of countries. The greatest challenge that most governments are currently suffering
from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect unknown infected cases and predict the infection
risk of COVID-19 virus. In response to mitigate this challenge, this study proposes a novel innovative
approach for mitigating big challenges of (COVID-19) coronavirus propagation and contagion.
This study propose a blockchain-based framework which investigate the possibility of utilizing
peer-to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage advantages of blockchain to build a new
system for verifying and detecting the unknown infected cases of COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the
proposed framework will enable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus within
conglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of P2P-Mobile Application.
The proposed approach is forecasted to produce an effective system able to support governments,
health authorities, and citizens to take critical decision regarding the infection detection,
infection prediction, and infection avoidance. The framework is currently being developed and
implemented as a new system consists of four components, Infection Verifier Subsystem, Blockchain
platform, P2P-Mobile Application, and Mass-Surveillance System. This four components work together
for detecting the unknown infected cases and predicting and estimating the infection Risk of Corona
Virus (COVID-19).
