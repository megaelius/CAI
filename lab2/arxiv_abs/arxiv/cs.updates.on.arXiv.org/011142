A parallel dynamic overset framework has been developed for the curvilinear immersed boundary
(overset-CURVIB) method to enable tackling a wide range of challenging flow problems. The dynamic
overset grids are used to locally increase the grid resolution near complex immersed bodies, which
are handled using a sharp interface immersed boundary method, undergoing large movements as well
as arbitrary relative motions. The new framework extends the previous overset-CURVIB method with
fixed overset grids and a sequential grid assembly to moving overset grids with an efficient parallel
grid assembly. In addition, a new method for the interpolation of variables at the grid boundaries
is developed which can drastically decrease the execution time and increase the parallel efficiency
of our framework compared to the previous strategy. The moving/rotating overset grids are solved
in a non-inertial frame of reference to avoid recalculating the curvilinear metrics of transformation
while the background/stationary grids are solved in the inertial frame. The new framework is verified
and validated against experimental data, and analytical/benchmark solutions. In addition, the
results of the overset grid are compared with results over a similar single grid. The method is shown
to be 2nd order accurate, decrease the computational cost relative to a single grid, and good overall
parallel speedup. The grid assembly takes less than 7% of the total CPU time even at the highest number
of CPUs tested in this work. The capabilities of our method are demonstrated by simulating the flow
past a school of self-propelled aquatic swimmers arranged initially in a diamond pattern.
