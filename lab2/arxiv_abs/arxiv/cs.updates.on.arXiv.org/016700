Background: Shared decision-making (SDM) aims to empower patients to take an active role in their
treatment choices, supported by clinicians and patient decision aids (PDAs). The purpose of this
study is to explore barriers and possible facilitators to SDM and a PDA in the prostate cancer trajectory.
In the process we identify possible actions that organizations and individuals can take to support
implementation in practice. Methods: We use the Ottawa Model of Research Use as a framework to determine
the barriers and facilitators to SDM and PDAs from the perspective of clinicians. Semi-structured
interviews were conducted with urologists (n=4), radiation oncologists (n=3), and oncology nurses
(n=2), focusing on the current decision-making process experienced by these stakeholders. Questions
included their attitudes towards SDM and PDAs, barriers to implementation and possible strategies
to overcome them. Results: Time pressure and patient characteristics were cited as major barriers
by 55% of the clinicians we interviewed. Structural factors such as external quotas for certain
treatment procedures were also considered as barriers by 44% of the clinicians. Facilitating factors
involved organizational changes to em-bed PDAs in the treatment trajectory, training in using
PDAs as a tool for SDM, and clinician motivation by disseminating positive clinical outcomes. Our
findings also suggest a role for external stakeholders such as healthcare insurers in creating
economic incentives to facilitate implementation. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance
of a multi-faceted implementation strategy to support SDM. While clinician motivation and patient
activation are essential, structural/economic barriers may hamper implementation. Action must
also be taken at the administrative and policy levels to foster a collaborative environment for
SDM and, in the process, for PDAs.
