Truly polymorphic circuits, whose functionality/circuit behavior can be altered using a control
variable, can provide tremendous benefits in multi-functional system design and resource sharing.
For secure and fault tolerant hardware designs these can be crucial as well. Polymorphic circuits
work in literature so far either rely on environmental parameters such as temperature, variation
etc. or on special devices such as ambipolar FET, configurable magnetic devices, etc., that often
result in inefficiencies in performance and/or realization. In this paper, we introduce a novel
polymorphic circuit design approach where deterministic interference between nano-metal lines
is leveraged for logic computing and configuration. For computing, the proposed approach relies
on nano-metal lines, their interference and commonly used FETs, and for polymorphism, it requires
only an extra metal line that carries the control signal. In this paper, we show a wide range of crosstalk
polymorphic (CT-P) logic gates and their evaluation results. We also show an example of a large circuit
that performs both the functionalities of multiplier and sorter depending on the configuration
signal. Our benchmarking results are presented in this paper. For CT-P, the transistor count was
found to be significantly less compared to other existing approaches, ranging from 25% to 83%. For
example, CT-P AOI21-OA21 cell show 83%, 85% and 50% transistor count reduction, and MultiplierSorter
circuit show 40%, 36% and 28% transistor count reduction with respect to CMOS, genetically evolved,
and ambipolar transistor based polymorphic circuits respectively.
