Recommender systems recommend items more accurately by analyzing users' potential interest on
different brands' items. In conjunction with users' rating similarity, the presence of users'
implicit feedbacks like clicking items, viewing items specifications, watching videos etc. have
been proved to be helpful for learning users' embedding, that helps better rating prediction of
users. Most existing recommender systems focus on modeling of ratings and implicit feedbacks ignoring
users' explicit feedbacks. Explicit feedbacks can be used to validate the reliability of the particular
users and can be used to learn about the users' characteristic. Users' characteristic mean what
type of reviewers they are. In this paper, we explore three different models for recommendation
with more accuracy focusing on users' explicit feedbacks and implicit feedbacks. First one is RHC-PMF
that predicts users' rating more accurately based on user's three explicit feedbacks (rating,
helpfulness score and centrality) and second one is RV-PMF, where user's implicit feedback (view
relationship) is considered. Last one is RHCV-PMF, where both type of feedbacks are considered.
In this model users' explicit feedbacks' similarity indicate the similarity of their reliability
and characteristic and implicit feedback's similarity indicates their preference similarity.
Extensive experiments on real world dataset, i.e. Amazon.com online review dataset shows that
our models perform better compare to base-line models in term of users' rating prediction. RHCV-PMF
model also performs better rating prediction compare to baseline models for cold start users and
cold start items.
