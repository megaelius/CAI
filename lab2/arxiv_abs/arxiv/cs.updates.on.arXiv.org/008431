Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has demonstrated impressive ability to represent hyperspectral
images and to achieve promising results in hyperspectral image classification. However, traditional
CNN models can only operate convolution on regular square image regions with fixed size and weights,
so they cannot universally adapt to the distinct local regions with various object distributions
and geometric appearances. Therefore, their classification performances are still to be improved,
especially in class boundaries. To alleviate this shortcoming, we consider employing the recently
proposed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for hyperspectral image classification, as it can
conduct the convolution on arbitrarily structured non-Euclidean data and is applicable to the
irregular image regions represented by graph topological information. Different from the commonly
used GCN models which work on a fixed graph, we enable the graph to be dynamically updated along with
the graph convolution process, so that these two steps can be benefited from each other to gradually
produce the discriminative embedded features as well as a refined graph. Moreover, to comprehensively
deploy the multi-scale information inherited by hyperspectral images, we establish multiple
input graphs with different neighborhood scales to extensively exploit the diversified spectral-spatial
correlations at multiple scales. Therefore, our method is termed 'Multi-scale Dynamic Graph Convolutional
Network' (MDGCN). The experimental results on three typical benchmark datasets firmly demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed MDGCN to other state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and
quantitative aspects.
