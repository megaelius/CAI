In this paper, we focus on the scheduling problem in multi-channel wireless networks, e.g., the
downlink of a single cell in fourth generation (4G) OFDM-based cellular networks. Our goal is to
design practical scheduling policies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both
throughput and delay, at a low complexity. While a class of $O(n^{2.5} \log n)$ complexity hybrid
scheduling policies are recently developed to guarantee both rate-function delay optimality
(in the many-channel many-user asymptotic regime) and throughput optimality (in general non-asymptotic
setting), their practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop a simple
greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a lower complexity $O(n^2)$,
and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achieves throughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal
rate-function-based delay performance. Specifically, the rate-function attained by D-SSG for
any fixed integer threshold $b>0$, is no smaller than the maximum achievable rate-function
by any scheduling policy for threshold $b-1$. Thus, we are able to achieve a reduction in complexity
(from $O(n^{2.5} \log n)$ of the hybrid policies to $O(n^2)$) with a minimal drop in the delay performance.
More importantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity than the hybrid
policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden in the $O(\cdot)$ notation. Finally,
we conduct numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results in various scenarios. The
simulation results show that D-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also
empirically is virtually indistinguishable from delay-optimal policies.
