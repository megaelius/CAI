The unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge for news media around
the globe. While journalism is meant to process yet unknown events by design, the dynamically evolving
situation affected all aspects of life in such profound ways that even the routines of crisis reporting
seemed to be insufficient. Critics noted tendencies to horse-race reporting and uncritical coverage,
with journalism being too close to official statements and too affirmative of political decisions.
However, empirical data on the performance of journalistic news media during the crisis has been
lacking thus far. The current study analyzes the Facebook messages of journalistic news media during
the early Coronavirus crisis, based on a large German data set from January to March 2020. Using computational
content analysis methods, reach and interactions, topical structure, relevant actors, negativity
of messages, as well as the coverage of fabricated news and conspiracy theories were examined. The
topical structure of the near-time Facebook coverage changed during various stages of the crisis,
with just partial support for the claims of critics. The initial stages were somewhat lacking in
topical breadth, but later stages offered a broad range of coverage on Corona-related issues and
societal concerns. Further, journalistic media covered fake news and conspiracy theories during
the crisis, but they consistently contextualized them as what they were and debunked the false claims
circulating in public. While some criticism regarding the performance of journalism during the
crisis received mild empirical support, the analysis did not find overwhelming signs of systemic
dysfunctionalities. Overall, journalistic media did not default to a uniform reaction nor to sprawling,
information-poor pandemic news, but they responded with a multi-perspective coverage of the crisis.
