Distributed Leger Technologies (DLTs), most notably Blockchain technologies, bring decentralised
platforms that eliminate a single trusted third party and avoid the notorious single point of failure
vulnerability. Since Nakamoto's Bitcoin cryptocurrency system, an enormous number of decentralised
applications have been proposed on top of these technologies, aiming at more transparency and trustworthiness
than their traditional counterparts. These applications spread over a lot of areas, e.g. financial
services, healthcare, transportation, supply chain management, and cloud computing. While Blockchain
brings transparency and decentralised trust intuitively due to the consensus of a (very large)
group of nodes (or, miners), it introduces very subtle implications for other desirable properties
such as privacy. In this work, we demonstrate these subtle implications for Blockchain-based searchable
encryption solutions, which are one specific use case of cloud computing services. These solutions
rely on Blockchain to achieve both the standard privacy property and the new fairness property,
which requires that search operations are carried out faithfully and are rewarded accordingly.
We show that directly replacing the server in an existing searchable encryption solution with a
Blockchain will cause undesirable operational cost, privacy loss, and security vulnerabilities.
The analysis results indicate that a dedicated server is still needed to achieve the desired privacy
guarantee. To this end, we propose two frameworks which can be instantiated based on most existing
searchable encryption schemes. Through analysing these two frameworks, we affirmatively show
that a carefully engineered Blockchain-based solution can achieve the desired fairness property
while preserving the privacy guarantee of the original searchable encryption scheme simultaneously.
