Background: Depression has become a major health burden worldwide, and effective detection depression
is a great public-health challenge. This Electroencephalography (EEG)-based research is to explore
the effective biomarkers for depression recognition. Methods: Resting state EEG data was collected
from 24 major depressive patients (MDD) and 29 normal controls using 128 channel HydroCel Geodesic
Sensor Net (HCGSN). To better identify depression, we extracted different types of EEG features
including linear features, nonlinear features and functional connectivity features phase lagging
index (PLI) to comprehensively analyze the EEG signals in patients with MDD. And using different
feature selection methods and classifiers to evaluate the optimal feature sets. Results: Functional
connectivity feature PLI is superior to the linear features and nonlinear features. And when combining
all the types of features to classify MDD patients, we can obtain the highest classification accuracy
82.31% using ReliefF feature selection method and logistic regression (LR) classifier. Analyzing
the distribution of optimal feature set, it was found that intrahemispheric connection edges of
PLI were much more than the interhemispheric connection edges, and the intrahemispheric connection
edges had a significant differences between two groups. Conclusion: Functional connectivity
feature PLI plays an important role in depression recognition. Especially, intrahemispheric
connection edges of PLI might be an effective biomarker to identify depression. And statistic results
suggested that MDD patients might exist functional dysfunction in left hemisphere.
