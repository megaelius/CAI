Over the last two decades, the majority of German universities adopted various characteristics
of the prevailing North-American academic system, resulting in significant changes in several
key areas that include, e.g., both teaching and research. The universities' internal organizational
structures, however, still follow a traditional, decentralized scheme implementing an additional
organizational level -- the Chair -- effectively a "mini department" with dedicated staff, budget
and infrastructure. Although the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has been establishing a
more centralized scheme for many administrative tasks over the past decade, the transition from
its distributed to a centralized information technology (IT) administration and infrastructure
is still an ongoing process. In case of the authors' chair, this migration so far included handing
over all network-related operations to the joint compute center, consolidating the Chair's legacy
server system in terms of both hardware architectures and operating systems and, lately, moving
selected services to replacements operated by Department or University. With requirements, individuals
and organizations constantly shifting, this process, however, is neither close to completion
nor particularly unique to TUM. In this paper, we will thus share our experiences w.r.t. this IT migration
as we believe both that many of the other German universities might be facing similar challenges
and that, in the future, North-American universities - currently not implementing the chair layer
and instead relying on a centralized IT infrastructure - could need a more decentralized solution.
Hoping that both benefit from this journey, we thus present the design, commissioning and evolution
of our infrastructure.
