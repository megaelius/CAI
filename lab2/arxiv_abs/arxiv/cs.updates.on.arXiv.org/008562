Funnel lane concept is a qualitative visual navigation method which helps robots to autonomously
navigate by using a recorded video. A visual path is extracted from the video by extracting some keyframes
from the video. The robot uses this visual path for its navigation. Funnel lane unlike some other
methods does not make use of traditional calculations of Jacobians, homographies, fundamental
matrices, or the focus of expansion, and does not require any camera calibration. However, funnel
lane has some shortcomings. One problem is that funnel lane gives no information about the radius
of rotation, so in turnings, the robot turns by a constant radius of rotation along the path. This
reduces the maneuverability and limits the robot from dealing with all turnings conditions. In
addition, this problem makes the robot faces a serious problem in correcting its path when it deviates
from the desired path. Another flaw is that in some situations the robot faces an ambiguity to understand
whether a translation or a rotation should be followed in the visual path which leads the robot to
deviate and to fail in following the desired path. This paper introduces the sloped funnel lane technique
which does not have these shortcomings. The roll and pitch angles are added to the funnel lane, which
help the robot to set its radius of rotation according to the turnings conditions it faces. Moreover,
they help to reduce the ambiguity between translation and rotation. Therefore the robot can deal
with different turnings conditions and the navigation method will be more robust and accurate.
Experimental results on challenging scenarios on a real ground robot demonstrate the effectiveness
of sloped funnel lane technique.
