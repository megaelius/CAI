The human thalamus is a brain structure that comprises numerous, highly specific nuclei. Since
these nuclei are known to have different functions and to be connected to different areas of the cerebral
cortex, it is of great interest for the neuroimaging community to study their volume, shape and connectivity
in vivo with MRI. In this study, we present a probabilistic atlas of the thalamic nuclei built using
ex vivo brain MRI scans and histological data, as well as the application of the atlas to in vivo MRI
segmentation. The atlas was built using manual delineation of 26 thalamic nuclei on the serial histology
of 12 whole thalami from six autopsy samples, combined with manual segmentations of the whole thalamus
and surrounding structures (caudate, putamen, hippocampus, etc.) made on in vivo brain MR data
from 39 subjects. The 3D structure of the histological data and corresponding manual segmentations
was recovered using the ex vivo MRI as reference frame, and stacks of blockface photographs acquired
during the sectioning as intermediate target. The atlas, which was encoded as an adaptive tetrahedral
mesh, shows a good agreement with with previous histological studies of the thalamus in terms of
volumes of representative nuclei. When applied to segmentation of in vivo scans using Bayesian
inference, the atlas shows excellent test-retest reliability, robustness to changes in input
MRI contrast, and ability to detect differential thalamic effects in subjects with Alzheimer's
disease. The probabilistic atlas and companion segmentation tool are publicly available as part
of the neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.
