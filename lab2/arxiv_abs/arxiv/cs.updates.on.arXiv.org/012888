Competitive equilibrium (CE) is a fundamental concept in market economics. Its efficiency and
fairness properties make it particularly appealing as a rule for fair allocation of resources among
agents with possibly different entitlements. However, when the resources are indivisible, a CE
might not exist even when there is one resource and two agents with equal incomes. Recently, Babaioff
and Nisan and Talgam-Cohen (2017) have suggested to consider the entire space of possible incomes,
and check whether there exists a competitive equilibrium for almost all income-vectors --- all
income-space except a subset of measure zero. They proved various existence and non-existence
results, but left open the cases of four goods and three or four agents with monotonically-increasing
preferences. This paper proves non-existence in both these cases, thus completing the characterization
of CE existence for almost all incomes in the domain of monotonically increasing preferences. Additionally,
the paper provides a complete characterization of CE existence in the domain of monotonically decreasing
preferences, corresponding to allocation of chores. On the positive side, the paper proves that
CE exists for almost all incomes when there are four goods and three agents with additive preferences.
The proof uses a new tool for describing a CE, as a subgame-perfect equilibrium of a specific sequential
game. The same tool also enables substantially simpler proofs to the cases already proved by Babaioff
et al. Additionally, this paper proves several strong fairness properties that are satisfied by
any CE allocation, illustrating its usefulness for fair allocation among agents with different
entitlements.
