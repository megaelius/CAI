Here we consider, in the context of causal inference, the general question: 'what can be estimated
from data?'. We call this the question of estimability. We consider the usual definition adopted
in the causal inference literature -- identifiability -- in a general mathematical setting and
show why it is an inadequate formal translation of the concept of estimability. Despite showing
that identifiability implies the existence of a Fisher-consistent estimator, we show that this
estimator may be discontinuous, hence unstable, in general. The source of the difficulty is that
the general form of the causal inference problem is an ill-posed inverse problem. Inverse problems
have three conditions which must be satisfied in order to be considered well-posed: existence,
uniqueness, and stability of solutions. We illustrate how identifiability corresponds to the
question of uniqueness; in contrast, we take estimability to mean satisfaction of all three conditions,
i.e. well-posedness. Well-known results from the inverse problems literature imply that mere
identifiability does not guarantee well-posedness of the causal inference procedure, i.e. estimability,
and apparent solutions to causal inference problems can be essentially useless with even the smallest
amount of imperfection. Analogous issues with attempts to apply standard statistical procedures
to very general settings were raised in the statistical literature as far back as the 60s and 70s.
Thus, in addition to giving general characterisations of identifiability and estimability, we
demonstrate how the issues raised in both the theory of inverse problems and in the theory of statistical
inference lead to concerns over the stability of general nonparametric approaches to causal inference.
These apply, in particular, to those that focus on identifiability while excluding the additional
stability requirements required for estimability.
