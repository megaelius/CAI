Cyber-physical system (CPS) has operated, controlled and coordinated the physical systems integrated
by a computing and communication core applied in industry 4.0. To accommodate CPS services, fog
radio and optical networks (F-RON) has become an important supporting physical cyber infrastructure
taking advantage of both the inherent ubiquity of wireless technology and the large capacity of
optical networks. However, cyber security is the biggest issue in CPS scenario as there is a tradeoff
between security control and privacy exposure in F-RON. To deal with this issue, we propose a brain-like
based distributed control security (BLCS) architecture for F-RON in CPS, by introducing a brain-like
security (BLS) scheme. BLCS can accomplish the secure cross-domain control among tripartite controllers
verification in the scenario of decentralized F-RON for distributed computing and communications,
which has no need to disclose the private information of each domain against cyber-attacks. BLS
utilizes parts of information to perform control identification through relation network and
deep learning of behavior library. The functional modules of BLCS architecture are illustrated
including various controllers and brain-like knowledge base. The interworking procedures in
distributed control security modes based on BLS are described. The overall feasibility and efficiency
of architecture are experimentally verified on the software defined network testbed in terms of
average mistrust rate, path provisioning latency, packet loss probability and blocking probability.
The emulation results are obtained and dissected based on the testbed.
