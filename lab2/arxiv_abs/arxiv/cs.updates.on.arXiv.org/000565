This paper studies the convergence of the estimation error process and the characterization of
the corresponding invariant measure in distributed Kalman filtering for potentially unstable
and large linear dynamic systems. A gossip based information exchanging scheme termed Modified
Gossip Interactive Kalman Filtering (M-GIKF) is proposed, where sensors exchange their filtered
states (estimates and error covariances) and also propagate their observations via inter-sensor
communications of rate $\overline{\gamma}$, where $\overline{\gamma}$ is defined as the averaged
number of inter-sensor message passages per signal evolution epoch. The filtered states are interpreted
as stochastic particles with local interaction and it is shown that the conditional estimation
error covariance sequence at each sensor under M-GIKF evolves as a random Riccati equation (RRE)
with Markov modulated switching. By formulating the RRE as a random dynamical system, it is shown
that the conditional estimation error covariance at each sensor converges weakly (in distribution)
to a unique invariant measure from any initial state. Further, it is proved that as $\overline{\gamma}
\rightarrow \infty$ this invariant measure satisfies the Large Deviation (LD) upper and lower
bounds, implying that this measure converges exponentially fast (in probability) to the Dirac
measure $\delta_{P^*}$, where $P^*$ is the stable error covariance of the centralized (Kalman)
filtering setup. The LD results answer a fundamental question on how to quantify the rate at which
the distributed scheme approaches the centralized performance as the inter-sensor communication
rate increases.
