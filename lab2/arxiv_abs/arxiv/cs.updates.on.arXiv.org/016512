Segmentation-based, two-stage neural network has shown excellent results in the surface defect
detection, enabling the network to learn from a relatively small number of samples. In this work,
we introduce end-to-end training of the two-stage network together with several extensions to
the training process, which reduce the amount of training time and improve the results on the surface
defect detection tasks. To enable end-to-end training we carefully balance the contributions
of both the segmentation and the classification loss throughout the learning. We adjust the gradient
flow from the classification into the segmentation network in order to prevent the unstable features
from corrupting the learning. As an additional extension to the learning, we propose frequency-of-use
sampling scheme of negative samples to address the issue of over- and under-sampling of images during
the training, while we employ the distance transform algorithm on the region-based segmentation
masks as weights for positive pixels, giving greater importance to areas with higher probability
of presence of defect without requiring a detailed annotation. We demonstrate the performance
of the end-to-end training scheme and the proposed extensions on three defect detection datasets
- DAGM, KolektorSDD and Severstal Steel defect dataset - where we show state-of-the-art results.
On the DAGM and the KolektorSDD we demonstrate 100\% detection rate, therefore completely solving
the datasets. Additional ablation study performed on all three datasets quantitatively demonstrates
the contribution to the overall result improvements for each of the proposed extensions.
