With the widespread use of information technologies, information networks are becoming increasingly
popular to capture complex relationships across various disciplines, such as social networks,
citation networks, telecommunication networks, and biological networks. Analyzing these networks
sheds light on different aspects of social life such as the structure of societies, information
diffusion, and communication patterns. In reality, however, the large scale of information networks
often makes network analytic tasks computationally expensive or intractable. Network representation
learning has been recently proposed as a new learning paradigm to embed network vertices into a low-dimensional
vector space, by preserving network topology structure, vertex content, and other side information.
This facilitates the original network to be easily handled in the new vector space for further analysis.
In this survey, we perform a comprehensive review of the current literature on network representation
learning in the data mining and machine learning field. We propose new taxonomies to categorize
and summarize the state-of-the-art network representation learning techniques according to
the underlying learning mechanisms, the network information intended to preserve, as well as the
algorithmic designs and methodologies. We summarize evaluation protocols used for validating
network representation learning including published benchmark datasets, evaluation methods,
and open source algorithms. We also perform empirical studies to compare the performance of representative
algorithms on common datasets, and analyze their computational complexity. Finally, we suggest
promising research directions to facilitate future study.
