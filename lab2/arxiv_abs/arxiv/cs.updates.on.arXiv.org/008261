Detecting acoustic shadows in ultrasound images is important in many clinical and engineering
applications. Real-time feedback of acoustic shadows can guide sonographers to a standardized
diagnostic viewing plane with minimal artifacts and can provide additional information for other
automatic image analysis algorithms. However, automatically detecting shadow regions using
learning-based algorithms is challenging because pixel-wise ground truth annotation of acoustic
shadows is subjective and time consuming. In this paper we propose a weakly supervised method for
automatic confidence estimation of acoustic shadow regions. Our method is able to generate a dense
shadow-focused confidence map. In our method, a shadow-seg module is built to learn general shadow
features for shadow segmentation, based on global image-level annotations as well as a small number
of coarse pixel-wise shadow annotations. A transfer function is introduced to extend the obtained
binary shadow segmentation to a reference confidence map. Additionally, a confidence estimation
network is proposed to learn the mapping between input images and the reference confidence maps.
This network is able to predict shadow confidence maps directly from input images during inference.
We use evaluation metrics such as DICE, inter-class correlation and etc. to verify the effectiveness
of our method. Our method is more consistent than human annotation, and outperforms the state-of-the-art
quantitatively in shadow segmentation and qualitatively in confidence estimation of shadow regions.
We further demonstrate the applicability of our method by integrating shadow confidence maps into
tasks such as ultrasound image classification, multi-view image fusion and automated biometric
measurements.
