Particulate matter pollution is one of the deadliest types of air pollution worldwide due to its
significant impacts on the global environment and human health. Particulate Matter (PM2.5) is
one of the important particulate pollutants to measure the Air Quality Index (AQI). The conventional
instruments used by the air quality monitoring stations to monitor PM2.5 are costly, bulkier, time-consuming,
and power-hungry. Furthermore, due to limited data availability and non-scalability, these stations
cannot provide high spatial and temporal resolution in real-time. To overcome the disadvantages
of existing methodology this article presents analytical equations based prediction approach
for PM2.5 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Since the derived analytical equations for
the prediction can be computed using a Wireless Sensor Node (WSN) or low-cost processing tool, it
demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach. Moreover, the study related to correlation
among the PM2.5 and other pollutants is performed to select the appropriate predictors. The large
authenticate data set of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) online station, India is used for
the proposed approach. The RMSE and coefficient of determination (R2) obtained for the proposed
prediction approach using eight predictors are 1.7973 ug/m3 and 0.9986 respectively. While the
proposed approach results show RMSE of 7.5372 ug/m3 and R2 of 0.9708 using three predictors. Therefore,
the results demonstrate that the proposed approach is one of the promising approaches for monitoring
PM2.5 without power-hungry gas sensors and bulkier analyzers.
