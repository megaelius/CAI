A class of evolution equations with nonlocal diffusion is considered in this work. These are integro-differential
equations arising as models of propagation phenomena in continuum media with nonlocal interactions
including neural tissue, porous media flow, peridynamics, models with fractional diffusion,
as well as continuum limits of interacting dynamical systems. The principal challenge of numerical
integration of nonlocal systems stems from the lack of spatial regularity of the data and solutions
intrinsic to nonlocal models. To overcome this problem we propose a semidiscrete numerical scheme
based on the combination of sparse Monte Carlo and discontinuous Galerkin methods. An important
feature of our method is sparsity. Sparse sampling of points in the Monte Carlo approximation of
the nonlocal term allows to use fewer discretization points without compromising the accuracy.
We prove convergence of the numerical method and estimate the rate of convergence. There are two
principal ingredients in the error of the numerical method related to the use of Monte Calro and Galerkin
approximations respectively. We analyze both errors. Two representative examples of discontinuous
kernels are presented. The first example features a kernel with a singularity, while the kernel
in the second example experiences jump discontinuity. We show how the information about the singularity
in the former case and the geometry of the discontinuity set in the latter translate into the rate
of convergence of the numerical procedure. In addition, we illustrate the rate of convergence estimate
with a numerical example of an initial value problem, for which an explicit analytic solution is
available. Numerical results are consistent with analytical estimates.
