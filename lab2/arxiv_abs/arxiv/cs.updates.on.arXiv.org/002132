Multi-person pose estimation (MPPE) in natural images is key to the meaningful use of visual data
in many fields including movement science, security, and rehabilitation. In this paper we tackle
MPPE with a bottom-up approach, starting with candidate detections of body parts from a convolutional
neural network (CNN) and grouping them into people. We formulate the grouping of body part detections
into people as a minimum-weight set packing (MWSP) problem where the set of potential people is the
power set of body part detections. We model the quality of a hypothesis of a person which is a set in
the MWSP by an augmented tree-structured Markov random field where variables correspond to body-parts
and their state-spaces correspond to the power set of the detections for that part. We describe a
novel algorithm that combines efficiency with provable bounds on this MWSP problem. We employ an
implicit column generation strategy where the pricing problem is formulated as a dynamic program.
To efficiently solve this dynamic program we exploit the problem structure utilizing a nested Bender's
decomposition (NBD) exact inference strategy which we speed up by recycling Bender's rows between
calls to the pricing problem. We test our approach on the MPII-Multiperson dataset, showing that
our approach obtains comparable results with the state-of-the-art algorithm for joint node labeling
and grouping problems, and that NBD achieves considerable speed-ups relative to a naive dynamic
programming approach. Typical algorithms that solve joint node labeling and grouping problems
use heuristics and thus can not obtain proofs of optimality. Our approach, in contrast, proves that
for over 99 percent of problem instances we find the globally optimal solution and otherwise provide
upper/lower bounds.
