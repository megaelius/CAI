In this paper, we combine communication-theoretic laws with known, practically verified results
from circuit theory. As a result, we obtain closed-form theoretical expressions linking fundamental
system design and environment parameters with the power consumption of analog front ends for communication
receivers. This collection of scaling laws and bounds is meant to serve as a theoretical reference
for practical low power front end design. In one set of results, we first find that the front end power
consumption scales at least as SNDR^3/2 if environment parameters (fading and blocker levels)
are static. The obtained scaling law is subsequently used to derive relations between front end
power consumption and several other important communication system parameters, namely, digital
modulation constellation size, symbol error probability, error control coding gain and coding
rate. Such relations, in turn, can be used when deciding which system design strategies to adopt
for low-power applications. For example, if error control coding is employed, the most energy-efficient
strategy for the entire receiver is to use codes with moderate coding gain and simple decoding algorithms,
such as convolutional codes. In another collection of results, we find how front end power scales
with environment parameters if the performance is kept constant. This yields bounds on average
power reduction of receivers that adapt to the communication environment. For instance, if a receiver
front end adapts to fading fluctuations while keeping the performance above some given minimum
requirement, power can theoretically be reduced at least 20x compared to a non-adaptive front end.
