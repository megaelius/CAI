At recent times, with the incremental demand of the fully autonomous system, a huge research interest
is observed in learning machine based intelligent, self-organizing, and evolving controller.
In this work, a new evolving and self-organizing controller namely Generic-controller, G-controller,
is proposed. The G-controller that works in the fully online mode with very minor expert domain knowledge
is developed by incorporating the sliding model control, SMC, theory based learning algorithm
with an advanced incremental learning machine namely Generic Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
System , GENEFIS. The controller starts operating from scratch with an empty set of fuzzy rules,
and therefore, no offline training is required. To cope with the plant vulnerable behavior, the
controller can add, or prune the rules on demand. Control law and adaptation laws for the consequents
are derived from the SMC algorithm to establish a stable closed-loop system, where the stability
of the G-controller is guaranteed using the Lyapunov function. The uniform asymptotic convergence
of tracking error to zero is witnessed through the implication of an auxiliary robustifying control
term. In addition, the implementation of the multivariate Gaussian function helps the controller
to handle the non-axis parallel data from the plant and consequently enhances the robustness against
the uncertainties and environmental perturbations. Finally, the controller performance has
been evaluated by observing the tracking performance in controlling simulated plants of unmanned
aerial vehicle namely bio-inspired flapping wing micro air vehicle BIFW MAV and hexacopter for
a variety of trajectories.
