Background and Purpose: Coronaviruses (CoV) are perilous viruses that may cause Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). The novel 2019 Coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) was discovered as a novel disease pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China at the
end of 2019. Now, it becomes a Coronavirus outbreak around the world, the number of infected people
and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the updated reports of the World Health
Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of this article is to introduce a new deep learning framework;
namely COVIDX-Net to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images.
Materials and Methods: Due to the lack of public COVID-19 datasets, the study is validated on 50 Chest
X-ray images with 25 confirmed positive COVID-19 cases. The COVIDX-Net includes seven different
architectures of deep convolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group
Network (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural network model is able
to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image to classify the patient status either negative
or positive COVID-19 case. Results: Experiments and evaluation of the COVIDX-Net have been successfully
done based on 80-20% of X-ray images for the model training and testing phases, respectively. The
VGG19 and Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) models showed a good and similar performance
of automated COVID-19 classification with f1-scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19, respectively.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated the useful application of deep learning models to classify
COVID-19 in X-ray images based on the proposed COVIDX-Net framework. Clinical studies are the next
milestone of this research work.
