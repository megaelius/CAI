Object detection has been vigorously studied for years but fast accurate detection for real-world
scenes remains a very challenging problem. Overcoming drawbacks of single-stage detectors, we
take aim at precisely detecting objects for static and temporal scenes in real time. Firstly, as
a dual refinement mechanism, a novel anchor-offset detection including an anchor refinement,
a feature offset refinement, and a deformable detection head is designed for two-step regression
and capture of accurate detection features. Based on the anchor-offset detection, a dual refinement
network (DRN) is developed for high-performance static detection, where a multi-deformable head
is further designed to leverage contextual information for describing objects. As for temporal
detection in real-world scenes, temporal refinement networks (TRN) and temporal dual refinement
networks (TDRN) are developed by propagating the refinement information across time, where we
also propose a loose refinement strategy to match object motion with the previous refinement. Our
proposed methods are evaluated on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ImageNet VID datasets. Extensive comparison
on static and temporal detection verify the superiority of DRN, TRN, and TDRN. Consequently, our
developed approaches run in a fairly fast speed, and in the meantime achieve a significantly enhanced
detection accuracy, i.e., a mAP of 82.8% on VOC 2007, 80.6% on VOC 2012, 69.4% on VID 2017, and an AP
of 34.3% on COCO. Ultimately, producing encouraging results, our methods are applied to underwater
object grasping with an autonomous system. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/SeanChenxy/TDRN.
