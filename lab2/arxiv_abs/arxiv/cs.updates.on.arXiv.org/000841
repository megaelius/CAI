This paper studies how cooperation between the transmitters can help manage interference and simultaneously
ensure secrecy, in the 2-user Gaussian symmetric interference channel. First, the problem is studied
in the linear deterministic setting, and achievable schemes are proposed, which use a combination
of interference cancelation, relaying of the other user's data bits, time sharing, and transmission
of random bits, depending on the rate of the cooperative link and the relative strengths of the signal
and the interference. Outer bounds on the secrecy rate are also derived. The novelty in the derivation
lies in the careful selection of side information, and partitioning the encoded message/output
depending on the relative strength of the signal and the interference. The inner and outer bounds
are derived under all possible parameter settings. It is found that, for some parameter settings,
the inner and outer bounds match, yielding the capacity of the symmetric linear deterministic IC
(SLDIC) under transmitter cooperation and secrecy constraints. In other scenarios, the achievable
rate matches with the capacity region of the 2-user SLDIC without secrecy constraints derived by
Wang and Tse; thus, the proposed scheme offers secrecy for free. Inspired by the achievable schemes
and outer bounds in the deterministic case, achievable schemes and outer bounds are derived in the
Gaussian case. The proposed achievable scheme for the Gaussian case uses a combination of Marton's
coding scheme and stochastic encoding along with dummy message transmission. For both the models,
one of the key techniques used in the achievable scheme is interference cancelation, which offers
two seemingly conflicting benefits simultaneously: it cancels interference and ensures secrecy.
The results show that limited transmitter cooperation can greatly facilitate secure communications
over 2-user ICs.
