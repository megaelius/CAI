Although complex-valued (CV) neural networks have shown better classification results compared
to their real-valued (RV) counterparts for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) classification,
the extension of pixel-level RV networks to the complex domain has not yet thoroughly examined.
This paper presents a novel complex-valued deep fully convolutional neural network (CV-FCN) designed
for PolSAR image classification. Specifically, CV-FCN uses PolSAR CV data that includes the phase
information and utilizes the deep FCN architecture that performs pixel-level labeling. It integrates
the feature extraction module and the classification module in a united framework. Technically,
for the particularity of PolSAR data, a dedicated complex-valued weight initialization scheme
is defined to initialize CV-FCN. It considers the distribution of polarization data to conduct
CV-FCN training from scratch in an efficient and fast manner. CV-FCN employs a complex downsampling-then-upsampling
scheme to extract dense features. To enrich discriminative information, multi-level CV features
that retain more polarization information are extracted via the complex downsampling scheme.
Then, a complex upsampling scheme is proposed to predict dense CV labeling. It employs complex max-unpooling
layers to greatly capture more spatial information for better robustness to speckle noise. In addition,
to achieve faster convergence and obtain more precise classification results, a novel average
cross-entropy loss function is derived for CV-FCN optimization. Experiments on real PolSAR datasets
demonstrate that CV-FCN achieves better classification performance than other state-of-art
methods.
