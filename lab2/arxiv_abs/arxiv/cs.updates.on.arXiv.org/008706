Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have progressed significantly in recent decades,
but most of them are designed to solve unconstrained multi-objective optimization problems. In
fact, many real-world multi-objective problems contain a number of constraints. To promote research
on constrained multi-objective optimization, we first propose a problem classification scheme
with three primary types of difficulty, which reflect various types of challenges presented by
real-world optimization problems, in order to characterize the constraint functions in constrained
multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). These are feasibility-hardness, convergence-hardness
and diversity-hardness. We then develop a general toolkit to construct difficulty-adjustable
and scalable CMOPs (DAS-CMOPs, or DAS-CMaOPs when the number of objectives is greater than three)
with three types of parameterized constraint functions developed to capture the three proposed
types of difficulty. Based on this toolkit, we suggest nine difficulty-adjustable and scalable
CMOPs and nine CMaOPs. The experimental results reveal that mechanisms in MOEA/D-CDP may be more
effective in solving convergence-hard DAS-CMOPs, while mechanisms of NSGA-II-CDP may be more
effective in solving DAS-CMOPs with simultaneous diversity-, feasibility- and convergence-hardness.
Mechanisms in C-NSGA-III may be more effective in solving feasibility-hard CMaOPs, while mechanisms
of C-MOEA/DD may be more effective in solving CMaOPs with convergence-hardness. In addition, none
of them can solve these problems efficiently, which stimulates us to continue to develop new CMOEAs
and CMaOEAs to solve the suggested DAS-CMOPs and DAS-CMaOPs.
