The highway vehicular ad hoc networks, where vehicles are wirelessly inter-connected, rely on
the multi-hop transmissions for end-to-end communications. This, however, is severely challenged
by the unreliable wireless connections, signal attenuation and channel contentions in the dynamic
vehicular environment. To overcome the network dynamics, selecting appropriate relays for end-to-end
connections is important. Different from the previous efforts (\emph{e.g.}, clustering and cooperative
downloading), this paper explores the existence of stable vehicles and propose building a stable
multi-hop transmission backbone network in the highway vehicular ad hoc network. Our work is composed
of three parts. Firstly, by analyzing the real-world vehicle traffic traces, we observe that the
large-size vehicles, \emph{e.g.}, trucks, are typically stable with low variations of mobility
and stable channel condition of low signal attenuation; this makes their inter-connections stable
in both connection time and transmission rate. Secondly, by exploring the stable vehicles, we propose
a distributed protocol to build a multi-hop backbone link for end-to-end transmissions, accordingly
forming a two-tier network architecture in highway vehicular ad hoc networks. Lastly, to show the
resulting data performance, we develop a queueing analysis model to evaluate the end-to-end transmission
delay and throughput. Using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed transmission backbone
can significantly improve the reliability of multi-hop data transmissions with higher throughput,
less transmission interruptions and end-to-end delay.
