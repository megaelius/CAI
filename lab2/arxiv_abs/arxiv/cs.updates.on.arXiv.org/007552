Modern, inherently dynamic systems are usually characterized by a network structure, i.e. an underlying
graph topology, which is subject to discrete changes over time. Given a static underlying graph
$G$, a temporal graph can be represented via an assignment of a set of integer time-labels to every
edge of $G$, indicating the discrete time steps when this edge is active. While most of the recent
theoretical research on temporal graphs has focused on the notion of a temporal path and other "path-related''
temporal notions, only few attempts have been made to investigate "non-path" temporal graph problems.
In this paper, motivated by applications in sensor and in transportation networks, we introduce
and study two natural temporal extensions of the classical problem Vertex Cover. In our first problem,
Temporal Vertex Cover, the aim is to cover every edge at least once during the lifetime of the temporal
graph, where an edge can be covered by one of its endpoints, only at a time step when it is active. In
our second, more pragmatic variation Sliding Window Temporal Vertex Cover, we are also given a natural
number $\Delta$, and our aim is to cover every edge at least once at every $\Delta$ consecutive time
steps. In both cases we wish to minimize the total number of "vertex appearances" that are needed
to cover the whole graph. We present a thorough investigation of the computational complexity and
approximability of these two temporal covering problems. In particular, we provide strong hardness
results, complemented by various approximation and exact algorithms. Some of our algorithms are
polynomial-time, while others are asymptotically almost optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis
(ETH) and other plausible complexity assumptions.
