We consider the problem in regression analysis of identifying subpopulations that exhibit different
patterns of response, where each subpopulation requires a different underlying model. Unlike
statistical cohorts, these subpopulations are not known a priori; thus, we refer to them as cadres.
When the cadres and their associated models are interpretable, modeling leads to insights about
the subpopulations and their associations with the regression target. We introduce a discriminative
model that simultaneously learns cadre assignment and target-prediction rules. Sparsity-inducing
priors are placed on the model parameters, under which independent feature selection is performed
for both the cadre assignment and target-prediction processes. We learn models using adaptive
step size stochastic gradient descent, and we assess cadre quality with bootstrapped sample analysis.
We present simulated results showing that, when the true clustering rule does not depend on the entire
set of features, our method significantly outperforms methods that learn subpopulation-discovery
and target-prediction rules separately. In a materials-by-design case study, our model provides
state-of-the-art prediction of polymer glass transition temperature. Importantly, the method
identifies cadres of polymers that respond differently to structural perturbations, thus providing
design insight for targeting or avoiding specific transition temperature ranges. It identifies
chemically meaningful cadres, each with interpretable models. Further experimental results
show that cadre methods have generalization that is competitive with linear and nonlinear regression
models and can identify robust subpopulations.
