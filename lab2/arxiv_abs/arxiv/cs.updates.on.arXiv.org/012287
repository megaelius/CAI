Assessing tumor tissue heterogeneity via ultrasound has recently been suggested for predicting
early response to treatment. The ultrasound backscattering characteristics can assist in better
understanding the tumor texture by highlighting local concentration and spatial arrangement
of tissue scatterers. However, it is challenging to quantify the various tissue heterogeneities
ranging from fine-to-coarse of the echo envelope peaks in tumor texture. Local parametric fractal
features extracted via maximum likelihood estimation from five well-known statistical model
families are evaluated for the purpose of ultrasound tissue characterization. The fractal dimension
(self-similarity measure) was used to characterize the spatial distribution of scatterers, while
the Lacunarity (sparsity measure) was applied to determine scatterer number density. Performance
was assessed based on 608 cross-sectional clinical ultrasound RF images of liver tumors (230 and
378 demonstrating respondent and non-respondent cases, respectively). Crossvalidation via
leave-one-tumor-out and with different k-folds methodologies using a Bayesian classifier were
employed for validation. The fractal properties of the backscattered echoes based on the Nakagami
model (Nkg) and its extend four-parameter Nakagami-generalized inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution
achieved best results - with nearly similar performance - for characterizing liver tumor tissue.
Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for the Nkg/NIG were: 85.6%/86.3%, 94.0%/96.0%, and 73.0%/71.0%,
respectively. Other statistical models, such as the Rician, Rayleigh, and K-distribution were
found to not be as effective in characterizing the subtle changes in tissue texture as an indication
of response to treatment. Employing the most relevant and practical statistical model could have
potential consequences for the design of an early and effective clinical therapy.
