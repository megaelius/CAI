A number of intriguing decision scenarios revolve around partitioning a collection of objects
to optimize some application specific objective function. This problem is generally referred
to as the Object Partitioning Problem (OPP) and is known to be NP-hard. We here consider a particularly
challenging version of OPP, namely, the Stochastic On-line Equi-Partitioning Problem (SO-EPP).
In SO-EPP, the target partitioning is unknown and has to be inferred purely from observing an on-line
sequence of object pairs. The paired objects belong to the same partition with probability $p$ and
to different partitions with probability $1-p$, with $p$ also being unknown. As an additional complication,
the partitions are required to be of equal cardinality. Previously, only sub-optimal solution
strategies have been proposed for SO- EPP. In this paper, we propose the first optimal solution strategy.
In brief, the scheme that we propose, BN-EPP, is founded on a Bayesian network representation of
SO-EPP problems. Based on probabilistic reasoning, we are not only able to infer the underlying
object partitioning with optimal accuracy. We are also able to simultaneously infer $p$, allowing
us to accelerate learning as object pairs arrive. Furthermore, our scheme is the first to support
arbitrary constraints on the partitioning (Constrained SO-EPP). Being optimal, BN-EPP provides
superior performance compared to existing solution schemes. We additionally introduce Walk-BN-EPP,
a novel WalkSAT inspired algorithm for solving large scale BN-EPP problems. Finally, we provide
a BN-EPP based solution to the problem of order picking, a representative real-life application
of BN-EPP.
