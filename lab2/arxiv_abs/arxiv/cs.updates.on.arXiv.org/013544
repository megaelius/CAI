Recently, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), benefited from the breakthrough on the
fabrication of programmable meta-material, has been speculated as one of the key enabling technologies
for the future six generation (6G) wireless communication systems scaled up beyond massive multiple
input multiple output (Massive-MIMO) technology to achieve smart radio environments. Employed
as reflecting arrays, RIS is able to assist MIMO transmissions without the need of radio frequency
chains resulting in considerable reduction in power consumption. In this paper, we investigate
the joint design of transmit beamforming matrix at the base station and the phase shift matrix at
the RIS, by leveraging recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We first develop a
DRL based algorithm, in which the joint design is obtained through trial-and-error interactions
with the environment by observing predefined rewards, in the context of continuous state and action.
Unlike the most reported works utilizing the alternating optimization techniques to alternatively
obtain the transmit beamforming and phase shifts, the proposed DRL based algorithm obtains the
joint design simultaneously as the output of the DRL neural network. Simulation results show that
the proposed algorithm is not only able to learn from the environment and gradually improve its behavior,
but also obtains the comparable performance compared with two state-of-the-art benchmarks. It
is also observed that, appropriate neural network parameter settings will improve significantly
the performance and convergence rate of the proposed algorithm.
