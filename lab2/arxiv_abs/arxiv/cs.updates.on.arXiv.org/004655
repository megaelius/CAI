Humans use signs, e.g., sentences in a spoken language, for communication and thought. Hence, symbol
systems like language are crucial for our communication with other agents and adaptation to our
real-world environment. The symbol systems we use in our human society adaptively and dynamically
change over time. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive systems, the symbol
grounding problem has been regarded as one of the central problems related to {\it symbols}. However,
the symbol grounding problem was originally posed to connect symbolic AI and sensorimotor information
and did not consider many interdisciplinary phenomena in human communication and dynamic symbol
systems in our society, which semiotics considered. In this paper, we focus on the symbol emergence
problem, addressing not only cognitive dynamics but also the dynamics of symbol systems in society,
rather than the symbol grounding problem. We first introduce the notion of a symbol in semiotics
from the humanities, to leave the very narrow idea of symbols in symbolic AI. Furthermore, over the
years, it became more and more clear that symbol emergence has to be regarded as a multifaceted problem.
Therefore, secondly, we review the history of the symbol emergence problem in different fields,
including both biological and artificial systems, showing their mutual relations. We summarize
the discussion and provide an integrative viewpoint and comprehensive overview of symbol emergence
in cognitive systems. Additionally, we describe the challenges facing the creation of cognitive
systems that can be part of symbol emergence systems.
