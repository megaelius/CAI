Supervised training of deep learning models requires large labeled datasets. There is a growing
interest in obtaining such datasets for medical image analysis applications. However, the impact
of label noise has not received sufficient attention. Recent studies have shown that label noise
can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models in many machine learning and computer
vision applications. This is especially concerning for medical applications, where datasets
are typically small, labeling requires domain expertise and suffers from high inter- and intra-observer
variability, and erroneous predictions may influence decisions that directly impact human health.
In this paper, we first review the state-of-the-art in handling label noise in deep learning. Then,
we review studies that have dealt with label noise in deep learning for medical image analysis. Our
review shows that recent progress on handling label noise in deep learning has gone largely unnoticed
by the medical image analysis community. To help achieve a better understanding of the extent of
the problem and its potential remedies, we conducted experiments with three medical imaging datasets
with different types of label noise. Based on the results of these experiments and our review of the
literature, we make recommendations on methods that can be used to alleviate the effects of different
types of label noise on deep models trained for medical image analysis. We hope that this article
helps the medical image analysis researchers and developers in choosing and devising new techniques
that effectively handle label noise in deep learning.
