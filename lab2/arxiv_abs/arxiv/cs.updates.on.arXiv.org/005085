We present a novel weed segmentation and mapping framework that processes multispectral images
obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a deep neural network (DNN). Most studies on
crop/weed semantic segmentation only consider single images for processing and classification.
Images taken by UAVs often cover only a few hundred square meters with either color only or color and
near-infrared (NIR) channels. Computing a single large and accurate vegetation map (e.g., crop/weed)
using a DNN is non-trivial due to difficulties arising from: (1) limited ground sample distances
(GSDs) in high-altitude datasets, (2) sacrificed resolution resulting from downsampling high-fidelity
images, and (3) multispectral image alignment. To address these issues, we adopt a stand sliding
window approach that operates on only small portions of multispectral orthomosaic maps (tiles),
which are channel-wise aligned and calibrated radiometrically across the entire map. We define
the tile size to be the same as that of the DNN input to avoid resolution loss. Compared to our baseline
model (i.e., SegNet with 3 channel RGB inputs) yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of [background=0.607,
crop=0.681, weed=0.576], our proposed model with 9 input channels achieves [0.839, 0.863, 0.782].
Additionally, we provide an extensive analysis of 20 trained models, both qualitatively and quantitatively,
in order to evaluate the effects of varying input channels and tunable network hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we release a large sugar beet/weed aerial dataset with expertly guided annotations
for further research in the fields of remote sensing, precision agriculture, and agricultural
robotics.
