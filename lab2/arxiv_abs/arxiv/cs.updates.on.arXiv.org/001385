We introduce a deep learning (DL) framework for inverse problems in imaging, and demonstrate the
advantages and applicability of this approach in passive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image
reconstruction. We interpret image recon- struction as a machine learning task and utilize deep
networks as forward and inverse solvers for imaging. Specifically, we design a recurrent neural
network (RNN) architecture as an inverse solver based on the iterations of proximal gradient descent
optimization methods. We further adapt the RNN architecture to image reconstruction problems
by transforming the network into a recurrent auto-encoder, thereby allowing for unsupervised
training. Our DL based inverse solver is particularly suitable for a class of image formation problems
in which the forward model is only partially known. The ability to learn forward models and hyper
parameters combined with unsupervised training approach establish our recurrent auto-encoder
suitable for real world applications. We demonstrate the performance of our method in passive SAR
image reconstruction. In this regime a source of opportunity, with unknown location and transmitted
waveform, is used to illuminate a scene of interest. We investigate recurrent auto- encoder architecture
based on the 1 and 0 constrained least- squares problem. We present a projected stochastic gradient
descent based training scheme which incorporates constraints of the unknown model parameters.
We demonstrate through extensive numerical simulations that our DL based approach out performs
conventional sparse coding methods in terms of computation and reconstructed image quality, specifically,
when no information about the transmitter is available.
