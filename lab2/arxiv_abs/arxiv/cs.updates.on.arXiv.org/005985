Accurate segmentation of brain tissue in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is a diffcult task due
to different types of brain abnormalities. Using information and features from multimodal MRI
including T1, T1-weighted inversion recovery (T1-IR) and T2-FLAIR and differential geometric
features including the Jacobian determinant(JD) and the curl vector(CV) derived from T1 modality
can result in a more accurate analysis of brain images. In this paper, we use the differential geometric
information including JD and CV as image characteristics to measure the differences between different
MRI images, which represent local size changes and local rotations of the brain image, and we can
use them as one CNN channel with other three modalities (T1-weighted, T1-IR and T2-FLAIR) to get
more accurate results of brain segmentation. We test this method on two datasets including IBSR
dataset and MRBrainS datasets based on the deep voxelwise residual network, namely VoxResNet,
and obtain excellent improvement over single modality or three modalities and increases average
DSC(Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), Gray Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM)) by about 1.5% on the well-known
MRBrainS18 dataset and about 2.5% on the IBSR dataset. Moreover, we discuss that one modality combined
with its JD or CV information can replace the segmentation effect of three modalities, which can
provide medical conveniences for doctor to diagnose because only to extract T1-modality MRI image
of patients. Finally, we also compare the segmentation performance of our method in two networks,
VoxResNet and U-Net network. The results show VoxResNet has a better performance than U-Net network
with our method in brain MRI segmentation. We believe the proposed method can advance the performance
in brain segmentation and clinical diagnosis.
