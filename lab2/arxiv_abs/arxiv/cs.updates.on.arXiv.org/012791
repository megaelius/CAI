Improved search quality enhances users' satisfaction, which directly impacts sales growth of
an E-Commerce (E-Com) platform. Traditional Learning to Rank (LTR) algorithms require relevance
judgments on products. In E-Com, getting such judgments poses an immense challenge. In the literature,
it is proposed to employ user feedback (add-to-basket (AtB) clicks, orders etc) to generate relevance
judgments. It is done in two steps: first, query-product pair data are aggregated from the logs and
then order rate etc are calculated for each pair in the logs. In this paper, we advocate counterfactual
risk minimization (CRM) approach which circumvents the need of relevance judgements, data aggregation
and is better suited for learning from logged data, i.e. contextual bandit feedback. Due to unavailability
of public E-Com LTR dataset, we provide \textit{Commercial dataset} from our platform. It contains
more than 10 million AtB click logs and 1 million order logs from a catalogue of about 3.5 million products
associated with 3060 queries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which examines
effectiveness of CRM approach in learning ranking model from real-world logged data. Our empirical
evaluation shows that CRM approach learns effectively from logged data and beats strong baseline
ranker ($\lambda$-MART) by a huge margin. Our method outperforms full-information loss (e.g.
cross-entropy) on various deep neural network models. These findings show that by adopting CRM
approach, E-Com platforms can improve product search quality without artificially mending the
data to fit in the traditional LTR algorithms.
