The employment of micro-simulation (agent-based) tools in the phase of design of public and private
spaces and facilities and for the definition of transport schemes that impact on pedestrian flows,
thanks to their achieved accuracy and predictive capacity, has become a consolidated practice.
These instruments provide support to the organization of spaces, services and facilities and to
the definition of management procedures for normal and emergency situations. The employment of
these tools is effective for various but not for all the contexts, nevertheless new features and
functions are under constant development and new products are often launched on the market. Therefore,
there is a higher necessity of a standard criteria both for the evaluation of the kinds of function
that these software provide, at use of practitioners and end-users, and for the definition of software
requirements as a reference for the developers that aim at being competitive on this market. On the
basis of our experience as pedestrian modellers and as researchers in the crowd modelling area,
we designed a comprehensive and detailed ready-to-use checklist for the quantitative evaluation
of Pedestrian Simulation Software functionalities that aims at capturing all the aspects that
we claim that are useful to undertake a professional study. These functions in our opinion are necessary
to provide accurate results in the planning of new facilities or schemes that involve pedestrian
activities. With this work we propose a set of criteria of evaluation for these products also to encourage
a debate for the definition of objective standards for pedestrian simulation software certification.
