Mosquitoes are vectors of many human diseases. In particular, Aedes \ae gypti (Linnaeus) is the
main vector for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Latin America and it represents a global
threat. Public health policies that aim at combating this vector require dependable and timely
information, which is usually expensive to obtain with field campaigns. For this reason, several
efforts have been done to use remote sensing due to its reduced cost. The present work includes the
temporal modeling of the oviposition activity (measured weekly on 50 ovitraps in a north Argentinean
city) of Aedes \ae gypti (Linnaeus), based on time series of data extracted from operational earth
observation satellite images. We use are NDVI, NDWI, LST night, LST day and TRMM-GPM rain from 2012
to 2016 as predictive variables. In contrast to previous works which use linear models, we employ
Machine Learning techniques using completely accessible open source toolkits. These models have
the advantages of being non-parametric and capable of describing nonlinear relationships between
variables. Specifically, in addition to two linear approaches, we assess a Support Vector Machine,
an Artificial Neural Networks, a K-nearest neighbors and a Decision Tree Regressor. Considerations
are made on parameter tuning and the validation and training approach. The results are compared
to linear models used in previous works with similar data sets for generating temporal predictive
models. These new tools perform better than linear approaches, in particular Nearest Neighbor
Regression (KNNR) performs the best. These results provide better alternatives to be implemented
operatively on the Argentine geospatial Risk system that is running since 2012.
