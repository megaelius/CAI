An oritatami system (OS) is a theoretical model of self-assembly via co-transcriptional folding.
It consists of a growing chain of beads which can form bonds with each other as they are transcribed.
During the transcription process, the $\delta$ most recently produced beads dynamically fold
so as to maximize the number of bonds formed, self-assemblying into a shape incrementally. The parameter
$\delta$ is called the delay and is related to the transcription rate in nature. This article initiates
the study of shape self-assembly using oritatami. A shape is a connected set of points in the triangular
lattice. We first show that oritatami systems differ fundamentally from tile-assembly systems
by exhibiting a family of infinite shapes that can be tile-assembled but cannot be folded by any OS.
As it is NP-hard in general to determine whether there is an OS that folds into (self-assembles) a
given finite shape, we explore the folding of upscaled versions of finite shapes. We show that any
shape can be folded from a constant size seed, at any scale n >= 3, by an OS with delay 1. We also show that
any shape can be folded at the smaller scale 2 by an OS with unbounded delay. This leads us to investigate
the influence of delay and to prove that, for all {\delta} > 2, there are shapes that can be folded (at
scale 1) with delay {\delta} but not with delay {\delta}'<{\delta}. These results serve as a foundation
for the study of shape-building in this new model of self-assembly, and have the potential to provide
better understanding of cotranscriptional folding in biology, as well as improved abilities of
experimentalists to design artificial systems that self-assemble via this complex dynamical
process.
