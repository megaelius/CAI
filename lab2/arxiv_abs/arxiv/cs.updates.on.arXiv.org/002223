In the age of cloud computing, cloud users with a limited amount of storage can outsource their data
to remote servers. The cloud servers, in lieu of monetary benefits, offer retrievability of their
clients' data at any point of time. A client's data can be dynamic (or static) in nature depending
on whether the client can (or cannot) update the uploaded data as needed. Secure cloud storage protocols
enable a client to check the integrity of her outsourced data by auditing the data. In this work, we
explore the possibility of constructing a secure cloud storage for dynamic data by leveraging the
idea of secure network coding. Specifically, we fail to provide a general construction of an efficient
secure cloud storage protocol for dynamic data from an arbitrary secure network coding protocol.
However, we show that some of the secure network coding schemes can be used to construct secure cloud
storage protocols for dynamic data, and we construct such a secure cloud storage protocol based
on a secure network coding protocol. To the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the first secure cloud
storage protocol for dynamic data that is based on a secure network coding protocol and that is secure
in the standard model. In a publicly verifiable setting, auditing task is often delegated to a third
party auditor that audits the outsourced data on behalf of a client. We extend our scheme in order
to provide privacy-preserving and to offer anonymity (from the server) of a user updating shared
data in an enterprise setting. We compare the performance of our secure cloud storage protocol with
that of other secure cloud storage schemes and discuss some limitations of our scheme. Finally,
we provide another construction of a secure cloud storage protocol specific to append-only data
--- that overcomes some of the limitations of our earlier scheme.
