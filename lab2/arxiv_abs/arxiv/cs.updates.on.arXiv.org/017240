We develop foundations for computing Craig-Lyndon interpolants of two given formulas with first-order
theorem provers that construct clausal tableaux. Provers that can be understood in this way include
efficient machine-oriented systems based on calculi of two families: goal-oriented such as model
elimination and the connection method, and bottom-up such as the hypertableau calculus. Similar
to known resolution-based interpolation methods our method proceeds in two stages. The first stage
is an induction on the tableau structure, which is sufficient to compute propositional interpolants.
We show that this can linearly simulate different prominent propositional interpolation methods
that operate by an induction on a resolution deduction tree. In the second stage, interpolant lifting,
quantified variables that replace certain terms (constants and compound terms) by variables are
introduced. Correctness of this second stage was apparently shown so far on the basis of resolution
and paramodulation with an error concerning equality, on the basis of resolution with paramodulation
and superposition for a special case, and on the basis of a natural deduction calculus without taking
equality into special account. Here the correctness of interpolant lifting is justified abstractly
on the basis of Herbrand's theorem and based on a different characterization of the formulas to be
lifted than in the literature (without taking equality into special account). In addition, we discuss
various subtle aspects that are relevant for the investigation and practical realization of first-order
interpolation based on clausal tableaux.
