Slender marine structures such as deep-water riser systems are continuously exposed to currents
leading to vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of the structure. This may result in amplified drag
loads and fast accumulation of fatigue damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of VIV responses
is of great importance for the safe design and operation of marine risers. Model tests with elastic
pipes have shown that VIV responses are influenced by many structural and hydrodynamic parameters,
which have not been fully modelled in present frequency domain VIV prediction tools. Traditionally,
predictions have been computed using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters, often leading to
inconsistent prediction accuracy when compared with observed field measurements and experimental
data. Hence, it is necessary to implement a high safety factor of 10 - 20 in the riser design, which
increases development cost and adds extra constraints in the field operation. One way to compensate
for the simplifications in the mathematical prediction model is to apply adaptive parameters to
describe different riser responses. The objective of this work is to demonstrate a new method to
improve the prediction consistency and accuracy by applying adaptive hydrodynamic parameters.
In the present work, a four-step approach has been proposed: First, the measured VIV response will
be analysed to identify key parameters to represent the response characteristics. These parameters
will be grouped using data clustering algorithms. Secondly, optimal hydrodynamic parameters
will be identified for each data group by optimisation against measured data. Thirdly, the VIV response
using the obtained parameters will be calculated and the prediction accuracy evaluated. The correct
hydrodynamic parameters to be used for new cases can be obtained from the clustering. This concept
has been demonstrated with examples from experimental data.
