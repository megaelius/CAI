In recent years, malicious information had an explosive growth in social media, with serious social
and political backlashes. Recent important studies, featuring large-scale analyses, have produced
deeper knowledge about this phenomenon, showing that misleading information spreads faster,
deeper and more broadly than factual information on social media, where echo chambers, algorithmic
and human biases play an important role in diffusion networks. Following these directions, we explore
the possibility of classifying news articles circulating on social media based exclusively on
a topological analysis of their diffusion networks. To this aim we collected a large dataset of diffusion
networks on Twitter pertaining to news articles published on two distinct classes of sources, namely
outlets that convey mainstream, reliable and objective information and those that fabricate and
disseminate various kinds of misleading articles, including false news intended to harm, satire
intended to make people laugh, click-bait news that may be entirely factual or rumors that are unproven.
We carried out an extensive comparison of these networks using several alignment-free approaches
including basic network properties, centrality measures distributions, and network distances.
We accordingly evaluated to what extent these techniques allow to discriminate between the networks
associated to the aforementioned news domains. Our results highlight that the communities of users
spreading mainstream news, compared to those sharing misleading news, tend to shape diffusion
networks with subtle yet systematic differences which might be effectively employed to identify
misleading and harmful information.
