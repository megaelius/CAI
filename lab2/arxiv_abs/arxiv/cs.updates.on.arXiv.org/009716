Fundamental mathematical constants like $e$ and $\pi$ are ubiquitous in diverse fields of science,
from abstract mathematics and geometry to physics, biology and chemistry. Nevertheless, for centuries
new mathematical formulas relating fundamental constants have been scarce and usually discovered
sporadically. In this paper we propose a novel and systematic approach that leverages algorithms
for deriving mathematical formulas for fundamental constants and help reveal their underlying
structure. Our algorithms find dozens of well-known as well as previously unknown continued fraction
representations of $\pi$, $e$, and the Riemann zeta function values. Two conjectures produced
by our algorithm, along with many others, are: \begin{equation*} \frac{e}{e-2} = 4 - \frac{1}{5-\frac{2}{6-\frac{3}{7-\frac{4}{8-\ldots}}}}
\quad\quad,\quad\quad \frac{4}{3\pi-8} = 3-\frac{1\cdot1}{6-\frac{2\cdot3}{9-\frac{3\cdot5}{12-\frac{4\cdot
7}{15-\ldots}}}} \end{equation*} We present two algorithms that proved useful in finding conjectures:
a variant of the Meet-In-The-Middle (MITM) algorithm and a Gradient Descent (GD) tailored to the
recurrent structure of continued fractions. Both algorithms are based on matching numerical values
and thus they conjecture formulas without providing proofs and without requiring any prior knowledge
on any underlaying mathematical structure. This approach is especially attractive for fundamental
constants for which no mathematical structure is known, as it reverses the conventional approach
of sequential logic in formal proofs. Instead, our work presents a new conceptual approach for research:
computer algorithms utilizing numerical data to unveil mathematical structures, thus trying
to play the role of intuition of great mathematicians of the past, providing leads to new mathematical
research.
