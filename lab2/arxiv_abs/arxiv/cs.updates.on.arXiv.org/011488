In various web applications like targeted advertising and recommender systems, the available
categorical features (e.g., product type) are often of great importance but sparse. As a widely
adopted solution, models based on Factorization Machines (FMs) are capable of modelling high-order
interactions among features for effective sparse predictive analytics. As the volume of web-scale
data grows exponentially over time, sparse predictive analytics inevitably involves dynamic
and sequential features. However, existing FM-based models assume no temporal orders in the data,
and are unable to capture the sequential dependencies or patterns within the dynamic features,
impeding the performance and adaptivity of these methods. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel
Sequence-Aware Factorization Machine (SeqFM) for temporal predictive analytics, which models
feature interactions by fully investigating the effect of sequential dependencies. As static
features (e.g., user gender) and dynamic features (e.g., user interacted items) express different
semantics, we innovatively devise a multi-view self-attention scheme that separately models
the effect of static features, dynamic features and the mutual interactions between static and
dynamic features in three different views. In SeqFM, we further map the learned representations
of feature interactions to the desired output with a shared residual network. To showcase the versatility
and generalizability of SeqFM, we test SeqFM in three popular application scenarios for FM-based
models, namely ranking, classification and regression tasks. Extensive experimental results
on six large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of SeqFM.
