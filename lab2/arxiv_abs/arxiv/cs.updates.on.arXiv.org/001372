Graphlets are small connected induced subgraphs of a larger graph $G$. Graphlets are now commonly
used to quantify local and global topology of networks in the field. Methods exist to exhaustively
enumerate all graphlets (and their orbits) in large networks as efficiently as possible using orbit
counting equations. However, the number of graphlets in $G$ is exponential in both the number of
nodes and edges in $G$. Enumerating them all is already unacceptably expensive on existing large
networks, and the problem will only get worse as networks continue to grow in size and density. Here
we introduce an efficient method designed to aid statistical sampling of graphlets up to size $k=8$
from a large network. We define graphettes as the generalization of graphlets allowing for disconnected
graphlets. Given a particular (undirected) graphette $g$, we introduce the idea of the canonical
graphette $\mathcal K(g)$ as a representative member of the isomorphism group $Iso(g)$ of $g$.
We compute the mapping $\mathcal K$, in the form of a lookup table, from all $2^{k(k-1)/2}$ undirected
graphettes $g$ of size $k\le 8$ to their canonical representatives $\mathcal K(g)$, as well as the
permutation that transforms $g$ to $\mathcal K(g)$. We also compute all automorphism orbits for
each canonical graphette. Thus, given any $k\le 8$ nodes in a graph $G$, we can in constant time infer
which graphette it is, as well as which orbit each of the $k$ nodes belongs to. Sampling a large number
$N$ of such $k$-sets of nodes provides an approximation of both the distribution of graphlets and
orbits across $G$, and the orbit degree vector at each node.
