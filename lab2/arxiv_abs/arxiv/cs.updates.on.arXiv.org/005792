The issue of synchronization in the power grid is receiving renewed attention, as new energy sources
with different dynamics enter the picture. Global metrics have been proposed to evaluate performance
and analyzed under highly simplified assumptions. In this paper, we extend this approach to more
realistic network scenarios and more closely connect it with metrics used in power engineering
practice. In particular, our analysis covers networks with generators of heterogeneous ratings
and richer dynamic models of machines. Under a suitable proportionality assumption in the parameters,
we show that the step response of bus frequencies can be decomposed in two components. The first component
is a {system-wide frequency} that captures the aggregate grid behavior, and the residual component
represents the individual bus frequency deviations from the aggregate. Using this decomposition,
we define --and compute in closed form-- several metrics that capture dynamic behaviors that are
of relevance for power engineers. In particular, using the \emph{system frequency}, we define
industry-style metrics (Nadir, RoCoF) that are evaluated through a representative machine. We
further use the norm of the residual component to define a \emph{synchronization cost} that can
appropriately quantify inter-area oscillations. Finally, we employ robustness analysis tools
to evaluate deviations from our proportionality assumption. We show that the system frequency
still captures the grid steady-state deviation, and becomes an accurate reduced-order model of
the grid as the network connectivity grows. Simulation studies with practically relevant data
are included to validate the theory and further illustrate the impact of network structure and parameters
on synchronization. Our analysis gives conclusions of practical interest, sometimes challenging
the conventional wisdom in the field.
