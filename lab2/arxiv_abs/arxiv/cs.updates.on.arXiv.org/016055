In recent years, various deep learning architectures have been proposed to solve complex challenges
(e.g., spatial dependency, temporal dependency) in traffic domain, which have achieved satisfactory
performance. These architectures are composed of multiple deep learning techniques in order to
tackle various challenges in traffic data. Traditionally, convolution neural networks (CNNs)
are utilized to model spatial dependency by decomposing the traffic network as grids. However,
many traffic networks are graph-structured in nature. In order to utilize such spatial information
fully, it's more appropriate to formulate traffic networks as graphs mathematically. Recently,
various novel deep learning techniques have been developed to process graph data, called graph
neural networks (GNNs). More and more works combine GNNs with other deep learning techniques to
construct an architecture dealing with various challenges in a complex traffic task, where GNNs
are responsible for extracting spatial correlations in traffic network. These graph-based architectures
have achieved state-of-the-art performance. To provide a comprehensive and clear picture of such
emerging trend, this survey carefully examines various graph-based deep learning architectures
in many traffic applications. We first give guidelines to formulate a traffic problem based on graph
and construct graphs from various traffic data. Then we decompose these graph-based architectures
to discuss their shared deep learning techniques, clarifying the utilization of each technique
in traffic tasks. What's more, we summarize common traffic challenges and the corresponding graph-based
deep learning solutions to each challenge. Finally, we provide benchmark datasets, open source
codes and future research directions in this rapidly growing field.
