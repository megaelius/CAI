Traffic-related pollution is becoming a major societal problem globally. Cyclists are particularly
exposed to this form of pollution due to their proximity to vehicles' tailpipes. In a number of recent
studies, it is been shown that exposure to this form of pollution eventually outweighs the cardio-vascular
benefits associated with cycling. Hence during cycling there are conflicting effects that affect
the cyclist. On the one hand, cycling effort gives rise to health benefits, whereas exposure to pollution
clearly does not. Mathematically speaking, these conflicting effects give rise to convex utility
functions that describe the health threats accrued to cyclists. More particularly, and roughly
speaking, for a given level of background pollution, there is an optimal length of journey time that
minimises the health risks to a cyclist. In this paper, we consider a group of cyclists that share
a common route. This may be recreational cyclists, or cyclists that travel together from an origin
to destination. Given this context, we ask the following question. What is the common speed at which
the cyclists should travel, so that the overall health risks can be minimised? We formulate this
as an optimisation problem with consensus constraints. More specifically, we design an intelligent
speed advisory system that recommends a common speed to a group of cyclists taking into account different
levels of fitness of the cycling group, or different levels of electric assist in the case that some
or all cyclists use e-bikes (electric bikes). To do this, we extend a recently derived consensus
result to the case of quasi-convex utility functions. Simulation studies in different scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system.
