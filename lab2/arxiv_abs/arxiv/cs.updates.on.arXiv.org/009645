The anomaly detection of time series is a hotspot of time series data mining. The own characteristics
of different anomaly detectors determine the abnormal data that they are good at. There is no detector
can be optimizing in all types of anomalies. Moreover, it still has difficulties in industrial production
due to problems such as a single detector can't be optimized at different time windows of the same
time series. This paper proposes an adaptive model based on time series characteristics and selecting
appropriate detector and run-time parameters for anomaly detection, which is called ATSDLN(Adaptive
Time Series Detector Learning Network). We take the time series as the input of the model, and learn
the time series representation through FCN. In order to realize the adaptive selection of detectors
and run-time parameters according to the input time series, the outputs of FCN are the inputs of two
sub-networks: the detector selection network and the run-time parameters selection network.
In addition, the way that the variable layer width design of the parameter selection sub-network
and the introduction of transfer learning make the model be with more expandability. Through experiments,
it is found that ATSDLN can select appropriate anomaly detector and run-time parameters, and have
strong expandability, which can quickly transfer. We investigate the performance of ATSDLN in
public data sets, our methods outperform other methods in most cases with higher effect and better
adaptation. We also show experimental results on public data sets to demonstrate how model structure
and transfer learning affect the effectiveness.
