Public safety networks avail to disseminate information during emergency situations through
its dedicated servers. Public safety networks accommodate public safety communication (PSC)
applications to track the location of its utilizers and enable to sustain transmissions even in
the crucial scenarios. Despite that, if the traditional setups responsible for PSCs are unavailable,
it becomes prodigiously arduous to handle any of the safety applications, which may cause havoc
in the society. Dependence on a secondary network may assist to solve such an issue. But, the secondary
networks should be facilely deployable and must not cause exorbitant overheads in terms of cost
and operation. For this, LoRaWAN can be considered as an ideal solution as it provides low power and
long-range communication. However, an excessive utilization of the secondary network may result
in high depletion of its own resources and can lead to a complete shutdown of services, which is a quandary
at hand. As a solution, this paper proposes a novel network model via a combination of LoRaWAN and
traditional public safety networks, and uses a self-enforcing agreement based game theory for
allocating resources efficiently amongst the available servers. The proposed approach adopts
memory and energy constraints as agreements, which are satisfied through Nash equilibrium. The
numerical results show that the proposed approach is capable of efficiently allocating the resources
with sufficiently high gains for resource conservation, network sustainability, resource restorations
and probability to continue at the present conditions even in the complete absence of traditional
Access Points (APs) compared with a baseline scenario with no failure of nodes.
