This work presents an overarching perspective on the role that machine intelligence can play in
enhancing human abilities, especially those that have been diminished due to injury or illness.
As a primary contribution, we develop the hypothesis that assistive devices, and specifically
artificial arms and hands, can and should be viewed as agents in order for us to most effectively improve
their collaboration with their human users. We believe that increased agency will enable more powerful
interactions between human users and next generation prosthetic devices, especially when the
sensorimotor space of the prosthetic technology greatly exceeds the conventional control and
communication channels available to a prosthetic user. To more concretely examine an agency-based
view on prosthetic devices, we propose a new schema for interpreting the capacity of a human-machine
collaboration as a function of both the human's and machine's degrees of agency. We then introduce
the idea of communicative capital as a way of thinking about the communication resources developed
by a human and a machine during their ongoing interaction. Using this schema of agency and capacity,
we examine the benefits and disadvantages of increasing the agency of a prosthetic limb. To do so,
we present an analysis of examples from the literature where building communicative capital has
enabled a progression of fruitful, task-directed interactions between prostheses and their human
users. We then describe further work that is needed to concretely evaluate the hypothesis that prostheses
are best thought of as agents. The agent-based viewpoint developed in this article significantly
extends current thinking on how best to support the natural, functional use of increasingly complex
prosthetic enhancements, and opens the door for more powerful interactions between humans and
their assistive technologies.
