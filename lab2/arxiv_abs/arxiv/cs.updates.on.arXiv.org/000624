Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks exhaust victim's bandwidth or services. Traditional
architecture of Internet is vulnerable to DDoS attacks and an ongoing cycle of attack & defense
is observed. In this paper, different types and techniques of DDoS attacks and their countermeasures
are reviewed. The significance of this paper is the coverage of many aspects of countering DDoS attacks
including new research on the topic. We survey different papers describing methods of defense against
DDoS attacks based on entropy variations, traffic anomaly parameters, neural networks, device
level defense, botnet flux identifications and application layer DDoS defense. We also discuss
some traditional methods of defense such as traceback and packet filtering techniques so that readers
can identify major differences between traditional and current techniques of defense against
DDoS attacks. Before the discussion on countermeasures, we mention different attack types under
DDoS with traditional and advanced schemes while some information on DDoS trends in the year 2012
Quarter-1 is also provided. We identify that application layer DDoS attacks possess the ability
to produce greater impact on the victim as they are driven by legitimate-like traffic making it quite
difficult to identify and distinguish from legitimate requests. The need of improved defense against
such attacks is therefore more demanding in research. The study conducted in this paper can be helpful
for readers and researchers to recognize better techniques of defense in current times against
DDoS attacks and contribute with more research on the topic in the light of future challenges identified
in this paper.
