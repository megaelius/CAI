This article addresses the sensitivity of sensor systems with minimal signal digitization complexity
regarding the estimation of analog model parameters. Digital measurements are exclusively available
in a hard-limited form, and the parameters of the analog received signals shall be inferred through
efficient algorithms. As a benchmark, the achievable estimation accuracy is to be assessed based
on theoretical error bounds. To this end, characterization of the parametric likelihood is required,
which forms a challenge for multivariate binary distributions. In this context, we analyze the
Fisher information matrix of the exponential family and derive a conservative approximation for
arbitrary models. The conservative information matrix rests on a surrogate exponential family,
defined by two equivalences to the real data-generating system. This probabilistic notion enables
designing estimators that consistently achieve the sensitivity level defined by the inverse of
the conservative information matrix without characterizing the distributions involved. For
parameter estimation with multivariate binary samples, using an equivalent quadratic exponential
distribution tames the computational complexity of the conservative information matrix such
that a quantitative assessment of the achievable error level becomes tractable. We exploit this
for the performance analysis concerning signal parameter estimation with an array of low-complexity
binary sensors by examining the achievable sensitivity in comparison to an ideal system featuring
receivers supporting data acquisition with infinite amplitude resolution. Additionally, we
demonstrate data-driven sensitivity analysis through the presented framework by learning the
guaranteed achievable performance when processing sensor data obtained with recursive binary
sampling schemes as implemented in $\Sigma\Delta$-modulating analog-to-digital converters.
