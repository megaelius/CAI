The management of security credentials (e.g., passwords, secret keys) for computational science
workflows is a burden for scientists and information security officers. Problems with credentials
(e.g., expiration, privilege mismatch) cause workflows to fail to fetch needed input data or store
valuable scientific results, distracting scientists from their research by requiring them to
diagnose the problems, re-run their computations, and wait longer for their results. In this paper,
we introduce SciTokens, open source software to help scientists manage their security credentials
more reliably and securely. We describe the SciTokens system architecture, design, and implementation
addressing use cases from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific
Collaboration and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) projects. We also present our integration
with widely-used software that supports distributed scientific computing, including HTCondor,
CVMFS, and XrootD. SciTokens uses IETF-standard OAuth tokens for capability-based secure access
to remote scientific data. The access tokens convey the specific authorizations needed by the workflows,
rather than general-purpose authentication impersonation credentials, to address the risks
of scientific workflows running on distributed infrastructure including NSF resources (e.g.,
LIGO Data Grid, Open Science Grid, XSEDE) and public clouds (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud,
Microsoft Azure). By improving the interoperability and security of scientific workflows, SciTokens
1) enables use of distributed computing for scientific domains that require greater data protection
and 2) enables use of more widely distributed computing resources by reducing the risk of credential
abuse on remote systems.
