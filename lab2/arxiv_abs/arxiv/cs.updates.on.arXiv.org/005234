Given a set of $n$ disks of radius $R$ in the Euclidean plane, the Traveling Salesman Problem With
Neighborhoods (TSPN) on uniform disks asks for the shortest tour that visits all of the disks. The
problem is a generalization of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) on points and has
been widely studied in the literature. For the case of disjoint uniform disks of radius $R$, Dumitrescu
and Mitchell[2001] show that the optimal TSP tour on the centers of the disks is a $3.547$-approximation
to the TSPN version. The core of their analysis is based on bounding the detour that the optimal TSPN
tour has to make in order to visit the centers of each disk and shows that it is at most $2Rn$ in the worst
case. H\"{a}me, Hyyti\"{a} and Hakula[2011] asked whether this bound is tight when $R$ is small
and conjectured that it is at most $\sqrt{3}Rn$. We further investigate this question and derive
structural properties of the optimal TSPN tour to describe the cases in which the bound is smaller
than $2Rn$. Specifically, we show that if the optimal TSPN tour is not a straight line, at least one
of the following is guaranteed to be true: the bound is smaller than $1.999Rn$ or the $TSP$ on the centers
is a $2$-approximation. The latter bound of $2$ is the best that we can get in general. Our framework
is based on using the optimality of the TSPN tour to identify local structures for which the detour
is large and then using their geometry to derive better lower bounds on the length of the TSPN tour.
This leads to an improved approximation factor of $3.53$ for disjoint uniform disks and $6.728$
for the general case. We further show that the H\"{a}me, Hyyti\"{a} and Hakula conjecture is true
for the case of three disks and discuss the method used to obtain it. Along the way, we will uncover
one way in which the TSPN problem is structurally different from the classical TSP.
