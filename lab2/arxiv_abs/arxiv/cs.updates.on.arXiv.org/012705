We investigate some algorithmic properties of closed set and half-space separation in abstract
closure systems. Assuming that the underlying closure system is finite and given by the corresponding
closure operator, we show that the half-space separation problem is NP-complete. In contrast,
for the relaxed problem of maximal closed set separation we give a greedy algorithm using linear
number of queries (i.e., closure operator calls) and show that this bound is sharp. For a second direction
to overcome the negative result above, we consider Kakutani closure systems and prove that they
are algorithmically characterized by the greedy algorithm. As one of the major potential application
fields, we then focus on Kakutani closure systems over graphs and generalize a fundamental characterization
result based on the Pasch axiom to graph structured partitioning of finite sets. In addition, we
give a sufficient condition for Kakutani closure systems over graphs in terms of graph minors. For
a second application field, we consider closure systems over finite lattices, present an adaptation
of the generic greedy algorithm to this kind of closure systems, and consider two potential applications.
We show that for the special case of subset lattices over finite ground sets, e.g., for formal concept
lattices, its query complexity is only logarithmic in the size of the lattice. The second application
is concerned with finite subsumption lattices in inductive logic programming. We show that our
method for separating two sets of first-order clauses from each other extends the traditional approach
based on least general generalizations of first-order clauses. Though our primary focus is on the
generality of the results obtained, we experimentally demonstrate the practical usefulness of
the greedy algorithm on binary classification problems in Kakutani and non-Kakutani closure systems.
