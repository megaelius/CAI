Space situation awareness (SSA) includes tracking of active and inactive resident space objects
(RSOs) and assessing the space environment through sensor data collection and processing. To enhance
SSA, the dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) framework couples on-line data with
off-line models to enhance system performance. Using feedback control, sensor management, and
communications reliability. For information management, there is a need for identity authentication
and access control to ensure the integrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities
access right to data and services. Due to decentralization and heterogeneity of SSA systems, it
is challenging to build an efficient centralized access control system, which could either be a
performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. Inspired by the blockchain and smart contract
technology, this paper introduces BlendCAC, a decentralized authentication and capability-based
access control mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services and information
in SSA networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the BlendCAC leverages the blockchain
to create virtual trust zones and a robust identity-based capability token management strategy
is proposed. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained
devices and more powerful computing devices, and is tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network.
The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC scheme to offer a decentralized,
scalable, lightweight and fine-grained access control solution for space system towards SSA.
