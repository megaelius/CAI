Automated theorem proving has long been a key task of artificial intelligence. Proofs form the bedrock
of rigorous scientific inquiry. Many tools for both partially and fully automating their derivations
have been developed over the last half a century. Some examples of state-of-the-art provers are
E (Schulz, 2013), VAMPIRE (Kov\'acs & Voronkov, 2013), and Prover9 (McCune, 2005-2010). Newer
theorem provers, such as E, use superposition calculus in place of more traditional resolution
and tableau based methods. There have also been a number of past attempts to apply machine learning
methods to guiding proof search. Suttner & Ertel proposed a multilayer-perceptron based method
using hand-engineered features as far back as 1990; Urban et al (2011) apply machine learning to
tableau calculus; and Loos et al (2017) recently proposed a method for guiding the E theorem prover
using deep nerual networks. All of this prior work, however, has one common limitation: they all
rely on the axioms of classical first-order logic. Very little attention has been paid to automated
theorem proving for non-classical logics. One of the only recent examples is McLaughlin & Pfenning
(2008) who applied the polarized inverse method to intuitionistic propositional logic. The literature
is otherwise mostly silent. This is truly unfortunate, as there are many reasons to desire non-classical
proofs over classical. Constructive/intuitionistic proofs should be of particular interest
to computer scientists thanks to the well-known Curry-Howard correspondence (Howard, 1980) which
tells us that all terminating programs correspond to a proof in intuitionistic logic and vice versa.
This work explores using Q-learning (Watkins, 1989) to inform proof search for a specific system
called non-classical logic called Core Logic (Tennant, 2017).
