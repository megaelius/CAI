Exploiting already deployed WLANs has attracted considerable attention, as an efficient and practical
method to improve the performance of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a novel communication
paradigm to satisfy the performance demands of the future wireless networks: a hybrid Cellular-WLAN
network with wireless offloading. In contrast to the commonly adopted practice of the WiFi offloading,
where the WLAN APs have a wired backhaul, we propose a wireless offloading approach, where the WLAN
APs will share their wireless cellular broadband connection with other users. These users will
select their serving node, i.e., the macro-cell base station or a WLAN AP, based on a certain selection
criterion. This is a challenging architecture, where interfering effects and wireless resources
limitations play a dominant role. Performance metrics of the proposed hybrid scheme are theoretically
studied and closed form expressions are derived for the single-user case with multiple interferers,
considering non identically channels. Furthermore, considering a multi-cell network scenario
the proposed hybrid scheme is optimized for minimizing the intercell interference and a fast greedy
algorithm is proposed for solving this optimization problem. Moreover, based on the general multi-cellular
hybrid WLAN/Celullar concept, we present a novel scheme for achieving frequency reuse one within
a single macro-cell, under specific performance criteria and constraints that guarantee the overall
cell or the individual user QoS requirements. We consider two optimization problems that aim at
the overall cell SINR maximization or at the minimum user SINR maximization and we propose a fast
greedy solution. Numerical results showed that the proposed wireless architecture may offer significant
performance gains in the presence of multiple interferers, compared to a conventional cellular
network.
