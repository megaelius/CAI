Both neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments have pointed out the crucial role of recurrent
and feedback connections to process context-dependent information in the early visual cortex.
While numerous models have accounted for feedback effects at either neural or representational
level, none of them were able to bind those two levels of analysis. Is it possible to describe feedback
effects at both levels using the same model? We answer this question by combining Predictive Coding
(PC) and Sparse Coding (SC) into a hierarchical and convolutional framework. In this Sparse Deep
Predictive Coding (SDPC) model, the SC component models the internal recurrent processing within
each layer, and the PC component describes the interactions between layers using feedforward and
feedback connections. Here, we train a 2-layered SDPC on two different databases of images, and
we interpret it as a model of the early visual system (V1 & V2). We first demonstrate that once the training
has converged, SDPC exhibits oriented and localized receptive fields in V1 and more complex features
in V2. Second, we analyze the effects of feedback on the neural organization beyond the classical
receptive field of V1 neurons using interaction maps. These maps are similar to association fields
and reflect the Gestalt principle of good continuation. We demonstrate that feedback signals reorganize
interaction maps and modulate neural activity to promote contour integration. Third, we demonstrate
at the representational level that the SDPC feedback connections are able to overcome noise in input
images. Therefore, the SDPC captures the association field principle at the neural level which
results in better disambiguation of blurred images at the representational level.
