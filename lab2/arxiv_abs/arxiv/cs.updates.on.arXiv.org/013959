While recent progress in quantum hardware open the door for significant speedup in certain key areas,
quantum algorithms are still hard to implement right, and the validation of such quantum programs
is a challenge. Early attempts either suffer from the lack of automation or parametrized reasoning,
or require the user to write specifications and algorithms far from those presented in research
articles or textbooks, and as a consequence, no significant quantum algorithm implementation
has been currently verified in a scale-invariant manner. We propose QBRICKS, the first development
environment for certified quantum programs featuring clear separation between code and proof,
scale-invariance specification and proof, high degree of proof automation and allowing to encode
quantum programs in a natural way, i.e. close to textbook style. This environment features a new
domain-specific language for quantum programs, namely QBRICKS-DSL, together with a new logical
specification language QBRICKS-SPEC . Especially, we introduce and intensively build upon HOPS,
a higher-order extension of the recent path-sum semantics, used for both specification (parametrized,
versatile) and automation (closure properties). QBRICKS builds on best practice of formal verification
for the classic case and tailor them to the quantum case. To illustrate the opportunity of QBRICKS
, we implement the first scale-invariant verified implementations of non-trivial quantum algorithms,
namely phase estimation (QPE) -- the purely quantum part of Shor algorithm for integer factoring
-- and Grover search. It proves by fact that applying formal verification to real quantum programs
is possible and should be further developed.
