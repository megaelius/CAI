Background. Previous state-of-the-art systems on Drug Name Recognition (DNR) and Clinical Concept
Extraction (CCE) have focused on a combination of text "feature engineering" and conventional
machine learning algorithms such as conditional random fields and support vector machines. However,
developing good features is inherently heavily time-consuming. Conversely, more modern machine
learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have proved capable of automatically
learning effective features from either random assignments or automated word "embeddings". Objectives.
(i) To create a highly accurate DNR and CCE system that avoids conventional, time-consuming feature
engineering. (ii) To create richer, more specialized word embeddings by using health domain datasets
such as MIMIC-III. (iii) To evaluate our systems over three contemporary datasets. Methods. Two
deep learning methods, namely the Bidirectional LSTM and the Bidirectional LSTM-CRF, are evaluated.
A CRF model is set as the baseline to compare the deep learning systems to a traditional machine learning
approach. The same features are used for all the models. Results. We have obtained the best results
with the Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model, which has outperformed all previously proposed systems.
The specialized embeddings have helped to cover unusual words in DDI-DrugBank and DDI-MedLine,
but not in the 2010 i2b2/VA IRB Revision dataset. Conclusion. We present a state-of-the-art system
for DNR and CCE. Automated word embeddings has allowed us to avoid costly feature engineering and
achieve higher accuracy. Nevertheless, the embeddings need to be retrained over datasets that
are adequate for the domain, in order to adequately cover the domain-specific vocabulary.
