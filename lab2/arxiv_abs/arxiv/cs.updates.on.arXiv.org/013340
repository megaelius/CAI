The last decade brought a significant increase in the amount of data and a variety of new inference
methods for reconstructing the detailed evolutionary history of various cancers. This brings
the need of designing efficient procedures for comparing rooted trees representing the evolution
of mutations in tumor phylogenies. Bernardini et al. [CPM 2019] recently introduced a notion of
the rearrangement distance for fully-labelled trees motivated by this necessity. This notion
originates from two operations: one that permutes the labels of the nodes, the other that affects
the topology of the tree. Each operation alone defines a distance that can be computed in polynomial
time, while the actual rearrangement distance, that combines the two, was proven to be NP-hard.
We answer two open question left unanswered by the previous work. First, what is the complexity of
computing the permutation distance? Second, is there a constant-factor approximation algorithm
for estimating the rearrangement distance between two arbitrary trees? We answer the first one
by showing, via a two-way reduction, that calculating the permutation distance between two trees
on $n$ nodes is equivalent, up to polylogarithmic factors, to finding the largest cardinality matching
in a sparse bipartite graph. In particular, by plugging in the algorithm of Liu and Sidford [ArXiv
2019], we obtain an $O(n^{11/8})$ time algorithm for computing the permutation distance between
two trees on $n$ nodes. Then we answer the second question positively, and design a linear-time constant-factor
approximation algorithm that does not need any assumption on the trees.
