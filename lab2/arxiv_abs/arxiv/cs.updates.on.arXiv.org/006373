Brain imaging analysis on clinically acquired computed tomography (CT) is essential for the diagnosis,
risk prediction of progression, and treatment of the structural phenotypes of traumatic brain
injury (TBI). However, in real clinical imaging scenarios, entire body CT images (e.g., neck, abdomen,
chest, pelvis) are typically captured along with whole brain CT scans. For instance, in a typical
sample of clinical TBI imaging cohort, only ~15% of CT scans actually contain whole brain CT images
suitable for volumetric brain analyses; the remaining are partial brain or non-brain images. Therefore,
a manual image retrieval process is typically required to isolate the whole brain CT scans from the
entire cohort. However, the manual image retrieval is time and resource consuming and even more
difficult for the larger cohorts. To alleviate the manual efforts, in this paper we propose an automated
3D medical image retrieval pipeline, called deep montage-based image retrieval (dMIR), which
performs classification on 2D montage images via a deep convolutional neural network. The novelty
of the proposed method for image processing is to characterize the medical image retrieval task
based on the montage images. In a cohort of 2000 clinically acquired TBI scans, 794 scans were used
as training data, 206 scans were used as validation data, and the remaining 1000 scans were used as
testing data. The proposed achieved accuracy=1.0, recall=1.0, precision=1.0, f1=1.0 for validation
data, while achieved accuracy=0.988, recall=0.962, precision=0.962, f1=0.962 for testing data.
Thus, the proposed dMIR is able to perform accurate CT whole brain image retrieval from large-scale
clinical cohorts.
