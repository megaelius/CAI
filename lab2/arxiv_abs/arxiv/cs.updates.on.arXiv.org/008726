There are hardly any data sets publicly available that can be used to evaluate intrusion detection
algorithms. The biggest threat for industrial applications arises from state-sponsored and criminal
groups. Often, formerly unknown exploits are employed by these attackers, so-called 0-day exploits.
They cannot be discovered with signature-based intrusion detection. Thus, statistical or machine
learning based anomaly detection lends itself readily. These methods especially, however, need
a large amount of labelled training data. In this work, an exemplary industrial use case with real-world
industrial hardware is presented. Siemens S7 Programmable Logic Controllers are used to control
a real world-based control application using the OPC UA protocol: A pump, filling and emptying water
tanks. This scenario is used to generate application specific network data. Furthermore, attacks
are introduced into this data set. This is done in three ways: First, the normal process is monitored
and captured. Common attacks are then synthetically introduced into this data set. Second, malicious
behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller program and executed live, the traffic
is captured as well. Third, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller
while still keeping the same output behaviour as in normal operation. An attacker could exploit
an application but forge valid sensor output so that no anomaly is detected. Sensors are employed,
capturing temperature, sound and flow of water to create data that can be correlated to the network
data and used to still detect the attack. All data is labelled, containing the ground truth, meaning
all attacks are known and no unknown attacks occur. This makes them perfect for training of anomaly
detection algorithms. The data is published to enable security researchers to evaluate intrusion
detection solutions.
