Beyond space exploration, the next critical step towards living and working in space requires developing
a space economy. One important challenge with this space-economy is ensuring the low-cost transport
of raw materials from one gravity-well to another. The escape delta-v of 11.2 km/s from Earth makes
this proposition very expensive. Transporting materials from the Moon takes 2.4 km/s and from Mars
5.0 km/s. Based on these factors, the Moon and Mars can become colonies to export material into this
space economy. One critical question is what are the resources required to sustain a space economy?
Water has been identified as a critical resource both to sustain human-life but also for use in propulsion,
attitude-control, power, thermal storage and radiation protection systems. Water may be obtained
off-world through In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) in the course of human or robotic space exploration.
Based upon these important findings, we developed an energy model to determine the feasibility
of developing a mining base on Mars that mines and exports water (transports water on a Mars escape
trajectory). Our designs for a mining base utilize renewable energy sources namely photovoltaics
and solar-thermal concentrators to provide power to construct the base, keep it operational and
export the water using a mass driver (electrodynamic railgun). Our studies found the key to keeping
the mining base simple and effective is to make it robotic. Teams of robots (consisting of 100 infrastructure
robots) would be used to construct the entire base using locally available resources and fully operate
the base. This would decrease energy needs by 5-folds. Furthermore, the base can be built 5-times
faster using robotics and 3D printing. This shows that automation and robotics is the key to making
such a base technologically feasible.
