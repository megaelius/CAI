Graph Balancing is the problem of orienting the edges of a weighted multigraph so as to minimize the
maximum weighted in-degree. Since the introduction of the problem the best algorithm known achieves
an approximation ratio of $1.75$ and it is based on rounding a linear program with this exact integrality
gap. It is also known that there is no $(1.5 - \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, unless $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{NP}$.
Can we do better than $1.75$? We prove that a different LP formulation, the configuration LP, has
a strictly smaller integrality gap. Graph Balancing was the last one in a group of related problems
from literature, for which it was open whether the configuration LP is stronger than previous, simple
LP relaxations. We base our proof on a local search approach that has been applied successfully to
the more general Restricted Assignment problem, which in turn is a prominent special case of makespan
minimization on unrelated machines. With a number of technical novelties we are able to obtain a
bound of $1.749$ for the case of Graph Balancing. It is not clear whether the local search algorithm
we present terminates in polynomial time, which means that the bound is non-constructive. However,
it is a strong evidence that a better approximation algorithm is possible using the configuration
LP and it allows the optimum to be estimated within a factor better than $1.75$. A particularly interesting
aspect of our techniques is the way we handle small edges in the local search. We manage to exploit
the configuration constraints enforced on small edges in the LP. This may be of interest to other
problems such as Restricted Assignment as well.
