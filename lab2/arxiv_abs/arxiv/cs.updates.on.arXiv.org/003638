Microservice Architecture (MSA) is a novel service-based architectural style for distributed
software systems. Compared to Service-oriented Architecture (SOA), MSA puts a stronger focus
on self-containment of services. Each microservice is responsible for realizing exactly one business
or technological capability that is distinct from other services' capabilities. Additionally,
on the implementation and operation level, microservices are self-contained in that they are developed,
tested, deployed and operated independently from each other. Next to these characteristics that
distinguish MSA from SOA, both architectural styles rely on services as building blocks of distributed
software architecture and hence face similar challenges regarding, e.g., service identification,
composition and provisioning. However, in contrast to MSA, SOA may rely on an extensive body of knowledge
to tackle these challenges. Thus, due to both architectural styles being service-based, the question
arises to what degree MSA might draw on existing findings of SOA research and practice. In this paper
we address this question in the field of Model-driven Development (MDD) for design and operation
of service-based architectures. Therefore, we present an analysis of existing MDD approaches
to SOA, which comprises the identification and semantic clustering of modeling concepts for SOA
design and operation. For each concept cluster, the analysis assesses its applicability to MDD
of MSA (MSA-MDD) and assigns it to a specific modeling viewpoint. The goal of the presented analysis
is to provide a conceptual foundation for an MSA-MDD metamodel.
