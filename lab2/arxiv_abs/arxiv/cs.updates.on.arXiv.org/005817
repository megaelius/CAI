In this paper, we study the dynamic assortment optimization problem under a finite selling season
of length $T$. At each time period, the seller offers an arriving customer an assortment of substitutable
products under a cardinality constraint, and the customer makes the purchase among offered products
according to a discrete choice model. Most existing work associates each product with a real-valued
fixed mean utility and assumes a multinomial logit choice (MNL) model. In many practical applications,
feature/contexutal information of products is readily available. In this paper, we incorporate
the feature information by assuming a linear relationship between the mean utility and the feature.
In addition, we allow the feature information of products to change over time so that the underlying
choice model can also be non-stationary. To solve the dynamic assortment optimization under this
changing contextual MNL model, we need to simultaneously learn the underlying unknown coefficient
and makes the decision on the assortment. To this end, we develop an upper confidence bound (UCB)
based policy and establish the regret bound on the order of $\widetilde O(d\sqrt{T})$, where $d$
is the dimension of the feature and $\widetilde O$ suppresses logarithmic dependence. We further
established the lower bound $\Omega(d\sqrt{T}/K)$ where $K$ is the cardinality constraint of
an offered assortment, which is usually small. When $K$ is a constant, our policy is optimal up to
logarithmic factors. In the exploitation phase of the UCB algorithm, we need to solve a combinatorial
optimization for assortment optimization based on the learned information. We further develop
an approximation algorithm and an efficient greedy heuristic. The effectiveness of the proposed
policy is further demonstrated by our numerical studies.
