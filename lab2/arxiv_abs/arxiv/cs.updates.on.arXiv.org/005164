Timely and reliable detection of abrupt anomalies, e.g., faults, intrusions/attacks, is crucial
for real-time monitoring and security of many modern systems such as the smart grid and the Internet
of Things (IoT) networks that produce high-dimensional data. With this goal, we propose effective
and scalable algorithms for real-time anomaly detection in high-dimensional settings. Our proposed
algorithms are nonparametric (model-free) as both the nominal and anomalous multivariate data
distributions are assumed to be unknown. We extract useful univariate summary statistics and perform
the anomaly detection task in a single-dimensional space. We model anomalies as persistent outliers
and propose to detect them via a cumulative sum (CUSUM)-like algorithm. In case the observed data
stream has a low intrinsic dimensionality, we find a low-dimensional submanifold in which the nominal
data are embedded and then evaluate whether the sequentially acquired data persistently deviate
from the nominal submanifold. Further, in the general case, we determine an acceptance region for
nominal data via the Geometric Entropy Minimization (GEM) method and then evaluate whether the
sequentially observed data persistently fall outside the acceptance region. We provide an asymptotic
lower bound on the average false alarm period of the proposed CUSUM-like algorithm. Moreover, we
provide a sufficient condition to asymptotically guarantee that the decision statistic of the
proposed algorithm does not diverge in the absence of anomalies. Numerical studies illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in quick and accurate detection of changes/anomalies
in a variety of high-dimensional settings.
