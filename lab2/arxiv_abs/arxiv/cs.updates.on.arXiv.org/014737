The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of the
global population. A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected
patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiological imaging using chest radiography.
Motivated by this, a number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on deep learning have
been proposed and results have been shown to be quite promising in terms of accuracy in detecting
patients infected with COVID-19 using chest radiography images. However, to the best of the authors'
knowledge, these developed AI systems have been closed source and unavailable to the research community
for deeper understanding and extension, and unavailable for public access and use. Therefore,
in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the
detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the
general public. We also describe the CXR dataset leveraged to train COVID-Net, which we will refer
to as COVIDx and is comprised of 13,800 chest radiography images across 13,725 patient patient cases
from three open access data repositories, one of which we introduced. Furthermore, we investigate
how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to gain deeper insights
into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening.
By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the
description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by
both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate
yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of
those who need it the most.
