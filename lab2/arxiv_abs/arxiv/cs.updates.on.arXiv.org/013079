We analyse perception and memory, using mathematical models for knowledge graphs and tensors,
to gain insights into the corresponding functionalities of the human mind. Our discussion is based
on the concept of propositional sentences consisting of \textit{subject-predicate-object}
(SPO) triples for expressing elementary facts. SPO sentences are the basis for most natural languages
but might also be important for explicit perception and declarative memories, as well as intra-brain
communication and the ability to argue and reason. A set of SPO sentences can be described as a knowledge
graph, which can be transformed into an adjacency tensor. We introduce tensor models, where concepts
have dual representations as indices and associated embeddings, two constructs we believe are
essential for the understanding of implicit and explicit perception and memory in the brain. We
argue that a biological realization of perception and memory imposes constraints on information
processing. In particular, we propose that explicit perception and declarative memories require
a semantic decoder, which, in a simple realization, is based on four layers: First, a sensory memory
layer, as a buffer for sensory input, second, an index layer representing concepts, third, a memoryless
representation layer for the broadcasting of information ---the "blackboard", or the "canvas"
of the brain--- and fourth, a working memory layer as a processing center and data buffer. We discuss
the operations of the four layers and relate them to the global workspace theory. In a Bayesian brain
interpretation, semantic memory defines the prior for observable triple statements. We propose
that ---in evolution and during development--- semantic memory, episodic memory, and natural
language evolved as emergent properties in agents' process to gain a deeper understanding of sensory
information.
