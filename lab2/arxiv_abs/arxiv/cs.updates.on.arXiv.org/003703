Brain extraction from images is a common pre-processing step. Many approaches exist, but they are
frequently only designed to perform brain extraction from images without strong pathologies.
Extracting the brain from images with strong pathologies, for example, the presence of a tumor or
of a traumatic brain injury, is challenging. In such cases, tissue appearance may deviate from normal
tissue and violates algorithmic assumptions for these approaches; hence, the brain may not be correctly
extracted. This paper proposes a brain extraction approach which can explicitly account for pathologies
by jointly modeling normal tissue and pathologies. Specifically, our model uses a three-part image
decomposition: (1) normal tissue appearance is captured by principal component analysis, (2)
pathologies are captured via a total variation term, and (3) non-brain tissue is captured by a sparse
term. Decomposition and image registration steps are alternated to allow statistical modeling
in a fixed atlas space. As a beneficial side effect, the model allows for the identification of potential
pathologies and the reconstruction of a quasi-normal image in atlas space. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method on four datasets: the IBSR and LPBA40 datasets which show normal images, the BRATS dataset
containing images with brain tumors and a dataset containing clinical TBI images. We compare the
performance with other popular models: ROBEX, BEaST, MASS, BET, BSE and a recently proposed deep
learning approach. Our model performs better than these competing methods on all four datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves the best median (97.11) and mean (96.88) Dice scores over all datasets.
The two best performing competitors, ROBEX and MASS, achieve scores of 96.23/95.62 and 96.67/94.25
respectively. Hence, our approach is an effective method for high quality brain extraction on a
wide variety of images.
