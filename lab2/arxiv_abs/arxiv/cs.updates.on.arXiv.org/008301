Community detection in graphs, data clustering, and local pattern mining are three mature fields
of data mining and machine learning. In recent years, attributed subgraph mining is emerging as
a new powerful data mining task in the intersection of these areas. Given a graph and a set of attributes
for each vertex, attributed subgraph mining aims to find cohesive subgraphs for which (a subset
of) the attribute values has exceptional values in some sense. While research on this task can borrow
from the three abovementioned fields, the principled integration of graph and attribute data poses
two challenges: the definition of a pattern language that is intuitive and lends itself to efficient
search strategies, and the formalization of the interestingness of such patterns. We propose an
integrated solution to both of these challenges. The proposed pattern language improves upon prior
work in being both highly flexible and intuitive. We show how an effective and principled algorithm
can enumerate patterns of this language. The proposed approach for quantifying interestingness
of patterns of this language is rooted in information theory, and is able to account for prior knowledge
on the data. Prior work typically quantifies interestingness based on the cohesion of the subgraph
and for the exceptionality of its attributes separately, combining these in a parametrized trade-off.
Instead, in our proposal this trade-off is implicitly handled in a principled, parameter-free
manner. Extensive empirical results confirm the proposed pattern syntax is intuitive, and the
interestingness measure aligns well with actual subjective interestingness.
