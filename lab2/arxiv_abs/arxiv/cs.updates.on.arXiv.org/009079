The Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model has gained prominence in recent
years with the discovery that it unifies a rich variety of combinatorial optimization problems.
By its association with the Ising problem in physics, the QUBO model has emerged as an underpinning
of the quantum computing area known as quantum annealing and has become a subject of study in neuromorphic
computing. Through these connections, QUBO models lie at the heart of experimentation carried
out with quantum computers developed by D-Wave Systems and neuromorphic computers developed by
IBM. Computational experience is being amassed by both the classical and the quantum computing
communities that highlights not only the potential of the QUBO model but also its effectiveness
as an alternative to traditional modeling and solution methodologies. This tutorial discloses
the basic features of the QUBO model that give it the power and flexibility to encompass the range
of applications that have thrust it onto center stage of the optimization field. We show how many
different types of constraining relationships arising in practice can be embodied within the "unconstrained"
QUBO formulation in a very natural manner using penalty functions, yielding exact model representations
in contrast to the approximate representations produced by customary uses of penalty functions.
Each step of generating such models is illustrated in detail by simple numerical examples, to highlight
the convenience of using QUBO models in numerous settings. We also describe recent innovations
for solving QUBO models that offer a fertile avenue for integrating classical and quantum computing
and for applying these models in machine learning.
