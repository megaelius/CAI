The rapid dynamics of COVID-19 calls for quick and effective tracking of virus transmission chains
and early detection of outbreaks, especially in the phase 2 of the pandemic, when lockdown and other
restriction measures are progressively withdrawn, in order to avoid or minimize contagion resurgence.
For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale adoption by many countries.
A centralized approach, where data sensed by the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises
concerns about citizens' privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us
to the need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We advocate the
conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected
exclusively in individual citizens' "personal data stores", to be shared separately and selectively,
voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving
level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords
multiple benefits: it allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving
fashion; and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak hotspots
on more finely-granulated geographic scale. Our recommendation is two-fold. First to extend existing
decentralized architectures with a light touch, in order to manage the collection of location data
locally on the device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates - if and when they want,
for specific aims - with health authorities, for instance. Second, we favour a longer-term pursuit
of realizing a Personal Data Store vision, giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective
good in the measure they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for
rebuilding society.
