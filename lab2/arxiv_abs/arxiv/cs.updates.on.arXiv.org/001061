Characterization of the uncertainty in robotic manipulators is the focus of this paper. Based on
the random matrix theory (RMT), we propose uncertainty characterization schemes in which the uncertainty
is modeled at the macro (system) level. This is different from the traditional approaches that model
the uncertainty in the parametric space of micro (state) level. We show that perturbing the system
matrices rather than the state of the system provides unique advantages especially for robotic
manipulators. First, it requires only limited statistical information that becomes effective
when dealing with complex systems where detailed information on their variability is not available.
Second, the RMT-based models are aware of the system state and configuration that are significant
factors affecting the level of uncertainty in system behavior. In this study, in addition to the
motion uncertainty analysis that was first proposed in our earlier work, we also develop an RMT-based
model for the quantification of the static wrench uncertainty in multi-agent cooperative systems.
This model is aimed to be an alternative to the elaborate parametric formulation when only rough
bounds are available on the system parameters. We discuss that how RMT-based model becomes advantageous
when the complexity of the system increases. We perform experimental studies on a KUKA youBot arm
to demonstrate the superiority of the RMT-based motion uncertainty models. We show that how these
models outperform the traditional models built upon Gaussianity assumption in capturing real-system
uncertainty and providing accurate bounds on the state estimation errors. In addition, to experimentally
support our wrench uncertainty quantification model, we study the behavior of a cooperative system
of mobile robots. It is shown that one can rely on less demanding RMT-based formulation and yet meets
the acceptable accuracy.
