The complexity of droplet microfluidics grows by implementing parallel processes and multiple
functionalities on a single device. This poses a challenge to the engineer designing the microfluidic
networks. In today's design processes, the engineer relies on calculations, assumptions, simplifications,
as well as his/her experiences and intuitions. In order to validate the obtained specification
of the microfluidic network, usually a prototype is fabricated and physical experiments are conducted
thus far. In case the design does not implement the desired functionality, this prototyping iteration
is repeated - obviously resulting in an expensive and time-consuming design process. In order to
avoid unnecessary prototyping loops, simulation methods could help to validate the specification
of the microfluidic network before any prototype is fabricated. However, state-of-the-art simulation
tools come with severe limitations, which prevent their utilization for practically-relevant
applications. More precisely, they are often not dedicated to droplet microfluidics, cannot handle
the required physical phenomena, are not publicly available, and can hardly be extended. In this
work, we present an advanced simulation approach for droplet microfluidics which addresses these
shortcomings and, eventually, allows to simulate practically-relevant applications. To this
end, we propose a simulation framework which directly works on the specification of the design,
supports essential physical phenomena, is publicly available, and easy to extend. Evaluations
and case studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed simulator: While current state-of-the-art
tools were not applicable for practically-relevant microfluidic networks, the proposed solution
allows to reduce the design time and costs e.g. of a drug screening device from one person month and
USD 1200, respectively, to just a fraction of that.
