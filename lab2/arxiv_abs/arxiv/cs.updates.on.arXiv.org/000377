Over the last decade, a number of Computational Imaging (CI) systems have been proposed for tasks
such as motion deblurring, defocus deblurring and multispectral imaging. These techniques increase
the amount of light reaching the sensor via multiplexing and then undo the deleterious effects of
multiplexing by appropriate reconstruction algorithms. Given the widespread appeal and the considerable
enthusiasm generated by these techniques, a detailed performance analysis of the benefits conferred
by this approach is important. Unfortunately, a detailed analysis of CI has proven to be a challenging
problem because performance depends equally on three components: (1) the optical multiplexing,
(2) the noise characteristics of the sensor, and (3) the reconstruction algorithm. A few recent
papers have performed analysis taking multiplexing and noise characteristics into account. However,
analysis of CI systems under state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, most of which exploit
signal prior models, has proven to be unwieldy. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis
framework incorporating all three components. In order to perform this analysis, we model the signal
priors using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A GMM prior confers two unique characteristics. Firstly,
GMM satisfies the universal approximation property which says that any prior density function
can be approximated to any fidelity using a GMM with appropriate number of mixtures. Secondly, a
GMM prior lends itself to analytical tractability allowing us to derive simple expressions for
the `minimum mean square error' (MMSE), which we use as a metric to characterize the performance
of CI systems. We use our framework to analyze several previously proposed CI techniques, giving
conclusive answer to the question: `How much performance gain is due to use of a signal prior and how
much is due to multiplexing?
