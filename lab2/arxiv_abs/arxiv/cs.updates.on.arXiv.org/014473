With the advent of Cardiac Cine Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Imaging, there has been a paradigm shift
in medical technology, thanks to its capability of imaging different structures within the heart
without ionizing radiation. However, it is very challenging to conduct pre-operative planning
of minimally invasive cardiac procedures without accurate segmentation and identification of
the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV) blood-pool, and LV-myocardium. Manual segmentation
of those structures, nevertheless, is time-consuming and often prone to error and biased outcomes.
Hence, automatic and computationally efficient segmentation techniques are paramount. In this
work, we propose a novel memory-efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture as
a modification of both CondenseNet, as well as DenseNet for ventricular blood-pool segmentation
by introducing a bottleneck block and an upsampling path. Our experiments show that the proposed
architecture runs on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset using half (50%)
the memory requirement of DenseNet and one-twelfth (~ 8%) of the memory requirements of U-Net, while
still maintaining excellent accuracy of cardiac segmentation. We validated the framework on the
ACDC dataset featuring one healthy and four pathology groups whose heart images were acquired throughout
the cardiac cycle and achieved the mean dice scores of 96.78% (LV blood-pool), 93.46% (RV blood-pool)
and 90.1% (LV-Myocardium). These results are promising and promote the proposed methods as a competitive
tool for cardiac image segmentation and clinical parameter estimation that has the potential to
provide fast and accurate results, as needed for pre-procedural planning and/or pre-operative
applications.
