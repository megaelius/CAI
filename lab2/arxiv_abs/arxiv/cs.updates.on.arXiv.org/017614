We propose and analyze a recipient-anonymous stochastic routing model to study a fundamental trade-off
between anonymity and routing delay. An agent wants to quickly reach a goal vertex in a network through
a sequence of routing actions, while an overseeing adversary observes the agent's entire trajectory
and tries to identify her goal among those vertices traversed. We are interested in understanding
the probability that the adversary can correctly identify the agent's goal (anonymity), as a function
of the time it takes the agent to reach it (delay). A key feature of our model is the presence of intrinsic
uncertainty in the environment, so that each of the agent's intended steps is subject to random perturbation
and thus may not materialize as planned. Using large-network asymptotics, our main results provide
near-optimal characterization of the anonymity-delay trade-off under a number of network topologies.
We establish an asymptotically tight characterization of the anonymity-delay trade-off in complete
graphs, showing that (1) any level of intrinsic uncertainty will lead to a strictly positive delay
overhead for the agent, even as her delay budget tends to infinity, and (2) a carefully designed routing
policy can ensure the overhead is only additive with respect to the level of the uncertainty. We further
extend the results to networks generated by random graph models, and settings where the network
structure can be designed. In both cases, we show it is possible to achieve an additive overhead even
for relatively sparse, non-complete networks. Our main technical contributions are centered
around a new class of "noise-harnessing" routing strategies that adaptively combine intrinsic
uncertainty from the environment with additional artificial randomization to achieve provably
efficient obfuscation.
