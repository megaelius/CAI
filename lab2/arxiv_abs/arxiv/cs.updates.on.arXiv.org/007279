Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is a kind of head tumor with an extraordinarily complex treatment
process. The survival period is typically 14-16 months, and the 2 year survival rate is approximately
26%-33%. The clinical treatment strategies for the pseudoprogression (PsP) and true tumor progression
(TTP) of GBM are different, so accurately distinguishing these two conditions is particularly
significant.As PsP and TTP of GBM are similar in shape and other characteristics, it is hard to distinguish
these two forms with precision. In order to differentiate them accurately, this paper introduces
a feature learning method based on a generative adversarial network: DC-Al GAN. GAN consists of
two architectures: generator and discriminator. Alexnet is used as the discriminator in this work.
Owing to the adversarial and competitive relationship between generator and discriminator, the
latter extracts highly concise features during training. In DC-Al GAN, features are extracted
from Alexnet in the final classification phase, and the highly nature of them contributes positively
to the classification accuracy.The generator in DC-Al GAN is modified by the deep convolutional
generative adversarial network (DCGAN) by adding three convolutional layers. This effectively
generates higher resolution sample images. Feature fusion is used to combine high layer features
with low layer features, allowing for the creation and use of more precise features for classification.
The experimental results confirm that DC-Al GAN achieves high accuracy on GBM datasets for PsP and
TTP image classification, which is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.
