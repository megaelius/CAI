Service robots are appearing more and more in our daily life. The development of service robots combines
multiple fields of research, from object perception to object manipulation. The state-of-the-art
continues to improve to make a proper coupling between object perception and manipulation. This
coupling is necessary for service robots not only to perform various tasks in a reasonable amount
of time but also to continually adapt to new environments and safely interact with non-expert human
users. Nowadays, robots are able to recognize various objects, and quickly plan a collision-free
trajectory to grasp a target object in predefined settings. Besides, in most of the cases, there
is a reliance on large amounts of training data. Therefore, the knowledge of such robots is fixed
after the training phase, and any changes in the environment require complicated, time-consuming,
and expensive robot re-programming by human experts. Therefore, these approaches are still too
rigid for real-life applications in unstructured environments, where a significant portion of
the environment is unknown and cannot be directly sensed or controlled. In such environments, no
matter how extensive the training data used for batch learning, a robot will always face new objects.
Therefore, apart from batch learning, the robot should be able to continually learn about new object
categories and grasp affordances from very few training examples on-site. Moreover, apart from
robot self-learning, non-expert users could interactively guide the process of experience acquisition
by teaching new concepts, or by correcting insufficient or erroneous concepts. In this way, the
robot will constantly learn how to help humans in everyday tasks by gaining more and more experiences
without the need for re-programming.
