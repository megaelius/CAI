The recent turn towards quantitative text-as-data approaches in IR brought new ways to study the
discursive landscape of world politics. Here seen as complementary to qualitative approaches,
quantitative assessments have the advantage of being able to order and make comprehensible vast
amounts of text. However, the validity of unsupervised methods applied to the types of text available
in large quantities needs to be established before they can speak to other studies relying on text
and discourse as data. In this paper, we introduce a new text corpus of United Nations Security Council
(UNSC) speeches on Afghanistan between 2001 and 2017; we study this corpus through unsupervised
topic modeling (LDA) with the central aim to validate the topic categories that the LDA identifies;
and we discuss the added value, and complementarity, of quantitative text-as-data approaches.
We set-up two tests using mixed- method approaches. Firstly, we evaluate the identified topics
by assessing whether they conform with previous qualitative work on the development of the situation
in Afghanistan. Secondly, we use network analysis to study the underlying social structures of
what we will call 'speaker-topic relations' to see whether they correspondent to know divisions
and coalitions in the UNSC. In both cases we find that the unsupervised LDA indeed provides valid
and valuable outputs. In addition, the mixed-method approaches themselves reveal interesting
patterns deserving future qualitative research. Amongst these are the coalition and dynamics
around the 'women and human rights' topic as part of the UNSC debates on Afghanistan.
