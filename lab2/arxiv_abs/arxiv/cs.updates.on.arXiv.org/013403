The proliferation of connected devices and emergence of internet-of-everything represent a major
challenge for broadband wireless networks. This requires a paradigm shift towards the development
of innovative technologies for next generation wireless systems. One of the key challenges is the
scarcity of spectrum, owing to the unprecedented broadband penetration rate in recent years. A
promising solution is the proposal of visible light communications (VLC), which explores the unregulated
visible light spectrum to enable high-speed communications, in addition to efficient lighting.
This solution offers a wider bandwidth that can accommodate ubiquitous broadband connectivity
to indoor users and offload data traffic from cellular networks. Although VLC is secure and able
to overcome the shortcomings of RF systems, it suffers from several limitations, e.g., limited
modulation bandwidth. In this respect, solutions have been proposed recently to overcome this
limitation. In particular, most common orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access techniques
initially proposed for RF systems, e.g., space-division multiple access (SDMA) and NOMA, have
been considered in the context of VLC. In spite of their promising gains, the performance of these
techniques is somewhat limited. Consequently, in this article a new and generalized multiple access
technique, called rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), is introduced and investigated for
the first time in VLC networks. We first provide an overview of the key multiple access technologies
used in VLC systems. Then, we propose the first comprehensive approach to the integration of RSMA
with VLC systems. In our proposed framework, SINR expressions are derived and used to evaluate the
weighted sum rate (WSR) of a two-user scenario. Our results illustrate the flexibility of RSMA in
generalizing NOMA and SDMA, and its WSR superiority in the VLC context.
