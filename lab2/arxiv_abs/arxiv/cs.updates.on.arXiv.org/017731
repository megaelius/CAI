This article introduces SCALPEL3, a scalable open-source framework for studies involving Large
Observational Databases (LODs). Its design eases medical observational studies thanks to abstractions
allowing concept extraction, high-level cohort manipulation, and production of data formats
compatible with machine learning libraries. SCALPEL3 has successfully been used on the SNDS database
(see Tuppin et al. (2017)), a huge healthcare claims database that handles the reimbursement of
almost all French citizens. SCALPEL3 focuses on scalability, easy interactive analysis and helpers
for data flow analysis to accelerate studies performed on LODs. It consists of three open-source
libraries based on Apache Spark. SCALPEL-Flattening allows denormalization of the LOD (only SNDS
for now) by joining tables sequentially in a big table. SCALPEL-Extraction provides fast concept
extraction from a big table such as the one produced by SCALPEL-Flattening. Finally, SCALPEL-Analysis
allows interactive cohort manipulations, monitoring statistics of cohort flows and building
datasets to be used with machine learning libraries. The first two provide a Scala API while the last
one provides a Python API that can be used in an interactive environment. Our code is available on
GitHub. SCALPEL3 allowed to extract successfully complex concepts for studies such as Morel et
al (2017) or studies with 14.5 million patients observed over three years (corresponding to more
than 15 billion healthcare events and roughly 15 TeraBytes of data) in less than 49 minutes on a small
15 nodes HDFS cluster. SCALPEL3 provides a sharp interactive control of data processing through
legible code, which helps to build studies with full reproducibility, leading to improved maintainability
and audit of studies performed on LODs.
