At present, the state-of-the-art computational models across a range of sequential data processing
tasks, including language modeling, are based on recurrent neural network architectures. This
paper begins with the observation that most research on developing computational models capable
of processing sequential data fails to explicitly analyze the long distance dependencies (LDDs)
within the datasets the models process. In this context, in this paper, we make five research contributions.
First, we argue that a key step in modeling sequential data is to understand the characteristics
of the LDDs within the data. Second, we present a method to compute and analyze the LDD characteristics
of any sequential dataset, and demonstrate this method on a number of sequential datasets that are
frequently used for model benchmarking. Third, based on the analysis of the LDD characteristics
within the benchmarking datasets, we observe that LDDs are far more complex than previously assumed,
and depend on at least four factors: (i) the number of unique symbols in a dataset, (ii) size of the
dataset, (iii) the number of interacting symbols within an LDD, and (iv) the distance between the
interacting symbols. Fourth, we verify these factors by using synthetic datasets generated using
Strictly k-Piecewise (SPk) languages. We then demonstrate how SPk languages can be used to generate
benchmarking datasets with varying degrees of LDDs. The advantage of these synthesized datasets
being that they enable the targeted testing of recurrent neural architectures. Finally, we demonstrate
how understanding the characteristics of the LDDs in a dataset can inform better hyper-parameter
selection for current state-of-the-art recurrent neural architectures and also aid in understanding
them...
