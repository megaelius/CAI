To date, the only way to argue polynomial lower bounds for dynamic algorithms is via fine-grained
complexity arguments. These arguments rely on strong assumptions about specific problems such
as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) and the Online Matrix-Vector Multiplication
Conjecture (OMv). While they have led to many exciting discoveries, dynamic algorithms still miss
out some benefits and lessons from the traditional ``coarse-grained'' approach that relates together
classes of problems such as P and NP. In this paper we initiate the study of coarse-grained complexity
theory for dynamic algorithms. Below are among questions that this theory can answer. What if dynamic
Orthogonal Vector (OV) is easy in the cell-probe model? A research program for proving polynomial
unconditional lower bounds for dynamic OV in the cell-probe model is motivated by the fact that many
conditional lower bounds can be shown via reductions from the dynamic OV problem. Since the cell-probe
model is more powerful than word RAM and has historically allowed smaller upper bounds, it might
turn out that dynamic OV is easy in the cell-probe model, making this research direction infeasible.
Our theory implies that if this is the case, there will be very interesting algorithmic consequences:
If dynamic OV can be maintained in polylogarithmic worst-case update time in the cell-probe model,
then so are several important dynamic problems such as $k$-edge connectivity, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
mincut, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate matching, planar nearest neighbors, Chan's subset union
and 3-vs-4 diameter. The same conclusion can be made when we replace dynamic OV by, e.g., subgraph
connectivity, single source reachability, Chan's subset union, and 3-vs-4 diameter. Lower bounds
for $k$-edge connectivity via dynamic OV? (see the full abstract in the pdf file).
