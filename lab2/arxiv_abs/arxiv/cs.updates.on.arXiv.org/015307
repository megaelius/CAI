In causal settings, such as instrumental variable settings, it is well known that estimators based
on ordinary least squares (OLS) can yield biased and non-consistent estimates of the causal parameters.
This is partially overcome by two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimators. These are, under weak
assumptions, consistent but do not have desirable finite sample properties: in many models, for
example, they do not have finite moments. The set of K-class estimators can be seen as a non-linear
interpolation between OLS and TSLS and are known to have improved finite sample properties. Recently,
in causal discovery, invariance properties such as the moment criterion which TSLS estimators
leverage have been exploited for causal structure learning: e.g., in cases, where the causal parameter
is not identifiable, some structure of the non-zero components may be identified, and coverage
guarantees are available. Subsequently, anchor regression has been proposed to trade-off invariance
and predictability. The resulting estimator is shown to have optimal predictive performance under
bounded shift interventions. In this paper, we show that the concepts of anchor regression and K-class
estimators are closely related. Establishing this connection comes with two benefits: (1) It enables
us to prove robustness properties for existing K-class estimators when considering distributional
shifts. And, (2), we propose a novel estimator in instrumental variable settings by minimizing
the mean squared prediction error subject to the constraint that the estimator lies in an asymptotically
valid confidence region of the causal parameter. We call this estimator PULSE (p-uncorrelated
least squares estimator) and show that it can be computed efficiently, even though the underlying
optimization problem is non-convex. We further prove that it is consistent.
