Radio signal classification has a very wide range of applications in the field of wireless communications
and electromagnetic spectrum management. In recent years, deep learning has been used to solve
the problem of radio signal classification and has achieved good results. However, the radio signal
data currently used is very limited in scale. In order to verify the performance of the deep learning-based
radio signal classification on real-world radio signal data, in this paper we conduct experiments
on large-scale real-world ACARS and ADS-B signal data with sample sizes of 900,000 and 13,000,000,
respectively, and with categories of 3,143 and 5,157 respectively. We use the same Inception-Residual
neural network model structure for ACARS signal classification and ADS-B signal classification
to verify the ability of a single basic deep neural network model structure to process different
types of radio signals, i.e., communication bursts in ACARS and pulse bursts in ADS-B. We build an
experimental system for radio signal deep learning experiments. Experimental results show that
the signal classification accuracy of ACARS and ADS-B is 98.1% and 96.3%, respectively. When the
signal-to-noise ratio (with injected additive white Gaussian noise) is greater than 9 dB, the classification
accuracy is greater than 92%. These experimental results validate the ability of deep learning
to classify large-scale real-world radio signals. The results of the transfer learning experiment
show that the model trained on large-scale ADS-B datasets is more conducive to the learning and training
of new tasks than the model trained on small-scale datasets.
