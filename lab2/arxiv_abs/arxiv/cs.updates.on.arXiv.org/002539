Competing cellular operators aggressively share infrastructure in many major US markets. If operators
also were to share spectrum in next-generation millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, intra-cellular
interference will become correlated with inter-cellular interference. We propose a mathematical
framework to model a multi-operator mmWave cellular network with co-located base-stations (BSs).
We then characterize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distribution for an
arbitrary network and derive its coverage probability. To understand how varying the spatial correlation
between different networks affects coverage probability, we derive special results for the two-operator
scenario, where we construct the operators' individual networks from a single network via probabilistic
coupling. For external validation, we devise a method to quantify and estimate spatial correlation
from actual base-station deployments. We compare our two-operator model against an actual macro-cell-dominated
network and an actual network primarily comprising distributed-antenna-system (DAS) nodes.
Using the actual deployment data to set the parameters of our model, we observe that coverage probabilities
for the model and actual deployments not only compare very well to each other, but also match nearly
perfectly for the case of the DAS-node-dominated deployment. Another interesting observation
is that a network that shares spectrum and infrastructure has a lower rate coverage probability
than a network of the same number of BSs that shares neither spectrum nor infrastructure, suggesting
that the latter is more suitable for low-rate applications.
