Onomastics is "the science or study of the origin and forms of proper names of persons or places."
["Onomastics". Merriam-Webster.com, 2013. this http URL (11 February 2013)]. Especially personal
names play an important role in daily life, as all over the world future parents are facing the task
of finding a suitable given name for their child. This choice is influenced by different factors,
such as the social context, language, cultural background and, in particular, personal taste.
With the rise of the Social Web and its applications, users more and more interact digitally and participate
in the creation of heterogeneous, distributed, collaborative data collections. These sources
of data also reflect current and new naming trends as well as new emerging interrelations among names.
The present work shows, how basic approaches from the field of social network analysis and information
retrieval can be applied for discovering relations among names, thus extending Onomastics by data
mining techniques. The considered approach starts with building co-occurrence graphs relative
to data from the Social Web, respectively for given names and city names. As a main result, correlations
between semantically grounded similarities among names (e.g., geographical distance for city
names) and structural graph based similarities are observed. The discovered relations among given
names are the foundation of "nameling" [ this http URL ], a search engine and academic research platform
for given names which attracted more than 30,000 users within four months, underpinningthe relevance
of the proposed methodology.
