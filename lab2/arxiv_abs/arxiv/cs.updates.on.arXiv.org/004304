Clock synchronization procedures are mandatory in most physical experiments where event fragments
are readout by spatially dislocated sensors and must be glued together to reconstruct key parameters
(e.g. energy, interaction vertex etc.) of the process under investigation. These distributed
data readout topologies rely on an accurate time information available at the frontend, where raw
data are acquired and tagged with a precise timestamp prior to data buffering and central data collecting.
This makes the network complexity and latency, between frontend and backend electronics, negligible
within upper bounds imposed by the frontend data buffer capability. The proposed research work
describes an FPGA implementation of IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) that exploits the CERN
Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC) system as a multicast messaging physical and data link layer.
The hardware implementation extends the clock synchronization to the nanoseconds range, overcoming
the typical accuracy limitations inferred by computers Ethernet based Local Area Network (LAN).
Establishing a reliable communication between master and timing receiver nodes is essential in
a message-based synchronization system. In the backend electronics, the serial data streams synchronization
with the global clock domain is guaranteed by an hardware-based finite state machine that scans
the bit period using a variable delay chain and finds the optimal sampling point. The validity of
the proposed timing system has been proved in point-to-point data links as well as in star topology
configurations over standard CAT-5e cables. The results achieved together with weaknesses and
possible improvements are hereby detailed.
