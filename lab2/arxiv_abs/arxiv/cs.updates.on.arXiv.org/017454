Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used in everyday clinical practice to assess brain tumors.
Several automatic or semi-automatic segmentation algorithms have been introduced to segment
brain tumors and achieve an expert-like accuracy. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have
recently shown very promising results, however, DCNN models are still far from achieving clinically
meaningful results mainly because of the lack of generalization of the models. DCNN models need
large annotated datasets to achieve good performance. Models are often optimized on the domain
dataset on which they have been trained, and then fail the task when the same model is applied to different
datasets from different institutions. One of the reasons is due to the lack of data standardization
to adjust for different models and MR machines. In this work, a 3D Spherical coordinates transform
during the pre-processing phase has been hypothesized to improve DCNN models' accuracy and to allow
more generalizable results even when the model is trained on small and heterogeneous datasets and
translated into different domains. Indeed, the spherical coordinate system avoids several standardization
issues since it works independently of resolution and imaging settings. Both Cartesian and spherical
volumes were evaluated in two DCNN models with the same network structure using the BraTS 2019 dataset.
The model trained on spherical transform pre-processed inputs resulted in superior performance
over the Cartesian-input trained model on predicting gliomas' segmentation on tumor core and enhancing
tumor classes (increase of 0.011 and 0.014 respectively on the validation dataset), achieving
a further improvement in accuracy by merging the two models together. Furthermore, the spherical
transform is not resolution-dependent and achieve same results on different input resolution.
