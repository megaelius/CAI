PARAFAC2 has demonstrated success in modeling irregular tensors, where the tensor dimensions
vary across one of the modes. An example scenario is jointly modeling treatments across a set of patients
with varying number of medical encounters, where the alignment of events in time bears no clinical
meaning, and it may also be impossible to align them due to their varying length. Despite recent improvements
on scaling up unconstrained PARAFAC2, its model factors are usually dense and sensitive to noise
which limits their interpretability. As a result, the following open challenges remain: a) various
modeling constraints, such as temporal smoothness, sparsity and non-negativity, are needed to
be imposed for interpretable temporal modeling and b) a scalable approach is required to support
those constraints efficiently for large datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a COnstrained
PARAFAC2 (COPA) method, which carefully incorporates optimization constraints such as temporal
smoothness, sparsity, and non-negativity in the resulting factors. To efficiently support all
those constraints, COPA adopts a hybrid optimization framework using alternating optimization
and alternating direction method of multiplier (AO-ADMM). As evaluated on large electronic health
record (EHR) datasets with hundreds of thousands of patients, COPA achieves significant speedups
(up to 36x faster) over prior PARAFAC2 approaches that only attempt to handle a subset of the constraints
that COPA enables. Overall, our method outperforms all the baselines attempting to handle a subset
of the constraints in terms of speed, while achieving the same level of accuracy.
