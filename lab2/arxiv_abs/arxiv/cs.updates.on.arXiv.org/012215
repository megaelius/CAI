In this work, we propose valley-coupled spin-hall memories (VSH-MRAMs) based on monolayer WSe2.
The key features of the proposed memories are (a) the ability to switch magnets with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy (PMA) via VSH effect and (b) an integrated gate that can modulate the charge/spin
current (IC/IS) flow. The former attribute results in high energy efficiency (compared to the Giant-Spin
Hall (GSH) effect-based devices with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) magnets). The latter
feature leads to a compact access transistor-less memory array design. We experimentally measure
the gate controllability of the current as well as the nonlocal resistance associated with VSH effect.
Based on the measured data, we develop a simulation framework (using physical equations) to propose
and analyze single-ended and differential VSH effect based magnetic memories (VSH-MRAM and DVSH-MRAM,
respectively). At the array level, the proposed VSH/DVSH-MRAMs achieve 50%/ 11% lower write time,
59%/ 67% lower write energy and 35%/ 41% lower read energy at iso-sense margin, compared to single
ended/differential (GSH/DGSH)-MRAMs. System level evaluation in the context of general purpose
processor and intermittently-powered system shows up to 3.14X and 1.98X better energy efficiency
for the proposed (D)VSH-MRAMs over (D)GSH-MRAMs respectively. Further, the differential sensing
of the proposed DVSH-MRAM leads to natural and simultaneous in-memory computation of bit-wise
AND and NOR logic functions. Using this feature, we design a computation-in-memory (CiM) architecture
that performs Boolean logic and addition (ADD) with a single array access. System analysis performed
by integrating our DVSH-MRAM: CiM in the Nios II processor across various application benchmarks
shows up to 2.66X total energy savings, compared to DGSH-MRAM: CiM.
