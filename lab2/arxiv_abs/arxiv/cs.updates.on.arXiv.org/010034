The problem of secure distributed matrix multiplication (SDMM) studies the communication efficiency
of retrieving a sequence of desired $L\times M$ matrix products ${\bf AB}=({\bf A}_1{\bf B}_1,{\bf
A_2B_2}, \cdots,{\bf A}_S{\bf B}_S)$ from $N$ distributed servers where the constituent $L\times
K$ matrices ${\bf A}=({\bf A}_1, {\bf A}_2, \cdots, {\bf A}_S)$ and $K\times M$ matrices ${\bf B}=({\bf
B}_1, {\bf B}_2,\cdots,{\bf B}_S)$ are stored in $X$-secure coded form, i.e., any group of up to
$X$ colluding servers learn nothing about ${\bf A, B}$. The rate of an SDMM scheme is defined as the
ratio of the number of bits of desired information that is retrieved, to the total number of bits downloaded
on average. The supremum of achievable rates is called the capacity of SDMM. In this work we explore
the capacity of SDMM, as well as several of its variants, e.g., where the user may already have either
${\bf A}$ or ${\bf B}$ available as side-information, and/or where the security constraint for
either ${\bf A}$ or ${\bf B}$ may be relaxed. As our main contribution, we obtain new converse bounds,
as well as new achievable schemes for various cases of SDMM, depending on the $L, K, M, N, X$ parameters,
and identify parameter regimes where these bounds match. A remarkable aspect of our upper bounds
is a connection between SDMM and a form of private information retrieval (PIR) problem, known as
multi-message $X$-secure $T$-private information retrieval (MM-XSTPIR). Notable features
of our achievable schemes include the use of cross-subspace alignment and a transformation argument
that converts a scalar multiplication problem into a scalar addition problem, allowing a surprisingly
efficient solution.
