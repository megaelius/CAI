Since its introduction, television has been the main channel of investment for advertisements
in order to influence customers purchase behavior. Many have attributed the mere exposure effect
as the source of influence in purchase intention and purchase decision; however, most of the studies
of television advertisement effects are not only outdated, but their sample size is questionable
and their environments do not reflect reality. With the advent of the internet, social media and
new information technologies, many recent studies focus on the effects of online advertisement,
meanwhile, the investment in television advertisement still has not declined. In response to this,
we applied machine learning algorithms SVM and XGBoost, as well as Logistic Regression, to construct
a number of prediction models based on at-home advertisement exposure time and demographic data,
examining the predictability of Actual Purchase and Purchase Intention behaviors of 3000 customers
across 36 different products during the span of 3 months. If models based on exposure time had unreliable
predictability in contrast to models based on demographic data, doubts would surface about the
effectiveness of the hard investment in television advertising. Based on our results, we found
that models based on advert exposure time were consistently low in their predictability in comparison
with models based on demographic data only, and with models based on both demographic data and exposure
time data. We also found that there was not a statistically significant difference between these
last two kinds of models. This suggests that advert exposure time has little to no effect in the short-term
in increasing positive actual purchase behavior.
