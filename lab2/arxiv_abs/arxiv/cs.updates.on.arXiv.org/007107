Respiratory ailments afflict a wide range of people and manifests itself through conditions like
asthma and sleep apnea. Continuous monitoring of chronic respiratory ailments is seldom used outside
the intensive care ward due to the large size and cost of the monitoring system. While Electrocardiogram
(ECG) based respiration extraction is a validated approach, its adoption is limited by access to
a suitable continuous ECG monitor. Recently, due to the widespread adoption of wearable smartwatches
with in-built Photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor, it is being considered as a viable candidate for
continuous and unobtrusive respiration monitoring. Research in this domain, however, has been
predominantly focussed on estimating respiration rate from PPG. In this work, a novel end-to-end
deep learning network called RespNet is proposed to perform the task of extracting the respiration
signal from a given input PPG as opposed to extracting respiration rate. The proposed network was
trained and tested on two different datasets utilizing different modalities of reference respiration
signal recordings. Also, the similarity and performance of the proposed network against two conventional
signal processing approaches for extracting respiration signal were studied. The proposed method
was tested on two independent datasets with a Mean Squared Error of 0.262 and 0.145. The Cross-Correlation
coefficient of the respective datasets were found to be 0.933 and 0.931. The reported errors and
similarity was found to be better than conventional approaches. The proposed approach would aid
clinicians to provide comprehensive evaluation of sleep-related respiratory conditions and
chronic respiratory ailments while being comfortable and inexpensive for the patient.
