Heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding, aiming to map the structure and semantic information
in a HIN to distributed representations, has drawn considerable research attention. Graph neural
networks for HIN embeddings typically adopt a hierarchical attention (including node-level and
meta-path-level attentions) to capture the information from meta-path-based neighbors. However,
this complicated attention structure often cannot achieve the function of selecting meta-paths
due to severe overfitting. Moreover, when propagating information, these methods do not distinguish
direct (one-hop) meta-paths from indirect (multi-hop) ones. But from the perspective of network
science, direct relationships are often believed to be more essential, which can only be used to
model direct information propagation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel neural
network method via implicitly utilizing attention and meta-paths, which can relieve the severe
overfitting brought by the current over-parameterized attention mechanisms on HIN. We first use
the multi-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) framework, which performs a discriminative
aggregation at each layer, along with stacking the information propagation of direct linked meta-paths
layer-by-layer, realizing the function of attentions for selecting meta-paths in an indirect
way. We then give an effective relaxation and improvement via introducing a new propagation operation
which can be separated from aggregation. That is, we first model the whole propagation process with
well-defined probabilistic diffusion dynamics, and then introduce a random graph-based constraint
which allows it to reduce noise with the increase of layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of the new approach over state-of-the-art methods.
