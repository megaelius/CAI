Wireless power transmission (WPT) is expected to play an important role in the Internet of Things
services by providing the perpetual operation of IoT sensors. However, to prolong the IoT network's
lifetime, the efficient resource allocation algorithm is required, in particular, the energy
fairness issue among IoT sensors has been a critical challenge of the WPT system. In this paper, considering
energy fairness as the minimum received energy of all energy poverty IoT sensors (EPISs), we allocate
orthogonal frequency bands to several EPISs and transfer the RF power on each orthogonal band, using
energy beamforming. Based on the energy poverty, we propose orthogonal frequency bands assignment
rule, granting the priority to the EPISs with less received energy. We also formulate two transmission
power allocation problems, incorporated the nonlinear logarithm-energy harvesting (EH) model.
First, the total received power maximization (TRPM) problem is presented and solved by combining
the well-known Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with the modified water-filling algorithm.
Second, the common received power maximization (CRPM) problem is formulated and the optimal solution
is derived using the iterative bisection search method. To apply the bisection search method to
the problem, this paper proposes a method of specifying the scope of the solution for the objective
function defined by the sum of monotonous functions. In numerical results, assuming the mobility
of EPISs by the one-dimensional random walk model, the effectiveness of the mobility of EPISs on
the minimum received energy of all EPISs is presented. Finally, the performance of the proposed
resource allocation schemes is verified by comparing other resources allocation schemes, such
as Round robin and equal power distribution
