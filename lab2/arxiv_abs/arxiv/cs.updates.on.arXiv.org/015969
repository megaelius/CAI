We study the problem of strategic choice of arrival time to a single-server queue with opening and
closing times when there is uncertainty regarding service speed. A Poisson population of customers
choose their arrival time with the goal of minimizing their expected waiting times and are served
on a first-come first-served basis. There are two types of customers that differ in their beliefs
regarding the service time distribution. The inconsistent beliefs may arise from randomness in
the server state along with noisy signals that customers observe. Customers are aware of the two
types of populations with differing beliefs. We characterize the Nash equilibrium dynamics for
exponentially distributed service times and show how they substantially differ from the model
with homogeneous customers. We further provide an explicit solution for a fluid approximation
of the game. For general service time distributions we provide an algorithm for computing the equilibrium
in a discrete time setting. We find that in equilibrium customers with different beliefs arrive
during different (and often disjoint) time intervals. Numerical analysis further shows that the
mean waiting time increases with the coefficient of variation of the service time. Furthermore,
we present a learning agent based model (ABM) in which customers make joining decisions based solely
on their signals and past experience. We numerically compare the long-term average outcome of the
ABM with that of the equilibrium and find that the arrival distributions are quite close if we assume
(for the equilibrium solution) that customers are fully rational and have knowledge of the system
parameters, while they may greatly differ if customers have limited information or computing abilities.
