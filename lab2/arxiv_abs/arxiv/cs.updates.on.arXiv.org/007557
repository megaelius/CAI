With huge data acquisition progresses realized in the past decades and acquisition systems now
able to produce high resolution grids and point clouds, the digitization of physical terrains becomes
increasingly more precise. Such extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact
computational performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media,
memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity, necessary
to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and storage are thus becoming "enabling
technologies'' in HPC experimental and simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original
decomposition scheme for structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance
in biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides a comprehensive
framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage. Its exactly reversible multiresolution
decomposition yields a hierarchy of meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry,
continuous or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes compression
techniques, our contribution blends coherently different multiresolution wavelet schemes in
different dimensions. It results in a global framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across
scales, implemented as a fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results
are provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the consistency of the proposed
representation, in terms of visualization, attribute downsampling and distribution at different
resolutions. Finally, HexaShrink yields gains in storage space when combined to lossless compression
techniques.
