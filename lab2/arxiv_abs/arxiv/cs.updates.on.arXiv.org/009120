In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of human-mobility modeling based on 1680 articles
published between 1999 and 2019, which can serve as a roadmap for research and practice in this area.
Mobility modeling research has accelerated the advancement of several fields of studies such as
urban planning, epidemic modeling, traffic engineering and contributed to the development of
location-based services. However, while the application of mobility models in different domains
has increased, the credibility of the research results has decreased. We highlight two significant
shortfalls commonly observed in our reviewed studies: (1) data-agnostic model selection resulting
in a poor tradeoff between accuracy vs. complexity, and (2) failure to identify the source of empirical
gains, due to adoption of inaccurate validation methodologies. We also observe troubling trends
with respect to application of Markov model variants for modeling mobility, despite the questionable
association of Markov processes and human-mobility dynamics. To this end, we propose a data-driven
mobility-modeling framework that quantifies the characteristics of a dataset based on four mobility
meta-attributes, in order to select the most appropriate prediction algorithm. Experimental
evaluations on three real-world mobility datasets based on a rigorous validation methodology
demonstrate our frameworks ability to correctly analyze the model accuracy vs. complexity tradeoff.
We offer these results to the community along with the tools and the literature meta-data in order
to improve the reliability and credibility of human mobility modeling research.
