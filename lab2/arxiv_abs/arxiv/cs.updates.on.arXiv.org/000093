We study several stochastic combinatorial problems, including the expected utility maximization
problem, the stochastic knapsack problem and the stochastic bin packing problem. A common technical
challenge in these problems is to optimize some function of the sum of a set of random variables. The
difficulty is mainly due to the fact that the probability distribution of the sum is the convolution
of a set of distributions, which is not an easy objective function to work with. To tackle this difficulty,
we introduce the Poisson approximation technique. The technique is based on the Poisson approximation
theorem discovered by Le Cam, which enables us to approximate the distribution of the sum of a set
of random variables using a compound Poisson distribution. We first study the expected utility
maximization problem introduced recently [Li and Despande, FOCS11]. For monotone and Lipschitz
utility functions, we obtain an additive PTAS if there is a multidimensional PTAS for the multi-objective
version of the problem, strictly generalizing the previous result. For the stochastic bin packing
problem (introduced in [Kleinberg, Rabani and Tardos, STOC97]), we show there is a polynomial time
algorithm which uses at most the optimal number of bins, if we relax the size of each bin and the overflow
probability by eps. For stochastic knapsack, we show a 1+eps-approximation using eps extra capacity,
even when the size and reward of each item may be correlated and cancelations of items are allowed.
This generalizes the previous work [Balghat, Goel and Khanna, SODA11] for the case without correlation
and cancelation. Our algorithm is also simpler. We also present a factor 2+eps approximation algorithm
for stochastic knapsack with cancelations. the current known approximation factor of 8 [Gupta,
Krishnaswamy, Molinaro and Ravi, FOCS11].
