With more and more adoption of Deep Learning (DL) in the field of image processing, computer vision
and NLP, researchers have begun to apply DL to tackle with encrypted traffic classification problems.
Although these methods can automatically extract traffic features to overcome the difficulty
of traditional classification methods like DPI in terms of feature engineering, a large amount
of data is needed to learn the characteristics of various types of traffic. Therefore, the performance
of classification model always significantly depends on the quality of datasets. Nevertheless,
the building of datasets is a time-consuming and costly task, especially encrypted traffic data.
Apparently, it is often more difficult to collect a large amount of traffic samples of those unpopular
encrypted applications than well-known, which leads to the problem of class imbalance between
major and minor encrypted applications in datasets. In this paper, we proposed a novel traffic data
augmenting method called PacketCGAN using Conditional GAN. As a generative model, PacketCGAN
exploit the benefit of CGAN to generate specified traffic to address the problem of the datasets'
imbalance. As a proof of concept, three classical DL models like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
were adopted and designed to classify four encrypted traffic datasets augmented by Random Over
Sampling (ROS), SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Techinique) , vanilla GAN and PacketCGAN
respectively based on two public datasets: ISCX2012 and USTC-TFC2016. The experimental evaluation
results demonstrate that DL based encrypted traffic classifier over dataset augmented by PacketCGAN
can achieve better performance than the others.
