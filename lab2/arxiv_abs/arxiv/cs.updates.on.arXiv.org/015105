In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19, countries have adopted Non-Pharmaceutical
Interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and full lockdown. An objective and quantitative
means of monitoring the impact of, and compliance with, these interventions at a local level is urgently
required. Here we explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform
RADAR-base as a toolbox to test the effect and response to NPIs aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-
19. We included 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the UK and the Netherlands.
We analysed phone GPS, phone usage data and Fitbit activity, heart rate, sleep, which were collected
and managed by the RADAR-base platform. Daily features were derived reflecting mobility, functional
measures, and phone usage. We visualised data using time series plots and performed statistical
tests to assess differences in behaviour during baseline, pre- and post-lockdown periods. We found
significant changes in behaviours between baseline/pre-lockdown and post- lockdown for all features
except total sleep duration. In general, participants spent more time at home and travelled much
less and were more active on their phones, interacting with others by using social apps. Nevertheless,
the level of compliance across nations differed with Denmark showing attenuated changes in behaviour.
Differences in the extracted features by country may reflect cultural differences as well as variations
in communication and implementation of different NPIs. We have demonstrated that generalised
open-source mobile health monitoring platforms such as RADAR-base which leverages data from wearables
and mobile technologies are valuable tools for helping understand the behavioural impact of public
health interventions implemented in response to infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19.
