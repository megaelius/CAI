Numerous laboratory systems have been proposed as analogs to study phenomena (like black holes,
Hawking radiation) associated with Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) but which are
challenging to study in experimental or simulated astrophysical settings. Such analogs, typically
acoustic, fluid, or atomic systems require delicate manipulation. Here we introduce a robotic
system that captures aspects of Einstein-like dynamics in curved spacetime and creates a path toward
a mechatronic analog gravity system. The system consists of a wheeled robotic vehicle transiting
a deformable elastic membrane. With a fixed central depression in the membrane (mimicking a massive
body), the vehicle paths around the depression resemble the dynamics observed near general-relativistic
compact objects (e.g. black holes). We recast the vehicle plus membrane dynamics in physical space
into geodesic motion of a so-called "test particle" in a fiducial curved space-time. The mapping
facilitates understanding of how vehicle characteristics (e.g. mass) can be modified to change
precession dynamics. Since an important aspect of GR is the coupling of matter and spacetime (which
influence each other) we also study the dynamics of a two-robot system interacting solely via local
membrane deformations. For a range of masses, we observe vehicle "attraction"; initially separated
robots converge and collide. A control scheme in which a robot senses its local tilt angle and adjusts
its speed enables it to escape capture. Our system provides a path towards a readily tunable analog
gravity system and can aid design and control of locomoting devices (e.g. water walkers) that couple
strongly to their environments.
