As robotic systems are moved out of factory work cells into human-facing environments questions
of choreography become central to their design, placement, and application. With a human viewer
or counterpart present, a system will automatically be interpreted within context, style of movement,
and form factor by human beings as animate elements of their environment. The interpretation by
this human counterpart is critical to the success of the system's integration: knobs on the system
need to make sense to a human counterpart; an artificial agent should have a way of notifying a human
counterpart of a change in system state, possibly through motion profiles; and the motion of a human
counterpart may have important contextual clues for task completion. Thus, professional choreographers,
dance practitioners, and movement analysts are critical to research in robotics. They have design
methods for movement that align with human audience perception, can identify simplified features
of movement for human-robot interaction goals, and have detailed knowledge of the capacity of human
movement. This article provides approaches employed by one research lab, specific impacts on technical
and artistic projects within, and principles that may guide future such work. The background section
reports on choreography, somatic perspectives, improvisation, the Laban/Bartenieff Movement
System, and robotics. From this context methods including embodied exercises, writing prompts,
and community building activities have been developed to facilitate interdisciplinary research.
The results of this work is presented as an overview of a smattering of projects in areas like high-level
motion planning, software development for rapid prototyping of movement, artistic output, and
user studies that help understand how people interpret movement. Finally, guiding principles
for other groups to adopt are posited.
