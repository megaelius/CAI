Objectives: Information in clinical trial registries can be used to identify evidence for systematic
reviews and measure reporting biases. However, the links between trial registrations and published
trial reports are often missing. Our aim was to evaluate the use of terms and concepts shared between
registrations and trial reports to identify unreported links between ClinicalTrials.gov and
PubMed. Study Design and Setting: We examined 84,027 trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov
and 20,300 reported links to 306,808 PubMed articles to determine whether the reported links could
be used to help identify unreported links. Using unique terms and concepts extracted from the two
corpora, we tested document similarity methods to rank articles in two datasets constructed from
reported and manually-identified unreported links. Performance was measured by the median rank
of linked trial reports, and the proportion of links that can be verified by checking ranked trial
reports in order. Results: Term and concept-based representations of registrations and trial
reports produced similar results. When testing on unreported and reported links, the best performing
concept-based representation produced a median rank of 3 (IQR 1-30) for reported links and 3.5 (IQR
1-18) for unreported links, and term-based representations produced a median rank of 3 (1-27) for
reported links and 3 (IQR 1-13) in unreported links. For one in three registrations, the matching
article was ranked first. For four in every five registrations, the matching article could be found
by checking 50 or fewer candidates. Conclusions: Leveraging the growth in the corpus of reported
links between ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed, we found that automated methods can assist in the
identification of unreported links between trial registrations and corresponding published
trial reports.
