The roles of trust, security and privacy are somewhat interconnected, but different facets of next
generation networks. The challenges in creating a trustworthy 6G are multidisciplinary spanning
technology, regulation, techno-economics, politics and ethics. This white paper addresses their
fundamental research challenges in three key areas. Trust: Under the current "open internet" regulation,
the telco cloud can be used for trust services only equally for all users. 6G network must support
embedded trust for increased level of information security in 6G. Trust modeling, trust policies
and trust mechanisms need to be defined. 6G interlinks physical and digital worlds making safety
dependent on information security. Therefore, we need trustworthy 6G. Security: In 6G era, the
dependence of the economy and societies on IT and the networks will deepen. The role of IT and the networks
in national security keeps rising - a continuation of what we see in 5G. The development towards cloud
and edge native infrastructures is expected to continue in 6G networks, and we need holistic 6G network
security architecture planning. Security automation opens new questions: machine learning can
be used to make safer systems, but also more dangerous attacks. Physical layer security techniques
can also represent efficient solutions for securing less investigated network segments as first
line of defense. Privacy: There is currently no way to unambiguously determine when linked, deidentified
datasets cross the threshold to become personally identifiable. Courts in different parts of the
world are making decisions about whether privacy is being infringed, while companies are seeking
new ways to exploit private data to create new business revenues. As solution alternatives, we may
consider blockchain, distributed ledger technologies and differential privacy approaches.
