Cloud-assisted Cognitive Internet of Things has powerful data analytics abilities based on the
computing and data storage capabilities of cloud virtual machines, which makes protecting virtual
machine filesystem very important for the whole system security. Agentless periodic filesystem
monitors are optimal solutions to protect cloud virtual machines because of the secure and low-overhead
features. However, most of the periodic monitors usually scan all of the virtual machine filesystem
or protected files in every scanning poll, so lots of secure files are scanned again and again even
though they are not corrupted. In this paper, we propose a novel agentless periodic filesystem monitor
framework for virtual machines with different image formats to improve the performance of agentless
periodic monitors. Our core idea is to minimize the scope of the scanning files in both file integrity
checking and virus detection. In our monitor, if a file is considered secure, it will not be scanned
when it has not been modified. Since our monitor only scans the newly created and modified files,
it can check fewer files than other filesystem monitors. To that end, we propose two monitor methods
for different types of virtual machine disks to reduce the number of scanning files. For virtual
machine with single disk image, we hook the backend driver to capture the disk modification information.
For virtual machine with multiple copy-onwrite images, we leverage the copy-on-write feature
of QCOW2 images to achieve the disk modification analysis. In addition, our system can restore and
remove the corrupted files. The experimental results show that our system is effective for both
Windows and Linux virtual machines with different image formats and can reduce the number of scanning
files and scanning time.
