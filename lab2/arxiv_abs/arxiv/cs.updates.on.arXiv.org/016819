The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments worldwide to impose movement restrictions on their
citizens. Although critical to reducing the virus' reproduction rate, these restrictions come
with far-reaching social and economic consequences. In this paper, we investigate the impact of
these restrictions on an individual level among software engineers currently working from home.
Although software professionals are accustomed to working with digital tools, but not all of them
remotely, in their day-to-day work, the abrupt and enforced work-from-home context has resulted
in an unprecedented scenario for the software engineering community. In a two-wave longitudinal
study ($N~=~192$), we covered over 50 psychological, social, situational, and physiological
factors that have previously been associated with well-being or productivity. Examples include
anxiety, distractions, psychological and physical needs, office set-up, stress, and work motivation.
This design allowed us to identify those variables that explain unique variance in well-being and
productivity. Results include (1) the quality of social contacts predicted positively, and stress
predicted an individual's well-being negatively when controlling for other variables consistently
across both waves; (2) boredom and distractions predicted productivity negatively; (3) productivity
was less strongly associated with all predictor variables at time two compared to time one, suggesting
that software engineers adapted to the lockdown situation over time; and (4) the longitudinal study
did not provide evidence that any predictor variable causal explained variance in well-being and
productivity. Our study can assess the effectiveness of current work-from-home and general well-being
and productivity support guidelines and provide tailored insights for software professionals.
