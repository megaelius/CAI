We introduce Stochastic Probing with Prices (SPP), a variant of the Stochastic Probing (SP) model
in which we must pay a price to probe an element. A SPP problem involves two set systems $(N,\mathcal{I}_{in})$
and $(N,\mathcal{I}_{out})$ where each $e\in N$ is active with probability $p_e$. To discover
whether $e$ is active, it must be probed by paying the price $\Delta_e$. If it is probed and active,
then it is irrevocably added to the solution. Moreover, at all times, the set of probed elements must
lie in $\mathcal{I}_{out}$, and the solution (the set of probed and active elements) must lie in
$\mathcal{I}_{in}$. The goal is to maximize a set function $f$ minus the cost of the probes. We show
this problem can be approximately solved via multilinear relaxation and contention resolution
schemes. If $\mathcal{I}_{in}$ and $\mathcal{I}_{out}$ admit $(b,c_{in})$ and $(b,c_{out})$
contention resolution schemes, we give a $\max\{c_{out} c_{in},c_{out}+c_{in}-1\}\alpha(b)$-approximation
to online SPP, where $\alpha(b)=1-e^{-b}$ if $f$ is monotone, and $be^{-b}$ otherwise. These results
apply in the online version of the problem: The elements are presented in an arbitrary (and potentially
adversarial) order. In the special case when $\mathcal{I}_{in}$ and $\mathcal{I}_{out}$ are
the intersection of $k$ and $\ell$ matroids, we demonstrate that the optimal value for $b$ is $\frac{1}{2}(z+2-\sqrt{z(z+4)})$
when $f$ is monotone, and $z+1-W(ze^{z+1})$ when $f$ is non-monotone, where $z=k+\ell$ and $W$
is the lambert W function. Our results also provide state-of-the-art approximations for online
SP when $f$ is monotone, and provide the first approximation to online, adversarial SP when $f$ is
non-monotone. Finally, we demonstrate that when $f$ is modular there exists an $\alpha$-approximation
to SP only if there exists an $\alpha$-approximation to SPP.
