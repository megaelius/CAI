In this paper, we demonstrate the combination of machine learning and three dimensional numerical
simulations for multi-objective optimization of low pressure die casting. The cooling of molten
metal inside the mold is achieved typically by passing water through the cooling lines in the die.
Depending on the cooling line location, coolant flow rate and die geometry, nonuniform temperatures
are imposed on the molten metal at the mold wall. This boundary condition along with the initial molten
metal temperature affect the product quality quantified in terms of micro-structure parameters
and yield strength. A finite volume based numerical solver is used to determine the temperature-time
history and correlate the inputs to outputs. The objective of this research is to develop and demonstrate
a procedure to obtain the initial and wall temperatures so as to optimize the product quality. The
non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used for multi-objective optimization
in this work. The number of function evaluations required for NSGA-II can be of the order of millions
and hence, the finite volume solver cannot be used directly for optimization. Therefore, a multilayer
perceptron feed-forward neural network is first trained using the results from the numerical solution
of the fluid flow and energy equations and is subsequently used as a surrogate model. As an assessment,
simplified versions of the actual problem are designed to first verify results of the genetic algorithm.
An innovative local sensitivity based approach is then used to rank the final Pareto optimal solutions
and select a single best design.
