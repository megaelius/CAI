The nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated many-particle systems is of interest in connection
with pump-probe experiments on molecular systems and solids, as well as theoretical investigations
of transport properties and relaxation processes. Nonequilibrium Green's functions are a powerful
tool to study interaction effects in quantum many-particle systems out of equilibrium, and to extract
physically relevant information for the interpretation of experiments. We present the open-source
software package NESSi (The Non-Equilibrium Systems Simulation package) which allows to perform
many-body dynamics simulations based on Green's functions on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour.
NESSi contains the library libcntr which implements tools for basic operations on these nonequilibrium
Green's functions, for constructing Feynman diagrams, and for the solution of integral and integro-differential
equations involving contour Green's functions. The library employs a discretization of the Kadanoff-Baym
contour into time $N$ points and a high-order implementation of integration routines. The total
integrated error scales up to $\mathcal{O}(N^{-7})$, which is important since the numerical effort
increases at least cubically with the simulation time. A distributed-memory parallelization
over reciprocal space allows large-scale simulations of lattice systems. We provide a collection
of example programs ranging from dynamics in simple two-level systems to problems relevant in contemporary
condensed matter physics, including Hubbard clusters and Hubbard or Holstein lattice models.
The libcntr library is the basis of a follow-up software package for nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field
theory calculations based on strong-coupling perturbative impurity solvers.
