Predictive modeling with electronic health record (EHR) data is anticipated to drive personalized
medicine and improve healthcare quality. Constructing predictive statistical models typically
requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive
process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient's record. We propose a representation
of patients' entire, raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately
predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization.
We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two U.S. academic medical centers with
216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24 hours. In the sequential format we propose,
this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical
notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting in-hospital mortality
(AUROC across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length
of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted
AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed state-of-the-art traditional predictive models in all
cases. We also present a case-study of a neural-network attribution system, which illustrates
how clinicians can gain some transparency into the predictions. We believe that this approach can
be used to create accurate and scalable predictions for a variety of clinical scenarios, complete
with explanations that directly highlight evidence in the patient's chart.
