Cartograms are maps that rescale geographic regions (e.g., countries, districts) such that their
areas are proportional to quantitative demographic data (e.g., population size, gross domestic
product). Unlike conventional bar or pie charts, cartograms can represent correctly which regions
share common borders, resulting in insightful visualizations that can be the basis for further
spatial statistical analysis. Computer programs can assist data scientists in preparing cartograms,
but developing an algorithm that can quickly transform every coordinate on the map (including points
that are not exactly on a border) while generating recognizable images has remained a challenge.
Methods that translate the cartographic deformations into physics-inspired equations of motion
have become popular, but solving these equations with sufficient accuracy can still take several
minutes on current hardware. Here we introduce a flow-based algorithm whose equations of motion
are numerically easier to solve compared with previous methods. The equations allow straightforward
parallelization so that the calculation takes only a few seconds even for complex and detailed input.
Despite the speedup, the proposed algorithm still keeps the advantages of previous techniques:
with comparable quantitative measures of shape distortion, it accurately scales all areas, correctly
fits the regions together and generates a map projection for every point. We demonstrate the use
of our algorithm with applications to the 2016 US election results, the gross domestic products
of Indian states and Chinese provinces, and the spatial distribution of deaths in the London borough
of Kensington and Chelsea between 2011 and 2014.
