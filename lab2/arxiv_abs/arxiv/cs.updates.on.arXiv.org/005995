Volumetric segmentation of lesions on CT scans is important for many types of analysis, including
lesion growth kinetic modeling in clinical trials and machine learning of radiomic features. Manual
segmentation is laborious, and impractical for large-scale use. For routine clinical use, and
in clinical trials that apply the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), clinicians
typically outline the boundaries of a lesion on a single slice to extract diameter measurements.
In this work, we have collected a large-scale database, named LesionVis, with pixel-wise manual
2D lesion delineations on the RECIST-slices. To extend the 2D segmentations to 3D, we propose a volumetric
progressive lesion segmentation (PLS) algorithm to automatically segment the 3D lesion volume
from 2D delineations using a scale-invariant and boundary-aware deep convolutional network (SIBA-Net).
The SIBA-Net copes with the size transition of a lesion when the PLS progresses from the RECIST-slice
to the edge-slices, as well as when performing longitudinal assessment of lesions whose size change
over multiple time points. The proposed PLS-SiBA-Net (P-SiBA) approach is assessed on the lung
lesion cases from LesionVis. Our experimental results demonstrate that the P-SiBA approach achieves
mean Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) of 0.81, which significantly improves 3D segmentation
accuracy compared with the approaches proposed previously (highest mean DSC at 0.78 on LesionVis).
In summary, by leveraging the limited 2D delineations on the RECIST-slices, P-SiBA is an effective
semi-supervised approach to produce accurate lesion segmentations in 3D.
