There is a growing concern and awareness about the right-to-be-forgotten issues among regulators
as well as users all over the world. To cope with these privacy concerns, social platforms offer deletion
mechanisms that give the users the opportunity to remove their contents and in some cases the platforms
remove them automatically. However, this leaves the users vulnerable to attacks by adversaries
who specifically seek the damaging content of the users and exploit the act of deletion as a strong
signal for it. In this paper, we conduct a user study on 191 participants to study their prior deletion
experiences, their expectations of deletion privacy, and how effective do they find the current
deletion mechanisms. We find that more than 80\% of the users have deleted at least a social media
post and 35\% of the deletions happened after a week of posting. While the participants identified
the irrelevancy of the content due to time passing as the main reason for removing their contents,
a majority of the participant believe that deletions indicate that the deleted content includes
some damaging information to the owner. Importantly, the participants are significantly more
concerned about their deletions being noticed by large-scale data collectors (e.g., a third-party
data collecting company or the government) than any other individual from their social circle.
Further, a third of the participants think that they can be attacked by these large-scale data collectors.
Finally, the participants find the current deletion mechanisms to be inadequate in protecting
the privacy of their deletions and provide guidelines for the future of deletion mechanisms.
