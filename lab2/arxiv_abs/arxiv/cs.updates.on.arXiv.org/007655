Selectivity estimation - the problem of estimating the result size of queries - is a fundamental
yet challenging problem in databases. Accurate estimation of query selectivity involving multiple
correlated attributes is especially challenging. Poor cardinality estimates could result in
the selection of bad plans by the query optimizer. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility
of using deep learning based approaches for challenging scenarios such as queries involving multiple
predicates and/or low selectivity. Specifically, we propose two complementary approaches. Our
first approach considers selectivity as an unsupervised deep density estimation problem. We successfully
introduce techniques from neural density estimation for this purpose. The key idea is to decompose
the joint distribution into a set of tractable conditional probability distributions such that
they satisfy the autoregressive property. Our second approach formulates selectivity estimation
as a supervised deep learning problem that predicts the selectivity of a given query. We also introduce
and address a number of practical challenges arising when adapting deep learning for relational
data. These include query/data featurization, incorporating query workload information in a
deep learning framework and the dynamic scenario where both data and workload queries could be updated.
Our extensive experiments with a special emphasis on queries with a large number of predicates and/or
small result sizes demonstrates that deep learning based techniques are a promising research avenue
for selectivity estimation worthy of further investigation.
