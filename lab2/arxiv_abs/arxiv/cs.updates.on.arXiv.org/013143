Investigation of detailed and complex optimisation problem formulations that reflect realistic
scenarios is a burgeoning field of research. A growing body of work exists for the Travelling Thief
Problem, including multi-objective formulations and comparisons of exact and approximate methods
to solve it. However, as many realistic scenarios are non-static in time, dynamic formulations
have yet to be considered for the TTP. Definition of dynamics within three areas of the TTP problem
are addressed; in the city locations, availability map and item values. Based on the elucidation
of solution conservation between initial sets and obtained non-dominated sets, we define a range
of initialisation mechanisms using solutions generated via solvers, greedily and randomly. These
are then deployed to seed the population after a change and the performance in terms of hypervolume
and spread is presented for comparison. Across a range of problems with varying TSP-component and
KP-component sizes, we observe interesting trends in line with existing conclusions; there is
little benefit to using randomisation as a strategy for initialisation of solution populations
when the optimal TSP and KP component solutions can be exploited. Whilst these separate optima don't
guarantee good TTP solutions, when combined, provide better initial performance and therefore
in some examined instances, provides the best response to dynamic changes. A combined approach
that mixes solution generation methods to provide a composite population in response to dynamic
changes provides improved performance in some instances for the different dynamic TTP formulations.
Potential for further development of a more cooperative combined method are realised to more cohesively
exploit known information about the problems.
