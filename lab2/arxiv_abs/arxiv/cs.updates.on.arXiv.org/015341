While critical for the practical progress of spectrum sharing, modulation recognition has so far
been investigated under unrealistic assumptions: (i) a transmitter's bandwidth must be scanned
alone and in full, (ii) prior knowledge of the technology must be available and (iii) a transmitter
must be trustworthy. In reality these assumptions cannot be readily met, as a transmitter's bandwidth
may only be scanned intermittently, partially, or alongside other transmitters, and modulation
obfuscation may be introduced by short-lived scans or malicious activity. This paper presents
LinksIQ, which bridges the gap between real-world spectrum sensing and the growing body of modrec
methods designed under simplifying assumptions. Our key insight is that ordered IQ samples form
distinctive patterns across modulations, which persist even with scan deficiencies. We mine these
patterns through a Fisher Kernel framework and employ lightweight linear support vector machine
for modulation classification. LinksIQ is robust to noise, scan partiality and data biases without
utilizing prior knowledge of transmitter technology. Its accuracy consistently outperforms
baselines in both simulated and real traces. We evaluate LinksIQ performance in a testbed using
two popular SDR platforms, RTL-SDR and USRP. We demonstrate high detection accuracy (i.e. 0.74)
even with a $20 RTL-SDR scanning at 50% transmitter overlap. This constitutes an average of 43% improvement
over existing counterparts employed on RTL-SDR scans. We also explore the effects of platform-aware
classifier training and discuss implications on real-world modrec system design. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost transmitter fingerprinting at scale.
