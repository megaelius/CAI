In many domains of life, business and management, numerous problems are addressed by small groups
of individuals engaged in face-to-face discussions. While research in social psychology has a
long history of studying the determinants of small group performances, the internal dynamics that
govern a group discussion is not yet well understood. Here, we rely on computational methods based
on network analyses and opinion dynamics to described how individuals influence each other during
a group discussion. We consider the situation in which a small group of three individuals engages
in a discussion to solve an estimation task. We propose a model describing how group members gradually
influence each other and revise their judgments over the course of the discussion. The main component
of the model is an influence network - a weighted, directed graph that determines the extent to which
individuals influence each other during the discussion. In simulations, we first study the optimal
structure of the influence network that yields the best group performances. Then, we implement
a social learning process by which individuals adapt to the past performance of their peers, thereby
affecting the structure of the influence network in the long run. We explore the mechanisms underlying
the emergence of efficient or maladaptive networks and show that the influence network can converge
towards the optimal one, but only when individuals exhibit a social discounting bias by downgrading
the relative performances of their peers. Finally, we find a late-speaker effect, whereby individuals
who speak later in the discussion are perceived more positively in the long run and are thus more influential.
The numerous predictions of the model can serve as a basis for future experiments, and this work opens
research on small group discussion to computational social sciences.
