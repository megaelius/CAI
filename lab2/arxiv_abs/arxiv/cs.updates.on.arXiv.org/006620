Group signatures allow users of a group to sign messages anonymously in the name of the group, while
incorporating a tracing mechanism to revoke anonymity and identify the signer of any message. Since
its introduction by Chaum and van Heyst (EUROCRYPT 1991), numerous proposals have been put forward,
yielding various improvements on security, efficiency and functionality. However, a drawback
of traditional group signatures is that the opening authority is given too much power, i.e., he can
indiscriminately revoke anonymity and there is no mechanism to keep him accountable. To overcome
this problem, Kohlweiss and Miers (PoPET 2015) introduced the notion of accountable tracing signatures
(ATS) - an enhanced group signature variant in which the opening authority is kept accountable for
his actions. Kohlweiss and Miers demonstrated a generic construction of ATS and put forward a concrete
instantiation based on number-theoretic assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, no other ATS
scheme has been known, and the problem of instantiating ATS under post-quantum assumptions, e.g.,
lattices, remains open to date. In this work, we provide the first lattice-based accountable tracing
signature scheme. The scheme satisfies the security requirements suggested by Kohlweiss and Miers,
assuming the hardness of the Ring Short Integer Solution (RSIS) and the Ring Learning With Errors
(RLWE) problems. At the heart of our construction are a lattice-based key-oblivious encryption
scheme and a zero-knowledge argument system allowing to prove that a given ciphertext is a valid
RLWE encryption under some hidden yet certified key. These technical building blocks may be of independent
interest, e.g., they can be useful for the design of other lattice-based privacy-preserving protocols.
