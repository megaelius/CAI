Analysis and visualization of an information network can be facilitated better using an appropriate
embedding of the network. Network embedding learns a compact low-dimensional vector representation
for each node of the network, and uses this lower dimensional representation for different network
analysis tasks. Only the structure of the network is considered by a majority of the current embedding
algorithms. However, some content is associated with each node, in most of the practical applications,
which can help to understand the underlying semantics of the network. It is not straightforward
to integrate the content of each node in the current state-of-the-art network embedding methods.
In this paper, we propose a nonnegative matrix factorization based optimization framework, namely
FSCNMF which considers both the network structure and the content of the nodes while learning a lower
dimensional representation of each node in the network. Our approach systematically regularizes
structure based on content and vice versa to exploit the consistency between the structure and content
to the best possible extent. We further extend the basic FSCNMF to an advanced method, namely FSCNMF++
to capture the higher order proximities in the network. We conduct experiments on real world information
networks for different types of machine learning applications such as node clustering, visualization,
and multi-class classification. The results show that our method can represent the network significantly
better than the state-of-the-art algorithms and improve the performance across all the applications
that we consider.
