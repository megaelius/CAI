We develop a comprehensive framework to characterize and optimize the performance of a unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted D2D network, where D2D transmissions underlay cellular transmissions.
Different from conventional non-line-of-sight (NLoS) terrestrial transmissions, aerial transmissions
are highly likely to experience line-of-sight (LoS). As such, characterizing the performance
of mixed aerial-terrestrial networks with accurate fading models is critical to precise network
performance characterization and resource optimization. We first characterize closed-form
expressions for a variety of performance metrics such as frame decoding error probability (referred
to as reliability), outage probability, and ergodic capacity of users. The terrestrial and aerial
transmissions may experience either LoS Rician fading or NLoS Nakagami-m fading with a certain
probability. Based on the derived expressions, we formulate a hierarchical bi-objective mixed-integer-nonlinear-programming
(MINLP) problem to minimize the total transmit power of all users and maximize the aggregate throughput
of D2D users subject to quality-of-service (QoS) measures (i.e., reliability and ergodic capacity)
of cellular users. We model the proposed problem as a bi-partite one-to-many matching game. To solve
this problem, we first obtain the optimal closed-form power allocations for each D2D and cellular
user on any possible subchannel, and then incorporate them to devise efficient subchannel and power
allocation algorithms. Complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms is presented. Numerical
results verify the accuracy of our derived expressions and reveal the significance of aerial relays
compared to ground relays in increasing the throughput of D2D pairs especially for distant D2D pairs.
