Crowdsourcing is becoming increasingly important in entity resolution tasks due to their inherent
complexity such as clustering of images and natural language processing. Humans can provide more
insightful information for these difficult problems compared to machine-based automatic techniques.
Nevertheless, human workers can make mistakes due to lack of domain expertise or seriousness, ambiguity,
or even due to malicious intents. The state-of-the-art literature usually deals with human errors
via majority voting or by assigning a universal error rate over crowd workers. However, such approaches
are incomplete, and often inconsistent, because the expertise of crowd workers are diverse with
possible biases, thereby making it largely inappropriate to assume a universal error rate for all
workers over all crowdsourcing tasks. To this end, we mitigate the above challenges by considering
an uncertain graph model, where the edge probability between two records A and B denotes the ratio
of crowd workers who voted Yes on the question if A and B are same entity. In order to reflect independence
across different crowdsourcing tasks, we apply the well-established notion of possible worlds,
and develop parameter-free algorithms both for next crowdsourcing, as well as for entity resolution
problems. In particular, using our framework, the problem of entity resolution becomes equivalent
to finding the maximum-likelihood clustering; whereas for the next crowdsourcing, we identify
the record pair that maximally increases the reliability of the maximum-likelihood clustering.
Based on detailed empirical analysis over real-world datasets, we find that our proposed solution,
PERC (probabilistic entity resolution with imperfect crowd) improves the quality by 15% and reduces
the overall cost by 50% for the crowdsourcing-based entity resolution problem.
