Decentralized electricity markets and more integration of renewables demand expansion of the
existing transmission infrastructure to accommodate inflected variabilities in power flows.
However, such expansion is severely limited in many countries because of political and environmental
issues. Furthermore, high renewables integration requires additional reactive power support,
which forces the transmission system operators to utilize the existing grid creatively, e.g.,
take advantage of new technologies, such as flexible alternating current transmission system
(FACTS) devices. We formulate, analyze and solve the challenging investment planning problem
of installation in an existing large-scale transmission grid multiple FACTS devices of two types
(series capacitors and static VAR compensators.) We account for details of AC character of the power
flows, probabilistic modeling of multiple-load scenarios, FACTS devices flexibility in terms
of their adjustments within the capacity constraints, and long term practical tradeoffs between
capital vs operational expenditures (CAPEX vs OPEX). It is demonstrated that proper installation
of the devices allows to do both - extend or improve feasibility domain for the system and also decrease
long term power generation cost (make cheaper generation available). Nonlinear, nonconvex, and
multiple-scenario-aware optimization is resolved through an efficient heuristic algorithm
consisting of a sequence of quadratic programmings solved by CPLEX combined with exact AC PF resolution
for each scenario for maintaining feasible operational states during iterations. Efficiency
and scalability of the approach is illustrated on the IEEE 30-bus model and the 2736-bus Polish model
from Matpower.
