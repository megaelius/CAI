Network function virtualization (NFV) is an emerging design paradigm that replaces physical middlebox
devices with software modules running on general purpose commodity servers. While gradually transitioning
to NFV, Internet service providers face the problem of where to introduce NFV in order to make the
most benefit of that; here, we measure the benefit by the amount of traffic that can be serviced through
the NFV. This problem is non-trivial as it is composed of two challenging subproblems: 1) placement
of nodes to support virtual network functions (referred to as VNF-nodes); and 2) allocation of the
VNF-nodes resources to network flows. This problem has been studied recently but for the one-dimensional
setting, where all network flows require one network function, which requires a unit of resource
to process a unit of flow. In this work, we extend to the multi-dimensional setting, where flows can
require multiple network functions, which can also require a different amount of each resource
to process a unit of flow. The multi-dimensional setting introduces new challenges in addition
to those of the one-dimensional setting (e.g., NP-hardness and non-submodularity) and also makes
the resource allocation a multi-dimensional generalization of the generalized assignment problem
with assignment restrictions. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel two-level relaxation
method and utilize the primal-dual technique to design two approximation algorithms that achieve
an approximation ratio of $\frac{(e-1)(Z-1) } {2 e^2 Z (kR)^{1/(Z-1)}}$ and $\frac{(e-1)(Z-1)}{2e(Z-1+e
Z R^{1/(Z-1)})}$, where $k$ (resp. $R$) is the number of VNF-nodes (resp. resources), and $Z$ is
a measure of the available resource compared to flow demand. Finally, we perform extensive trace-driven
simulations to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
