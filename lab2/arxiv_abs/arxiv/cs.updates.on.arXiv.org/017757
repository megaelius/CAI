As of July 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has over 17 million reported cases, causing more than 667,000
deaths. Countries irrespective of economic status have succumbed to this pandemic. Many aspects
of the lives, including health, economy, freedom of movement have been negatively affected by the
coronavirus outbreak. Numerous strategies have been taken in order to prevent the outbreak. Some
countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale lockdown, while others took a moderate
approach of dealing with the pandemics, for example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public
gatherings, restricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown
strategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social interactions between
the people are primarily affected by the lockdown, psychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress,
fear are supposedly affecting the South American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore
the impact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the Spanish speaking South
American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology approach by employing large-scale Twitter
data-set over 33 million feeds in order to understand people's interaction over the months of this
on-going coronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the beginning of the pandemic, people
demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) which declined over time even though
the actual pandemic is worsening by having more positive cases, and inflicting more deaths. This
leads us to speculate that the South American population is adapting to this pandemic thus improving
the overall psychological distress.
