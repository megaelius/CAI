Software-defined networking (SDN) as a new paradigm for networking provides efficient resource
reallocation platform in emerging cloud data center networks. The dynamic nature of cloud data
center network's traffic, as well as the existence of big flows make it necessary to periodically
reprogram the network through the SDN controller. Therefore, it is critical for network researchers
to minimize the side-effects of network reconfiguration. In this way, the most challenging issue
is the number of rerouted flows that affect the network stability and QoS parameters. As a result,
dynamic reconfiguration of the network with minimum overhead (i.e. minimum flow rerouting) is
an interesting problem in SDN-based resource reallocation. In this paper, we mathematically formulated
the resource reallocation problem as an optimization problem with minimum network reconfiguration
overhead subject to QoS requirements of the applications flows. In order to reduce the time complexity
of solving the optimization problem, a forwarding table compression technique is devised making
the proposed scheme an efficient resource reallocation method which can be used as an application
on top of the SDN controller. Our Experimental results show that the proposed scheme decreases the
network reconfiguration overhead dramatically while meeting the QoS constraints. Since the reconfiguration
overhead of the proposed scheme is low, the controller can reallocate the resources more frequently
based on the network condition. We also studied the impact of the proposed network reconfiguration
scheme on packet loss and delay in the network. The results show that the proposed approach outperform
the conventional methods.
