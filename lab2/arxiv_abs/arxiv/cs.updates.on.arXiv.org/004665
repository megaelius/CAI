String matching is the fundamental algorithmic problem of deciding whether a string of length $n$
contains a pattern of length $k \leq n$. We study string matching algorithms from a nonuniform as
well as learning theoretic perspective. For nonuniform algorithms we consider the problem of designing
small circuits that solve string matching under two popular choices of gates: De Morgan and threshold
gates. For learning algorithms we consider the problem of learning a hidden pattern $\sigma$ of
length at most $k$ under the classification rule where a string is assigned 1 by the classifier if
and only if it contains $\sigma$. Perhaps surprisingly both problems seem to have hardly been studied
before. We present several upper and lower bounds on the number of gates of circuits solving string
matching. For depth 2 circuits and certain values of $k$ we demonstrate nearly linear lower bounds
for threshold circuits and super polynomial lower bounds for DeMorgan circuits. These lower bounds
are nearly tight as we provide almost matching upper bounds. For unrestricted (unbounded depth)
circuits, we present for certain values of $k$ a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n/\log n})$ for threshold
circuits and a linear lower bound for De Morgan circuits (with unbounded fanin). Our proof for threshold
circuits builds on a curious connection between detecting patterns and evaluating Boolean functions
when the truth table of the function is given explicitly. For learning algorithms we prove asymptotically
tight bounds on the VC dimension and sample complexity and provide an efficient learning algorithm.
Several extensions (e.g., classification of 2D images, multiple patterns, infinite alphabets)
are discussed as well.
