As Internet streaming of live content has gained on traditional cable TV viewership, we have also
seen significant growth of free live streaming services which illegally provide free access to
copyrighted content over the Internet. Some of these services draw millions of viewers each month.
Moreover, this viewership has continued to increase, despite the consistent coupling of this free
content with deceptive advertisements and user-hostile tracking. In this paper, we explore the
ecosystem of free illegal live streaming services by collecting and examining the behavior of a
large corpus of illegal sports streaming websites. We explore and quantify evidence of user tracking
via third-party HTTP requests, cookies, and fingerprinting techniques on more than $27,303$ unique
video streams provided by $467$ unique illegal live streaming domains. We compare the behavior
of illegal live streaming services with legitimate services and find that the illegal services
go to much greater lengths to track users than most legitimate services, and use more obscure tracking
services. Similarly, we find that moderated sites that aggregate links to illegal live streaming
content fail to moderate out sites that go to significant lengths to track users. In addition, we
perform several case studies which highlight deceptive behavior and modern techniques used by
some domains to avoid detection, monetize traffic, or otherwise exploit their viewers. Overall,
we find that despite recent improvements in mechanisms for detecting malicious browser extensions,
ad-blocking, and browser warnings, users of free illegal live streaming services are still exposed
to deceptive ads, malicious browser extensions, scams, and extensive tracking. We conclude with
insights into the ecosystem and recommendations for addressing the challenges highlighted by
this study.
