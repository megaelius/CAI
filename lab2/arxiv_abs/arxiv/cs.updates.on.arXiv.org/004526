Consider the following problem: given a database of records indexed by names (e.g., name of companies,
restaurants, businesses, or universities) and a new name, determine whether the new name is in the
database, and if so, which record it refers to. This problem is an instance of record linkage problem
and is a challenging problem because people do not consistently use the official name, but use abbreviations,
synonyms, different order of terms, different spelling of terms, short form of terms, and the name
can contain typos or spacing issues. We provide a probabilistic model using relational logistic
regression to find the probability of each record in the database being the desired record for a given
query and find the best record(s) with respect to the probabilities. Building on term-matching
and translational approaches for search, our model addresses many of the aforementioned challenges
and provides good results when existing baselines fail. Using the probabilities outputted by the
model, we can automate the search process for a portion of queries whose desired documents get a probability
higher than a trust threshold. We evaluate our model on a large real-world dataset from a telecommunications
company and compare it to several state-of-the-art baselines. The obtained results show that our
model is a promising probabilistic model for record linkage for names. We also test if the knowledge
learned by our model on one domain can be effectively transferred to a new domain. For this purpose,
we test our model on an unseen test set from the business names of the secondString dataset. Promising
results show that our model can be effectively applied to unseen datasets. Finally, we study the
sensitivity of our model to the statistics of datasets.
