Probabilistic atlases provide essential spatial contextual information for image interpretation,
Bayesian modeling, and algorithmic processing. Such atlases are typically constructed by grouping
subjects with similar demographic information. Importantly, use of the same scanner minimizes
inter-group variability. However, generalizability and spatial specificity of such approaches
is more limited than one might like. Inspired by Commowick "Frankenstein's creature paradigm"
which builds a personal specific anatomical atlas, we propose a data-driven framework to build
a personal specific probabilistic atlas under the large-scale data scheme. The data-driven framework
clusters regions with similar features using a point distribution model to learn different anatomical
phenotypes. Regional structural atlases and corresponding regional probabilistic atlases are
used as indices and targets in the dictionary. By indexing the dictionary, the whole brain probabilistic
atlases adapt to each new subject quickly and can be used as spatial priors for visualization and
processing. The novelties of this approach are (1) it provides a new perspective of generating personal
specific whole brain probabilistic atlases (132 regions) under data-driven scheme across sites.
(2) The framework employs the large amount of heterogeneous data (2349 images). (3) The proposed
framework achieves low computational cost since only one affine registration and Pearson correlation
operation are required for a new subject. Our method matches individual regions better with higher
Dice similarity value when testing the probabilistic atlases. Importantly, the advantage the
large-scale scheme is demonstrated by the better performance of using large-scale training data
(1888 images) than smaller training set (720 images).
