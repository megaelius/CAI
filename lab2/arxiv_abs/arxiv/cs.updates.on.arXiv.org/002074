We used redescription mining to find interpretable rules revealing associations between those
determinants that provide insights about the Alzheimer's disease (AD). We extended the CLUS-RM
redescription mining algorithm to a constraint-based redescription mining (CBRM) setting, which
enables several modes of targeted exploration of specific, user-constrained associations. Redescription
mining enabled finding specific constructs of clinical and biological attributes that describe
many groups of subjects of different size, homogeneity and levels of cognitive impairment. We confirmed
some previously known findings. However, in some instances, as with the attributes: testosterone,
the imaging attribute Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of Early AD, as well as the
levels of leptin and angiopoietin-2 in plasma, we corroborated previously debatable findings
or provided additional information about these variables and their association with AD pathogenesis.
Applying redescription mining on ADNI data resulted with the discovery of one largely unknown attribute:
the Pregnancy-Associated Protein-A (PAPP-A), which we found highly associated with cognitive
impairment in AD. Statistically significant correlations (p <= 0.01) were found between PAPP-A
and various different clinical tests. The high importance of this finding lies in the fact that PAPP-A
is a metalloproteinase, known to cleave insulin-like growth factor binding proteins. Since it
also shares similar substrates with A Disintegrin and the Metalloproteinase family of enzymes
that act as {\alpha}-secretase to physiologically cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the
non-amyloidogenic pathway, it could be directly involved in the metabolism of APP very early during
the disease course. Therefore, further studies should investigate the role of PAPP-A in the development
of AD more thoroughly.
