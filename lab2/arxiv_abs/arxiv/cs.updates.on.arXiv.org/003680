Dempster-Shafer evidence theory has been widely used in various fields of applications, because
of the flexibility and effectiveness in modeling uncertainties without prior information. Besides,
it has been proven that the quantum theory has powerful capabilities of solving the decision making
problems, especially for modelling human decision and cognition. However, the classical Dempster-Shafer
evidence theory modelled by real numbers cannot be integrated directly with the quantum theory
modelled by complex numbers. So, how can we establish a bridge of communications between the classical
Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and the quantum theory? To answer this question, a generalized
Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is proposed in this paper. The main contribution in this study
is that, unlike the existing evidence theory, a mass function in the generalized Dempster-Shafer
evidence theory is modelled by a complex number, called as a complex mass function. In addition,
compared with the classical Dempster's combination rule, the condition in terms of the conflict
coefficient between two evidences K < 1 is released in the generalized Dempster's combination rule
so that it is more general and applicable than the classical Dempster's combination rule. When the
complex mass function is degenerated from complex numbers to real numbers, the generalized Dempster's
combination rule degenerates to the classical evidence theory under the condition that the conflict
coefficient between the evidences K is less than 1. Numerical examples are illustrated to show the
efficiency of the generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Finally, an application of an
evidential quantum dynamical model is implemented by integrating the generalized Dempster-Shafer
evidence theory with the quantum dynamical model. From the experimental results, it validates
the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.
