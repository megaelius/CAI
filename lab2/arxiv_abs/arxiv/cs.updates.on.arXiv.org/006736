In this work, we present a new approach for competitive geometric routing in wireless ad hoc networks.
In general, it is well-known that any online routing strategy performs very poor in the worst case.
The main difficulty are uncovered regions within the wireless ad hoc network, which we denote as
radio holes. Complex shapes of radio holes, for example zig-zag-shapes, make local geometric routing
even more difficult, i.e., forwarded messages in direction to the destination might get stuck in
a dead end or are routed along very long detours, when there is no knowledge about the ad hoc network.
To obtain knowledge about the position and shape of radio holes, we make use of a hybrid network approach.
This approach assumes that we can not just make use of the ad hoc network but also of some cellular infrastructure,
which is used to gather knowledge about the underlying ad hoc network. Communication via the cellular
infrastructure incurs costs as cell phone providers are involved. Therefore, we use the cellular
infrastructure only to compute routing paths in the ad hoc network. The actual data transmission
takes place in the ad hoc network. In order to find good routing paths we aim at computing an abstraction
of the ad hoc network in which radio holes are abstracted by bounding boxes. The advantage of bounding
boxes as hole abstraction is that we only have to consider a constant number of nodes per hole. We prove
that bounding boxes are a suitable hole abstraction that allows us to find $c$-competitive paths
in the ad hoc network in case of non-intersecting bounding boxes. In case of intersecting bounding
boxes, we show via simulations that our routing strategy significantly outperforms the so far best
online routing strategies for wireless ad hoc networks. Finally, we also present a routing strategy
that is $c$-competitive in case of pairwise intersecting bounding boxes.
