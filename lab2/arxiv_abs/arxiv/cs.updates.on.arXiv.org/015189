Locally testable codes (LTC) are error-correcting codes that have a local tester which can distinguish
valid codewords from words that are "far" from all codewords by probing a given word only at a very
few (sublinear, typically constant) number of locations. Such codes form the combinatorial backbone
of PCPs. A major open problem is whether there exist LTCs with positive rate, constant relative distance
and testable with a constant number of queries. In this paper, we present a new approach towards constructing
such LTCs using the machinery of high-dimensional expanders. To this end, we consider the Tanner
representation of a code, which is specified by a graph and a base code. Informally, our result states
that if this graph is part of a high-dimensional expander then the local testability of the code follows
from the local testability of the base code. This work unifies and generalizes the known results
on testability of the Hadamard, Reed-Muller and lifted codes on the Subspace Complex, all of which
are proved via local self correction. However, unlike previous results, constant rounds of self
correction do not suffice as the diameter of the underlying test graph can be logarithmically large
in a high-dimensional expander and not constant as in all known earlier results. We overcome this
technical hurdle by performing iterative self correction with logarithmically many rounds and
tightly controlling the error in each iteration using properties of the high-dimensional expander.
Given this result, the missing ingredient towards constructing a constant-query LTC with positive
rate and constant relative distance is an instantiation of a base code that interacts well with a
constant-degree high-dimensional expander.
