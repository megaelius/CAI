Real-world complex networks are usually being modeled as graphs. The concept of graphs assumes
that the relations within the network are binary (for instance, between pairs of nodes); however,
this is not always true for many real-life scenarios, such as peer-to-peer communication schemes,
paper co-authorship, or social network interactions. For such scenarios, it is often the case that
the underlying network is better and more naturally modeled by hypergraphs. A hypergraph is a generalization
of a graph in which a single (hyper)edge can connect any number of vertices. Hypergraphs allow modelers
to have a complete representation of multi-relational (many-to-many) networks; hence, they are
extremely suitable for analyzing and discovering more subtle dependencies in such data structures.
Working with hypergraphs requires new software libraries that make it possible to perform operations
on them, from basic algorithms (such as searching or traversing the network) to computing significant
hypergraph measures, to including more challenging algorithms (such as community detection).
In this paper, we present a new software library, SimpleHypergraphs.jl, written in the Julia language
and designed for high-performance computing on hypergraphs and propose two new algorithms for
analyzing their properties: s-betweenness and modified label propagation. We also present various
approaches for hypergraph visualization integrated into our tool. In order to demonstrate how
to exploit the library in practice, we discuss two case studies based on the 2019 Yelp Challenge dataset
and the collaboration network built upon the Game of Thrones TV series. The results are promising
and they confirm the ability of hypergraphs to provide more insight than standard graph-based approaches.
