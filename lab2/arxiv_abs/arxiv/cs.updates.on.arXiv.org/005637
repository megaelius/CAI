Objective: Surgical data science is evolving into a research field that aims to observe everything
occurring within and around the treatment process to provide situation-aware data-driven assistance.
In the context of endoscopic video analysis, the accurate classification of organs in the field
of view of the camera proffers a technical challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach to anatomical
structure classification and image tagging that features an intrinsic measure of confidence to
estimate its own performance with high reliability and which can be applied to both RGB and multispectral
imaging (MI) data. Methods: Organ recognition is performed using a superpixel classification
strategy based on textural and reflectance information. Classification confidence is estimated
by analyzing the dispersion of class probabilities. Assessment of the proposed technology is performed
through a comprehensive in vivo study with seven pigs. Results: When applied to image tagging, mean
accuracy in our experiments increased from 65% (RGB) and 80% (MI) to 90% (RGB) and 96% (MI) with the
confidence measure. Conclusion: Results showed that the confidence measure had a significant
influence on the classification accuracy, and MI data are better suited for anatomical structure
labeling than RGB data. Significance: This work significantly enhances the state of art in automatic
labeling of endoscopic videos by introducing the use of the confidence metric, and by being the first
study to use MI data for in vivo laparoscopic tissue classification. The data of our experiments
will be released as the first in vivo MI dataset upon publication of this paper.
