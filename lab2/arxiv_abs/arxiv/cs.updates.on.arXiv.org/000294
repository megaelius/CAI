Recently, Cloud-based Mobile Augmentation (CMA) approaches have gained remarkable ground from
academia and industry. CMA is the state-of-the-art mobile augmentation model that employs resource-rich
clouds to increase, enhance, and optimize computing capabilities of mobile devices aiming at execution
of resource-intensive mobile applications. Augmented mobile devices envision to perform extensive
computations and to store big data beyond their intrinsic capabilities with least footprint and
vulnerability. Researchers utilize varied cloud-based computing resources (e.g., distant clouds
and nearby mobile nodes) to meet various computing requirements of mobile users. However, employing
cloud-based computing resources is not a straightforward panacea. Comprehending critical factors
that impact on augmentation process and optimum selection of cloud-based resource types are some
challenges that hinder CMA adaptability. This paper comprehensively surveys the mobile augmentation
domain and presents taxonomy of CMA approaches. The objectives of this study is to highlight the
effects of remote resources on the quality and reliability of augmentation processes and discuss
the challenges and opportunities of employing varied cloud-based resources in augmenting mobile
devices. We present augmentation definition, motivation, and taxonomy of augmentation types,
including traditional and cloud-based. We critically analyze the state-of-the-art CMA approaches
and classify them into four groups of distant fixed, proximate fixed, proximate mobile, and hybrid
to present a taxonomy. Vital decision making and performance limitation factors that influence
on the adoption of CMA approaches are introduced and an exemplary decision making flowchart for
future CMA approaches are presented. Impacts of CMA approaches on mobile computing is discussed
and open challenges are presented as the future research directions.
