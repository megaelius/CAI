We consider a natural extension to the metric uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (FLP) in
which requests ask for different commodities out of a finite set $S$ of commodities. Ravi and Sinha
(SODA'04) introduced the model as the Multi-Commodity Facility Location Problem (MFLP) and considered
it an offline optimization problem. The model itself is similar to the FLP: i.e., requests are located
at points of a finite metric space and the task of an algorithm is to construct facilities and assign
requests to facilities while minimizing the construction cost and the sum over all assignment distances.
In addition, requests and facilities are heterogeneous; they request or offer multiple commodities
out of $S$. A request has to be connected to a set of facilities jointly offering the commodities demanded
by it. In comparison to the FLP, an algorithm has to decide not only if and where to place facilities,
but also which commodities to offer at each. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to study the
problem in its online variant in which requests, their positions and their commodities are not known
beforehand but revealed over time. We present results regarding the competitive ratio. On the one
hand, we show that heterogeneity influences the competitive ratio by developing a lower bound on
the competitive ratio for any randomized online algorithm of $\Omega(\sqrt{|S|}+\frac{\log
n}{\log\log n})$ that already holds for simple line metrics. Here, $n$ is the number of requests.
On the other side, we establish a deterministic $O(\sqrt{|S|}\cdot\log n)$-competitive algorithm
and a randomized $O(\sqrt{|S|}\cdot\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$-competitive algorithm. Further,
we show that when considering a more special class of cost functions for the construction cost of
a facility, the competitive ratio decreases given by our deterministic algorithm depending on
the function.
