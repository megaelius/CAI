Scientific publishing seems to be at a turning point. Its paradigm has stayed basically the same
for 300 years but is now challenged by the increasing volume of articles that makes it very hard for
scientists to stay up to date in their respective fields. In fact, many have pointed out serious flaws
of current scientific publishing practices, including the lack of accuracy and efficiency of the
reviewing process. To address some of these problems, we apply here the general principles of the
Web and the Semantic Web to scientific publishing, focusing on the reviewing process. We want to
determine if a fine-grained model of the scientific publishing workflow can help us make the reviewing
processes better organized and more accurate, by ensuring that review comments are created with
formal links and semantics from the start. Our contributions include a novel model called Linkflows
that allows for such detailed and semantically rich representations of reviews and the reviewing
processes. We evaluate our approach on a manually curated dataset from several recent Computer
Science journals and conferences that come with open peer reviews. We gathered ground-truth data
by contacting the original reviewers and asking them to categorize their own review comments according
to our model. Comparing this ground truth to answers provided by model experts, peers, and automated
techniques confirms that our approach of formally capturing the reviewers' intentions from the
start prevents substantial discrepancies compared to when this information is later extracted
from the plain-text comments. In general, our analysis shows that our model is well understood and
easy to apply, and it revealed the semantic properties of such review comments.
