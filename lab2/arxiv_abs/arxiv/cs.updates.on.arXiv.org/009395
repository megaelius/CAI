Recent work has considered the problem of extending to the case of iterated belief change the so-called
`Harper Identity' (HI), which defines single-shot contraction in terms of single-shot revision.
The present paper considers the prospects of providing a similar extension of the Levi Identity
(LI), in which the direction of definition runs the other way. We restrict our attention here to the
three classic iterated revision operators--natural, restrained and lexicographic, for which
we provide here the first collective characterisation in the literature, under the appellation
of `elementary' operators. We consider two prima facie plausible ways of extending (LI). The first
proposal involves the use of the rational closure operator to offer a `reductive' account of iterated
revision in terms of iterated contraction. The second, which doesn't commit to reductionism, was
put forward some years ago by Nayak et al. We establish that, for elementary revision operators and
under mild assumptions regarding contraction, Nayak's proposal is equivalent to a new set of postulates
formalising the claim that contraction by $\neg A$ should be considered to be a kind of `mild' revision
by $A$. We then show that these, in turn, under slightly weaker assumptions, jointly amount to the
conjunction of a pair of constraints on the extension of (HI) that were recently proposed in the literature.
Finally, we consider the consequences of endorsing both suggestions and show that this would yield
an identification of rational revision with natural revision. We close the paper by discussing
the general prospects for defining iterated revision in terms of iterated contraction.
