Given the multitude of challenges surgeons face during mitral valve repair surgery, they should
have a high confidence in handling of instruments and in the application of surgical techniques
before they enter the operating room. Unfortunately, opportunities for surgical training of minimally-invasive
repair are very limited, leading to a situation where most surgeons undergo a steep learning curve
while operating the first patients. In order to provide a realistic tool for surgical training,
a commercial simulator was augmented by flexible patient-specific mitral valve replica. In an
elaborated production pipeline, finalized after many optimization cycles, models were segmented
from 3D ultrasound and then 3D-printable molds were computed automatically and printed in rigid
material, the lower part being water-soluble. After silicone injection, the silicone model was
dissolved from the mold and anchored in the simulator. To our knowledge, our models are the first
to comprise the full mitral valve apparatus, i.e. the annulus, leaflets, chordae tendineae and
papillary muscles. Nine different valve molds were automatically created according to the proposed
workflow (seven prolapsed valves and two valves with functional mitral insufficiency). From these
mold geometries, 16 replica were manufactured. A material test revealed that Ecoflex\textsuperscript{TM}
00-30 is the most suitable material for leaflet-mimicking tissue out of seven mixtures. Production
time was around 36h per valve. Twelve surgeons performed various surgical techniques, e.g. annuloplasty,
neo-chordae implantation, triangular leaflet resection and assessed the realism of the valves
very positively. The standardized production process guarantees a high anatomical recapitulation
of the silicone valves to the segmented models and the ultrasound data...
