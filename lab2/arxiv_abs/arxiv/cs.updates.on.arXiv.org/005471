The widespread adoption of continuously connected smartphones and tablets developed the usage
of mobile applications, among which many use location to provide geolocated services. These services
provide new prospects for users: getting directions to work in the morning, leaving a check-in at
a restaurant at noon and checking next day's weather in the evening are possible right from any mobile
device embedding a GPS chip. In these location-based applications, the user's location is sent
to a server, which uses them to provide contextual and personalised answers. However, nothing prevents
the latter from gathering, analysing and possibly sharing the collected information, which opens
the door to many privacy threats. Indeed, mobility data can reveal sensitive information about
users, among which one's home, work place or even religious and political preferences. For this
reason, many privacy-preserving mechanisms have been proposed these last years to enhance location
privacy while using geolocated services. This article surveys and organises contributions in
this area from classical building blocks to the most recent developments of privacy threats and
location privacy-preserving mechanisms. We divide the protection mechanisms between online
and offline use cases, and organise them into six categories depending on the nature of their algorithm.
Moreover, this article surveys the evaluation metrics used to assess protection mechanisms in
terms of privacy, utility and performance. Finally, open challenges and new directions to address
the problem of computational location privacy are pointed out and discussed.
