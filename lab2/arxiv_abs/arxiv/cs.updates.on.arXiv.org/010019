Knowledge in Computer Science (CS) is essential, and companies have increased their demands for
CS professionals. Despite this, many jobs remain unfilled. Furthermore, employees with computational
thinking (CT) skills are required, even if they are not actual technicians. Moreover, the gender
disparity in technology related fields is a serious problem. Even if companies want to hire women
in technology, the number of women who enter these fields is remarkably low. In high schools, most
teenagers acquire only low-level skills in CS. Thus, they may never understand the fundamental
concepts of CS, have unrealistic expectations or preconceptions, and are influenced by stereotype-based
expectations. Consequently, many teenagers exclude computing as a career path. In this research
study, we present two promising concepts to overcome these challenges. First, we consider alternative
paths to enter the field of CS. In 2018, a voluntary lecture "Design your own app" at the University
of Graz for students of all degree programs was introduced. In total, 202 students participated.
We applied a Game Development-Based Learning (GDBL) approach with the visual coding tool Pocket
Code, a mobile app developed at Graz University of Technology. The students were supposed to create
simple games directly on smartphones. The course received positive evaluations and led to our second
concept; In January 2019, we started to design a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) with the title
"Get FIT in Computer Science". First, this course can be used to encourage young women who have little
to no previous knowledge in CS. Second, it should help all teenagers to get a more realistic picture
of CS to its basic concepts. Third, teachers can use the course materials to lead high school classes
(Open Educational Resources). Finally, the MOOC can be accessed by everyone interested in this
topic.
