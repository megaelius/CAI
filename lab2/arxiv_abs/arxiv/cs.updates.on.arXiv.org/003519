Active Traffic Management (ATM) systems have been introduced by transportation agencies to manage
recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. ATM systems rely on the interconnectivity of components
made possible by wired and/or wireless networks. Unfortunately, this connectivity that supports
ATM systems also provides potential system access points that results in vulnerability to cyberattacks.
This is becoming more pronounced as ATM systems begin to integrate internet of things (IoT) devices.
Hence, there is a need to rigorously evaluate ATM systems for cyberattack vulnerabilities, and
explore design concepts that provide stability and graceful degradation in the face of cyberattacks.
In this research, a prototype ATM system along with a real-time cyberattack monitoring system were
developed for a 1.5-mile section of I-66 in Northern Virginia. The monitoring system detects deviation
from expected operation of an ATM system by comparing lane control states generated by the ATM system
with lane control states deemed most likely by the monitoring system. In case of any deviation between
two sets of states, the monitoring system displays the lane control states generated by the back-up
data source. In a simulation experiment, the prototype ATM system and cyberattack monitoring system
were subject to emulated cyberattacks. The evaluation results showed that when subject to cyberattack,
the mean speed reduced by 15% compared to the case with the ATM system and was similar to the baseline
case. This illustrates that the effectiveness of the ATM system was negated by cyberattacks. The
monitoring system however, allowed the ATM system to revert to an expected safe state and reduced
the negative impact of cyberattacks. These results illustrate the need to revisit ATM system design
concepts as a means to protect against cyberattacks in addition to traditional system intrusion
prevention approaches.
