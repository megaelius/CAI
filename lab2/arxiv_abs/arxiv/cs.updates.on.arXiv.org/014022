Tremendous advances have been made in our understanding of the properties and evolution of complex
networks. These advances were initially driven by information-poor empirical networks and theoretical
analysis of unweighted and undirected graphs. Recently, information-rich empirical data complex
networks supported the development of more sophisticated models that include edge directionality
and weight properties, and multiple layers. Many studies still focus on unweighted undirected
description of networks, prompting an essential question: how to identify when a model is simpler
than it must be? Here, we argue that the presence of centrality anomalies in complex networks is a
result of model over-simplification. Specifically, we investigate the well-known anomaly in
betweenness centrality for transportation networks, according to which highly connected nodes
are not necessarily the most central. Using a broad class of network models with weights and spatial
constraints and four large data sets of transportation networks, we show that the unweighted projection
of the structure of these networks can exhibit a significant fraction of anomalous nodes compared
to a random null model. However, the weighted projection of these networks, compared with an appropriated
null model, significantly reduces the fraction of anomalies observed, suggesting that centrality
anomalies are a symptom of model over-simplification. Because lack of information-rich data is
a common challenge when dealing with complex networks and can cause anomalies that misestimate
the role of nodes in the system, we argue that sufficiently sophisticated models be used when anomalies
are detected.
