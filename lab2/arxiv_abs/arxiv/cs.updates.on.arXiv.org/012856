Early detection of breast cancer through screening mammography yields a 20-35% increase in survival
rate; however, there are not enough radiologists to serve the growing population of women seeking
screening mammography. Although commercial computer aided detection (CADe) software has been
available to radiologists for decades, it has failed to improve the interpretation of full-field
digital mammography (FFDM) images due to its low sensitivity over the spectrum of findings. In this
work, we leverage a large set of FFDM images with loose bounding boxes of mammographically significant
findings to train a deep learning detector with extreme sensitivity. Building upon work from the
Hourglass architecture, we train a model that produces segmentation-like images with high spatial
resolution, with the aim of producing 2D Gaussian blobs centered on ground-truth boxes. We replace
the pixel-wise $L_2$ norm with a weak-supervision loss designed to achieve high sensitivity, asymmetrically
penalizing false positives and false negatives while softening the noise of the loose bounding
boxes by permitting a tolerance in misaligned predictions. The resulting system achieves a sensitivity
for malignant findings of 0.99 with only 4.8 false positive markers per image. When utilized in a
CADe system, this model could enable a novel workflow where radiologists can focus their attention
with trust on only the locations proposed by the model, expediting the interpretation process and
bringing attention to potential findings that could otherwise have been missed. Due to its nearly
perfect sensitivity, the proposed detector can also be used as a high-performance proposal generator
in two-stage detection systems.
