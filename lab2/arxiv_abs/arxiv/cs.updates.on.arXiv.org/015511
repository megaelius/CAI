The cache and transcoding of the multi-access edge computing (MEC) server and wireless resource
allocation in eNodeB interact and determine the quality of experience (QoE) of dynamic adaptive
streaming over HTTP (DASH) clients in MEC networks. However, the relationship among the three factors
has not been explored, which has led to limited improvement in clients' QoE. Therefore, we propose
a joint optimization framework of video segment cache and transcoding in MEC servers and resource
allocation to improve the QoE of DASH clients. Based on the established framework, we develop a MEC
cache management mechanism that consists of the MEC cache partition, video segment deletion, and
MEC cache space transfer. Then, a joint optimization algorithm that combines video segment cache
and transcoding in the MEC server and resource allocation is proposed. In the algorithm, the clients'
channel state and the playback status and cooperation among MEC servers are employed to estimate
the client's priority, video segment presentation switch and continuous playback time. Considering
the above four factors, we develop a utility function model of clients' QoE. Then, we formulate a
mixed-integer nonlinear programming mathematical model to maximize the total utility of DASH
clients, where the video segment cache and transcoding strategy and resource allocation strategy
are jointly optimized. To solve this problem, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm
that decomposes the original problem into multiple subproblems. The simulation results show that
our proposed algorithms efficiently improve client's throughput, received video quality and
hit ratio of video segments while decreasing the playback rebuffering time, video segment presentation
switch and system backhaul traffic.
