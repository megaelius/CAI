A non-hydrostatic depth-averaged model for dry granular flows is proposed, taking into account
vertical acceleration. A variable friction coefficient based on the $\mu(I)$ rheology is considered.
The model is obtained from an asymptotic analysis in a local reference system, where the non-hydrostatic
contribution is supposed to be small compared to the hydrostatic one. The non-hydrostatic counterpart
of the pressure may be written as the sum of two terms: one corresponding to the stress tensor and the
other to the vertical acceleration. The model introduced here is weakly non-hydrostatic, in the
sense that the non-hydrostatic contribution related to the stress tensor is not taken into account
due to its complex implementation. A simple and efficient numerical scheme is proposed. It consists
of a three-step splitting procedure, and it is based on a hydrostatic reconstruction. Two key points
are: (i) the friction force has to be taken into account before solving the non-hydrostatic pressure.
Otherwise, the incompressibility condition is not ensured; (ii) both the hydrostatic and the non-hydrostatic
pressure are taken into account when dealing with the friction force. The model and numerical scheme
are then validated based on several numerical tests, including laboratory experiments of granular
collapse. The influence of non-hydrostatic terms and of the choice of the coordinate system (Cartesian
or local) is analyzed. We show that non-hydrostatic models are less sensitive to the choice of the
coordinate system. In general, the non-hydrostatic model introduced here much better reproduces
granular collapse experiments compared to hydrostatic models. An important result is that the
simulated mass profiles up to the deposit and the front velocity are greatly improved. As expected,
the influence of the non-hydrostatic pressure is shown to be larger for small values of the slope.
