Purpose: To present a method that automatically segments and quantifies abnormal CT patterns commonly
present in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), namely ground glass opacities and consolidations.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, the proposed method takes as input a non-contrasted
chest CT and segments the lesions, lungs, and lobes in three dimensions, based on a dataset of 9749
chest CT volumes. The method outputs two combined measures of the severity of lung and lobe involvement,
quantifying both the extent of COVID-19 abnormalities and presence of high opacities, based on
deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. The first measure of (PO, PHO) is global, while the
second of (LSS, LHOS) is lobewise. Evaluation of the algorithm is reported on CTs of 200 participants
(100 COVID-19 confirmed patients and 100 healthy controls) from institutions from Canada, Europe
and the United States collected between 2002-Present (April, 2020). Ground truth is established
by manual annotations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Correlation and regression analyses were performed
to compare the prediction to the ground truth. Results: Pearson correlation coefficient between
method prediction and ground truth for COVID-19 cases was calculated as 0.92 for PO (P < .001), 0.97
for PHO(P < .001), 0.91 for LSS (P < .001), 0.90 for LHOS (P < .001). 98 of 100 healthy controls had a predicted
PO of less than 1%, 2 had between 1-2%. Automated processing time to compute the severity scores was
10 seconds per case compared to 30 minutes required for manual annotations. Conclusion: A new method
segments regions of CT abnormalities associated with COVID-19 and computes (PO, PHO), as well as
(LSS, LHOS) severity scores.
