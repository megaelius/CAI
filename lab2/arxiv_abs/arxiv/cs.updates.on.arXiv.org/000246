In an earlier paper of Cadek, Vokrinek, Wagner, and the present authors, we investigated an algorithmic
problem in computational algebraic topology, namely, the computation of all possible homotopy
classes of maps between two topological spaces, under suitable restriction on the spaces. We aim
at showing that, if the dimensions of the considered spaces are bounded by a constant, then the computations
can be done in polynomial time. In this paper we make a significant technical step towards this goal:
we show that the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z,1), represented as a simplicial group, can be equipped
with polynomial-time homology (this is a polynomial-time version of effective homology considered
in previous works of the third author and co-workers). To this end, we construct a suitable discrete
vector field, in the sense of Forman's discrete Morse theory, on K(Z,1). The construction is purely
combinatorial and it can be understood as a certain procedure for reducing finite sequences of integers,
without any reference to topology.The Eilenberg-MacLane spaces are the basic building blocks
in a Postnikov system, which is a "layered" representation of a topological space suitable for homotopy-theoretic
computations. Employing the result of this paper together with some other results on polynomial-time
homology, in another paper we obtain, for every fixed k, a polynomial-time algorithm for computing
the k-th homotopy group pi_k(X) of a given simply connected space X, as well as the first k stages of
a Postnikov system for X, and also a polynomial-time version of the algorithm of Cadek et al. mentioned
above.
