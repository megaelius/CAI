Several years of academic and industrial research efforts have converged to a common understanding
on fundamental security building blocks for the upcoming Vehicular Communication (VC) systems.
There is a growing consensus towards deploying a special-purpose identity and credential management
infrastructure, i.e., a Vehicular Public-Key Infrastructure (VPKI), enabling pseudonymous
authentication, with standardization efforts towards that direction. In spite of the progress
made by standardization bodies (IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI) and harmonization efforts (Car2Car Communication
Consortium (C2C-CC)), significant questions remain unanswered towards deploying a VPKI. Deep
understanding of the VPKI, a central building block of secure and privacy-preserving VC systems,
is still lacking. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap. We present SECMACE, a VPKI system,
which is compatible with the IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI standards specifications. We provide a detailed
description of our state-of-the-art VPKI that improves upon existing proposals in terms of security
and privacy protection, and efficiency. SECMACE facilitates multi-domain operations in the VC
systems and enhances user privacy, notably preventing linking pseudonyms based on timing information
and offering increased protection even against honest-but-curious VPKI entities. We propose
multiple policies for the vehicle-VPKI interactions, based on which and two large-scale mobility
trace datasets, we evaluate the full-blown implementation of SECMACE. With very little attention
on the VPKI performance thus far, our results reveal that modest computing resources can support
a large area of vehicles with very low delays and the most promising policy in terms of privacy protection
can be supported with moderate overhead.
