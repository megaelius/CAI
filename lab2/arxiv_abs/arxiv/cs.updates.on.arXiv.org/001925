Traffic accident data are usually noisy, contain missing values, and heterogeneous. How to select
the most important variables to improve real-time traffic accident risk prediction has become
a concern of many recent studies. This paper proposes a novel variable selection method based on
the Frequent Pattern tree (FP tree) algorithm. First, all the frequent patterns in the traffic accident
dataset are discovered. Then for each frequent pattern, a new criterion, called the Relative Object
Purity Ratio (ROPR) which we proposed, is calculated. This ROPR is added to the importance score
of the variables that differentiate one frequent pattern from the others. To test the proposed method,
a dataset was compiled from the traffic accidents records detected by only one detector on interstate
highway I-64 in Virginia in 2005. This dataset was then linked to other variables such as real-time
traffic information and weather conditions. Both the proposed method based on the FP tree algorithm,
as well as the widely utilized, random forest method, were then used to identify the important variables
or the Virginia dataset. The results indicate that there are some differences between the variables
deemed important by the FP tree and those selected by the random forest method. Following this, two
baseline models (i.e. a nearest neighbor (k-NN) method and a Bayesian network) were developed to
predict accident risk based on the variables identified by both the FP tree method and the random
forest method. The results show that the models based on the variable selection using the FP tree
performed better than those based on the random forest method for several versions of the k-NN and
Bayesian network models.The best results were derived from a Bayesian network model using variables
from FP tree. That model could predict 61.11% of accidents accurately while having a false alarm
rate of 38.16%.
