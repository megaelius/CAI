Clustering analysis has been widely used in trust evaluation on various complex networks such as
wireless sensors networks and online social networks. Spectral clustering is one of the most commonly
used algorithms for graph-structured data (networks). However, the conventional spectral clustering
is inherently difficult to work with large-scale networks due to the fact that it needs computationally
expensive matrix manipulations. To deal with large networks, in this paper, we propose an efficient
graph clustering algorithm, KCoreMotif, specifically for large networks by exploiting k-core
decomposition and motifs. The essential idea behind the proposed clustering algorithm is to perform
the efficient motif-based spectral clustering algorithm on k-core subgraphs, rather than on the
entire graph. More specifically, (1) we first conduct the k-core decomposition of the large input
network; (2) we then perform the motif-based spectral clustering for the top k-core subgraphs;
(3) we group the remaining vertices in the rest (k-1)-core subgraphs into previously found clusters;
and finally obtain the desired clusters of the large input network. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed graph clustering algorithm KCoreMotif, we use both the conventional and the motif-based
spectral clustering algorithms as the baselines and compare our algorithm with them for 18 groups
of real-world datasets. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed graph clustering algorithm
is accurate yet efficient for large networks, which also means that it can be further used to evaluate
the intra-cluster and inter-cluster trusts on large networks.
