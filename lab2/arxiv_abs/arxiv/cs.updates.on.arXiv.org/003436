An efficient iterative Earth Mover's Distance (iEMD) algorithm for visual tracking is proposed
in this paper. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is used as the similarity measure to search for the
optimal template candidates in feature-spatial space in a video sequence. The computation of the
EMD is formulated as the transportation problem from linear programming. The efficiency of the
EMD optimization problem limits its use for visual tracking. To alleviate this problem, a transportation-simplex
method is used for EMD optimization and a monotonically convergent iterative optimization algorithm
is developed. The local sparse representation is used as the appearance models for the iEMD tracker.
The maximum-alignment-pooling method is used for constructing a sparse coding histogram which
reduces the computational complexity of the EMD optimization. The template update algorithm based
on the EMD is also presented. The iEMD tracking algorithm assumes small inter-frame movement in
order to guarantee convergence. When the camera is mounted on a moving robot, e.g., a flying quadcopter,
the camera could experience a sudden and rapid motion leading to large inter-frame movements. To
ensure that the tracking algorithm converges, a gyro-aided extension of the iEMD tracker is presented,
where synchronized gyroscope information is utilized to compensate for the rotation of the camera.
The iEMD algorithm's performance is evaluated using eight publicly available datasets. The performance
of the iEMD algorithm is compared with seven state-of-the-art tracking algorithms based on relative
percentage overlap. The robustness of this algorithm for large inter-frame displacements is also
illustrated.
