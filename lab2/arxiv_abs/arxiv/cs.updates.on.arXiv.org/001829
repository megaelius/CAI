We propose new computational models for analyzing self-reported emotional diary texts of pregnant
women to support maternal care. We gathered affective ratings outside clinical setting and developed
new models to facilitate interpretation and communication of affective expressions between persons
representing different affective ratings. Relying on constructed emotion theory, models of dimensional
emotion categories and affective ratings of Self Assessment Manikin, we demonstrate our new proposal
to analyze linguistic data with computational models exploiting vector space and clustering methods.
35 persons having Finnish as a native language provided affective ratings for 195 emotional adjectives
and 16 pregnancy-related nouns in Finnish in dimensions of pleasure, arousal and dominance. We
developed new models to represent dependencies and differences of affective ratings between various
population subgroup categorizations, including "women without children", "women with children"
and "men without children" that we consider important population segments to be addressed in maternal
care. Our affective ratings showed significant correlations between pleasure and dominance (like
Warriner et al., 2013) and with previous data collections (S\"oderholm et al., 2013; Eilola & Havelka,
2010; Warriner et al., 2013). Our affective ratings had significant effects on categorizations
based on gender, gender-parental role and the time of the day and duration of giving ratings. Our
results indicate accordance with significant affectivity differences of gender and age (Warriner
et al., 2013) and motherhood (Rosebrock et al., 2015). Our proposed models aim to support health-related
communication. Our results suggest gathering next the affective ratings of patients of maternal
care in a real clinical setting.
