This paper presents a novel method for finding features in the analysis of variable distributions
stemming from time series. We apply the methodology to the case of submitted and accepted papers
in peer-reviewed journals. We provide a comparative study of editorial decisions for papers submitted
to two peer-reviewed journals: the Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society (JSCS) and this MDPI
Entropy journal. We cover three recent years for which the fate of submitted papers, about 600 papers
to JSCS and 2500 to Entropy, is completely determined. Instead of comparing the number distributions
of these papers as a function of time with respect to a uniform distribution, we analyze the relevant
probabilities, from which we derive the information entropy. It is argued that such probabilities
are indeed more relevant for authors than the actual number of submissions. We tie this entropy analysis
to the so called diversity of the variable distributions. Furthermore, we emphasize the correspondence
between the entropy and the diversity with inequality measures, like the Herfindahl-Hirschman
index and the Theil index, itself being in the class of entropy measures; the Gini coefficient which
also measures the diversity in ranking is calculated for further discussion. In this sample, the
seasonal aspects of the peer review process are outlined. It is found that the use of such indices,
non linear transformations of the data distributions, allow to distinguish features and evolutions
of peer review process as a function of time as well as comparing non-uniformity of distributions.
Furthermore, t- and z- statistical tests are applied in order to measure the significance (p-level)
of the findings, i.e. whether papers are more likely to be accepted if they are submitted during a
few specific months or "season"; the predictability strength depends on the journal.
