Stone-type duality theorems, which relate algebraic and relational/topological models, are
important tools in logic because -- in addition to elegant abstraction -- they strengthen soundness
and completeness to a categorical equivalence, yielding a framework through which both algebraic
and topological methods can be brought to bear on a logic. We give a systematic treatment of Stone-type
duality for the structures that interpret bunched logics, starting with the weakest systems, recovering
the familiar BI and Boolean BI (BBI), and extending to both classical and intuitionistic Separation
Logic. We demonstrate the uniformity and modularity of this analysis by additionally capturing
the bunched logics obtained by extending BI and BBI with modalities and multiplicative connectives
corresponding to disjunction, negation and falsum. This includes the logic of separating modalities
(LSM), De Morgan BI (DMBI), Classical BI (CBI), and the sub-classical family of logics extending
Bi-intuitionistic (B)BI (Bi(B)BI). We additionally obtain as corollaries soundness and completeness
theorems for the specific Kripke-style models of these logics as presented in the literature: for
DMBI, the sub-classical logics extending BiBI and a new bunched logic, Concurrent Kleene BI (connecting
our work to Concurrent Separation Logic), this is the first time soundness and completeness theorems
have been proved. We thus obtain a comprehensive semantic account of the multiplicative variants
of all standard propositional connectives in the bunched logic setting. This approach synthesises
a variety of techniques from modal, substructural and categorical logic and contextualizes the
"resource semantics" interpretation underpinning Separation Logic amongst them.
