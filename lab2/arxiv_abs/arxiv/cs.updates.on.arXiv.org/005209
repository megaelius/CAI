Sample entropy ($SampEn$) has been accepted as an alternate, and sometimes a replacement, measure
to approximate entropy ($ApEn$) for characterizing temporal complexity of time series. However,
it still suffers from issues such as inconsistency over short-length signals and its tolerance
parameter $r$, susceptibility to signal amplitude changes and insensitivity to self-similarity
of time series. We propose modifications to the $ApEn$ and $SampEn$ measures which are defined for
0<$r$<1, are more robust to signal amplitude changes and sensitive to self-similarity property
of time series. We modified $ApEn$ and $SampEn$ by redefining the distance function used originally
in their definitions. We then evaluated the new entropy measures, called range entropies ($RangeEn$)
using different random processes and nonlinear deterministic signals. We further applied the
proposed entropies to normal and epileptic electroencephalographic (EEG) signals under different
states. Our results suggest that, unlike $ApEn$ and $SampEn$, $RangeEn$ measures are robust to
stationary and nonstationary signal amplitude variations and that their trajectories in the tolerance
r-plane are constrained between 0 (maximum entropy) and 1 (minimum entropy). We also showed that
$RangeEn$ have direct relationships with the Hurst exponent; suggesting that the new definitions
are sensitive to self-similarity structures of signals. $RangeEn$ analysis of epileptic EEG data
showed distinct behaviours in the $r$-domain for extracranial versus intracranial recordings
as well as different states of epileptic EEG data. The constrained trajectory of $RangeEn$ in the
r-plane makes them a good candidate for studying complex biological signals such as EEG during seizure
and non-seizure states. The Python package used to generate the results shown in this paper is publicly
