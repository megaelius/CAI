Diagnosing Parkinson's disease is a complex task that requires the evaluation of several motor
and non-motor symptoms. During diagnosis, gait abnormalities are among the important symptoms
that physicians should consider. However, gait evaluation is challenging and relies on the expertise
and subjectivity of clinicians. In this context, the use of an intelligent gait analysis algorithm
may assist physicians in order to facilitate the diagnosis process. This paper proposes a novel
intelligent Parkinson detection system based on deep learning techniques to analyze gait information.
We used 1D convolutional neural network (1D-Convnet) to build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier.
The proposed model processes 18 1D-signals coming from foot sensors measuring the vertical ground
reaction force (VGRF). The first part of the network consists of 18 parallel 1D-Convnet corresponding
to system inputs. The second part is a fully connected network that connects the concatenated outputs
of the 1D-Convnets to obtain a final classification. We tested our algorithm in Parkinson's detection
and in the prediction of the severity of the disease with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS). Our experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed method in the detection
of Parkinson disease based on gait data. The proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 98.7 %. To
our knowledge, this is the state-of-the-start performance in Parkinson's gait recognition. Furthermore,
we achieved an accuracy of 85.3 % in Parkinson's severity prediction. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first algorithm to perform a severity prediction based on the UPDRS. Our results show
that the model is able to learn intrinsic characteristics from gait data and to generalize to unseen
subjects, which could be helpful in a clinical diagnosis.
