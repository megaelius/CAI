The field of Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is one of the most important areas in the general field
of optimization, with important applications found in every industry, including both the private
and public sectors. It is also one of the most active research areas pursued by the research communities
of Operations Research, Computer Science, and Analytics as they work to design and test new methods
for solving real world CO problems. In recent years, we have discovered that a mathematical formulation
known as QUBO, an acronym for a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, can embrace
a large variety of important CO problems found in industry and government. Through special reformulation
techniques that are easy to apply, the power of QUBO solvers can be used to efficiently solve many
important problems once they are put into the QUBO framework. This two-step process of first re-casting
an original model into the form of a QUBO model and then solving it with appropriate software enables
the QUBO model to become a unifying framework for combinatorial optimization. The alternative
path that results for effectively modeling and solving many important problems is a new development
in the field of combinatorial optimization. The materials provided in subsequent sections illustrate
the process of reformulating important optimization problems as QUBO models through a series of
explicit examples. Collectively these examples highlight the application breadth of the QUBO
model. We do not focus here on modeling a given problem in the form classically adopted in the optimization
community. Rather, our examples disclose the methods that can be used to recast a given problem,
perhaps existing in a classical mathematical form, into an equivalent QUBO model.
