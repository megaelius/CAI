Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology is a disruptive technology that provides the infrastructure
for developing decentralized applications enabling the implementation of novel business models
even in traditionally centralized domains. In the last years it has drawn high interest from the
academic community, technology developers and startups thus lots of solutions have been developed
to address blockchain technology limitations and the requirements of applications software engineering.
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of DLT solutions analyzing the addressed challenges,
provided solutions and their usage for developing decentralized applications. Our study reviews
over 100 blockchain papers and startup initiatives from which we construct a 3-tier based architecture
for decentralized applications and we use it to systematically classify the technology solutions.
Protocol and Network Tier solutions address the digital assets registration, transactions, data
structure, and privacy and business rules implementation and the creation of peer-to-peer networks,
ledger replication, and consensus-based state validation. Scaling Tier solutions address the
scalability problems in terms of storage size, transaction throughput, and computational capability.
Finally, Federated Tier aggregates integrative solutions across multiple blockchain applications
deployments. The paper closes with a discussion on challenges and opportunities for developing
decentralized applications by providing a multi-step guideline for decentralizing the design
of traditional systems and implementing decentralized applications.
