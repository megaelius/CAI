This work focuses on classification over time series data. When a time series is generated by non-stationary
phenomena, the pattern relating the series with the class to be predicted may evolve over time (concept
drift). Consequently, predictive models aimed to learn this pattern may become eventually obsolete,
hence failing to sustain performance levels of practical use. To overcome this model degradation,
online learning methods incrementally learn from new data samples arriving over time, and accommodate
eventual changes along the data stream by implementing assorted concept drift strategies. In this
manuscript we elaborate on the suitability of online learning methods to predict the road congestion
level based on traffic speed time series data. We draw interesting insights on the performance degradation
when the forecasting horizon is increased. As opposed to what is done in most literature, we provide
evidence of the importance of assessing the distribution of classes over time before designing
and tuning the learning model. This previous exercise may give a hint of the predictability of the
different congestion levels under target. Experimental results are discussed over real traffic
speed data captured by inductive loops deployed over Seattle (USA). Several online learning methods
are analyzed, from traditional incremental learning algorithms to more elaborated deep learning
models. As shown by the reported results, when increasing the prediction horizon, the performance
of all models degrade severely due to the distribution of classes along time, which supports our
claim about the importance of analyzing this distribution prior to the design of the model.
