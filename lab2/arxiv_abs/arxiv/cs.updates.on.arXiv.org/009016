Unsupervised machine learning is the training of an artificial intelligence system using information
that is neither classified nor labeled, with a view to modeling the underlying structure or distribution
in a dataset. Since unsupervised machine learning systems are widely used in many real-world applications,
assessing the appropriateness of these systems and validating their implementations with respect
to individual users' requirements and specific application scenarios$\,/\,$contexts are indisputably
two important tasks. Such assessment and validation tasks, however, are fairly challenging due
to the absence of a priori knowledge of the data. In view of this challenge, we develop a $\textbf{MET}$amorphic
$\textbf{T}$esting approach to assessing and validating unsupervised machine $\textbf{LE}$arning
systems, abbreviated as METTLE. Our approach provides a new way to unveil the (possibly latent)
characteristics of various machine learning systems, by explicitly considering the specific
expectations and requirements of these systems from individual users' perspectives. To support
METTLE, we have further formulated 11 generic metamorphic relations (MRs), covering users' generally
expected characteristics that should be possessed by machine learning systems. To demonstrate
the viability and effectiveness of METTLE we have performed an experiment involving six commonly
used clustering systems. Our experiment has shown that, guided by user-defined MR-based adequacy
criteria, end users are able to assess, validate, and select appropriate clustering systems in
accordance with their own specific needs. Our investigation has also yielded insightful understanding
and interpretation of the behavior of the machine learning systems from an end-user software engineering's
perspective, rather than a designer's or implementor's perspective, who normally adopts a theoretical
approach.
