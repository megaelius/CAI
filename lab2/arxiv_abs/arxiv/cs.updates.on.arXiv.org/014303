5G and edge computing will serve various emerging use cases that have diverse requirements of multiple
resources, e.g., radio, transportation, and computing. Network slicing is a promising technology
for creating virtual networks that can be customized according to the requirements of different
use cases. Provisioning network slices requires end-to-end resource orchestration which is challenging.
In this paper, we design a decentralized resource orchestration system named EdgeSlice for dynamic
end-to-end network slicing. EdgeSlice introduces a new decentralized deep reinforcement learning
(D-DRL) method to efficiently orchestrate end-to-end resources. D-DRL is composed of a performance
coordinator and multiple orchestration agents. The performance coordinator manages the resource
orchestration policies in all the orchestration agents to ensure the service level agreement (SLA)
of network slices. The orchestration agent learns the resource demands of network slices and orchestrates
the resource allocation accordingly to optimize the performance of the slices under the constrained
networking and computing resources. We design radio, transport and computing manager to enable
dynamic configuration of end-to-end resources at runtime. We implement EdgeSlice on a prototype
of the end-to-end wireless edge computing network with OpenAirInterface LTE network, OpenDayLight
SDN switches, and CUDA GPU platform. The performance of EdgeSlice is evaluated through both experiments
and trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that EdgeSlice achieves much improvement
as compared to baseline in terms of performance, scalability, compatibility.
