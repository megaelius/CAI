In this work we propose to improve text recognition from a new perspective by separating text content
from complex backgrounds. We exploit the generative adversarial networks (GANs) for removing
backgrounds while retaining the text content. As vanilla GANs are not sufficiently robust to generate
sequence-like characters in natural images, we propose an adversarial learning framework for
the generation and recognition of multiple characters in an image. The proposed framework consists
of an attention-based recognizer and a generative adversarial architecture. Furthermore, to
tackle the lack of paired training samples, we design an interactive joint training scheme, which
shares attention masks from the recognizer to the discriminator, and enables the discriminator
to extract the features of every character for further adversarial training. Benefiting from the
character-level adversarial training, our framework requires only unpaired simple data for style
supervision. Every target style sample containing only one randomly chosen character can be simply
synthesized online during the training. This is significant as the training does not require costly
paired samples or character-level annotations. Thus, only the input images and corresponding
text labels are needed. In addition to the style transfer of the backgrounds, we refine character
patterns to ease the recognition task. A feedback mechanism is proposed to bridge the gap between
the discriminator and the recognizer. Therefore, the discriminator can guide the generator according
to the confusion of the recognizer. The generated patterns are thus clearer for recognition. Experiments
on various benchmarks, including both regular and irregular text, demonstrate that our method
significantly reduces the difficulty of recognition. Our framework can be integrated with recent
recognition methods to achieve new state-of-the-art performance.
