All Italian consonants affected by gemination, that is affricates, fricatives, liquids, nasals
and stops were analysed within a project named GEMMA that lasted over a span of about 25 years. Results
of the analysis on stops, as published in a previous paper, had shown that the main acoustic cue to
gemination in Italian is closure duration, while frequency and energy domain parameters were not
significantly affected by gemination. This paper - the first of a set of two covering all remaining
consonants - addresses nasals and liquids; its companion paper addresses affricates and fricatives.
Results on nasals and liquids confirm the findings on stops, and reinforce the hypothesis that the
primary acoustic cue to gemination in Italian is durational in nature, and corresponds to a lengthened
consonant duration. Results also show an inverse correlation between consonant and pre-consonant
vowel durations. This correlation is, however, also present when considering singleton vs. geminate
word sets separately, indicating a sort of duration compensation between these phonemes to eventually
preserve rhythmical structures; this inverse correlation is reinforced when considering singleton
and geminate sets combined. Classification tests of single vs. geminate consonants show that,
for both nasals and liquids, best classification scores are obtained using consonant duration,
that is a durational parameter. Although slightly less performing, the ratio between consonant
and pre-consonant vowel durations is also a potential good candidate for automatic classification
of nasals and liquids geminate vs singleton consonants in Italian.
