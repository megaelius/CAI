Introduction. Development of methodical system for training course "Foundations of mathematical
informatics" plays a key role in forming the students' of technical universities competencies
in mathematical informatics. So it is very important to analyze of the components of methodical
system, identify the weaknesses and problems that can significantly impair its quality and which
can not be overcome without its further development. Purpose. Develop a model of methodical system
of training course "Foundations of mathematical informatics" for students of technical universities
and specify its target component. Methods. Using cloud technologies at learning the foundations
of mathematical informatics requires the construction technology training, which results in
the selection of appropriate cloudoriented forms of organization and teaching methods. On the
other hand, the theory, methods and tools for cloud significantly affect the primary content of
learning and its goals. Thus, the cloud technology theory, methods and tools are the basis for constructing
methodical system of training course "Foundations of mathematical informatics". Results. Development
of methodical system of training course "Foundations of mathematical informatics" plays a leading
role in forming the students' of technical universities competencies in mathematical informatics
due to its fundamental impact and technology improvement. Conclusion. The model of methodical
system of training course "Foundations of mathematical informatics" includes content, objectives
and learning technology. The last one contains forms of organization, methods and teaching tools,
including leading cloud technologies. The main purpose of training course "Foundations of mathematical
informatics" is developing of students competencies of technical universities in mathematical
informatics.
