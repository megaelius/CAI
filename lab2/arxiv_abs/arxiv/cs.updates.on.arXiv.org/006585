Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) access networks have been widely deployed due to the complementary advantages
of high-capacity fiber backhaul and ubiquitous wireless front end. To meet the increasing demands
for bandwidth-hungry applications, access points (APs) are densely deployed and new wireless
network standards have been published for higher data rates. Hence, fiber backhaul in FiWi access
networks is still facing the incoming bandwidth capacity crunch. In this paper, we involve caches
in FiWi access networks to cope with fiber backhaul bottleneck and enhance the network throughput.
On the other hand, power consumption is an important issue in wireless access networks. As both power
budget in wireless access networks and bandwidth of fiber backhaul are constrained, it is challenging
to properly leverage power for caching and that for wireless transmission to achieve optimal system
performance. To address this challenge, we formulate the downlink wireless access throughput
maximization problem by joint consideration of power allocation and caching strategy in FiWi access
networks. To solve the problem, firstly, we propose a volume adjustable backhaul-constrained
water-filling method (VABWF) to derive the expression of optimal wireless transmission power
allocation. Then, we reformulate the problem as a multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP) and
propose a dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal solution of the MCKP problem. Simulation
results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing algorithms in terms
of system throughput under different FiWi access network scenarios.
