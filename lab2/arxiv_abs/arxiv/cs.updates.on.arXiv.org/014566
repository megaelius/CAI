Manipulation and grasping with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) currently require accurate positioning
and are often executed at reduced speed to ensure successful grasps. This is due to the fact that typical
UAVs can only accommodate rigid manipulators with few degrees of freedom, which limits their capability
to compensate for disturbances caused by the vehicle positioning errors. Moreover, they have to
minimize external contact forces in order to maintain stability. Biological systems, on the other
hand, exploit softness to overcome similar limitations, and fully exploit compliance to enable
aggressive grasping. This paper investigates control and trajectory optimization for a soft aerial
manipulator, consisting of a quadrotor and a tendon-actuated soft gripper, in which the advantages
of softness can be fully exploited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work at the intersection
between soft manipulation and UAV control. We present a decoupled approach for the quadrotor and
the soft gripper, combining (i) a geometric controller and a minimum-snap trajectory optimization
for the quadrotor (rigid) base, with (ii) a quasi-static finite element model and control-space
interpolation for the soft gripper. We prove that the geometric controller asymptotically stabilizes
the quadrotor velocity and attitude despite the addition of the soft load. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed system in a realistic soft dynamics simulator, and show that: (i) the geometric controller
is fairly insensitive to the soft payload, (ii) the platform can reliably grasp unknown objects
despite inaccurate positioning and initial conditions, and (iii) the decoupled controller is
amenable for real-time execution.
