Any theory amenable to scientific inquiry must have testable consequences. This minimal criterion
is uniquely challenging for the study of consciousness, as we do not know if it is possible to confirm
via observation from the outside whether or not a physical system knows what it feels like to have
an inside - a challenge referred to as the "hard problem" of consciousness. To arrive at a theory of
consciousness, the hard problem has motivated the development of phenomenological approaches
that adopt assumptions of what properties consciousness has based on first-hand experience and,
from these, derive the physical processes that give rise to these properties. A leading theory adopting
this approach is Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which assumes our subjective experience
is a "unified whole", subsequently yielding a requirement for physical feedback as a necessary
condition for consciousness. Here, we develop a mathematical framework to assess the validity
of this assumption by testing it in the context of isomorphic physical systems with and without feedback.
The isomorphism allows us to isolate changes in $\Phi$ without affecting the size or functionality
of the original system. Indeed, we show that the only mathematical difference between a "conscious"
system with $\Phi>0$ and an isomorphic "philosophical zombies" with $\Phi=0$ is a permutation
of the binary labels used to internally represent functional states. This implies $\Phi$ is sensitive
to functionally arbitrary aspects of a particular labeling scheme, with no clear justification
in terms of phenomenological differences. In light of this, we argue any quantitative theory of
consciousness, including IIT, should be invariant under isomorphisms if it is to avoid the existence
of isomorphic philosophical zombies and the epistemological problems they pose.
