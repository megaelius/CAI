There has been a great deal of work establishing that random linear codes are as list-decodable as
uniformly random codes, in the sense that a random linear binary code of rate $1 - H(p) - \epsilon$
is $(p,O(1/\epsilon))$-list-decodable. In this work, we show that in fact random linear binary
codes are \em more \em list-decodable than uniformly random codes, in the sense that the constant
in the $O(1/\epsilon)$ is strictly smaller for random linear codes than for uniformly random codes.
For our upper bound on the list size of random linear codes, we strengthen an existential argument
of (Guruswami, H{\aa}stad, Sudan and Zuckerman, IEEE Trans. IT, 2002) to hold with high probability.
In addition to improving known list-size bounds, our argument works simultaneously for all values
of $p$, while previous works obtaining $L = O(1/\epsilon)$ patched together different arguments
to cover different parameter regimes. To complement our upper bound for random linear codes, we
also improve an argument of (Guruswami, Narayanan, IEEE Trans. IT, 2014) to obtain an essentially
tight lower bound on the list size of uniformly random codes. To demonstrate the applicability of
these techniques, we use them to (a) obtain more information about the distribution of list sizes
of random linear codes and (b) to prove a similar result for random linear rank-metric codes. More
precisely, we prove that in some parameter regimes, random linear rank-metric codes have strictly
smaller list sizes than uniformly random rank-metric codes; our upper bound improves upon a recent
result of Guruswami and Resch, and we prove a new lower bound on the list size for uniformly rank metric
codes.
