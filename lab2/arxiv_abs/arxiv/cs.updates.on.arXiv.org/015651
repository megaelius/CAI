Humans are what constitutes the most complex and complicated, yet fascinating, component of a software
engineering endeavor. A meaningful and deep understanding of the human aspects of software engineering
requires psychological constructs to be taken into account. We argue that psychology and statistics
theory would facilitate the development and adoption of valid and reliable instruments to assess
these constructs. In particular, to ensure high quality, the psychometric properties of measurement
instruments need evaluation. In this paper, we provide an introduction to psychometric theory
for the evaluation of measurement instruments (e.g., psychological tests and questionnaires)
for software engineering researchers. We present guidelines that enable using existing instruments
and developing new ones adequately. We conducted a field survey of the psychology literature, including
journal articles, textbooks, and society standards, framed by the Standards for Educational and
Psychological Testing (American Educational Research Association et al, 2014). We detail activities
used when operationalizing new psychological constructs, such as item analysis, factor analysis,
standardization and normalization, reliability, validity, and fairness in testing and test bias.
With this paper, we hope to encourage a culture change in software engineering research towards
the adoption of established methods from social science. To improve the quality of behavioral research,
we believe that studies focusing on introducing and psychometrically validating measurement
instruments need to be more common. Finally, we present an example of a psychometric evaluation
based on our guidelines, to which we openly provide code and dataset.
