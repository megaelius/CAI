Digital watermarking is a technique of information adding or information hiding in order to identify
the owner of the data in multimedia content. It seems that a signal or digital image can permanently
embed over another digital data providing a good way to protect intellectual property from illegal
replication. The cover data that is transmitted through the internet hides the watermark in a computer
aided assertion method such that it becomes undetectable. Finally it stands as a hindrance over
many operations without harming the embedded host document. Unfortunately, many owners of the
digital materials such as images, text, audio and video are reluctant to the spreading of their documents
on the web or other networked environment, because the ease of duplicating digital materials facilitates
copyright violation. Digital media distribution occurs through various channels. The cover data
may or may not hold any relation with the watermark information. In the last two decades, a considerable
amount of research has been done on the digital watermarking of multimedia files such as audio, video,
images and text. Different type of watermarking algorithms has been proposed by the researchers
to achieve high level of security and authenticity. In our proposed method, a modified reversible
watermarking technique is introduced, which employs a blueprint generation of original image
based on odd-even embedding methodology to yield large data hiding capacity, security as well as
high watermarked quality. The experimental results demonstrate that, no matter how much secret
data is embedded, the watermarked quality is about 51dB in this proposed scheme.
