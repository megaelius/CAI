In the past few years, generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have dramatically
advanced our ability to represent and parameterize high-dimensional, non-linear image manifolds.
As a result, they have been widely adopted across a variety of applications, ranging from challenging
inverse problems like image completion, to being used as a prior in problems such as anomaly detection
and adversarial defense. A recurring theme in many of these applications is the notion of projecting
an image observation onto the manifold that is inferred by the generator. In this context, Projected
Gradient Descent (PGD) has been the most popular approach, which essentially searches for a latent
representation with the goal of minimizing discrepancy between a generated image and the given
observation. However, PGD is an extremely brittle optimization technique that fails to identify
the right projection when the observation is corrupted, even by a small amount. Unfortunately,
such corruptions are common in the real world, for example arbitrary images with unknown crops,
rotations, missing pixels, or other kinds of distribution shifts requiring a more robust projection
technique. In this paper we propose corruption-mimicking, a new strategy that utilizes a surrogate
network to approximate the unknown corruption directly at test time, without the need for additional
supervision or data augmentation. The proposed projection technique significantly improves
the robustness of PGD under a wide variety of corruptions, thereby enabling a more effective use
of GANs in real-world applications. More importantly, we show that our approach produces state-of-the-art
performance in several GAN-based applications -- anomaly detection, domain adaptation, and adversarial
defense, that rely on an accurate projection.
