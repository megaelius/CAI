Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have made significant advances in semi-supervised learning,
especially for classification tasks. However, existing GCN based methods have two main drawbacks.
First, to increase the receptive field and improve the representation capability of GCNs, larger
kernels or deeper network architectures are used, which greatly increases the computational complexity
and the number of parameters. Second, methods working on higher order graphs computed directly
from adjacency matrices may alter the relationship between graph nodes, particularly for weighted
graphs. In addition, the direct construction of higher-order graphs introduces redundant information,
which may result in lower network performance. To address the above weaknesses, in this paper, we
propose a new method of multi-hop convolutional network on weighted graphs. The proposed method
consists of multiple convolutional branches, where each branch extracts node representation
from a $k$-hop graph with small kernels. Such design systematically aggregates multi-scale contextual
information without adding redundant information. Furthermore, to efficiently combine the extracted
information from the multi-hop branches, an adaptive weight computation (AWC) layer is proposed.
We demonstrate the superiority of our MultiHop in six publicly available datasets, including three
citation network datasets and three medical image datasets. The experimental results show that
our proposed MultiHop method achieves the highest classification accuracy and outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods. The source code of this work have been released on GitHub (https://github.com/ahukui/Multi-hop-Convolutions-on-Weighted-Graphs).
