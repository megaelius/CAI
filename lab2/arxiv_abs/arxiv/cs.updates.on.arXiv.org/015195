Ever since the first case of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was confirmed in Wuhan, China,
social distancing has been promoted worldwide, including the United States. It is one of the major
community mitigation strategies, also known as non-pharmaceutical interventions. However,
our understanding is remaining limited in how people practice social distancing. In this study,
we construct a Social Distancing Index (SDI) to evaluate people's mobility pattern changes along
with the spread of COVID-19. We utilize an integrated dataset of mobile device location data for
the contiguous United States plus Alaska and Hawaii over a 100-day period from January 1, 2020 to
April 9, 2020. The major findings are: 1) the declaration of the national emergency concerning the
COVID-19 outbreak greatly encouraged social distancing and the mandatory stay-at-home orders
in most states further strengthened the practice; 2) the states with more confirmed cases have taken
more active and timely responses in practicing social distancing; 3) people in the states with fewer
confirmed cases did not pay much attention to maintaining social distancing and some states, e.g.,
Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana, already began to practice less social distancing despite the
high increasing speed of confirmed cases; 4) some counties with the highest infection rates are
not performing much social distancing, e.g., Randolph County and Dougherty County in Georgia,
and some counties began to practice less social distancing right after the increasing speed of confirmed
cases went down, e.g., in Blaine County, Idaho, which may be dangerous as well.
