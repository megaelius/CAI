One of the methods for stratifying different molecular classes of breast cancer is the Nottingham
Prognostic Index Plus (NPI+) which uses breast cancer relevant biomarkers to stain tumour tissues
prepared on tissue microarray (TMA). To determine the molecular class of the tumour, pathologists
will have to manually mark the nuclei activity biomarkers through a microscope and use a semi-quantitative
assessment method to assign a histochemical score (H-Score) to each TMA core. Manually marking
positively stained nuclei is a time consuming, imprecise and subjective process which will lead
to inter-observer and intra-observer discrepancies. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep
learning system which directly predicts the H-Score automatically. Our system imitates the pathologists'
decision process and uses one fully convolutional network (FCN) to extract all nuclei region (tumour
and non-tumour), a second FCN to extract tumour nuclei region, and a multi-column convolutional
neural network which takes the outputs of the first two FCNs and the stain intensity description
image as input and acts as the high-level decision making mechanism to directly output the H-Score
of the input TMA image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end system that takes
a TMA image as input and directly outputs a clinical score. We will present experimental results
which demonstrate that the H-Scores predicted by our model have very high and statistically significant
correlation with experienced pathologists' scores and that the H-Score discrepancy between our
algorithm and the pathologists is on par with the inter-subject discrepancy between the pathologists.
