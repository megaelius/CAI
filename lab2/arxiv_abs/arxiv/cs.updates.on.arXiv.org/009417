Objective: To test automated in vivo estimation of active and passive skeletal muscle states using
ultrasonic imaging. Background: Current technology (electromyography, dynamometry, shear
wave imaging) provides no general, non-invasive method for online estimation of skeletal intramuscular
states. Ultrasound (US) allows non-invasive imaging of muscle, yet current computational approaches
have never achieved simultaneous extraction nor generalisation of independently varying, active
and passive states. We use deep learning to investigate the generalizable content of 2D US muscle
images. Method: US data synchronized with electromyography of the calf muscles, with measures
of joint moment/angle were recorded from 32 healthy participants (7 female, ages: 27.5, 19-65).
We extracted a region of interest of medial gastrocnemius and soleus using our prior developed accurate
segmentation algorithm. From the segmented images, a deep convolutional neural network was trained
to predict three absolute, drift-free, components of the neurobiomechanical state (activity,
joint angle, joint moment) during experimentally designed, simultaneous, independent variation
of passive (joint angle) and active (electromyography) inputs. Results: For all 32 held-out participants
(16-fold cross-validation) the ankle joint angle, electromyography, and joint moment were estimated
to accuracy 55+-8%, 57+-11%, and 46+-9% respectively. Significance: With 2D US imaging, deep neural
networks can encode in generalizable form, the activity-length-tension state relationship of
muscle. Observation only, low power, 2D US imaging can provide a new category of technology for non-invasive
estimation of neural output, length and tension in skeletal muscle. This proof of principle has
value for personalised muscle diagnosis in pain, injury, neurological conditions, neuropathies,
myopathies and ageing.
