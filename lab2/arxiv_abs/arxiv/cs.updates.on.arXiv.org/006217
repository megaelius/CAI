It has long been observed that for practically any computational problem that has been intensely
studied, different instances are best solved using different algorithms. This is particularly
pronounced for computationally hard problems, where in most cases, no single algorithm defines
the state of the art; instead, there is a set of algorithms with complementary strengths. This performance
complementarity can be exploited in various ways, one of which is based on the idea of selecting,
from a set of given algorithms, for each problem instance to be solved the one expected to perform
best. The task of automatically selecting an algorithm from a given set is known as the per-instance
algorithm selection problem and has been intensely studied over the past 15 years, leading to major
improvements in the state of the art in solving a growing number of discrete combinatorial problems,
including propositional satisfiability and AI planning. Per-instance algorithm selection also
shows much promise for boosting performance in solving continuous and mixed discrete/continuous
optimisation problems. This survey provides an overview of research in automated algorithm selection,
ranging from early and seminal works to recent and promising application areas. Different from
earlier work, it covers applications to discrete and continuous problems, and discusses algorithm
selection in context with conceptually related approaches, such as algorithm configuration,
scheduling or portfolio selection. Since informative and cheaply computable problem instance
features provide the basis for effective per-instance algorithm selection systems, we also provide
an overview of such features for discrete and continuous problems. Finally, we provide perspectives
on future work in the area and discuss a number of open research challenges.
