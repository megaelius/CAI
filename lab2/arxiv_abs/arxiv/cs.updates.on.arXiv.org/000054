One important classifier ensemble for multiclass classification problems is the Error-Correcting
Output Code (ECOC). It bridges the multiclass problem and the binary-class classifiers by decomposing
the multiclass problem to a serial binary-class problems. In this paper, we present a novel Weight
Optimization and Layered Clustering-based ECOC (WOLC-ECOC). WOLC-ECOC is a heuristic ternary
ECOC. It starts with an arbitrary valid ECOC ensemble and then iterates the following two steps until
the training risk converges. The first step is to train a new binary-class classifier that discriminates
the most confusing pair of classes by a novel Layered Clustering based ECOC (LC-ECOC) coding method.
The second step is to add the new classifier to the ECOC ensemble effectively by a novel Optimized
Weighted (OW) decoding algorithm. Technically, LC-ECOC can construct multiple different strong
classifiers on a single binary-class problem by employing a layered clustering-based approach,
so that the heuristic training process will not be blocked by some difficult binary-class problem.
The OW decoding guarantees the non-increase of the training risk after adding the new binary-class
classifier, so that the heuristic training process can be easily controlled via the training risk,
which enables WOLC-ECOC maintain a small code length. Moreover, the cutting plane algorithm is
employed to make the OW decoding available for large scale problems. The experimental comparison
with 15 ECOC coding-decoding methods on 14 UCI datasets and the application to the music genre classification
problem demonstrate the effectiveness of WOLC-ECOC.
