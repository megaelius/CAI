Restricted Boltzmann Machines trained with different numbers of iterations were used to provide
a diverse set of energy functions each containing many local valleys (LVs) with different energies,
widths, escape barrier heights, etc. They were used to verify the previously reported possibility
of using the D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) to find potentially important LVs in the energy functions
of Ising spin glasses that may be missed by classical searches. For classical search, extensive
simulated annealing (SA) was conducted to find as many LVs as possible regardless of the computational
cost. SA was conducted long enough to ensure that the number of SA-found LVs approaches that and eventually
significantly exceeds the number of the LVs found by a single call submitted to the D-Wave. Even after
a prohibitively long SA search, as many as 30-50% of the D-Wave-found LVs remained not found by the
SA. In order to establish if LVs found only by the D-Wave represent potentially important regions
of the configuration space, they were compared to those that were found by both techniques. While
the LVs found by the D-Wave but missed by SA predominantly had higher energies and lower escape barriers,
there was a significant fraction having intermediate values of the energy and barrier height. With
respect to most other important LV parameters, the LVs found only by the D-Wave were distributed
in a wide range of the parameters' values. It was established that for large or small, shallow or deep,
wide or narrow LVs, the LVs found only by the D-Wave are distinguished by a few-times smaller size
of the LV basin of attraction (BoA). Apparently, the size of the BoA is not or at least is less important
for QA search compared to the classical search, allowing QA to easily find many potentially important
(e.g., wide and deep) LVs missed by even prohibitively lengthy classical searches.
