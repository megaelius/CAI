Data stream poses additional challenges to statistical classification tasks because distributions
of the training and target samples may differ as time passes. Such distribution change in streaming
data is called concept drift. Numerous histogram-based distribution change detection methods
have been proposed to detect drift. Most histograms are developed on grid-based or tree-based space
partitioning algorithms which makes the space partitions arbitrary, unexplainable, and may cause
drift blind-spots. There is a need to improve the drift detection accuracy for histogram-based
methods with the unsupervised setting. To address this problem, we propose a cluster-based histogram,
called equal intensity k-means space partitioning (EI-kMeans). In addition, a heuristic method
to improve the sensitivity of drift detection is introduced. The fundamental idea of improving
the sensitivity is to minimize the risk of creating partitions in distribution offset regions.
Pearson's chi-square test is used as the statistical hypothesis test so that the test statistics
remain independent of the sample distribution. The number of bins and their shapes, which strongly
influence the ability to detect drift, are determined dynamically from the sample based on an asymptotic
constraint in the chi-square test. Accordingly, three algorithms are developed to implement concept
drift detection, including a greedy centroids initialization algorithm, a cluster amplify-shrink
algorithm, and a drift detection algorithm. For drift adaptation, we recommend retraining the
learner if a drift is detected. The results of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the advantages of EI-kMeans and show its efficacy in detecting concept drift.
