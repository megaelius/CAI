Walking and push recovery controllers for humanoid robots have advanced throughout the years while
unsolved gaps leading to undesirable behaviours still exist. Because previous studies are mainly
pure engineering methods, while the use of data-driven methods has made impressive achievements
in the field of control, we set motivation for exploration of control laws applied by human beings.
Successful findings may help fill the gaps in current engineering-based controllers and can potentially
improve the performance. In this thesis, we show our complete design and implementation of a set
of experiments to collect and process human data, as well as data analysis for model fitting. Using
the processed motion data and force data collected, we export the position, velocity and acceleration
of our participants' centres of mass to form a one-dimensional point mass model defined by the direction
of pushes. As a result, we find that proportional-derivative (PD) control can describe the underlying
control law that people used and different PD gains are set for different phases of a push recovery
trial within the scope of our study. Our final PD control fittings have an average root mean square
error below 0.1m with above 90% of a trial's data points are taken into account on average. We also
explore how different error metrics that the PD control model uses influence its performance but
neither of the two metrics we proposed can help improve the performance. Finally, we have statistics
on how people switch push recovery strategies based on their centre of mass properties at the start
of the push. We find that the further the centre of mass is from the steady-state point and the higher
the velocity it has, a person is more likely to make a step for push force compensation.
