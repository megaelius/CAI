The Meeting problem for $k\geq 2$ searchers in a polygon $P$ (possibly with holes) consists in making
the searchers move within $P$, according to a distributed algorithm, in such a way that at least two
of them eventually come to see each other, regardless of their initial positions. The polygon is
initially unknown to the searchers, and its edges obstruct both movement and vision. Depending
on the shape of $P$, we minimize the number of searchers $k$ for which the Meeting problem is solvable.
Specifically, if $P$ has a rotational symmetry of order $\sigma$ (where $\sigma=1$ corresponds
to no rotational symmetry), we prove that $k=\sigma+1$ searchers are sufficient, and the bound
is tight. Furthermore, we give an improved algorithm that optimally solves the Meeting problem
with $k=2$ searchers in all polygons whose barycenter is not in a hole (which includes the polygons
with no holes). Our algorithms can be implemented in a variety of standard models of mobile robots
operating in Look-Compute-Move cycles. For instance, if the searchers have memory but are anonymous,
asynchronous, and have no agreement on a coordinate system or a notion of clockwise direction, then
our algorithms work even if the initial memory contents of the searchers are arbitrary and possibly
misleading. Moreover, oblivious searchers can execute our algorithms as well, encoding information
by carefully positioning themselves within the polygon. This code is computable with basic arithmetic
operations, and each searcher can geometrically construct its own destination point at each cycle
using only a compass. We stress that such memoryless searchers may be located anywhere in the polygon
when the execution begins, and hence the information they initially encode is arbitrary. Our algorithms
use a self-stabilizing map construction subroutine which is of independent interest.
