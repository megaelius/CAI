Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become a favorable device in the Dermatology discipline
due to its moderate resolution and penetration depth. OCT images however contain a grainy pattern,
called speckle, due to the use of a broadband source in the configuration of OCT. So far, a variety
of filtering (de-speckling) techniques is introduced to reduce speckle in OCT images. Most of these
methods are generic and can be applied to OCT images of different tissues. The ambition of this work
is to provide a de-speckling framework specialized for filtering skin tissues for the community
to utilize, adapt or build upon. In this paper, we present an adaptive cluster-based filtering framework,
optimized for speckle reduction of OCT skin images. In this framework, by considering the layered
structure of skin, first the OCT skin images are segmented into differentiable layers utilizing
clustering algorithms, and then each cluster is de-speckled individually using adaptive filtering
techniques. In this study, hierarchical clustering algorithm and adaptive Wiener filtering technique
are utilized to develop the framework. The proposed method is tested on optical solid phantoms with
predetermined optical properties. The method is also tested on healthy human skin images. The results
show that the proposed cluster-based filtering method can effectively reduce the speckle and increase
the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast while preserving the edges in the image. The proposed cluster-based
filtering framework enables researchers to develop unsupervised learning solutions for de-speckling
OCT skin images using adaptive filtering methods, or extend the framework to new applications.
