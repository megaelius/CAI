How does the collaboration network of researchers coalesce around a scientific topic? What sort
of social restructuring occurs as a new field develops? Previous empirical explorations of these
questions have examined the evolution of co-authorship networks associated with several fields
of science, each noting a characteristic shift in network structure as fields develop. Historically,
however, such studies have tended to rely on manually annotated datasets and therefore only consider
a handful of disciplines, calling into question the universality of the observed structural signature.To
overcome this limitation and test the robustness of this phenomenon, we use a comprehensive dataset
of over 189,000 scientific articles and develop a framework for partitioning articles and their
authors into coherent, semantically-related groups representing scientific fields of varying
size and specificity. We then use the resulting population of fields to study the structure of evolving
co-authorship networks. Consistent with earlier findings, we observe a global topological transition
as the co-authorship networks coalesce from a disjointed aggregate into a dense giant connected
component that dominates the network. We validate these results using a separate, complimentary
corpus of scientific articles, and, overall, we find that the previously reported characteristic
structural evolution of a scientific field's associated co-authorship network is robust across
a large number of scientific fields of varying size, scope, and specificity. Additionally, the
framework developed in this study may be used in other scientometric contexts in order to extend
studies to compare across a larger range of scientific disciplines.
