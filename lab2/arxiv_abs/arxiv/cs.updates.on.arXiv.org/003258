While the Internet is often touted as a revolutionary technology, it might be noted that democratic
institutions have witnessed no digital revolution through the Internet. This observation leads
this chapter to argue that the field of e-democracy has generally failed to live up to its own reformist
rhetoric. It argues that instead of reforming government processes through technology, e-democracy
projects have tended to focus either on lowering the costs and increasing the efficiency of existing
political processes or on analysing the civic participation that occurs outside of purpose-built
e-democracy platforms. The chapter suggests that this lack of attention to the Internet's potential
for systemic change in formal political institutions has little normative impact on the democratization
of society and may even re-enforce, rather than challenge, the sociopolitical status quo. Further,
it suggests that the current approach of e-democracy risks normalizing the Internet to the norms
and expectations of the offline world. To elucidate this argument, this chapter overviews both
the general trend of e-democracy projects and criticisms of those projects. Finally, the chapter
proposes a more radical vision of e-democracy that, it suggests, would usher a larger potential
for democratization. This more radical vision of e-democracy consists of recognizing the attributes
of the Internet that transcend the limits of the analogue world and applying these to democracy.
Such an approach would open the path for envisaging new political processes and systems, allowing
the field of e-democracy to live up to its own rhetoric, and affording society the means to address
multiple of the centuries-old problems faced by democracy.
