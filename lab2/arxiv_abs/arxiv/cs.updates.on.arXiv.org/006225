Cryptography with quantum states exhibits a number of surprising and counterintuitive features.
In a 2002 work, Barnum et al. argued informally that these strange features should imply that digital
signatures for quantum states are impossible (Barnum et al., FOCS 2002). In this work, we perform
the first rigorous study of the problem of signing quantum states. We first show that the intuition
of Barnum et al. was correct, by proving an impossibility result which rules out even very weak forms
of signing quantum states. Essentially, we show that any non-trivial combination of correctness
and security requirements results in negligible security. This rules out all quantum signature
schemes except those which simply measure the state and then sign the outcome using a classical scheme.
In other words, only classical signature schemes exist. We then show a positive result: it is possible
to sign quantum states, provided that they are also encrypted with the public key of the intended
recipient. Following classical nomenclature, we call this notion quantum signcryption. Classically,
signcryption is only interesting if it provides superior efficiency to simultaneous encryption
and signing. Our results imply that, quantumly, it is far more interesting: by the laws of quantum
mechanics, it is the only signing method available. We develop security definitions for quantum
signcryption, ranging from a simple one-time two-user setting, to a chosen-ciphertext-secure
many-time multi-user setting. We also give secure constructions based on post-quantum public-key
primitives. Along the way, we show that a natural hybrid method of combining classical and quantum
schemes can be used to "upgrade" a secure classical scheme to the fully-quantum setting, in a wide
range of cryptographic settings including signcryption, authenticated encryption, and chosen-ciphertext
security.
