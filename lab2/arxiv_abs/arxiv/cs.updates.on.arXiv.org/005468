Covert communication is necessary when revealing the mere existence of a message leaks sensitive
information to an attacker. Consider a network link where an authorized transmitter Jack sends
packets to an authorized receiver Steve, and the packets visit Alice, Willie, and Bob, respectively,
before they reach Steve. Covert transmitter Alice wishes to alter the packet stream in some way to
send information to covert receiver Bob without watchful and capable adversary Willie being able
to detect the presence of the message. In our previous works, we addressed two techniques for such
covert transmission from Alice to Bob: packet insertion and packet timing. In this paper, we consider
covert communication via bit insertion in packets with available space (e.g., with size less than
the maximum transmission unit). We consider three scenarios: 1) packet sizes are independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a probability mass function (pmf) whose support is a set
of one bit spaced values; 2) packet sizes are i.i.d. with a pmf whose support is arbitrary; 3) packet
sizes may be dependent. For the first and second assumptions, we show that Alice can covertly insert
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ bits of information in a flow of $n$ packets; conversely, if she inserts
$\omega(\sqrt{n})$ bits of information, Willie can detect her with arbitrarily small error probability.
For the third assumption, we prove Alice can covertly insert on average $\mathcal{O}(c(n)/\sqrt{n})$
bits in a sequence of $n$ packets, where $c(n)$ is the average number of conditional pmf of packet
sizes given the history, with a support of at least size two.
