Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access,
and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media.
On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of "fake news", i.e., low quality news with intentionally
false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts
on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become
an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media
presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from
traditional news media ineffective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written
to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect
based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social
engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information
is challenging in and of itself as users' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big,
incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is
both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem.
In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including
fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data
mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related
research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social
media.
