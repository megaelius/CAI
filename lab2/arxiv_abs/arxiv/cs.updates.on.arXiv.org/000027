Internal routing inside an ISP network is the foundation for lots of services that generate revenue
from the ISP's customers. A fine-grained control of paths taken by network traffic once it enters
the ISP's network is therefore a crucial means to achieve a top-quality offer and, equally important,
to enforce SLAs. Many widespread network technologies and approaches (most notably, MPLS) offer
limited (e.g., with RSVP-TE), tricky (e.g., with OSPF metrics), or no control on internal routing
paths. On the other hand, recent advances in the research community are a good starting point to address
this shortcoming, but miss elements that would enable their applicability in an ISP's network.
We extend pathlet routing by introducing a new control plane for internal routing that has the following
qualities: it is designed to operate in the internal network of an ISP; it enables fine-grained management
of network paths with suitable configuration primitives; it is scalable because routing changes
are only propagated to the network portion that is affected by the changes; it supports independent
configuration of specific network portions without the need to know the configuration of the whole
network; it is robust thanks to the adoption of multipath routing; it supports the enforcement of
QoS levels; it is independent of the specific data plane used in the ISP's network; it can be incrementally
deployed and it can nicely coexist with other control planes. Besides formally introducing the
algorithms and messages of our control plane, we propose an experimental validation in the simulation
framework OMNeT++ that we use to assess the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.
