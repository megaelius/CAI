Websites are constantly adapting the methods used, and intensity with which they track online visitors.
However, the wide-range enforcement of GDPR since one year ago (May 2018) forced websites serving
EU-based online visitors to eliminate or at least reduce such tracking activity, given they receive
proper user consent. Therefore, it is important to record and analyze the evolution of this tracking
activity and assess the overall "privacy health" of the Web ecosystem and if it is better after GDPR
enforcement. This work makes a significant step towards this direction. In this paper, we analyze
the online ecosystem of 3rd-parties embedded in top websites which amass the majority of online
tracking through 6 time snapshots taken every few months apart, in the duration of the last 2 years.
We perform this analysis in three ways: 1) by looking into the network activity that 3rd-parties
impose on each publisher hosting them, 2) by constructing a bipartite graph of "publisher-to-tracker",
connecting 3rd parties with their publishers, 3) by constructing a "tracker-to-tracker" graph
connecting 3rd-parties who are commonly found in publishers. We record significant changes through
time in number of trackers, traffic induced in publishers (incoming vs. outgoing), embeddedness
of trackers in publishers, popularity and mixture of trackers across publishers. We also report
how such measures compare with the ranking of publishers based on Alexa. On the last level of our analysis,
we dig deeper and look into the connectivity of trackers with each other and how this relates to potential
cookie synchronization activity.
