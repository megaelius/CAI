Recall the classical hypothesis testing setting with two convex sets of probability distributions
P and Q. One receives either n i.i.d. samples from a distribution p in P or from a distribution q in Q
and wants to decide from which set the points were sampled. It is known that the optimal exponential
rate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood ratio test which does
not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q. We consider an adaptive generalization of this model
where the choice of p in P and q in Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on
the previous samples. In other words, in the k'th round, an adversary, having observed all the previous
samples in rounds 1,...,k-1, chooses p_k in P and q_k in Q, with the goal of confusing the hypothesis
test. We prove that even in this case, the optimal exponential error rate can be achieved by a simple
maximum-likelihood test that depends only on P and Q. We then show that the adversarial model has
applications in hypothesis testing for quantum states using restricted measurements. For example,
it can be used to study the problem of distinguishing entangled states from the set of all separable
states using only measurements that can be implemented with local operations and classical communication
(LOCC). The basic idea is that in our setup, the deleterious effects of entanglement can be simulated
by an adaptive classical adversary. We prove a quantum Stein's Lemma in this setting: In many circumstances,
the optimal hypothesis testing rate is equal to an appropriate notion of quantum relative entropy
between two states. In particular, our arguments yield an alternate proof of Li and Winter's recent
strengthening of strong subadditivity for quantum relative entropy.
