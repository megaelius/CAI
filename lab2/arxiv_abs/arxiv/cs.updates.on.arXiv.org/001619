In this paper, the problem of energy trading between smart grid prosumers, who can simultaneously
consume and produce energy, and a grid power company is studied. The problem is formulated as a single-leader,
multiple-follower Stackelberg game between the power company and multiple prosumers. In this
game, the power company acts as a leader who determines the pricing strategy that maximizes its profits,
while the prosumers act as followers who react by choosing the amount of energy to buy or sell so as
to optimize their current and future profits. The proposed game accounts for each prosumer's subjective
decision when faced with the uncertainty of profits, induced by the random future price. In particular,
the framing effect, from the framework of prospect theory (PT), is used to account for each prosumer's
valuation of its gains and losses with respect to an individual utility reference point. The reference
point changes between prosumers and stems from their past experience and future aspirations of
profits. The followers' noncooperative game is shown to admit a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium
(NE) under classical game theory (CGT) which is obtained using a fully distributed algorithm. The
results are extended to account for the case of PT using algorithmic solutions that can achieve an
NE under certain conditions. Simulation results show that the total grid load varies significantly
with the prosumers' reference point and their loss-aversion level. In addition, it is shown that
the power company's profits considerably decrease when it fails to account for the prosumers' subjective
perceptions under PT.
