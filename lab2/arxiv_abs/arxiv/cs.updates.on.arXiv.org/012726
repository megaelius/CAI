This paper presents a new approach to a robust Gaussian process (GP) regression. Most existing approaches
replace an outlier-prone Gaussian likelihood with a non-Gaussian likelihood induced from a heavy
tail distribution, such as the Laplace distribution and Student-t distribution. However, the
use of a non-Gaussian likelihood would incur the need for a computationally expensive Bayesian
approximate computation in the posterior inferences. The proposed approach models an outlier
as a noisy and biased observation of an unknown regression function, and accordingly, the likelihood
contains bias terms to explain the degree of deviations from the regression function. We entail
how the biases can be estimated accurately with other hyperparameters by a regularized maximum
likelihood estimation. Conditioned on the bias estimates, the robust GP regression can be reduced
to a standard GP regression problem with analytical forms of the predictive mean and variance estimates.
Therefore, the proposed approach is simple and very computationally attractive. It also gives
a very robust and accurate GP estimate for many tested scenarios. For the numerical evaluation,
we perform a comprehensive simulation study to evaluate the proposed approach with the comparison
to the existing robust GP approaches under various simulated scenarios of different outlier proportions
and different noise levels. The approach is applied to data from two measurement systems, where
the predictors are based on robust environmental parameter measurements and the response variables
utilize more complex chemical sensing methods that contain a certain percentage of outliers. The
utility of the measurement systems and value of the environmental data are improved through the
computationally efficient GP regression and bias model.
