The revolutionary trend of the up-to-date medicine can be formulated as wide introduction into
basic medicine fields of electronic (e-health) and mobile (m-health) healthcare services and
information applications. Unfortunately, all list of qualified m/e-healthcare services can
be provided cost-effectively only in urban areas very good covered by broadband 4G/5G wireless
communications. Unacceptably high investments are required into deployment of the optic core
infrastructure for ubiquitous wide covering of sparsely populated rural, remote, and difficult
for access (RRD) areas using the recent (4G) and forthcoming (5G) broadband radio access (RAN) centralized
techniques, characterized by short cells ranges, because their profitability boundary exceeds
several hundred residents per square km. Furthermore, the unprecedented requirements and new
features of the forthcoming Internet of Things (IoT), machine-to-machine (M2M), and many other
machine type IT-systems lead to a breakthrough in designing extremely green, flexible, and cost-effective
technologies for future 5G wireless systems which will be able to reach in real time the performance
extremums, trade-off optimums and fundamental limits. This paper examines the 5G PHY-MAC fundamentals
and extremely approaches to creation of the profitable ubiquitous remote e/m-health services
and telemedicine as the main innovation technology of popular healthcare and other social e-Applications
for RRD territories. Proposed approaches lean on summarizing and develop the results of our previous
works on RRD-adapted profitable ubiquitous green 4G/5G wireless multifunctional technologies.
