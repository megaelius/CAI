Analyzing job hopping behavior is important for the understanding of job preference and career
progression of working individuals. When analyzed at the workforce population level, job hop analysis
helps to gain insights of talent flow among different jobs and organizations. Traditionally, surveys
are conducted on job seekers and employers to study job hop behavior. Beyond surveys, job hop behavior
can also be studied in a highly scalable and timely manner using a data driven approach in response
to fast-changing job landscape. Fortunately, the advent of online professional networks (OPNs)
has made it possible to perform a large-scale analysis of talent flow. In this paper, we present a
new data analytics framework to analyze the talent flow patterns of close to 1 million working professionals
from three different countries/regions using their publicly-accessible profiles in an established
OPN. As OPN data are originally generated for professional networking applications, our proposed
framework re-purposes the same data for a different analytics task. Prior to performing job hop
analysis, we devise a job title normalization procedure to mitigate the amount of noise in the OPN
data. We then devise several metrics to measure the amount of work experience required to take up
a job, to determine that existence duration of the job (also known as the job age), and the correlation
between the above metric and propensity of hopping. We also study how job hop behavior is related
to job promotion/demotion. Lastly, we perform connectivity analysis at job and organization levels
to derive insights on talent flow as well as job and organizational competitiveness.
