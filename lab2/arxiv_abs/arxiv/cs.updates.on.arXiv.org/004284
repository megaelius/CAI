The exponential increase in the usage of Wikipedia as a key source of scientific knowledge among
the researchers is making it absolutely necessary to metamorphose this knowledge repository into
an integral and self-contained source of information for direct utilization. Unfortunately,
the references which support the content of each Wikipedia entity page, are far from complete. Why
are the reference section ill-formed for most Wikipedia pages? Is this section edited as frequently
as the other sections of a page? Can there be appropriate surrogates that can automatically enhance
the reference section? In this paper, we propose a novel two step approach -- WikiRef -- that (i) leverages
the wikilinks present in a scientific Wikipedia target page and, thereby, (ii) recommends highly
relevant references to be included in that target page appropriately and automatically borrowed
from the reference section of the wikilinks. In the first step, we build a classifier to ascertain
whether a wikilink is a potential source of reference or not. In the following step, we recommend
references to the target page from the reference section of the wikilinks that are classified as
potential sources of references in the first step. We perform an extensive evaluation of our approach
on datasets from two different domains -- Computer Science and Physics. For Computer Science we
achieve a notably good performance with a precision@1 of 0.44 for reference recommendation as opposed
to 0.38 obtained from the most competitive baseline. For the Physics dataset, we obtain a similar
performance boost of 10% with respect to the most competitive baseline.
