With the advent of ISO 26262 there is an increased emphasis on top-down design in the automotive industry.
ISO 26262 lacks detailed requirements for its various constituent phases. The lack of guidance
becomes evident for the reuse of legacy components and subsystems, leaving vehicle architects
and safety engineers to rely on experience without methodological support for their decisions.
This poses challenges in the industry which is undergoing many significant changes due to new features
like connectivity, electrification and automation. Here we focus on automated driving where multiple
subsystems, both new and legacy, need to coordinate to realize a safety-critical function. This
paper introduces a method to support consistent design of an ISO 26262 work product, the Functional
Safety Concept (FSC). The method addresses a need within the industry for architectural analysis,
rationale management and reuse of legacy subsystems. The method makes use of an existing work product,
the diagnostic specifications of a subsystem, to assist in performing a systematic assessment
of the influence a human driver, in the design of the subsystem. The output of the method is a report
with an abstraction level suitable for a vehicle architect, used as a basis for decisions related
to the FSC such as generating a Preliminary Architecture (PA) and building up argumentation for
verification of the FSC. The proposed method is tested in a safety-critical braking subsystem at
one of the largest heavy vehicle manufacturers in Sweden, Scania C.V. AB. The results demonstrate
the benefits of the method including (i) reuse of pre-existing work products, (ii) gathering requirements
for automated driving functions while designing the PA and FSC, (iii) the parallelization of work
across the organization on the basis of expertise, and (iv) the applicability of the method across
all types of subsystems.
