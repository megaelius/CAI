Strain localization and resulting plasticity and failure play an important role in the evolution
of the lithosphere. These phenomena are commonly modeled by Stokes flows with viscoplastic rheologies.
The nonlinearities of these rheologies make the numerical solution of the resulting systems challenging,
and iterative methods often converge slowly or not at all. Yet accurate solutions are critical for
representing the physics. Moreover, for some rheology laws, aspects of solvability are still unknown.
We study a basic but representative viscoplastic rheology law. The law involves a yield stress that
is independent of the dynamic pressure, referred to as von Mises yield criterion. Two commonly used
variants, perfect/ideal and composite viscoplasticity, are compared. We derive both variants
from energy minimization principles, and we use this perspective to argue when solutions are unique.
We propose a new stress-velocity Newton solution algorithm that treats the stress as an independent
variable during the Newton linearization but requires solution only of Stokes systems that are
of the usual velocity-pressure form. To study different solution algorithms, we implement 2D and
3D finite element discretizations, and we generate Stokes problems with up to 7 orders of magnitude
viscosity contrasts, in which compression or tension results in significant nonlinear localization
effects. Comparing the performance of the proposed Newton method with the standard Newton method
and the Picard fixed-point method, we observe a significant reduction in the number of iterations
and improved stability with respect to problem nonlinearity, mesh refinement, and the polynomial
order of the discretization.
