Observational transport relates to transferring a statistical relation $\mathcal{R}(P)$ from
environment ($\pi$) characterized by probability distribution $P$ and causal diagram $G$ to another
environment ($\pi^*$) characterized by $P^*$, $G^*$. In doing so it is expected that the causal
mechanism is known a priori and the relation to be transferred is learned from both the source environment
consisting of variables $V$ and the target environment comprised of variables $V^*$. The causal
diagram helps to identify what part of the statistical relation $\mathcal{R}(P)$ (invariant information)
is transportable from the source environment ($\pi$) while also identifying the target environment
($\pi^*$) specific relation $\mathcal{R}(P^*)$ which is learned empirically from the available
data. While domain adaptation is a common technique to learn the invariant information across the
entire population (dataset), in health care/consumer transactions there is invariant information
based on population subgroups. A further issue is that all subgroups are not equally represented
across the different environments resulting into selection bias. We posit that we can combine the
environment and population invariant information in a novel multi-component population-aware
hierarchical domain adaptation Bayesian framework in the presence of the selection bias. We also
study the conditions under which invariant learning fails; leading to reliance on the environment-specific
attributes. Experimental results on real-world data for influenza prediction show the model can
improve prediction in the case of largely unlabelled target data by harnessing both domain and population
invariant information, with implications for human-generated data, fair algorithms and human
well-being.
