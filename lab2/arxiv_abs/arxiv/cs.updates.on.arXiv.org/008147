Compositions of tree-walking tree transducers form a hierarchy with respect to the number of transducers
in the composition. As main technical result it is proved that any such composition can be realized
as a linear bounded composition, which means that the sizes of the intermediate results can be chosen
to be at most linear in the size of the output tree. This has consequences for the expressiveness and
complexity of the translations in the hierarchy. First, if the computed translation is a function
of linear size increase, i.e., the size of the output tree is at most linear in the size of the input
tree, then it can be realized by just one, deterministic, tree-walking tree transducer. For compositions
of deterministic transducers it is decidable whether or not the translation is of linear size increase.
Second, every composition of deterministic transducers can be computed in deterministic linear
time on a RAM and in deterministic linear space on a Turing machine, measured in the sum of the sizes
of the input and output tree. Similarly, every composition of nondeterministic transducers can
be computed in simultaneous polynomial time and linear space on a nondeterministic Turing machine.
Their output tree languages are deterministic context-sensitive, i.e., can be recognized in deterministic
linear space on a Turing machine. The membership problem for compositions of nondeterministic
translations is nondeterministic polynomial time and deterministic linear space. The membership
problem for the composition of a nondeterministic and a deterministic tree-walking tree translation
(for a nondeterministic IO macro tree translation) is log-space reducible to a context-free language,
whereas the membership problem for the composition of a deterministic and a nondeterministic tree-walking
tree translation (for a nondeterministic OI macro tree translation) is possibly NP-complete.
