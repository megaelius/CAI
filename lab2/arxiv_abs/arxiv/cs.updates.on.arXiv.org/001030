GPTIPS is a free, open source MATLAB based software platform for symbolic data mining (SDM). It uses
a multigene variant of the biologically inspired machine learning method of genetic programming
(MGGP) as the engine that drives the automatic model discovery process. Symbolic data mining is
the process of extracting hidden, meaningful relationships from data in the form of symbolic equations.
In contrast to other data-mining methods, the structural transparency of the generated predictive
equations can give new insights into the physical systems or processes that generated the data.
Furthermore, this transparency makes the models very easy to deploy outside of MATLAB. The rationale
behind GPTIPS is to reduce the technical barriers to using, understanding, visualising and deploying
GP based symbolic models of data, whilst at the same time remaining highly customisable and delivering
robust numerical performance for power users. In this chapter, notable new features of the latest
version of the software are discussed with these aims in mind. Additionally, a simplified variant
of the MGGP high level gene crossover mechanism is proposed. It is demonstrated that the new functionality
of GPTIPS 2 (a) facilitates the discovery of compact symbolic relationships from data using multiple
approaches, e.g. using novel gene-centric visualisation analysis to mitigate horizontal bloat
and reduce complexity in multigene symbolic regression models (b) provides numerous methods for
visualising the properties of symbolic models (c) emphasises the generation of graphically navigable
libraries of models that are optimal in terms of the Pareto trade off surface of model performance
and complexity and (d) expedites real world applications by the simple, rapid and robust deployment
of symbolic models outside the software environment they were developed in.
