This paper presents an agent-based model of population desegregation and provides a thorough analysis
of the social behavior leading to it, namely, the contact hypothesis. Based on the parameters of
frequency and intensity of influence of group leaders on the population, the proposed model is constituted
by two layers: 1) a physical layer of the population that is influenced by and 2) a virtual layer of
group leaders. The model of negotiation and survival of group leaders are governed by the nature-inspired
evolutionary process of queen ants, also known as Foundress Dilemma. The motivation of using a virtual
grouping concept (instead of taking a subset of population as the group leaders) is to stay focused
on finding the conditions leading individuals in a society tolerating a significantly diversified
(desegregated) neighborhood, rather than, indulging into complex details, which would be more
relevant to studies targeting the evolution of societal group and leaders. A geographic information
system-driven simulation is performed, which reveals that: 1) desegregation is directly proportional
to the frequency of group leaders' contact with the population and 2) mostly, it remains ineffective
with an increase in the intensity of group leaders' contact with the population. The mechanism of
group selection (the conflict resolution model resolving the Foundress Dilemma) reveals an exciting
result concerning negative influence of cooperative group leaders. Most of the time, desegregation
decreases with increase in cooperative leaders (the leaders enforcing desegregation) when compared
with fierce leaders (the leaders enforcing segregation).
