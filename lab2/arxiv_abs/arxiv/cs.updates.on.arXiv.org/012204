Prediction of future movement of stock prices has been a subject matter of many research work. There
is a gamut of literature of technical analysis of stock prices where the objective is to identify
patterns in stock price movements and derive profit from it. Improving the prediction accuracy
remains the single most challenge in this area of research. We propose a hybrid approach for stock
price movement prediction using machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.
We select the NIFTY 50 index values of the National Stock Exchange of India, and collect its daily
price movement over a period of three years (2015 to 2017). Based on the data of 2015 to 2017, we build
various predictive models using machine learning, and then use those models to predict the closing
value of NIFTY 50 for the period January 2018 till June 2019 with a prediction horizon of one week.
For predicting the price movement patterns, we use a number of classification techniques, while
for predicting the actual closing price of the stock, various regression models have been used.
We also build a Long and Short-Term Memory - based deep learning network for predicting the closing
price of the stocks and compare the prediction accuracies of the machine learning models with the
LSTM model. We further augment the predictive model by integrating a sentiment analysis module
on twitter data to correlate the public sentiment of stock prices with the market sentiment. This
has been done using twitter sentiment and previous week closing values to predict stock price movement
for the next week. We tested our proposed scheme using a cross validation method based on Self Organizing
Fuzzy Neural Networks and found extremely interesting results.
