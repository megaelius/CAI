Various 3D reconstruction methods have enabled civil engineers to detect damage on a road surface.
To achieve the millimetre accuracy required for road condition assessment, a disparity map with
subpixel resolution needs to be used. However, none of the existing stereo matching algorithms
are specially suitable for the reconstruction of the road surface. Hence in this paper, we propose
a novel dense subpixel disparity estimation algorithm with high computational efficiency and
robustness. This is achieved by first transforming the perspective view of the target frame into
the reference view, which not only increases the accuracy of the block matching for the road surface
but also improves the processing speed. The disparities are then estimated iteratively using our
previously published algorithm where the search range is propagated from three estimated neighbouring
disparities. Since the search range is obtained from the previous iteration, errors may occur when
the propagated search range is not sufficient. Therefore, a correlation maxima verification is
performed to rectify this issue, and the subpixel resolution is achieved by conducting a parabola
interpolation enhancement. Furthermore, a novel disparity global refinement approach developed
from the Markov Random Fields and Fast Bilateral Stereo is introduced to further improve the accuracy
of the estimated disparity map, where disparities are updated iteratively by minimising the energy
function that is related to their interpolated correlation polynomials. The algorithm is implemented
in C language with a near real-time performance. The experimental results illustrate that the absolute
error of the reconstruction varies from 0.1 mm to 3 mm.
