Conventionally, pairwise relationships between nodes are considered to be the fundamental building
blocks of complex networks. However, over the last decade the overabundance of certain sub-network
patterns, so called motifs, has attracted high attention. It has been hypothesized, these motifs,
instead of links, serve as the building blocks of network structures. Although the relation between
a network's topology and the general properties of the system, such as its function, its robustness
against perturbations, or its efficiency in spreading information is the central theme of network
science, there is still a lack of sound generative models needed for testing the functional role
of subgraph motifs. Our work aims to overcome this limitation. We employ the framework of exponential
random graphs (ERGMs) to define novel models based on triadic substructures. The fact that only
a small portion of triads can actually be set independently poses a challenge for the formulation
of such models. To overcome this obstacle we use Steiner Triple Systems (STS). These are partitions
of sets of nodes into pair-disjoint triads, which thus can be specified independently. Combining
the concepts of ERGMs and STS, we suggest novel generative models capable of generating ensembles
of networks with non-trivial triadic Z-score profiles. Further, we discover inevitable correlations
between the abundance of triad patterns, which occur solely for statistical reasons and need to
be taken into account when discussing the functional implications of motif statistics. Moreover,
we calculate the degree distributions of our triadic random graphs analytically.
