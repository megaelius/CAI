Degrees of freedom (DoF) gains are studied in wireless networks with cooperative transmission
under a backhaul load constraint that limits the average number of messages that can be delivered
from a centralized controller to base station transmitters. The backhaul load is defined as the
sum of all the messages available at all the transmitters per channel use, normalized by the number
of users. For Wyner's linear interference network, where each transmitter is connected to the receiver
having the same index as well as one succeeding receiver, the per user DoF is characterized and the
optimal scheme is presented. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimal assignment of messages to
transmitters is asymmetric and satisfies a local cooperation constraint, and that the optimal
coding scheme relies only on one-shot cooperative zero-forcing transmit beamforming. Using insights
from the analysis of Wyner's linear interference network, the results are extended to the more practical
hexagonal sectored cellular network, and coding schemes based on cooperative zero-forcing are
shown to deliver significant DoF gains. It is established that by allowing for cooperative transmission
and a flexible message assignment that is constrained only by an average backhaul load, one can deliver
the rate gains promised by information-theoretic upper bounds with practical one-shot schemes
that incur little or no additional load on the backhaul. Finally, useful upper bounds on the per user
DoF for schemes based on cooperative zero-forcing are presented for lower values of the average
backhaul load constraint, and an optimization framework is formulated for the general converse
problem.
