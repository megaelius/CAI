Pattern formation is a widely observed phenomenon in diverse fields including materials physics,
developmental biology and ecology among many others. The physics underlying the patterns is specific
to the mechanisms, and is encoded by partial differential equations (PDEs). With the aim of discovering
hidden physics, we have previously presented a variational approach to identifying such systems
of PDEs in the face of noisy data at varying fidelities (Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
Engineering, 353:201-216, 2019). Here, we extend our methods to address the challenges presented
by image data on microstructures in materials physics. PDEs are formally posed as initial and boundary
value problems over combinations of time intervals and spatial domains whose evolution is either
fixed or can be tracked. However, the vast majority of microscopy techniques for evolving microstructure
in a given material system deliver micrographs of pattern evolution wherein the domain at one instant
does not spatially overlap with that at another time. The temporal resolution can rarely capture
the fastest time scales that dominate the early dynamics, and noise abounds. Finally data for evolution
of the same phenomenon in a material system may well be obtained from different physical samples.
Against this backdrop of spatially non-overlapping, sparse and multi-source data, we exploit
the variational framework to make judicious choices of moments of fields and identify PDE operators
from the dynamics. This step is preceded by an imposition of consistency to parsimoniously infer
a minimal set of the spatial operators at steady state. The framework is demonstrated on synthetic
data that reflects the characteristics of the experimental material microscopy images.
