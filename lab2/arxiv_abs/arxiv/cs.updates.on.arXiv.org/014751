We show that many natural two-dimensional packing problems are algorithmically equivalent to
finding real roots of multivariate polynomials. A two-dimensional packing problem is defined
by the type of pieces, containers, and motions that are allowed. The aim is to decide if a given set
of pieces can be placed inside a given container. The pieces must be placed so that they are pairwise
interior-disjoint, and only motions of the allowed type can be used to move them there. We establish
a framework which enables us to show that for many combinations of allowed pieces, containers, and
motions, the resulting problem is $\exists\mathbb R$-complete. This means that the problem is
equivalent (under polynomial time reductions) to deciding whether a given system of polynomial
equations and inequalities with integer coefficients has a real solution. We consider packing
problems where only translations are allowed as the motions, and problems where arbitrary rigid
motions are allowed, i.e., both translations and rotations. When rotations are allowed, we show
that the following combinations of allowed pieces and containers are $\exists\mathbb R$-complete:
$\bullet$ simple polygons, each of which has at most 8 corners, into a square, $\bullet$ convex objects
bounded by line segments and hyperbolic curves into a square, $\bullet$ convex polygons into a container
bounded by line segments and hyperbolic curves. Restricted to translations, we show that the following
combinations are $\exists\mathbb R$-complete: $\bullet$ objects bounded by segments and hyperbolic
curves into a square, $\bullet$ convex polygons into a container bounded by segments and hyperbolic
curves.
