The growing complexity of modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the frequent communication
between their components make them vulnerable to malicious attacks. As a result, secure state estimation
is a critical requirement for the control of these systems. Many existing secure state estimation
methods suffer from combinatorial complexity which grows with the number of states and sensors
in the system. This complexity can be mitigated using optimization-based methods that relax the
original state estimation problem, although at the cost of optimality as these methods often identify
attack-free sensors as attacked. In this paper, we propose a new optimal graph-search algorithm
to correctly identify malicious attacks and to securely estimate the states even in large-scale
CPS modeled as linear time-invariant systems. The graph consists of layers, each one containing
two nodes capturing a truth assignment of any given sensor, and directed edges connecting adjacent
layers only. Then, our algorithm searches the layers of this graph incrementally, favoring directions
at higher layers with more attack-free assignments, while actively managing a repository of nodes
to be expanded at later iterations. The proposed search bias and the ability to revisit nodes in the
repository and self-correct, allow our graph-search algorithm to reach the optimal assignment
faster and tackle larger problems. We show that our algorithm is complete and optimal provided that
process and measurement noises do not dominate the attack signal. Moreover, we provide numerical
simulations that demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to correctly identify attacked sensors
and securely reconstruct the state. Our simulations show that our method outperforms existing
algorithms both in terms of optimality and execution time.
