Sharing perceptual data with other vehicles enhances the traffic safety of autonomous vehicles
because it helps vehicles locate other vehicles and pedestrians in their blind spots. Such safety
applications require high throughput and short delay, which cannot be achieved by conventional
microwave vehicular communication systems. Therefore, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications
are considered to be a key technology for sharing perceptual data because of their wide bandwidth.
One of the challenges of data sharing in mmWave communications is broadcasting because narrow-beam
directional antennas are used to obtain high gain. Because many vehicles should share their perceptual
data to others within a short time frame in order to enlarge the areas that can be perceived based on
shared perceptual data, an efficient scheduling for concurrent transmission that improves spatial
reuse is required for perceptual data sharing. This paper proposes a data sharing algorithm that
employs a graph-based concurrent transmission scheduling. The proposed algorithm realizes concurrent
transmission to improve spatial reuse by designing a rule that is utilized to determine if the two
pairs of transmitters and receivers interfere with each other by considering the radio propagation
characteristics of narrow-beam antennas. A prioritization method that considers the geographical
information in perceptual data is also designed to enlarge perceivable areas in situations where
data sharing time is limited and not all data can be shared. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm doubles the area of the cooperatively perceivable region compared with
a conventional algorithm that does not consider mmWave communications because the proposed algorithm
achieves high-throughput transmission by improving spatial reuse. The prioritization also enlarges
the perceivable region by a maximum of 20%.
