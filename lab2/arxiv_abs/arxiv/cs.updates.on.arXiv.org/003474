Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is an internetworking paradigm that offers an alternative to
today's IP-based Internet Architecture. Instead of focusing on hosts and their locations, CCN
emphasizes addressable named content. By decoupling content from its location, CCN allows opportunistic
in-network content caching, thus enabling better network utilization, at least for scalable content
distribution. However, in order to be considered seriously, CCN must support basic security services,
including content authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, authorization and access control.
Current approaches rely on content producers to perform authorization and access control. This
general approach has several disadvantages. First, consumer privacy vis-a-vis producers is not
preserved. Second, identity management and access control impose high computational overhead
on producers. Also, unnecessary repeated authentication and access control decisions must be
made for each content request. These issues motivate our design of KRB-CCN - a complete authorization
and access control system for private CCNs. Inspired by Kerberos in IP-based networks, KRB-CCN
involves distinct authentication and authorization authorities. By doing so, KRB-CCN obviates
the need for producers to make consumer authentication and access control decisions. KRB-CCN preserves
consumer privacy since producers are unaware of consumer identities. Producers are also not required
to keep any hard state and only need to perform two symmetric key operations to guarantee that sensitive
content is confidentially delivered only to authenticated and authorized consumers. Most importantly,
unlike prior designs, KRB-CCN leaves the network (i.e., CCN routers) out of any authorization,
access control or confidentiality issues. We describe KRB-CCN design and implementation, analyze
its security, and report on its performance.
