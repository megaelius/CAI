In this paper, the problem of minimizing energy and time consumption for task computation and transmission
is studied in a mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled balloon network. In the considered network,
each user needs to process a computational task in each time instant, where high-altitude balloons
(HABs), acting as flying wireless base stations, can use their powerful computational abilities
to process the tasks offloaded from their associated users. Since the data size of each user's computational
task varies over time, the HABs must dynamically adjust the user association, service sequence,
and task partition scheme to meet the users' needs. This problem is posed as an optimization problem
whose goal is to minimize the energy and time consumption for task computing and transmission by
adjusting the user association, service sequence, and task allocation scheme. To solve this problem,
a support vector machine (SVM)-based federated learning (FL) algorithm is proposed to determine
the user association proactively. The proposed SVM-based FL method enables each HAB to cooperatively
build an SVM model that can determine all user associations without any transmissions of either
user historical associations or computational tasks to other HABs. Given the prediction of the
optimal user association, the service sequence and task allocation of each user can be optimized
so as to minimize the weighted sum of the energy and time consumption. Simulations with real data
of city cellular traffic from the OMNILab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University show that the proposed
algorithm can reduce the weighted sum of the energy and time consumption of all users by up to 16.1%
compared to a conventional centralized method.
