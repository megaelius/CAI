For space-based laser communications, when the mean photon number per received optical pulse is
much smaller than one, there is a large gap between communications capacity---measured in bits
communicated per pulse---achievable with a receiver that detects (converts from optical to electrical
domain) each modulated pulse one at a time, versus with the quantum-optimal joint-detection receiver
that acts on a long codeword comprised of $n$ modulated pulses; an effect often termed superadditive
capacity. The action of this receiver cannot be described as the detection of each individual pulse,
interspersed with classical feedforward and soft-information post-processing. In this paper,
we consider the simplest scenario where a large superadditive capacity is known: a pure-loss channel
with a coherent-state binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) modulation. The two BPSK states can be mapped
conceptually to two non-orthogonal states of a single qubit, described by an inner product that
is a function of the mean photon number of each BPSK pulse. Using this map, we derive an explicit construction
of the quantum circuit of a joint-detection receiver based on a recent idea of belief-propagation
with quantum messages (BPQM) [arXiv:1607.04833]. We analyze this scheme rigorously and show that
it achieves the quantum limit of minimum average error probability in discriminating $8$ (BPSK)
codewords of a length-$5$ binary linear code with a tree factor graph. We quantify its performance
improvement over the (Dolinar) receiver that optimally detects one pulse at a time. Our result suggests
that a BPQM-receiver might attain the Holevo capacity, the quantum limit of classical communication
capacity, of this BPSK-modulated pure-loss channel. This suggests a new application for a small,
special-purpose, photonic quantum computer capable of so-called cat-basis universal qubit logic.
