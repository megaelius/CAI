Unsupervised lesion detection is a challenging problem that requires accurately estimating normative
distributions of healthy anatomy and detecting lesions as outliers without training examples.
Recently, this problem has received increased attention from the research community following
the advances in unsupervised learning with deep learning. Such advances allow the estimation of
high-dimensional distributions, such as normative distributions, with higher accuracy than
previous methods.The main approach of the recently proposed methods is to learn a latent-variable
model parameterized with networks to approximate the normative distribution using example images
showing healthy anatomy, perform prior-projection, i.e. reconstruct the image with lesions using
the latent-variable model, and determine lesions based on the differences between the reconstructed
and original images. While being promising, the prior-projection step often leads to a large number
of false positives. In this work, we approach unsupervised lesion detection as an image restoration
problem and propose a probabilistic model that uses a network-based prior as the normative distribution
and detect lesions pixel-wise using MAP estimation. The probabilistic model punishes large deviations
between restored and original images, reducing false positives in pixel-wise detections. Experiments
with gliomas and stroke lesions in brain MRI using publicly available datasets show that the proposed
approach outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a substantial margin, +0.13
(AUC), for both glioma and stroke detection. Extensive model analysis confirms the effectiveness
of MAP-based image restoration.
