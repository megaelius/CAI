An adversary looking to disrupt a power grid may look to target certain substations and sources of
power generation to initiate a cascading failure that maximizes the number of customers without
electricity. This is particularly an important concern when the enemy has the capability to launch
cyber-attacks as practical concerns (i.e. avoiding disruption of service, presence of legacy
systems, etc.) may hinder security. Hence, a defender can harden the security posture at certain
power stations but may lack the time and resources to do this for the entire power grid. We model a power
grid as a graph and introduce the cascading failure game in which both the defender and attacker choose
a subset of power stations such as to minimize (maximize) the number of consumers having access to
producers of power. We formalize problems for identifying both mixed and deterministic strategies
for both players, prove complexity results under a variety of different scenarios, identify tractable
cases, and develop algorithms for these problems. We also perform an experimental evaluation of
the model and game on a real-world power grid network. Empirically, we noted that the game favors
the attacker as he benefits more from increased resources than the defender. Further, the minimax
defense produces roughly the same expected payoff as an easy-to-compute deterministic load based
(DLB) defense when played against a minimax attack strategy. However, DLB performs more poorly
than minimax defense when faced with the attacker's best response to DLB. This is likely due to the
presence of low-load yet high-payoff nodes, which we also found in our empirical analysis.
