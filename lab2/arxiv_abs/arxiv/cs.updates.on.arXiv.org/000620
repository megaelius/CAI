Motion planning has been studied for nearly four decades now. Complete, combinatorial motion planning
approaches are theoretically well-rooted with completeness guarantees but they are hard to implement.
Sampling-based and heuristic methods are easy-to-implement and quite simple to customize but
they lack completeness guarantees. Can the best of both worlds be ever achieved, particularly for
mission-critical applications such as robotic surgery, space explorations, and handling hazardous
material? In this paper, we answer affirmatively to that question. We present a new methodology,
NuRA, to numerically approximate the roadmap (a network of one-dimensional algebraic curves)
that is computed in the complete motion planning algorithms, namely the Canny's algorithm. Our
algorithm encloses the roadmap with a chain of tiny boxes each of which contains a piece of the roadmap
and whose connectivity captures the roadmap connectivity. Our algorithm starts by enclosing the
entire space with a box. In each iteration, remaining boxes are shrunk on all sides and then split
into smaller sized boxes. Those boxes that are empty are detected in the shrink phase and removed.
The algorithm terminates when all remaining boxes are smaller than an input size. Shrink operation
is cast as a polynomial optimization with semialgebraic constraints, which is in turn transformed
into a (series of) semidefinite programs (SDP) using the Lasserre's approach. NuRA's success is
due to fast SDP solvers. To confirm the effectiveness of NuRA, the three-leaf clover planar curve
and torus roadmap were computed. In both cases, NuRA completely captured the connectivity. Since
boxes are independent from one another, NuRA can be parallelized particularly on GPUs.
