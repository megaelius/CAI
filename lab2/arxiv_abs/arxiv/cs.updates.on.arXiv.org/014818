Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has abruptly and undoubtedly changed the world as we know
it at the end of the 2nd decade of the 21st century. COVID-19 is extremely contagious and quickly spreading
globally making its early diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables
health care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten
the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test, however, requires specific equipment
and has relatively low sensitivity. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other
hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung infections
makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent
surge of interest to develop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based
on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases.
CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and require large
datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred
to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance
due to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images show
that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models. COVID-CAPS achieved an Accuracy
of 95.7%, Sensitivity of 90%, Specificity of 95.8%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, while
having far less number of trainable parameters in comparison to its counterparts. To further improve
diagnosis capabilities of the COVID-CAPS, pre-training based on a new dataset constructed from
an external dataset of X-ray images. Pre-training with a dataset of similar nature further improved
accuracy to 98.3% and specificity to 98.6%.
