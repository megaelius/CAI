Higher-order motif structures and multi-vertex interactions are becoming increasingly important
in studies that aim to improve our understanding of functionalities and evolution patterns of networks.
To elucidate the role of higher-order structures in community detection problems over complex
networks, we introduce the notion of a Superimposed Stochastic Block Model (SupSBM). The model
is based on a random graph framework in which certain higher-order structures or subgraphs are generated
through an independent hyperedge generation process, and are then replaced with graphs that are
superimposed with directed or undirected edges generated by an inhomogeneous random graph model.
Consequently, the model introduces controlled dependencies between edges which allow for capturing
more realistic network phenomena, namely strong local clustering in a sparse network, short average
path length, and community structure. We proceed to rigorously analyze the performance of a number
of recently proposed higher-order spectral clustering methods on the SupSBM. In particular, we
prove non-asymptotic upper bounds on the misclustering error of spectral community detection
for a SupSBM setting in which triangles or 3-uniform hyperedges are superimposed with undirected
edges. As part of our analysis, we also derive new bounds on the misclustering error of higher-order
spectral clustering methods for the standard SBM and the 3-uniform hypergraph SBM. Furthermore,
for a non-uniform hypergraph SBM model in which one directly observes both edges and 3-uniform hyperedges,
we obtain a criterion that describes when to perform spectral clustering based on edges and when
on hyperedges, based on a function of hyperedge density and observation quality.
