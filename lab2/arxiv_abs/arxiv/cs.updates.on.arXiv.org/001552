DNA sequencing entails the process of determining the precise physical order of the four bases (Adenine,
Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine) in a DNA strand. As semiconductor technology revolutionized computing,
DNA sequencing technology, termed often as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), revolutionized
genomic research. Modern NGS platforms can sequence millions of short DNA fragments in parallel.
The resulting short DNA sequences are termed (short) reads. Mapping each read to a reference genome
of the same species (which itself represents a full-fledged assembly of already sequenced reads),
sequence mapping, is an emerging application. Sequence mapping enables detailed study of genetic
variations, and thereby catalyzes personalized health care solutions. Due to the large scale of
the problem, well-studied pair-wise sequence similarity detection (or sequence alignment) algorithms
fall short of efficiently mapping individual reads to the reference genome. Mapping represents
a search-heavy data-intensive operation and barely features any complex floating point arithmetic.
Therefore, sequence mapping can greatly benefit from in- or near-memory search and processing.
Fast parallel associative search enabled by Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) can particularly
help, however CMOS-based TCAM implementations cannot accommodate the large memory footprint
in an area and energy efficient manner, where non-volatile TCAM comes to rescue. Still, brute-force
TCAM search over as large of a search space as sequence mapping demands consumes unacceptably high
energy. This paper provides an effective solution to the energy problem to tap the potential of non-volatile
TCAM for high-throughput, energy-efficient sequence mapping: BioCAM. BioCAM can improve the
throughput of sequence mapping by 7.5x; the energy consumption, by 109.0x when compared to a highly-optimized
software implementation for modern GPUs.
