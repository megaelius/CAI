In this study, a shell-and-tube heat exchanger (STHX) design based on seven continuous independent
design variables is proposed. Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis hasting (DRAM) was utilized
as a powerful tool in the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. This Reverse Sampling
(RS) method was used to find the probability distribution of design variables of the shell and tube
heat exchanger. Thanks to this probability distribution, an uncertainty analysis was also performed
to find the quality of these variables. In addition, a decision-making strategy based on confidence
intervals of design variables and on the Total Annual Cost (TAC) provides the final selection of
design variables. Results indicated high accuracies for the estimation of design variables which
leads to marginally improved performance compared to commonly used optimization methods. In order
to verify the capability of the proposed method, a case of study is also presented, it shows that a
significant cost reduction is feasible with respect to multi-objective and single-objective
optimization methods. Furthermore, the selected variables have good quality (in terms of probability
distribution) and a lower TAC was also achieved. Results show that the costs of the proposed design
are lower than those obtained from optimization method reported in previous studies. The algorithm
was also used to determine the impact of using probability values for the design variables rather
than single values to obtain the best heat transfer area and pumping power. In particular, a reduction
of the TAC up to 3.5% was achieved in the case considered.
