The appearance of a new dangerous and contagious disease requires the development of a drug therapy
faster than what is foreseen by usual mechanisms. Many drug therapy developments consist in investigating
through different clinical trials the effects of different specific drug combinations by delivering
it into a test group of ill patients, meanwhile a placebo treatment is delivered to the remaining
ill patients, known as the control group. We compare the above technique to a new technique in which
all patients receive a different and reasonable combination of drugs and use this outcome to feed
a Neural Network. By averaging out fluctuations and recognizing different patient features, the
Neural Network learns the pattern that connects the patients initial state to the outcome of the
treatments and therefore can predict the best drug therapy better than the above method. In contrast
to many available works, we do not study any detail of drugs composition nor interaction, but instead
pose and solve the problem from a phenomenological point of view, which allows us to compare both
methods. Although the conclusion is reached through mathematical modeling and is stable upon any
reasonable model, this is a proof-of-concept that should be studied within other expertises before
confronting a real scenario. All calculations, tools and scripts have been made open source for
the community to test, modify or expand it. Finally it should be mentioned that, although the results
presented here are in the context of a new disease in medical sciences, these are useful for any field
that requires a experimental technique with a control group.
