The current mobile applications have rapidly growing memory footprints, posing a great challenge
for memory system design. Insufficient DRAM main memory will incur frequent data swaps between
memory and storage, a process that hurts performance, consumes energy and deteriorates the write
endurance of typical flash storage devices. Alternately, a larger DRAM has higher leakage power
and drains the battery faster. Further, DRAM scaling trends make further growth of DRAMin the mobile
space prohibitive due to cost. Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) has the potential to alleviate
these issues due to its higher capacity per cost than DRAM and mini-mal static power. Recently, a
wide spectrum of NVM technologies, including phase-change memories (PCM), memristor, and 3D XPoint
have emerged. Despite the mentioned advantages, NVM has longer access latency compared to DRAMand
NVM writes can incur higher latencies and wear costs. Therefore integration of these new memory
technologies in the memory hierarchy requires a fundamental rearchitect-ing of traditional system
designs. In this work, we propose a hardware-accelerated memory manager (HMMU) that addresses
both types of memory in a flat space address space. We design a set of data placement and data migration
policies within this memory manager, such that we may exploit the advantages of each memory technology.
By augmenting the system with this HMMU, we reduce the overall memory latency while also reducing
writes to the NVM. Experimental results show that our design achieves a 39% reduction in energy consumption
with only a 12% performance degradation versus an all-DRAM baseline that is likely untenable in
the future.
