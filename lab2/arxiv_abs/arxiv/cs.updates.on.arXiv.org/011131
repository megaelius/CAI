We introduce SneakySnake, a highly parallel and highly accurate pre-alignment filter that remarkably
reduces the need for the computationally costly sequence alignment step. The key idea of SneakySnake
is to provide fast and highly accurate filtering by reducing the ASM problem to the single net routing
(SNR) problem in VLSI chip layout. In the SNR problem, we are interested in only finding the path that
connects two terminals with the least routing cost on a special grid layout that contains obstacles.
The SneakySnake algorithm quickly and optimally solves the SNR problem and uses the found optimal
path to decide whether performing sequence alignment is necessary. We also build two new hardware
accelerator designs, Snake-on-Chip and Snake-on-GPU, that adopts modern FPGA and GPU architectures,
respectively, to further boost the performance of our algorithm. SneakySnake significantly improves
the accuracy of pre-alignment filtering by up to four orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art
pre-alignment filters, Shouji, GateKeeper, and SHD. SneakySnake accelerates the state-of-the-art
CPU-based sequence aligners, Edlib and Parasail, by up to 37.6x and 43.9x, respectively, without
requiring hardware acceleration. The addition of Snake-on-Chip and Snake-on-GPU as a pre-alignment
filter reduces the execution time of four state-of-the-art sequence aligners, designed for different
computing platforms, by up to 689x (101x on average). To our knowledge, SneakySnake is the only pre-alignment
filtering mechanism that works on all modern high-performance computing architectures. Unlike
most existing works that aim to accelerate sequence alignment, SneakySnake does not sacrifice
any of the aligner capabilities (i.e., scoring and backtracking), as it does not modify or replace
the aligner. SneakySnake is freely available online at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SneakySnake/
