As the first diagnostic imaging modality of avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH), accurately
staging AVNFH from a plain radiograph is critical and challenging for orthopedists. Thus, we propose
a deep learning-based AVNFH diagnosis system (AVN-net). The proposed AVN-net reads plain radiographs
of the pelvis, conducts diagnosis, and visualizes results automatically. Deep convolutional
neural networks are trained to provide an end-to-end diagnosis solution, covering femoral head
detection, exam-view/sides identification, AVNFH diagnosis, and key clinical note generation
subtasks. AVN-net is able to obtain state-of-the-art testing AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92-0.98) in
AVNFH detection and significantly greater F1 scores (p<0.01) than less-to-moderately experienced
orthopedists in all diagnostic tests. Furthermore, two real-world pilot studies were conducted
for diagnosis support and education assistance, respectively, to assess the utility of AVN-net.
The experimental results are promising. With the AVN-net diagnosis as a reference, the diagnostic
accuracy and consistency of all orthopedists considerably improved while requiring only 1/4 of
the time. Students self-studying the AVNFH diagnosis using AVN-net can learn better and faster
than the control group. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first research on the prospective
use of a deep learning-based diagnosis system for AVNFH by conducting two pilot studies representing
real-world application scenarios. We have demonstrated that the proposed AVN-net achieves expert-level
AVNFH diagnosis performance, provides efficient support in clinical decision-making, and effectively
passes clinical experience to students.
