Geostatistics represents one of the most challenging classes of scientific applications due to
the desire to incorporate an ever increasing number of geospatial locations to accurately model
and predict environmental phenomena. For example, the evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood
function, which constitutes the main computational phase, involves solving systems of linear
equations with a large dense symmetric and positive definite covariance matrix. Cholesky, the
standard algorithm, requires O(n^3) floating point operators and has an O(n^2) memory footprint,
where n is the number of geographical locations. Here, we present a mixed-precision tile algorithm
to accelerate the Cholesky factorization during the log-likelihood function evaluation. Under
an appropriate ordering, it operates with double-precision arithmetic on tiles around the diagonal,
while reducing to single-precision arithmetic for tiles sufficiently far off. This translates
into an improvement of the performance without any deterioration of the numerical accuracy of the
application. We rely on the StarPU dynamic runtime system to schedule the tasks and to overlap them
with data movement. To assess the performance and the accuracy of the proposed mixed-precision
algorithm, we use synthetic and real datasets on various shared and distributed-memory systems
possibly equipped with hardware accelerators. We compare our mixed-precision Cholesky factorization
against the double-precision reference implementation as well as an independent block approximation
method. We obtain an average of 1.6X performance speedup on massively parallel architectures while
maintaining the accuracy necessary for modeling and prediction.
