Using machine learning, especially deep learning, to facilitate biological research is a fascinating
research direction. However, in addition to the standard classification or regression problems,
in bioinformatics, we often need to predict more complex structured targets, such as 2D images and
3D molecular structures. The above complex prediction tasks are referred to as structured prediction.
Structured prediction is more complicated than the traditional classification but has much broader
applications, considering that most of the original bioinformatics problems have complex output
objects. Due to the properties of those structured prediction problems, such as having problem-specific
constraints and dependency within the labeling space, the straightforward application of existing
deep learning models can lead to unsatisfactory results. Here, we argue that the following ideas
can help resolve structured prediction problems in bioinformatics. Firstly, we can combine deep
learning with other classic algorithms, such as probabilistic graphical models, which model the
problem structure explicitly. Secondly, we can design the problem-specific deep learning architectures
or methods by considering the structured labeling space and problem constraints, either explicitly
or implicitly. We demonstrate our ideas with six projects from four bioinformatics subfields,
including sequencing analysis, structure prediction, function annotation, and network analysis.
The structured outputs cover 1D signals, 2D images, 3D structures, hierarchical labeling, and
heterogeneous networks. With the help of the above ideas, all of our methods can achieve SOTA performance
on the corresponding problems. The success of these projects motivates us to extend our work towards
other more challenging but important problems, such as health-care problems, which can directly
benefit people's health and wellness.
