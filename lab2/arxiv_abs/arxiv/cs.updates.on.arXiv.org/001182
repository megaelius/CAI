Comparator circuit model was originally introduced by Mayr and Subramanian (1992) (and further
studied by Cook, Filmus and Le (2012)) to capture problems which are not known to be P-complete but
still not known to admit efficient parallel algorithms. The class CC is the complexity class of problems
many-one logspace reducible to the Comparator Circuit Value Problem and we know that NL is contained
in CC which is inturn contained in P. Cook, Filmus and Le (2012) showed that CC is also the class of languages
decided by polynomial size comparator circuits. We study generalizations of the comparator circuit
model that work over fixed finite bounded posets. We observe that there are universal comparator
circuits even over arbitrary fixed finite bounded posets. Building on this, we show that general
(resp. skew) comparator circuits of polynomial size over fixed finite distributive lattices characterizes
CC (resp. L). Complementing this, we show that general comparator circuits of polynomial size over
arbitrary fixed finite lattices exactly characterizes P even when the comparator circuit is skew.
In addition, we show a characterization of the class NP by a family of polynomial sized comparator
circuits over fixed {\em finite bounded posets}. These results generalize the results by Cook,
Filmus and Le (2012) regarding the power of comparator circuits. As an aside, we consider generalizations
of Boolean formulae over arbitrary lattices. We show that Spira's theorem (1971) can be extended
to this setting as well and show that polynomial sized Boolean formulae over finite fixed lattices
capture exactly NC^1.
