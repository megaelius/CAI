Many science advances have been possible thanks to the use of research software, which has become
essential to advancing virtually every Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
discipline and many non-STEM disciplines including social sciences and humanities. And while
much of it is made available under open source licenses, work is needed to develop, support, and sustain
it, as underlying systems and software as well as user needs evolve. In addition, the changing landscape
of high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, where performance and scaling advances are ever
more reliant on software and algorithm improvements as we hit hardware scaling barriers, is causing
renewed tension between sustainability of software and its performance. We must do more to highlight
the trade-off between performance and sustainability, and to emphasize the need for sustainability
given the fact that complex software stacks don't survive without frequent maintenance; made more
difficult as a generation of developers of established and heavily-used research software retire.
Several HPC forums are doing this, and it has become an active area of funding as well. In response,
the authors organized and ran a panel at the SC18 conference. The objectives of the panel were to highlight
the importance of sustainability, to illuminate the tension between pure performance and sustainability,
and to steer SC community discussion toward understanding and addressing this issue and this tension.
The outcome of the discussions, as presented in this paper, can inform choices of advance compute
and data infrastructures to positively impact future research software and future research.
