We consider optimal mechanism design for the case with one buyer and two items. The buyer's valuations
towards the two items are independent and additive. In this setting, optimal mechanism is unknown
for general valuation distributions. We obtain two categories of structural results that shed
light on the optimal mechanisms. The first category of results state that, under certain mild condition,
the optimal mechanism has a monotone menu. In other words, in the menu that represents the optimal
mechanism, as payment increases, the allocation probabilities for both items increase simultaneously.
Applying this theorem, we derive a version of revenue monotonicity theorem that states stochastically
superior distributions yield more revenue. Moreover, our theorem subsumes a previous result regarding
sufficient conditions under which bundling is optimal. The second category of results state that,
under certain conditions, the optimal mechanisms have few menu items. Our first result in this category
says, for certain distributions, the optimal menu contains at most 4 items. The condition admits
power (including uniform) density functions. Based on a similar proof of this result, we are able
to obtain a wide class of distributions where bundling is optimal. Our second result in this category
works for a weaker condition, under which the optimal menu contains at most 6 items. This condition
includes exponential density functions. Our last result in this category works for unit-demand
setting. It states that, for uniform distributions, the optimal menu contains at most 5 items. All
these results are in sharp contrast to Hart and Nisan's recent result that finite-sized menu cannot
guarantee any positive fraction of optimal revenue for correlated valuation distributions.
