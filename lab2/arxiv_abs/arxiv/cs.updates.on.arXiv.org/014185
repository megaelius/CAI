Network defenses based on traditional tools, techniques, and procedures fail to account for the
attacker's inherent advantage present due to the static nature of network services and configurations.
To take away this asymmetric advantage, Moving Target Defense (MTD) continuously shifts the configuration
of the underlying system, in turn reducing the success rate of cyberattacks. In this survey, we analyze
the recent advancements made in the development of MTDs and define categorizations that capture
the key aspects of such defenses. We first categorize these defenses into different sub-classes
depending on what they move, when they move and how they move. In trying to answer the latter question,
we showcase the use of domain knowledge and game-theoretic modeling can help the defender come up
with effective and efficient movement strategies. Second, to understand the practicality of these
defense methods, we discuss how various MTDs have been implemented and find that networking technologies
such as Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization act as key enablers for
implementing these dynamic defenses. We then briefly highlight MTD test-beds and case-studies
to aid readers who want to examine or deploy existing MTD techniques. Third, our survey categorizes
proposed MTDs based on the qualitative and quantitative metrics they utilize to evaluate their
effectiveness in terms of security and performance. We use well-defined metrics such as risk analysis
and performance costs for qualitative evaluation and metrics based on Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability (CIA), attack representation, QoS impact, and targeted threat models for quantitative
evaluation. Finally, we show that our categorization of MTDs is effective in identifying novel
research areas and highlight directions for future research.
