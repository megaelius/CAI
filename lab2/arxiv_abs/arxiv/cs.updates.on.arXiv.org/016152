As a massive number of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are deployed, the security and privacy
issues in IoT arouse more and more attention. The IoT attacks are causing tremendous loss to the IoT
networks and even threatening human safety. Compared to traditional networks, IoT networks have
unique characteristics, which make the attack detection more challenging. First, the heterogeneity
of platforms, protocols, software, and hardware exposes various vulnerabilities. Second, in
addition to the traditional high-rate attacks, the low-rate attacks are also extensively used
by IoT attackers to obfuscate the legitimate and malicious traffic. These low-rate attacks are
challenging to detect and can persist in the networks. Last, the attackers are evolving to be more
intelligent and can dynamically change their attack strategies based on the environment feedback
to avoid being detected, making it more challenging for the defender to discover a consistent pattern
to identify the attack. In order to adapt to the new characteristics in IoT attacks, we propose a reinforcement
learning-based attack detection model that can automatically learn and recognize the transformation
of the attack pattern. Therefore, we can continuously detect IoT attacks with less human intervention.
In this paper, we explore the crucial features of IoT traffics and utilize the entropy-based metrics
to detect both the high-rate and low-rate IoT attacks. Afterward, we leverage the reinforcement
learning technique to continuously adjust the attack detection threshold based on the detection
feedback, which optimizes the detection and the false alarm rate. We conduct extensive experiments
over a real IoT attack dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of our IoT attack detection framework.
