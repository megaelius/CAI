Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are the next major evolution in urban mobility. This technology
has attracted much interest of car manufacturers aiming at playing a role as transportation network
companies (TNCs) in order to gain benefits per kilometer and per ride. The majority of future SAVs
will most probably be electric. It is therefore important to understand how limited vehicle range
and the configuration of charging infrastructure will affect the performance of shared autonomous
electric vehicle (SAEV) services. We aim to explore the impacts of charging station placement,
charging type (rapid charging, battery swapping) as well as vehicle range onto service efficiency
and customer experience in terms of service availability and response time. We perform an agent-based
simulation of SAEVs across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. The simulation process
features impact assessment by considering dynamic demand responsive to the network and traffic.
Research results suggest that the performance of SAEVs is strongly correlated to the charging infrastructure.
Importantly, faster charging infrastructure and optimized placement of charging locations in
order to minimize distances between demand hubs and charging stations result in a higher performance.
Further analysis indicates the importance of dispersing charging stations across the service
area and how this affects service effectiveness. The results also underline that SAEV battery capacity
has to be carefully selected to avoid the overlaps between demand and charging peak times. Finally,
the simulation results show that by providing battery swapping infrastructure the performance
indicators of SAEV service are significantly improved.
