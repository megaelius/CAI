L\'evy walks are random walks processes whose step length follows a long-tailed power law distribution.
Due to their abundance as movement patterns of biological organisms, significant theoretical
efforts have been devoted to identify the foraging circumstances that would make such patterns
advantageous [Viswanathan et al. Nature, 1999]. Despite numerous attempts, there is currently
no conclusive analytical evidence that L\'evy flights are preferable strategies in higher dimensions
than one. Here we show that the optimality of inverse-square L\'evy walks in two-dimensions becomes
striking when targets are sparse and unpredictable in size, and when detection is weak. Specifically,
we prove that under the intermittent model, in which detection is not possible while moving ballistically
[B\'enichou et al. Reviews of Modern Physics, 2011], this strategy optimally finds sparse targets
of any size and shape. That is, in a square torus of area~$n$, and assuming that the detection radius
is normalized to $1$, the strategy finds any connected set of diameter $D$ in $\tilde{O}(n/D)$ expected
time, whereas $\Omega(n/D)$ is an unconditional lower bound on the expected time, that holds even
when assuming that the shape and size of the target are known. Furthermore, this particular L\'evy
process stands in stark contrast to many other basic intermittent processes, including all other
L\'evy walks, whose competitive ratio is shown to be polynomial in $n$, for wide ranges of target
scales. Our results thus provide strong theoretical support for the optimality and robustness
of intermittent L\'evy walks under general conditions.
