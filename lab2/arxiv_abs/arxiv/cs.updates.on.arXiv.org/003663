Person re-identification (re-ID) requires rapid, flexible yet discriminant representations
to quickly generalize to unseen observations on-the-fly and recognize the same identity across
disjoint camera views. Recent effective methods are developed in a pair-wise similarity learning
system to detect a fixed set of features from distinct regions which are mapped to their vector embeddings
for the distance measuring. However, the most relevant and crucial parts of each image are detected
independently without referring to the dependency conditioned on one and another. Also, these
region based methods rely on spatial manipulation to position the local features in comparable
similarity measuring. To combat these limitations, in this paper we introduce the Deep Co-attention
based Comparators (DCCs) that fuse the co-dependent representations of the paired images so as
to focus on the relevant parts of both images and produce their \textit{relative representations}.
Given a pair of pedestrian images to be compared, the proposed model mimics the foveation of human
eyes to detect distinct regions concurrent on both images, namely co-dependent features, and alternatively
attend to relevant regions to fuse them into the similarity learning. Our comparator is capable
of producing dynamic representations relative to a particular sample every time, and thus well-suited
to the case of re-identifying pedestrians on-the-fly. We perform extensive experiments to provide
the insights and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCCs in person re-ID. Moreover,
our approach has achieved the state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark data sets: DukeMTMC-reID
\cite{DukeMTMC}, CUHK03 \cite{FPNN}, and Market-1501 \cite{Market1501}.
