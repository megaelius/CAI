Molecular optimization, which transforms a given input molecule X into another Y with desirable
properties, is essential in molecular drug discovery. The traditional translating approaches,
generating the molecular graphs from scratch by adding some substructures piece by piece, prone
to error because of the large set of candidate substructures in a large number of steps to the final
target. In this study, we present a novel molecular optimization paradigm, Graph Polish, which
changes molecular optimization from the traditional "two-language translating" task into a "single-language
polishing" task. The key to this optimization paradigm is to find an optimization center subject
to the conditions that the preserved areas around it ought to be maximized and thereafter the removed
and added regions should be minimized. We then propose an effective and efficient learning framework
T&S polish to capture the long-term dependencies in the optimization steps. The T component automatically
identifies and annotates the optimization centers and the preservation, removal and addition
of some parts of the molecule, and the S component learns these behaviors and applies these actions
to a new molecule. Furthermore, the proposed paradigm can offer an intuitive interpretation for
each molecular optimization result. Experiments with multiple optimization tasks are conducted
on four benchmark datasets. The proposed T&S polish approach achieves significant advantage over
the five state-of-the-art baseline methods on all the tasks. In addition, extensive studies are
conducted to validate the effectiveness, explainability and time saving of the novel optimization
paradigm.
