Loss of thrust emergencies-e.g., induced by bird/drone strikes or fuel exhaustion-create the
need for dynamic data-driven flight trajectory planning to advise pilots or control UAVs. While
total loss of thrust trajectories to nearby airports can be pre-computed for all initial points
in a 3D flight plan, dynamic aspects such as partial power and airplane surface damage must be considered
for accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new Dynamic Data-Driven Avionics Software (DDDAS) approach
which during flight updates a damaged aircraft performance model, used in turn to generate plausible
flight trajectories to a safe landing site. Our damaged aircraft model is parameterized on a baseline
glide ratio for a clean aircraft configuration assuming best gliding airspeed on straight flight.
The model predicts purely geometric criteria for flight trajectory generation, namely, glide
ratio and turn radius for different bank angles and drag configurations. Given actual aircraft
performance data, we dynamically infer the baseline glide ratio to update the damaged aircraft
model. Our new flight trajectory generation algorithm thus can significantly improve upon prior
Dubins based trajectory generation work by considering these data-driven geometric criteria.
We further introduce a trajectory utility function to rank trajectories for safety. As a use case,
we consider the Hudson River ditching of US Airways 1549 in January 2009 using a flight simulator
to evaluate our trajectories and to get sensor data. In this case, a baseline glide ratio of 17.25:1
enabled us to generate trajectories up to 28 seconds after the birds strike, whereas, a 19:1 baseline
glide ratio enabled us to generate trajectories up to 36 seconds after the birds strike. DDDAS can
significantly improve the accuracy of generated flight trajectories thereby enabling better
decision support systems for pilots in emergency conditions.
