These proceedings present the accepted regular papers and some selected extended abstracts from
the 3rd joint DICE-FOPARA workshop, which was held in Prague, Czech Republic on April 6-7, 2019,
as a part of ETAPS. The joint workshop provides synergies by combining two complementary communities:
The 10th DICE workshop explores the area of Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC), which grew
out from several proposals to use logic and formal methods to provide languages for complexity-bounded
computation (e.g. Ptime, Logspace computation). It aims at studying the computational complexity
of programs without referring to external measuring conditions or a particular machine model,
but only by considering language restrictions or logical/computational principles entailing
complexity properties. Several approaches have been explored for that purpose, such as restrictions
on primitive recursion and ramification, rewriting systems, linear logic, types and lambda calculus,
interpretations of functional and imperative programs. The 6th FOPARA workshop serves as a forum
for presenting original research results that are relevant to the analysis of resource (e.g. time,
space, energy) consumption by computer programs. The workshop aims to bring together the researchers
that work on foundational issues with the researchers that focus more on practical results. Therefore,
both theoretical and practical contributions are encouraged. We also encourage papers that combine
theory and practice. This third joint DICE-FOPARA workshop at ETAPS 2019 follows the successful
experiences of co-location of DICE-FOPARA at ETAPS 2015 in London and ETAPS 2017 in Uppsala.
