We consider the classical problem of minimizing the total weighted flow-time for unrelated machines
in the online \emph{non-clairvoyant} setting. In this problem, a set of jobs $J$ arrive over time
to be scheduled on a set of $M$ machines. Each job $j$ has processing length $p_j$, weight $w_j$, and
is processed at a rate of $\ell_{ij}$ when scheduled on machine $i$. The online scheduler knows the
values of $w_j$ and $\ell_{ij}$ upon arrival of the job, but is not aware of the quantity $p_j$. We
present the {\em first} online algorithm that is {\em scalable} ($(1+\eps)$-speed $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$-competitive
for any constant $\eps > 0$) for the total weighted flow-time objective. No non-trivial results
were known for this setting, except for the most basic case of identical machines. Our result resolves
a major open problem in online scheduling theory. Moreover, we also show that no job needs more than
a logarithmic number of migrations. We further extend our result and give a scalable algorithm for
the objective of minimizing total weighted flow-time plus energy cost for the case of unrelated
machines and obtain a scalable algorithm. The key algorithmic idea is to let jobs migrate selfishly
until they converge to an equilibrium. Towards this end, we define a game where each job's utility
which is closely tied to the instantaneous increase in the objective the job is responsible for,
and each machine declares a policy that assigns priorities to jobs based on when they migrate to it,
and the execution speeds. This has a spirit similar to coordination mechanisms that attempt to achieve
near optimum welfare in the presence of selfish agents (jobs). To the best our knowledge, this is
the first work that demonstrates the usefulness of ideas from coordination mechanisms and Nash
equilibria for designing and analyzing online algorithms.
