Although timely sepsis diagnosis and prompt interventions in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients
are associated with reduced mortality, early clinical recognition is frequently impeded by non-specific
signs of infection and failure to detect signs of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction in a constellation
of dynamically changing physiological data. The goal of this work is to identify patient at risk
of life-threatening sepsis utilizing a data-centered and machine learning-driven approach.
We derive a mortality risk predictive dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) guided by a customized sepsis
knowledgebase and compare the predictive accuracy of the derived DBN with the Sepsis-related Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, the Quick SOFA (qSOFA) score, the Simplified Acute Physiological
Score (SAPS-II) and the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) tools. A customized sepsis ontology
was used to derive the DBN node structure and semantically characterize temporal features derived
from both structured physiological data and unstructured clinical notes. We assessed the performance
in predicting mortality risk of the DBN predictive model and compared performance to other models
using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, area under curve (AUROC), calibration
curves, and risk distributions. The derived dataset consists of 24,506 ICU stays from 19,623 patients
with evidence of suspected infection, with 2,829 patients deceased at discharge. The DBN AUROC
was found to be 0.91, which outperformed the SOFA (0.843), qSOFA (0.66), MEWS (0.73), and SAPS-II
(0.77) scoring tools. Continuous Net Reclassification Index and Integrated Discrimination Improvement
analysis supported the superiority DBN. Compared with conventional rule-based risk scoring tools,
the sepsis knowledgebase-driven DBN algorithm offers improved performance for predicting mortality
of infected patients in ICUs.
