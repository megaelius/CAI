Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a newly emerging yet widely studied topic in
recent years. The existing methods can be categorized into two localization-by-classification
pipelines, i.e., the pre-classification pipeline and the post-classification pipeline. The
pre-classification pipeline first performs classification on each video snippet and then aggregate
the snippet-level classification scores to obtain the video-level classification score, while
the post-classification pipeline aggregates the snippet-level features first and then predicts
the video-level classification score based on the aggregated feature. Although the classifiers
in these two pipelines are used in different ways, the role they play is exactly the same---to classify
the given features to identify the corresponding action categories. To this end, an ideal classifier
can make both pipelines work. This inspires us to simultaneously learn these two pipelines in a unified
framework to obtain an effective classifier. Specifically, in the proposed learning framework,
we implement two parallel network streams to model the two localization-by-classification pipelines
simultaneously and make the two network streams share the same classifier, thus achieving the novel
Equivalent Classification Mapping (ECM) mechanism. Considering that an ideal classifier would
make the classification results of the two network streams be identical and make the frame-level
classification scores obtained from the pre-classification pipeline and the feature aggregation
weights in the post-classification pipeline be consistent, we further introduce an equivalent
classification loss and an equivalent weight transition module to endow the proposed learning
framework with such properties. Comprehensive experiments are carried on three benchmarks and
the proposed ECM achieves superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods.
