Recently Ermon et al. (2013) pioneered an ingenuous way to practically compute approximations
to large scale counting or discrete integration problems by using random hashes. The hashes are
used to reduce the counting problems into many separate discrete optimization problems. The optimization
problems can be solved by an NP-oracle, and if they allow some amenable structure then commercial
SAT solvers or linear programming (LP) solvers can be used in lieu of the NP-oracle. In particular,
Ermon et al. has shown that if the domain of integration is $\{0,1\}^n$ then it is possible to obtain
a $16$-approximation by this technique. In many crucial counting tasks, such as computation of
partition function of ferromagnetic Potts model, the domain of integration is naturally $\{0,1,\dots,
q-1\}^n, q>2$. A straightforward extension of Ermon et al.'s work would allow a $q^2$-approximation
for this problem, assuming the existence of an optimization oracle. In this paper, we show that it
is possible to obtain a $(2+\frac2{q-1})^2$-approximation to the discrete integration problem,
when $q$ is a power of an odd prime (a similar expression follows for even $q$). We are able to achieve
this by using an idea of optimization over multiple bins of the hash functions, that can be easily
implemented by inequality constraints, or even in unconstrained way. Also the burden on the NP-oracle
is not increased by our method (an LP solver can still be used). Furthermore, we provide a close-to-4-approximation
for the permanent of a matrix by extending our technique. Note that, the domain of integration here
is the symmetric group. Finally, we provide memory optimal hash functions that uses minimal number
of random bits for the above purpose. We are able to obtain these structured hashes without sacrificing
the amenability of the NP-oracle. We provide experimental simulation results to support our algorithms.
