Multi-objective optimization is a crucial matter in computer systems design space exploration
because real-world applications often rely on a trade-off between several objectives. Derivatives
are usually not available or impractical to compute and the feasibility of an experiment can not
always be determined in advance. These problems are particularly difficult when the feasible region
is relatively small, and it may be prohibitive to even find a feasible experiment, let alone an optimal
one. We introduce a new methodology and corresponding software framework, ParetoDaemon, which
handles multi-objective optimization, unknown feasibility constraints, and categorical/ordinal
variables. This new methodology also supports injection of user prior knowledge in the search when
available. All of these features are common requirements in computer systems but rarely exposed
in existing design space exploration systems. The proposed methodology follows a white-box model
which is simple to understand and interpret (unlike, for example, neural networks) and can be used
by the user to better understand the results of the automatic search. We apply and evaluate the new
methodology to automatic static tuning of hardware accelerators within the recently introduced
Spatial programming language, with minimization of design runtime and compute logic under the
constraint of the design fitting in a target field programmable gate array chip. Our results show
that ParetoDaemon provides better Pareto fronts compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with
better or competitive hypervolume indicator and with 8x improvement in sampling budget for most
of the benchmarks explored.
