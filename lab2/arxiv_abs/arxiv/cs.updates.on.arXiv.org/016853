Although the anchor-based detectors have taken a big step forward in pedestrian detection, the
overall performance of algorithm still needs further improvement for practical applications,
\emph{e.g.}, a good trade-off between the accuracy and efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes
a series of systematic optimization strategies for the detection pipeline of one-stage detector,
forming a single shot anchor-based detector (SADet) for efficient and accurate pedestrian detection,
which includes three main improvements. Firstly, we optimize the sample generation process by
assigning soft tags to the outlier samples to generate semi-positive samples with continuous tag
value between $0$ and $1$, which not only produces more valid samples, but also strengthens the robustness
of the model. Secondly, a novel Center-$IoU$ loss is applied as a new regression loss for bounding
box regression, which not only retains the good characteristics of IoU loss, but also solves some
defects of it. Thirdly, we also design Cosine-NMS for the postprocess of predicted bounding boxes,
and further propose adaptive anchor matching to enable the model to adaptively match the anchor
boxes to full or visible bounding boxes according to the degree of occlusion, making the NMS and anchor
matching algorithms more suitable for occluded pedestrian detection. Though structurally simple,
it presents state-of-the-art result and real-time speed of $20$ FPS for VGA-resolution images
($640 \times 480$) on challenging pedestrian detection benchmarks, i.e., CityPersons, Caltech,
and human detection benchmark CrowdHuman, leading to a new attractive pedestrian detector.
