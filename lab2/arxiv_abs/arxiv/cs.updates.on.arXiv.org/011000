Predicting discomfort glare in open-plan offices is a challenging problem since most of available
glare metrics are developed for cellular offices which are typically daylight dominated. The problem
with open-plan offices is that they are mainly dependent on electric lighting rather than daylight
even when they have a fully glazed facade. In addition, the contrast between bright windows and the
buildings interior can be problematic and may cause discomfort glare to the building occupants.
These problems can affect occupant productivity and wellbeing. Thus, it is important to develop
a predictive model to avoid discomfort glare when designing open plan offices. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to adopt Machine Learning (ML) models to predict discomfort glare. In
order to develop new glare predictive models for these types of offices, Post-Occupancy Evaluation
(POE) and High Dynamic Range (HDR) images were collected from 80 occupants (n=80) in four different
open-plan offices. Consequently, various multi-region luminance values, luminance and glare
indices were calculated and used as input features to train ML models. The accuracy of the ML model
was compared to the accuracy of 24 indices which were also evaluated using a Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) analysis to identify the best cutoff values (thresholds) for each index for open-plan configurations.
Results showed that the ML glare model could predict glare in open-plan offices with an accuracy
of 83.8% (0.80 true positive rate and 0.86 true negative rate) which outperformed the accuracy of
the previously developed glare metrics.
