This paper is concerned with a compositional approach for constructing both infinite (reduced-order
models) and finite abstractions (a.k.a. finite Markov decision processes) of large-scale interconnected
discrete-time stochastic control systems. The proposed framework is based on the notion of stochastic
simulation functions enabling us to use an abstract system as a substitution of the original one
in the controller design process with guaranteed error bounds. In the first part of the paper, we
derive sufficient small-gain type conditions for the compositional quantification of the probabilistic
distance between the interconnection of stochastic control subsystems and that of their infinite
abstractions. We then construct infinite abstractions together with their corresponding stochastic
simulation functions for a class of discrete-time nonlinear stochastic control systems. In the
second part of the paper, we leverage small-gain type conditions for the compositional construction
of finite abstractions. We propose an approach to construct finite Markov decision processes (MDPs)
of the concrete models (or their reduced-order versions) satisfying an incremental input-to-state
stability property. We also show that for a particular class of nonlinear stochastic control systems,
the aforementioned property can be readily checked by matrix inequalities. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed results by applying our approaches to the temperature regulation
in a circular building and constructing compositionally a finite abstraction of a network containing
1000 rooms. We also apply our proposed techniques to a fully connected network of 20 nonlinear subsystems
(totally 100 dimensions) and construct finite MDPs from their reduced-order versions (together
20 dimensions) with guaranteed error bounds on their output trajectories.
