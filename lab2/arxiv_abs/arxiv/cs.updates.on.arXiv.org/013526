We present a framework for petrophysically and geologically guided inversion to perform multi-physics
joint inversions. Petrophysical and geological information is included in a multi-dimensional
Gaussian mixture model that regularizes the inverse problem. The inverse problem we construct
consists of a suite of three cyclic optimizations over the geophysical, petrophysical and geological
information. The two additional problems over the petrophysical and geological data are used as
a coupling term. They correspond to updating the geophysical reference model and regularization
weights. This guides the inverse problem towards reproducing the desired petrophysical and geological
characteristics. The objective function that we define for the inverse problem is comprised of
multiple data misfit terms: one for each geophysical survey and one for the petrophysical properties
and geological information. Each of these misfit terms has its target misfit value which we seek
to fit in the inversion. We detail our reweighting strategies to handle multiple data misfits at
once. Our framework is modular and extensible, and this allows us to combine multiple geophysical
methods in a joint inversion and to distribute open-source code and reproducible examples. To illustrate
the gains made by multi-physics inversions, we apply our framework to jointly invert, in 3D, synthetic
potential fields data based on the DO-$27$ kimberlite pipe case study (Northwest Territories,
Canada). The pipe contains two distinct kimberlite facies embedded in a host rock. We show that inverting
the datasets individually, even with petrophysical information, leads to a binary geologic model
consisting of background or kimberlite. A joint inversion, with petrophysical information, can
differentiate the two main kimberlite facies of the pipe.
