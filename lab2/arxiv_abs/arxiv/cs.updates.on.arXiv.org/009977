A deep-learning-based surrogate model is developed and applied for predicting dynamic subsurface
flow in channelized geological models. The surrogate model is based on deep convolutional and recurrent
neural network architectures, specifically a residual U-Net and a convolutional long short term
memory recurrent network. Training samples entail global pressure and saturation maps, at a series
of time steps, generated by simulating oil-water flow in many (1500 in our case) realizations of
a 2D channelized system. After training, the `recurrent R-U-Net' surrogate model is shown to be
capable of accurately predicting dynamic pressure and saturation maps and well rates (e.g., time-varying
oil and water rates at production wells) for new geological realizations. Assessments demonstrating
high surrogate-model accuracy are presented for an individual geological realization and for
an ensemble of 500 test geomodels. The surrogate model is then used for the challenging problem of
data assimilation (history matching) in a channelized system. For this study, posterior reservoir
models are generated using the randomized maximum likelihood method, with the permeability field
represented using the recently developed CNN-PCA parameterization. The flow responses required
during the data assimilation procedure are provided by the recurrent R-U-Net. The overall approach
is shown to lead to substantial reduction in prediction uncertainty. High-fidelity numerical
simulation results for the posterior geomodels (generated by the surrogate-based data assimilation
procedure) are shown to be in essential agreement with the recurrent R-U-Net predictions. The accuracy
and dramatic speedup provided by the surrogate model suggest that it may eventually enable the application
of more formal posterior sampling methods in realistic problems.
