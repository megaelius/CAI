Let $p \ge 2$. We improve the bound $\frac{\|f\|_p}{\|f\|_2} \le (p-1)^{s/2}$ for a polynomial
$f$ of degree $s$ on the boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$, which comes from hypercontractivity, replacing
the right hand side of this inequality by an explicit bivariate function of $p$ and $s$, which is smaller
than $(p-1)^{s/2}$ for any $p > 2$ and $s > 0$. We show the new bound to be tight, within a smaller order
factor, for the Krawchouk polynomial of degree $s$. This implies several nearly-extremal properties
of Krawchouk polynomials and Hamming spheres (equivalently, Hamming balls). In particular, Krawchouk
polynomials have (almost) the heaviest tails among all polynomials of the same degree and $\ell_2$
norm (this has to be interpreted with some care). The Hamming spheres have the following approximate
edge-isoperimetric property: For all $1 \le s \le \frac{n}{2}$, and for all even distances $0 \le
i \le \frac{2s(n-s)}{n}$, the Hamming sphere of radius $s$ contains, up to a multiplicative factor
of $O(i)$, as many pairs of points at distance $i$ as possible, among sets of the same size (there is
a similar, but slightly weaker and somewhat more complicated claim for general distances). This
also implies that Hamming spheres are (almost) stablest with respect to noise among sets of the same
size. In coding theory terms this means that a Hamming sphere (equivalently a Hamming ball) has the
maximal probability of undetected error, among all binary codes of the same rate. We also describe
a family of hypercontractive inequalities for functions on $\{0,1\}^n$, which improve on the `usual'
"$q \rightarrow 2$" inequality by taking into account the concentration of a function (expressed
as the ratio between its $\ell_r$ norms), and which are nearly tight for characteristic functions
of Hamming spheres.
