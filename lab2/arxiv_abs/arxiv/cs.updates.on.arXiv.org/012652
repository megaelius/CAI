Morphologies of red blood cells are normally interpreted by a pathologist. It is time-consuming
and laborious. Furthermore, a misclassified red blood cell morphology will lead to false disease
diagnosis and improper treatment. Thus, a decent pathologist must truly be an expert in classifying
red blood cell morphology. In the past decade, many approaches have been proposed for classifying
human red blood cell morphology. However, those approaches have not addressed the class imbalance
problem in classification. A class imbalance problem---a problem where the numbers of samples
in classes are very different---is one of the problems that can lead to a biased model towards the
majority class. Due to the rarity of every type of abnormal blood cell morphology, the data from the
collection process are usually imbalanced. In this study, we aimed to solve this problem specifically
for classification of dog red blood cell morphology by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)---a
well-known deep learning technique---in conjunction with a focal loss function, adept at handling
class imbalance problem. The proposed technique was conducted on a well-designed framework: two
different CNNs were used to verify the effectiveness of the focal loss function and the optimal hyper-parameters
were determined by 5-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that both CNNs models
augmented with the focal loss function achieved higher $F_{1}$-scores, compared to the models
augmented with a conventional cross-entropy loss function that does not address class imbalance
problem. In other words, the focal loss function truly enabled the CNNs models to be less biased towards
the majority class than the cross-entropy did in the classification task of imbalanced dog red blood
cell data.
