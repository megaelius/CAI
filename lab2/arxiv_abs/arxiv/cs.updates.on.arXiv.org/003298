Demand response (DR) programs have emerged as a potential key enabling ingredient in the context
of smart grid (SG). Nevertheless, the rising concerns over privacy issues raised by customers subscribed
to these programs constitute a major threat towards their effective deployment and utilization.
This has driven extensive research to resolve the hindrance confronted, resulting in a number of
methods being proposed for preserving customers' privacy. While these methods provide stringent
privacy guarantees, only limited attention has been paid to their computational efficiency and
performance quality. Under the paradigm of differential privacy, this paper initiates a systematic
empirical study on quantifying the trade-off between privacy and optimality in centralized DR
systems for maximizing cumulative customer utility. Aiming to elucidate the factors governing
this trade-off, we analyze the cost of privacy in terms of the effect incurred on the objective value
of the DR optimization problem when applying the employed privacy-preserving strategy based on
Laplace mechanism. The theoretical results derived from the analysis are complemented with empirical
findings, corroborated extensively by simulations on a 4-bus MG system with up to thousands of customers.
By evaluating the impact of privacy, this pilot study serves DR practitioners when considering
the social and economic implications of deploying privacy-preserving DR programs in practice.
Moreover, it stimulates further research on exploring more efficient approaches with bounded
performance guarantees for optimizing energy procurement of MGs without infringing the privacy
of customers on demand side.
