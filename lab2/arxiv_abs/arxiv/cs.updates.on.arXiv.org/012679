The inherent behavioral variability exhibited by stochastic biochemical systems makes it a challenging
task for human experts to manually analyze them. Computational modeling of such systems helps in
investigating and predicting the behaviors of the underlying biochemical processes but at the
same time introduces the presence of several unknown parameters. A key challenge faced in this scenario
is to determine the values of these unknown parameters against known behavioral specifications.
The solutions that have been presented so far estimate the parameters of a given model against a single
specification whereas a correct model is expected to satisfy all the behavioral specifications
when instantiated with a single set of parameter values. We present a new method, BioMETA, to address
this problem such that a single set of parameter values causes a parameterized stochastic biochemical
model to satisfy all the given probabilistic temporal logic behavioral specifications simultaneously.
Our method is based on combining a multiple hypothesis testing based statistical model checking
technique with simulated annealing search to look for a single set of parameter values so that the
given parameterized model satisfies multiple probabilistic behavioral specifications. We study
two stochastic rule-based models of biochemical receptors, namely, Fc$\epsilon$RI and T-cell
as our benchmarks to evaluate the usefulness of the presented method. Our experimental results
successfully estimate $26$ parameters of Fc$\epsilon$RI and $29$ parameters of T-cell receptor
model against three probabilistic temporal logic behavioral specifications each.
