Numerous studies have established that estimated brain age, as derived from statistical models
trained on healthy populations, constitutes a valuable biomarker that is predictive of cognitive
decline and various neurological diseases. In this work, we curate a large-scale heterogeneous
dataset (N = 10,158, age range 18 - 97) of structural brain MRIs in a healthy population from multiple
publicly-available sources, upon which we train a deep learning model for brain age estimation.
The availability of the large-scale dataset enables a more uniform age distribution across adult
life-span for effective age estimation with no bias toward certain age groups. We demonstrate that
the age estimation accuracy, evaluated with mean absolute error (MAE) and correlation coefficient
(r), outperforms previously reported methods in both a hold-out test set reflective of the custom
population (MAE = 4.06 years, r = 0.970) and an independent life-span evaluation dataset (MAE = 4.21
years, r = 0.960) on which a previous study has evaluated. We further demonstrate the utility of the
estimated age in life-span aging analysis of cognitive functions. Furthermore, we conduct extensive
ablation tests and employ feature-attribution techniques to analyze which regions contribute
the most predictive value, demonstrating the prominence of the frontal lobe as well as pattern shift
across life-span. In summary, we achieve superior age estimation performance confirming the efficacy
of deep learning and the added utility of training with data both in larger number and more uniformly
distributed than in previous studies. We demonstrate the regional contribution to our brain age
predictions through multiple routes and confirm the association of divergence between estimated
and chronological brain age with neuropsychological measures.
