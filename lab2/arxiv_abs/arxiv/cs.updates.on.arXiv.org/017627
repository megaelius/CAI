Although the field of sleep study has greatly developed over the recent years, the most common and
efficient way to detect sleep issues remains a sleep examination performed in a sleep laboratory,
in a procedure called Polysomnography (PSG). This examination measures several vital signals
during a full night's sleep using multiple sensors connected to the patient's body. Yet, despite
being the golden standard, the connection of the sensors and the unfamiliar environment inevitably
impact the quality of the patient's sleep and the examination itself. Therefore, with the novel
development of more accurate and affordable 3D sensing devices, new approaches for non-contact
sleep study emerged. These methods utilize different techniques with the purpose to extract the
same sleep parameters, but remotely, eliminating the need of any physical connections to the patient's
body. However, in order to enable reliable remote extraction, these methods require accurate identification
of the basic Region of Interest (ROI) i.e. the chest area of the patient, a task that is currently holding
back the development process, as it is performed manually for each patient. In this study, we propose
an automatic chest area segmentation algorithm, that given an input set of 3D frames of a sleeping
patient, outputs a segmentation image with the pixels that correspond to the chest area, and can
then be used as an input to subsequent sleep analysis algorithms. Except for significantly speeding
up the development process of the non-contact methods, accurate automatic segmentation can also
enable a more precise feature extraction and it is shown it is already improving sensitivity of prior
solutions on average 46.9% better compared to manual ROI selection. All mentioned will place the
extraction algorithms of the non-contact methods as a leading candidate to replace the existing
traditional methods used today.
