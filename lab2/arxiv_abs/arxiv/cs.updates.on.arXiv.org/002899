Crowdsourcing is an important avenue for collecting machine learning data, but crowdsourcing
can go beyond simple data collection by employing the creativity and wisdom of crowd workers. Yet
crowd participants are unlikely to be experts in statistics or predictive modeling, and it is not
clear how well non-experts can contribute creatively to the process of machine learning. Here we
study an end-to-end crowdsourcing algorithm where groups of non-expert workers propose supervised
learning problems, rank and categorize those problems, and then provide data to train predictive
models on those problems. Problem proposal includes and extends feature engineering because workers
propose the entire problem, not only the input features but also the target variable. We show that
workers without machine learning experience can collectively construct useful datasets and that
predictive models can be learned on these datasets. In our experiments, the problems proposed by
workers covered a broad range of topics, from politics and current events to problems capturing
health behavior, demographics, and more. Workers also favored questions showing positively correlated
relationships, which has interesting implications given many supervised learning methods perform
as well with strong negative correlations. Proper instructions are crucial for non-experts, so
we also conducted a randomized trial to understand how different instructions may influence the
types of problems proposed by workers. In general, shifting the focus of machine learning tasks
from designing and training individual predictive models to problem proposal allows crowdsourcers
to design requirements for problems of interest and then guide workers towards contributing to
the most suitable problems.
