Token Curated Registries (TCR) are decentralized recommendation systems that can be implemented
using Blockchain smart contracts. They allow participants to vote for or against adding items to
a list through a process that involves staking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving
the staked tokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated list. In
this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing token-holders to actually
engage and participate in the voting process. We propose a novel token-inflation mechanism for
enhancing engagement, whereby only voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined
multiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a simple 4-class model
of voters that captures all possible combinations of two key dimensions: whether they are engaged
(likely to vote at all for a given item) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote
in a way that increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to evaluate the
quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct simulations using this model of
voters and show that implementing token-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for
engaged voters. In particular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our simulations
show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the greatest benefits from participating
in the registry when our proposed token-inflation mechanism is employed. We further validate this
finding using a simplified mathematical analysis.
