Underwater machine vision has attracted significant attention, but its low quality has prevented
it from a wide range of applications. Although many different algorithms have been developed to
solve this problem, real-time adaptive methods are frequently deficient. In this paper, based
on filtering and the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), two approaches are proposed
for the aforementioned issue, i.e., a filtering-based restoration scheme (FRS) and a GAN-based
restoration scheme (GAN-RS). Distinct from previous methods, FRS restores underwater images
in the Fourier domain, which is composed of a parameter search, filtering, and enhancement. Aiming
to further improve the image quality, GAN-RS can adaptively restore underwater machine vision
in real time without the need for pretreatment. In particular, information in the Lab color space
and the dark channel is developed as loss functions, namely, underwater index loss and dark channel
prior loss, respectively. More specifically, learning from the underwater index, the discriminator
is equipped with a carefully crafted underwater branch to predict the underwater probability of
an image. A multi-stage loss strategy is then developed to guarantee the effective training of GANs.
Through extensive comparisons on the image quality and applications, the superiority of the proposed
approaches is confirmed. Consequently, the GAN-RS is considerably faster and achieves a state-of-the-art
performance in terms of the color correction, contrast stretch, dehazing, and feature restoration
of various underwater scenes. The source code will be made available.
