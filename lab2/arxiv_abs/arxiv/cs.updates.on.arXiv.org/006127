In the United States, heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women, accounting
for 610,000 deaths each year [1]. Physicians use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to take
images of the heart in order to non-invasively estimate its structural and functional parameters
for cardiovascular diagnosis and disease management. The end-systolic volume (ESV) and end-diastolic
volume (EDV) of the left ventricle (LV), and the ejection fraction (EF) are indicators of heart disease.
These measures can be derived from the segmented contours of the LV; thus, consistent and accurate
segmentation of the LV from MRI images are critical to the accuracy of the ESV, EDV, and EF, and to non-invasive
cardiac disease detection. In this work, various image preprocessing techniques, model configurations
using the U-Net deep learning architecture, postprocessing methods, and approaches for volume
estimation are investigated. An end-to-end analytics pipeline with multiple stages is provided
for automated LV segmentation and volume estimation. First, image data are reformatted and processed
from DICOM and NIfTI formats to raw images in array format. Secondly, raw images are processed with
multiple image preprocessing methods and cropped to include only the Region of Interest (ROI).
Thirdly, preprocessed images are segmented using U-Net models. Lastly, post processing of segmented
images to remove extra contours along with intelligent slice and frame selection are applied, followed
by calculation of the ESV, EDV, and EF. This analytics pipeline is implemented and runs on a distributed
computing environment with a GPU cluster at the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UCSD.
