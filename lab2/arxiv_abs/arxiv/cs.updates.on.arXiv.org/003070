The changes in user preferences can originate from substantial reasons, like personality shift,
or transient and circumstantial ones, like seasonal changes in item popularities. Disregarding
these temporal drifts in modelling user preferences can result in unhelpful recommendations.
Moreover, different temporal patterns can be associated with various preference domains, and
preference components and their combinations. These components comprise preferences over features,
preferences over feature values, conditional dependencies between features, socially-influenced
preferences, and bias. For example, in the movies domain, the user can change his rating behaviour
(bias shift), her preference for genre over language (feature preference shift), or start favouring
drama over comedy (feature value preference shift). In this paper, we first propose a novel latent
factor model to capture the domain-dependent component-specific temporal patterns in preferences.
The component-based approach followed in modelling the aspects of preferences and their temporal
effects enables us to arbitrarily switch components on and off. We evaluate the proposed method
on three popular recommendation datasets and show that it significantly outperforms the most accurate
state-of-the-art static models. The experiments also demonstrate the greater robustness and
stability of the proposed dynamic model in comparison with the most successful models to date. We
also analyse the temporal behaviour of different preference components and their combinations
and show that the dynamic behaviour of preference components is highly dependent on the preference
dataset and domain. Therefore, the results also highlight the importance of modelling temporal
effects but also underline the advantages of a component-based architecture that is better suited
to capture domain-specific balances in the contributions of the aspects.
