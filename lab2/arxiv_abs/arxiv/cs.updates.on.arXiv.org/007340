Objective Automatic artery/vein (A/V) segmentation from fundus images is required to track blood
vessel changes occurring with many pathologies including retinopathy and cardiovascular pathologies.
One of the clinical measures that quantifies vessel changes is the arterio-venous ratio (AVR) which
represents the ratio between artery and vein diameters. This measure significantly depends on
the accuracy of vessel segmentation and classification into arteries and veins. This paper proposes
a fast, novel method for semantic A/V segmentation combining deep learning and graph propagation.
Methods A convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to jointly segment and classify vessels
into arteries and veins. The initial CNN labeling is propagated through a graph representation
of the retinal vasculature, whose nodes are defined as the vessel branches and edges are weighted
by the cost of linking pairs of branches. To efficiently propagate the labels, the graph is simplified
into its minimum spanning tree. Results The method achieves an accuracy of 94.8% for vessels segmentation.
The A/V classification achieves a specificity of 92.9% with a sensitivity of 93.7% on the CT-DRIVE
database compared to the state-of-the-art-specificity and sensitivity, both of 91.7%. Conclusion
The results show that our method outperforms the leading previous works on a public dataset for A/V
classification and is by far the fastest. Significance The proposed global AVR calculated on the
whole fundus image using our automatic A/V segmentation method can better track vessel changes
associated to diabetic retinopathy than the standard local AVR calculated only around the optic
disc.
