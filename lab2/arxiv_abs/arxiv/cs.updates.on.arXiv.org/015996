Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have
great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAV-aided maritime
data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim
to minimize the UAV's energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication
time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV's flight trajectory subject to wind effect, which is
a non-convex problem and difficult to solve optimally. Existing techniques such as the successive
convex approximation (SCA) method provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate
data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on the trajectory initialization and has not explicitly
considered the wind effect, while the computational complexity and resulted trajectory complexity
both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical
trajectory design framework that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently subject to wind
effect. Specifically, the proposed UAV trajectory comprises multiple cyclical laps, each responsible
for collecting only a subset of data and thereby significantly reducing the computational/trajectory
complexity, which allows searching for better trajectory initialization that fits the buoys'
topology and the wind. Numerical results show that the proposed cyclical scheme outperforms the
benchmark one-flight-only scheme in general. Moreover, the optimized cyclical 8-shape trajectory
can proactively exploit the wind and achieve lower energy consumption compared with the case without
wind.
