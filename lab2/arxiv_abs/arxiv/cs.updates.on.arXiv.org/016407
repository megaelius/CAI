In fractured natural formations, the equations governing fluid flow and geomechanics are strongly
coupled. Hydrodynamical properties depend on the mechanical configuration, and they are therefore
difficult to accurately resolve using uncoupled methods. In recent years, significant research
has focused on discretization strategies for these coupled systems, particularly in the presence
of complicated fracture network geometries. In this work, we explore a finite-volume discretization
for the multiphase flow equations coupled with a finite-element scheme for the mechanical equations.
Fractures are treated as lower dimensional surfaces embedded in a background grid. Interactions
are captured using the Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) and the Embedded Finite Element
Method (EFEM) for the flow and the mechanics, respectively. This non-conforming approach significantly
alleviates meshing challenges. EDFM considers fractures as lower dimension finiten volumes which
exchange fluxes with the rock matrix cells. The EFEM method provides, instead, a local enrichment
of the finite-element space inside each matrix cell cut by a fracture element. Both the use of piecewise
constant and piecewise linear enrichments are investigated. They are also compared to an Extended
Finite Element (XFEM) approach. One key advantage of EFEM is the element-based nature of the enrichment,
which reduces the geometric complexity of the implementation and leads to linear systems with advantageous
properties. Synthetic numerical tests are presented to study the convergence and accuracy of the
proposed method. It is also applied to a realistic scenario, involving a heterogeneous reservoir
with a complex fracture distribution, to demonstrate its relevance for field applications.
