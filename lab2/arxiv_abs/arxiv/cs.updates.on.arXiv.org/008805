Managing large-scale systems often involves simultaneously solving thousands of unrelated stochastic
optimization problems, each with limited data. Intuition suggests one can decouple these unrelated
problems and solve them separately without loss of generality. We propose a novel data-pooling
algorithm called Shrunken-SAA that disproves this intuition. In particular, we prove that combining
data across problems can outperform decoupling, even when there is no a priori structure linking
the problems and data are drawn independently. Our approach does not require strong distributional
assumptions and applies to constrained, possibly non-convex, non-smooth optimization problems
such as vehicle-routing, economic lot-sizing or facility location. We compare and contrast our
results to a similar phenomenon in statistics (Stein's Phenomenon), highlighting unique features
that arise in the optimization setting that are not present in estimation. We further prove that
as the number of problems grows large, Shrunken-SAA learns if pooling can improve upon decoupling
and the optimal amount to pool, even if the average amount of data per problem is fixed and bounded.
Importantly, we highlight a simple intuition based on stability that highlights when} and why data-pooling
offers a benefit, elucidating this perhaps surprising phenomenon. This intuition further suggests
that data-pooling offers the most benefits when there are many problems, each of which has a small
amount of relevant data. Finally, we demonstrate the practical benefits of data-pooling using
real data from a chain of retail drug stores in the context of inventory management.
