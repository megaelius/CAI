The quality of powder layers, specifically their packing density and surface uniformity, is a critical
factor influencing the quality of components produced by powder bed metal additive manufacturing
(AM) processes, including selective laser melting, electron beam melting and binder jetting.
The present work employs a computational model to study the critical influence of powder cohesiveness
on the powder recoating process in AM. The model is based on the discrete element method (DEM) with
particle-to-particle and particle-to-wall interactions involving frictional contact, rolling
resistance and cohesive forces. Quantitative metrics, namely the spatial mean values and standard
deviations of the packing fraction and surface profile field, are defined in order to evaluate powder
layer quality. Based on these metrics, the size-dependent behavior of exemplary plasma-atomized
Ti-6Al-4V powders during the recoating process is studied. It is found that decreased particle
size / increased cohesiveness leads to considerably decreased powder layer quality in terms of
low, strongly varying packing fractions and highly non-uniform surface profiles. For relatively
fine-grained powders (mean particle diameter $17 \mu m$), it is shown that cohesive forces dominate
gravity forces by two orders of magnitude leading to low quality powder layers not suitable for subsequent
laser melting without additional layer / surface finishing steps. Besides particle-to-particle
adhesion, this contribution quantifies the influence of mechanical bulk powder material parameters,
nominal layer thickness, blade velocity as well as particle-to-wall adhesion. Finally, the implications
of the resulting powder layer characteristics on the subsequent melting process are discussed
and practical recommendations are given for the choice of powder recoating process parameters.
