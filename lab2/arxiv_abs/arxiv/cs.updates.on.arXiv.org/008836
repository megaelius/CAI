The conventional notion of community that favors a high ratio of internal edges to outbound edges
becomes invalid when each vertex participates in multiple communities. Such a behavior is commonplace
in social networks. The significant overlaps among communities make most existing community detection
algorithms ineffective. The lack of effective and efficient tools resulted in very few empirical
studies on large-scale detection and analyses of overlapping community structure in real social
networks. We developed recently a scalable and accurate method called the Partial Community Merger
Algorithm (PCMA) with linear complexity and demonstrated its effectiveness by analyzing two online
social networks, Sina Weibo and Friendster, with 79.4 and 65.6 million vertices, respectively.
Here, we report in-depth analyses of the 2.9 million communities detected by PCMA to uncover their
complex overlapping structure. Each community usually overlaps with a significant number of other
communities and has far more outbound edges than internal edges. Yet, the communities remain well
separated from each other. Most vertices in a community are multi-membership vertices, and they
can be at the core or the peripheral. Almost half of the entire network can be accounted for by an extremely
dense network of communities, with the communities being the vertices and the overlaps being the
edges. The empirical findings ask for rethinking the notion of community, especially the boundary
of a community. Realizing that it is how the edges are organized that matters, the f-core is suggested
as a suitable concept for overlapping community in social networks. The results shed new light on
the understanding of overlapping community.
