The ability to determine what parts of objects and surfaces people touch as they go about their daily
lives would be useful in understanding how the COVID-19 virus spreads. To determine whether a person
has touched an object or surface using visual data, images, or videos, is a hard problem. Computer
vision 3D reconstruction approaches project objects and the human body from the 2D image domain
to 3D and perform 3D space intersection directly. However, this solution would not meet the accuracy
requirement in applications due to projection error. Another standard approach is to train a neural
network to infer touch actions from the collected visual data. This strategy would require significant
amounts of training data to generalize over scale and viewpoint variations. A different approach
to this problem is to identify whether a person has touched a defined object. In this work, we show
that the solution to this problem can be straightforward. Specifically, we show that the contact
between an object and a static surface can be identified by projecting the object onto the static
surface through two different viewpoints and analyzing their 2D intersection. The object contacts
the surface when the projected points are close to each other; we call this cross view projection
consistency. Instead of doing 3D scene reconstruction or transfer learning from deep networks,
a mapping from the surface in the two camera views to the surface space is the only requirement. For
planar space, this mapping is the Homography transformation. This simple method can be easily adapted
to real-life applications. In this paper, we apply our method to do office occupancy detection for
studying the COVID-19 transmission pattern from an office desk in a meeting room using the contact
information.
