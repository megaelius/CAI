We present a new system S for handling uncertainty in a quantified modal logic (first-order modal
logic). The system is based on both probability theory and proof theory. The system is derived from
Chisholm's epistemology. We concretize Chisholm's system by grounding his undefined and primitive
(i.e. foundational) concept of reasonablenes in probability and proof theory. S can be useful in
systems that have to interact with humans and provide justifications for their uncertainty. As
a demonstration of the system, we apply the system to provide a solution to the lottery paradox. Another
advantage of the system is that it can be used to provide uncertainty values for counterfactual statements.
Counterfactuals are statements that an agent knows for sure are false. Among other cases, counterfactuals
are useful when systems have to explain their actions to users. Uncertainties for counterfactuals
fall out naturally from our system. Efficient reasoning in just simple first-order logic is a hard
problem. Resolution-based first-order reasoning systems have made significant progress over
the last several decades in building systems that have solved non-trivial tasks (even unsolved
conjectures in mathematics). We present a sketch of a novel algorithm for reasoning that extends
first-order resolution. Finally, while there have been many systems of uncertainty for propositional
logics, first-order logics and propositional modal logics, there has been very little work in building
systems of uncertainty for first-order modal logics. The work described below is in progress; and
once finished will address this lack.
