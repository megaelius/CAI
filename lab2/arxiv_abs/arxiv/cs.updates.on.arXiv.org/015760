Contact-tracing apps have potential benefits in helping health authorities to act swiftly to halt
the spread of COVID-19. However, their effectiveness is heavily dependent on their installation
rate, which may be influenced by people's perceptions of the utility of these apps and any potential
privacy risks due to the collection and releasing of sensitive user data (e.g., user identity and
location). In this paper, we present a survey study that examined people's willingness to install
six different contact-tracing apps after informing them of the risks and benefits of each design
option (with a U.S.-only sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk, $N=208$). The six app designs covered
two major design dimensions (centralized vs decentralized, basic contact tracing vs. also providing
hotspot information), grounded in our analysis of existing contact-tracing app proposals. Contrary
to assumptions of some prior work, we found that the majority of people in our sample preferred to
install apps that use a centralized server for contact tracing, as they are more willing to allow
a centralized authority to access the identity of app users rather than allowing tech-savvy users
to infer the identity of diagnosed users. We also found that the majority of our sample preferred
to install apps that share diagnosed users' recent locations in public places to show hotspots of
infection. Our results suggest that apps using a centralized architecture with strong security
protection to do basic contact tracing and providing users with other useful information such as
hotspots of infection in public places may achieve a high adoption rate in the U.S.
