Course assignment is a wide-spread problem in education and beyond. Often students have preferences
for bundles of course seats or course schedules over the week, which need to be considered. The problem
is a challenging distributed scheduling task requiring decision support. First-Come First-Served
(FCFS) is simple and the most widely used assignment rule in practice, but it leads to inefficient
outcomes and envy in the allocation. Recent theoretical results suggest alternatives with attractive
economic and computational properties. Bundled Probabilistic Serial (BPS) is a randomized mechanism
satisfying ordinal efficiency, envy-freeness, and weak strategy-proofness. This mechanism
also runs in polynomial time, which is important for the large problem instances in the field. We
report empirical results from a first implementation of BPS at the Technical University of Munich,
which allows us to provide important empirical metrics such as the size of the resulting matching,
the average rank, the profile, and the popularity of the assignments. These metrics were central
for the adoption of BPS. In particular, we compare these metrics to Random Serial Dictatorship with
bundle bids (BRSD). The BRSD mechanism is used to simulate the wide-spread First-Come First-Served
(FCFS) mechanism and it allows us to compare FCFS (BRSD) and BPS. While theoretically appealing,
preference elicitation is a major challenge when considering preferences over exponentially
many packages. We introduce tools to elicit preferences which reduce the number of parameters a
student needs to a manageable set. The approach together with BPS yields a computationally effective
tool to solve course assignment problems with thousands of students, and possibly provides an approach
for other distributed scheduling tasks in organizations.
