Communication through e-mails remains to be highly formalized, conventional and indispensable
method for the exchange of information over the Internet. An ever-increasing ratio and adversary
nature of spam e-mails have posed a great many challenges such as uneven class distribution, unequal
error cost, frequent change of content and personalized context-sensitive discrimination. In
this research, we propose a novel and distinctive approach to develop an incremental personalized
e-mail spam filter. The proposed work is described using three significant contributions. First,
we applied a novel term frequency difference and category ratio based feature selection function
TFDCR to select the most discriminating features irrespective of the number of samples in each class.
Second, an incremental learning model is used which enables the classifier to update the discriminant
function dynamically. Third, a heuristic function called selectionRankWeight is introduced
to upgrade the existing feature set that determines new features carrying strong discriminating
ability from an incoming set of e-mails. Three public e-mail datasets possessing different characteristics
are used to evaluate the filter performance. Experiments are conducted to compare the feature selection
efficiency of TFDCR and to observe the filter performance under both the batch and the incremental
learning mode. The results demonstrate the superiority of TFDCR as the most effective f eature selection
function. The incremental learning model incorporating dynamic feature update function overcomes
the problem of drifting concepts. The proposed filter validates its efficiency and feasibility
by substantially improving the classification accuracy and reducing the false positive error
of misclassifying legitimate e-mail as spam.
