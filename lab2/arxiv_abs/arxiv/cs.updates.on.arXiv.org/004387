Ever since the introduction of the secretary problem, the notion of selecting from a pool of candidates
before encountering every candidate has been of significant research interest. Motivated by the
real-world problem of hiring in a supply-constrained environment, e.g., the tech industry, we
extend the secretary problem setting to the case where the complete score of a candidate is revealed
only after a certain number of subsequent candidates (characterizing the delay in the partial score)
have been encountered. A novel aspect of our study is that of predicting each candidate's absolute
rank before all of the candidates have been revealed. A key contribution of our study involves the
innovative use of weighted bipartite matching to find the maximum likelihood assignment of candidates
to order-statistic distributions. We run extensive experiments on synthetically generated data
as well as real-world data obtained from a university course. On synthetic data, we observe an average
deviation of at most 1.6 ranks out of 25 from the true ranking, and on real-world partially observed
data we observe a median deviation of 5.5 ranks out of 50. On fully observed real-world data, the algorithm
successfully identifies the ten best students immediately upon their arrivals into the system,
demonstrating that the algorithm has wide applicability for online hiring problems. Furthermore,
we generalize the algorithm to match candidates to an arbitrary set of template distributions.
This is particularly useful when we are interested in a certain fraction of the candidates only (e.g.
the top 10% of all the candidates) and involves significantly fewer distributions than the order
statistics. For this case, we introduce a novel sparsified randomized matching algorithm with
a better complexity ($\mathcal O(N^2 \log N)$, where $N$ is the number of candidates) than the naive
algorithm ($\mathcal O(N^3)$).
