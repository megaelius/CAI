The problem of inpainting consists of filling missing or damaged regions in images and videos in
such a way that the filling pattern does not produce artifacts that deviate from the original data.
In addition to restoring the missing data, the inpainting technique can also be used to remove undesired
objects. In this work, we address the problem of inpainting on surfaces through a new method based
on dictionary learning and sparse coding. Our method learns the dictionary through the subdivision
of the mesh into patches and rebuilds the mesh via a method of reconstruction inspired by the Non-local
Means method on the computed sparse codes. One of the advantages of our method is that it is capable
of filling the missing regions and simultaneously removes noise and enhances important features
of the mesh. Moreover, the inpainting result is globally coherent as the representation based on
the dictionaries captures all the geometric information in the transformed domain. We present
two variations of the method: a direct one, in which the model is reconstructed and restored directly
from the representation in the transformed domain and a second one, adaptive, in which the missing
regions are recreated iteratively through the successive propagation of the sparse code computed
in the hole boundaries, which guides the local reconstructions. The second method produces better
results for large regions because the sparse codes of the patches are adapted according to the sparse
codes of the boundary patches. Finally, we present and analyze experimental results that demonstrate
the performance of our method compared to the literature.
