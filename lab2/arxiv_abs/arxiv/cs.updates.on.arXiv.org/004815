Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a measure of the importance of a node from the perspective of another
(we call these nodes the $\textit{target}$ and the $\textit{source}$, respectively). PPR has
been used in many applications, such as offering a Twitter user (the source) recommendations of
who to follow (targets deemed important by PPR); additionally, PPR has been used in graph-theoretic
problems such as community detection. However, computing PPR is infeasible for large networks
like Twitter, so efficient estimation algorithms are necessary. In this work, we analyze the relationship
between PPR estimation complexity and clustering. First, we devise algorithms to estimate PPR
for many source/target pairs. In particular, we propose an enhanced version of the existing single
pair estimator $\texttt{Bidirectional-PPR}$ that is more useful as a primitive for many pair estimation.
We then show that the common underlying graph can be leveraged to efficiently and jointly estimate
PPR for many pairs, rather than treating each pair separately using the primitive algorithm. Next,
we show the complexity of our joint estimation scheme relates closely to the degree of clustering
among the sources and targets at hand, indicating that estimating PPR for many pairs is easier when
clustering occurs. Finally, we consider estimating PPR when several machines are available for
parallel computation, devising a method that leverages our clustering findings, specifically
the quantities computed $\textit{in situ}$, to assign tasks to machines in a manner that reduces
computation time. This demonstrates that the relationship between complexity and clustering
has important consequences in a practical distributed setting.
