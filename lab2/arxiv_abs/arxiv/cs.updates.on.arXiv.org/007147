Natural evolution has produced a tremendous diversity of functional organisms. Many believe an
essential component of this process was the evolution of evolvability, whereby evolution speeds
up its ability to innovate by generating a more adaptive pool of offspring. One hypothesized mechanism
for evolvability is developmental canalization, wherein certain dimensions of variation become
more likely to be traversed and others are prevented from being explored (e.g. offspring tend to
have similarly sized legs, and mutations affect the length of both legs, not each leg individually).
While ubiquitous in nature, canalization almost never evolves in computational simulations of
evolution. Not only does that deprive us of in silico models in which to study the evolution of evolvability,
but it also raises the question of which conditions give rise to this form of evolvability. Answering
this question would shed light on why such evolvability emerged naturally and could accelerate
engineering efforts to harness evolution to solve important engineering challenges. In this paper
we reveal a unique system in which canalization did emerge in computational evolution. We document
that genomes entrench certain dimensions of variation that were frequently explored during their
evolutionary history. The genetic representation of these organisms also evolved to be highly
modular and hierarchical, and we show that these organizational properties correlate with increased
fitness. Interestingly, the type of computational evolutionary experiment that produced this
evolvability was very different from traditional digital evolution in that there was no objective,
suggesting that open-ended, divergent evolutionary processes may be necessary for the evolution
of evolvability.
