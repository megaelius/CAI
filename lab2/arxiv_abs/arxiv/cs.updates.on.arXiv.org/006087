We study a stochastic game framework with varying number of players, for modeling and analyzing
their computational investment strategies in distributed computing, for solving a problem such
as in blockchain mining. In particular, we propose a continuous time Markov chain model, where players
arrive and depart according to a stochastic process, and determine their investment strategies
based on the state of the system. The players obtain a certain reward for being the first to solve the
problem, while incur a certain cost based on the time and computational power invested in the attempt
to solve it. We consider that the players are Markovian, that is, they determine their strategies
which maximize their expected utilities, while ignoring past payoffs. We first study a scenario
where the rate of problem getting solved is proportional to the total computational power invested
by the players. We show that, in statewise Nash equilibrium, players with costs exceeding a certain
threshold do not invest, while players with costs less than this threshold invest maximum power.
Further, we show that Markov perfect equilibrium follows a similar threshold policy, and the players
do not need to have knowledge of the system state. We then consider a scenario where the rate of problem
getting solved is independent of the computational power invested by players. Here, we show that,
in statewise Nash equilibrium, only the players with cost parameters in a relatively low range,
invest. We also show that, in Markov perfect equilibrium, players invest proportionally to the
reward-cost ratio. Using simulations, we quantify the effects of arrival and departure rates on
players' expected utilities and provide insights.
