Understanding city-scale vehicular mobility and trip patterns is essential to addressing many
problems, from transportation and pollution to public safety, among others. Using spatio-temporal
analysis of vehicular mobility, promising solutions can be proposed to alleviate these major challenges,
utilizing shared mobility and crowd-sourcing. The rise of transportation networks (e.g. Uber,
Lyft), is a mere beginning to shared mobility. In this paper, we address problems of trip representation
and matching. Particularly, we study a real-world dataset of trips (from Cologne, Germany), from
spatial and temporal perspectives. Comparison of trajectories is desired for applications relying
on spatio-temporal phenomena. For that purpose, we present a novel combined spatio-temporal similarity
score, based on the weighted geometric mean (WGM) and conduct experiments on its applicability
and strengths. First, we use the score to find clusters of trips that were spatially and/or temporally
separable using spectral clustering. The score is then used in a real-time matching of trips for
Catch-a-Ride (CaR) and CarPooling (CP) scenarios. CaR and CP achieve $\approx40\%$ and $\approx25\%$
decrease in traveled distances respectively, at the cost of moving to pick-up and from drop-off
locations (i.e. drivers going on average $<700m$ out of their way on pick-up and drop-off for CP).
Additionally, a comparison with the metrics available in the literature is presented on CaR scenario.
We find that main advantages of WGM include the flexibility to favor time or space components, and
linearity of runtime complexity. Finally, we formulate an optimal free float Car-Sharing scenario
(e.g. scheduling a system of automated vehicles or taxis) resulting in an average of $\approx3.88$
trips serviced by a car in one hour.
