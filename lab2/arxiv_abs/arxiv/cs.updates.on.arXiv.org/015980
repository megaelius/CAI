A standard approach to solving the S$_N$ transport equations is to use source iteration with diffusion
synthetic acceleration (DSA). Although this approach is widely used and effective on many problems,
there remain some practical issues with DSA preconditioning, particularly on highly heterogeneous
domains. For large-scale parallel simulation, it is critical that both (i) preconditioned source
iteration converges rapidly, and (ii) the action of the DSA preconditioner can be applied using
fast, scalable solvers, such as algebraic multigrid (AMG). For heterogeneous domains, these two
interests can be at odds. In particular, there exist DSA diffusion discretizations that can be solved
rapidly using AMG, but they do not always yield robust/fast convergence of the larger source iteration.
Conversely, there exist robust DSA discretizations where source iteration converges rapidly
on difficult heterogeneous problems, but fast parallel solvers like AMG tend to struggle applying
the action of such operators. Moreover, very few current methods for the solution of deterministic
transport are compatible with voids. This paper develops a new heterogeneous DSA preconditioner
based on only preconditioning the optically thick subdomains. The resulting method proves robust
on a variety of heterogeneous transport problems, including a linearized hohlraum mesh related
to inertial confinement fusion. Moreover, the action of the preconditioner is easily computed
using O(1) AMG iterations, convergence of the transport iteration typically requires 2-5x less
iterations than current state-of-the-art "full DSA," and the proposed method is trivially compatible
with voids. On the hohlraum problem, rapid convergence is obtained by preconditioning less than
3% of the mesh elements with 5-10 AMG iterations.
