For sales and marketing organizations within large enterprises, identifying and understanding
new markets, customers and partners is a key challenge. Intel's Sales and Marketing Group (SMG)
faces similar challenges while growing in new markets and domains and evolving its existing business.
In today's complex technological and commercial landscape, there is need for intelligent automation
supporting a fine-grained understanding of businesses in order to help SMG sift through millions
of companies across many geographies and languages and identify relevant directions. We present
a system developed in our company that mines millions of public business web pages, and extracts
a faceted customer representation. We focus on two key customer aspects that are essential for finding
relevant opportunities: industry segments (ranging from broad verticals such as healthcare,
to more specific fields such as 'video analytics') and functional roles (e.g., 'manufacturer'
or 'retail'). To address the challenge of labeled data collection, we enrich our data with external
information gleaned from Wikipedia, and develop a semi-supervised multi-label, multi-lingual
deep learning model that parses customer website texts and classifies them into their respective
facets. Our system scans and indexes companies as part of a large-scale knowledge graph that currently
holds tens of millions of connected entities with thousands being fetched, enriched and connected
to the graph by the hour in real time, and also supports knowledge and insight discovery. In experiments
conducted in our company, we are able to significantly boost the performance of sales personnel
in the task of discovering new customers and commercial partnership opportunities.
