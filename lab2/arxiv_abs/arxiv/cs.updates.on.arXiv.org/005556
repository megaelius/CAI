Fine-grained classification of cervical cells into different abnormality levels is of great clinical
importance but remains very challenging. Contrary to traditional classification methods that
rely on hand-crafted or engineered features, convolution neural network (CNN) can classify cervical
cells based on automatically learned deep features. However, CNN in previous studies do not involve
cell morphological information, and it is unknown whether morphological features can be directly
modeled by CNN to classify cervical cells. This paper presents a CNN-based method that combines
cell image appearance with cell morphology for classification of cervical cells in Pap smear. The
training cervical cell dataset consists of adaptively re-sampled image patches coarsely centered
on the nuclei. Several CNN models (AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet and DenseNet) pre-trained on ImageNet
dataset were fine-tuned on the cervical dataset for comparison. The proposed method is evaluated
on the Herlev cervical dataset by five-fold cross-validation at patient level splitting. Results
show that by adding cytoplasm and nucleus masks as raw morphological information into appearance-based
CNN learning, higher classification accuracies can be achieved in general. Among the four CNN models,
GoogleNet fed with both morphological and appearance information obtains the highest classification
accuracies of 94.5% for 2-class classification task and 64.5% for 7-class classification task.
Our method demonstrates that combining cervical cell morphology with appearance information
can provide improved classification performance, which is clinically important for early diagnosis
of cervical dysplastic changes.
