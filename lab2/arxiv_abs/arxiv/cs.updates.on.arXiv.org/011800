New computing paradigms, modern feature-rich programming languages and off-the-shelf software
libraries enabled the development of new sophisticated malware families. Evidence of this phenomena
is the recent growth of fileless malware attacks. Fileless malware or memory resident malware is
an example of an Advanced Volatile Threat (AVT). In a fileless malware attack, the malware writes
itself directly onto the main memory (RAM) of the compromised device without leaving any trace on
the compromised device's file system. For this reason, fileless malware presents a difficult challenge
for traditional malware detection tools and in particular signature-based detection. Moreover,
fileless malware forensics and reverse engineering are nearly impossible using traditional methods.
The majority of fileless malware attacks in the wild take advantage of MS PowerShell, however, fileless
malware are not limited to MS PowerShell. In this paper, we designed and implemented a fileless malware
by taking advantage of new features in Javascript and HTML5. The proposed fileless malware could
infect any device that supports Javascript and HTML5. It serves as a proof-of-concept (PoC) to demonstrate
the threats of fileless malware in web applications. We used the proposed fileless malware to evaluate
existing methods and techniques for malware detection in web applications. We tested the proposed
fileless malware with several free and commercial malware detection tools that apply both static
and dynamic analysis. The proposed fileless malware bypassed all the anti-malware detection tools
included in our study. In our analysis, we discussed the limitations of existing approaches/tools
and suggested possible detection and mitigation techniques.
