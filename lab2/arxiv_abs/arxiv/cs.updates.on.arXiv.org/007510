Virtualization of network functions (as virtual routers, virtual firewalls, etc.) enables network
owners to efficiently respond to the increasing dynamicity of network services. Virtual Network
Functions (VNFs) are easy to deploy, update, monitor, and manage. The number of VNF instances, similar
to generic computing resources in cloud, can be easily scaled based on load. Hence, auto-scaling
(of resources without human intervention) has been receiving attention. Prior studies on auto-scaling
use measured network traffic load to dynamically react to traffic changes. In this study, we propose
a proactive Machine Learning (ML) based approach to perform auto-scaling of VNFs in response to
dynamic traffic changes. Our proposed ML classifier learns from past VNF scaling decisions and
seasonal/spatial behavior of network traffic load to generate scaling decisions ahead of time.
Compared to existing approaches for ML-based auto-scaling, our study explores how the properties
(e.g., start-up time) of underlying virtualization technology impacts Quality of Service (QoS)
and cost savings. We consider four different virtualization technologies: Xen and KVM, based on
hypervisor virtualization, and Docker and LXC, based on container virtualization. Our results
show promising accuracy of the ML classifier using real data collected from a private ISP. We report
in-depth analysis of the learning process (learning-curve analysis), feature ranking (feature
selection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), etc.), impact of different sets of features, training
time, and testing time. Our results show how the proposed methods improve QoS and reduce operational
cost for network owners. We also demonstrate a practical use-case example (Software-Defined Wide
Area Network (SD-WAN) with VNFs and backbone network) to show that our ML methods save significant
cost for network service leasers.
