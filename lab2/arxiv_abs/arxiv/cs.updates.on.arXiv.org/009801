The biological processes involved in a drug's mechanisms of action are oftentimes dynamic, complex
and difficult to discern. Time-course gene expression data is a rich source of information that
can be used to unravel these complex processes, identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and predict
the response to a drug. However, the majority of previous work has not fully utilized this temporal
dimension. In these studies, the gene expression data is either considered at one time-point (before
the administration of the drug) or two timepoints (before and after the administration of the drug).
This is clearly inadequate in modeling dynamic gene-drug interactions, especially for applications
such as long-term drug therapy. In this work, we present a novel REcursive Prediction (REP) framework
for drug response prediction by taking advantage of time-course gene expression data. Our goal
is to predict drug response values at every stage of a long-term treatment, given the expression
levels of genes collected in the previous time-points. To this end, REP employs a built-in recursive
structure that exploits the intrinsic time-course nature of the data and integrates past values
of drug responses for subsequent predictions. It also incorporates tensor completion that can
not only alleviate the impact of noise and missing data, but also predict unseen gene expression
levels (GELs). These advantages enable REP to estimate drug response at any stage of a given treatment
from some GELs measured in the beginning of the treatment. Extensive experiments on a dataset corresponding
to 53 multiple sclerosis patients treated with interferon are included to showcase the effectiveness
of REP.
