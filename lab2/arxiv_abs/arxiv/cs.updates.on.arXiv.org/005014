Accurate prediction of inter-residue contacts of a protein is important to calcu- lating its tertiary
structure. Analysis of co-evolutionary events among residues has been proved effective to inferring
inter-residue contacts. The Markov ran- dom field (MRF) technique, although being widely used
for contact prediction, suffers from the following dilemma: the actual likelihood function of
MRF is accurate but time-consuming to calculate, in contrast, approximations to the actual likelihood,
say pseudo-likelihood, are efficient to calculate but inaccu- rate. Thus, how to achieve both accuracy
and efficiency simultaneously remains a challenge. In this study, we present such an approach (called
clmDCA) for contact prediction. Unlike plmDCA using pseudo-likelihood, i.e., the product of conditional
probability of individual residues, our approach uses composite- likelihood, i.e., the product
of conditional probability of all residue pairs. Com- posite likelihood has been theoretically
proved as a better approximation to the actual likelihood function than pseudo-likelihood. Meanwhile,
composite likelihood is still efficient to maximize, thus ensuring the efficiency of clmDCA. We
present comprehensive experiments on popular benchmark datasets, includ- ing PSICOV dataset
and CASP-11 dataset, to show that: i) clmDCA alone outperforms the existing MRF-based approaches
in prediction accuracy. ii) When equipped with deep learning technique for refinement, the prediction
ac- curacy of clmDCA was further significantly improved, suggesting the suitability of clmDCA
for subsequent refinement procedure. We further present successful application of the predicted
contacts to accurately build tertiary structures for proteins in the PSICOV dataset. Accessibility:
