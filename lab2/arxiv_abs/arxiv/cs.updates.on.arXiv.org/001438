Wireless networked control systems (WNCS) are composed of spatially distributed sensors, actuators,
and con- trollers communicating through wireless networks instead of conventional point-to-point
wired connections. Due to their main benefits in the reduction of deployment and maintenance costs,
large flexibility and possible enhancement of safety, WNCS are becoming a fundamental infrastructure
technology for critical control systems in automotive electrical systems, avionics control systems,
building management systems, and industrial automation systems. The main challenge in WNCS is
to jointly design the communication and control systems considering their tight interaction to
improve the control performance and the network lifetime. In this survey, we make an exhaustive
review of the literature on wireless network design and optimization for WNCS. First, we discuss
what we call the critical interactive variables including sampling period, message delay, message
dropout, and network energy consumption. The mutual effects of these communication and control
variables motivate their joint tuning. We discuss the effect of controllable wireless network
parameters at all layers of the communication protocols on the probability distribution of these
interactive variables. We also review the current wireless network standardization for WNCS and
their corresponding methodology for adapting the network parameters. Moreover, we discuss the
analysis and design of control systems taking into account the effect of the interactive variables
on the control system performance. Finally, we present the state-of-the-art wireless network
design and optimization for WNCS, while highlighting the tradeoff between the achievable performance
and complexity of various approaches. We conclude the survey by highlighting major research issues
and identifying future research directions.
