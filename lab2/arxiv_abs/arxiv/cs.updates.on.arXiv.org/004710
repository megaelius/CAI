Recommender systems have been studied extensively due to their practical use in many real-world
scenarios. Despite this, generating effective recommendations with sparse user ratings remains
a challenge. Side information associated with items has been widely utilized to address rating
sparsity. Existing recommendation models that use side information are linear and, hence, have
restricted expressiveness. Deep learning has been used to capture non-linearities by learning
deep item representations from side information but as side information is high-dimensional existing
deep models tend to have large input dimensionality, which dominates their overall size. This makes
them difficult to train, especially with small numbers of inputs. Rather than learning item representations,
which is problematic with high-dimensional side information, in this paper, we propose to learn
feature representation through deep learning from side information. Learning feature representations,
on the other hand, ensures a sufficient number of inputs to train a deep network. To achieve this,
we propose to simultaneously recover user ratings and side information, by using a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE). Specifically, user ratings and side information are encoded and decoded collectively
through the same inference network and generation network. This is possible as both user ratings
and side information are data associated with items. To account for the heterogeneity of user rating
and side information, the final layer of the generation network follows different distributions
depending on the type of information. The proposed model is easy to implement and efficient to optimize
and is shown to outperform state-of-the-art top-$N$ recommendation methods that use side information.
