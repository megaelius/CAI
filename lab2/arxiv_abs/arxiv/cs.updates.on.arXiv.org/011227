Machine-learning-based data-driven applications have become ubiquitous, e.g., health-care
analysis and database system optimization. Big training data and large (deep) models are crucial
for good performance. Dropout has been widely used as an efficient regularization technique to
prevent large models from overfitting. However, many recent works show that dropout does not bring
much performance improvement for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a popular deep learning
model for data-driven applications. In this paper, we revisit the problem and investigate its failure.
We attribute the failure to the conflict between the conventional dropout and the batch normalization
operation after it. We propose to adjust the order of the dropout operations to address the conflict;
and further, other structurally more suited dropout variants are also examined and introduced
for more efficient and effective regularization for CNNs. These dropout variants can be easily
integrated into the building blocks of CNNs implemented by existing deep learning libraries, e.g.,
Apache Singa, to provide effective regularization for CNNs. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets CIFAR, SVHN and ImageNet are conducted to compare the existing building blocks and the
proposed building blocks with the proposed customizable dropout methods. The results confirm
the superiority of our building blocks due to the regularization and implicit model ensemble effect
of dropout. In particular, we improve over state-of-the-art CNNs with significantly better performance
of 3.17%, 16.15%, 1.44%, 21.68% error rate on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and ImageNet respectively.
