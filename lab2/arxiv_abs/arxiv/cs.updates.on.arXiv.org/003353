Cybercriminals abuse Online Social Networks (OSNs) to lure victims into a variety of spam. Among
different spam types, a less explored area is OSN abuse that leverages the telephony channel to defraud
users. Phone numbers are advertized via OSNs, and users are tricked into calling these numbers.
To expand the reach of such scam / spam campaigns, phone numbers are advertised across multiple platforms
like Facebook, Twitter, GooglePlus, Flickr, and YouTube. In this paper, we present the first data-driven
characterization of cross-platform campaigns that use multiple OSN platforms to reach their victims
and use phone numbers for monetization. We collect 23M posts containing 1.8M unique phone numbers
from Twitter, Facebook, GooglePlus, Youtube, and Flickr over a period of six months. Clustering
these posts helps us identify 202 campaigns operating across the globe with Indonesia, United States,
India, and United Arab Emirates being the most prominent originators. We find that even though Indonesian
campaigns generate highest volume (3.2M posts), only 1.6% of the accounts propagating Indonesian
campaigns have been suspended so far. By examining campaigns running across multiple OSNs, we discover
that Twitter detects and suspends 93% more accounts than Facebook. Therefore, sharing intelligence
about abuse-related user accounts across OSNs can aid in spam detection. According to our dataset,
around 35K victims and 8.8M USD could have been saved if intelligence was shared across the OSNs.
By analyzing phone number based spam campaigns running on OSNs, we highlight the unexplored variety
of phone-based attacks surfacing on OSNs.
