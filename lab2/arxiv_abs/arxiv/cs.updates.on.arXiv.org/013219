In the past few years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have dramatically advanced our ability
to represent and parameterize high-dimensional, non-linear image manifolds. As a result, they
have been widely adopted across a variety of applications, ranging from challenging inverse problems
like image completion, to problems such as anomaly detection and adversarial defense. A recurring
theme in many of these applications is the notion of projecting an image observation onto the manifold
that is inferred by the generator. In this context, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) has been the
most popular approach, which essentially optimizes for a latent vector that minimizes the discrepancy
between a generated image and the given observation. However, PGD is a brittle optimization technique
that fails to identify the right projection (or latent vector) when the observation is corrupted,
or perturbed even by a small amount. Such corruptions are common in the real world, for example images
in the wild come with unknown crops, rotations, missing pixels, or other kinds of non-linear distributional
shifts which break current encoding methods, rendering downstream applications unusable. To
address this, we propose corruption mimicking -- a new robust projection technique, that utilizes
a surrogate network to approximate the unknown corruption directly at test time, without the need
for additional supervision or data augmentation. The proposed method is significantly more robust
than PGD and other competing methods under a wide variety of corruptions, thereby enabling a more
effective use of GANs in real-world applications. More importantly, we show that our approach produces
state-of-the-art performance in several GAN-based applications -- anomaly detection, domain
adaptation, and adversarial defense, that benefit from an accurate projection.
