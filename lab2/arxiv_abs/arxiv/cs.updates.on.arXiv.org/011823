Nonlinear system identification is important with a wide range of applications. The typical approaches
for nonlinear system identification include Volterra series models, nonlinear autoregressive
with exogenous inputs models, block-structured models, state-space models and neural network
models. Among them, neural networks (NN) is an important black-box method thanks to its universal
approximation capability and less dependency on prior information. However, there are several
challenges associated with NN. The first one lies in the design of a proper neural network structure.
A relatively simple network cannot approximate the feature of the system, while a complex model
may lead to overfitting. The second lies in the availability of data for some nonlinear systems.
For some systems, it is difficult to collect enough data to train a neural network. This raises the
challenge that how to train a neural network for system identification with a small dataset. In addition,
if the uncertainty of the NN parameter could be obtained, it would be also beneficial for further
analysis. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian deep learning approach to address the above
problems. Specifically, the Bayesian method can reinforce the regularization on neural networks
by introducing introduced sparsity-inducing priors. The Bayesian method can also compute the
uncertainty of the NN parameter. An efficient iterative re-weighted algorithm is presented in
this paper. We also test the capacity of our method to identify the system on various ratios of the
original dataset. The one-step-ahead prediction experiment on Cascaded Tank System shows the
effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we test our algorithm with more challenging simulation
experiment on this benchmark, which also outperforms other methods.
