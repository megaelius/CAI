In recent years, mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) have met an increasing commercial
success and have become a fundamental element of the everyday life for billions of people all around
the world. Mobile devices are used not only for traditional communication activities (e.g., voice
calls and messages) but also for more advanced tasks made possible by an enormous amount of multi-purpose
applications (e.g., finance, gaming, and shopping). As a result, those devices generate a significant
network traffic (a consistent part of the overall Internet traffic). For this reason, the research
community has been investigating security and privacy issues that are related to the network traffic
generated by mobile devices, which could be analyzed to obtain information useful for a variety
of goals (ranging from device security and network optimization, to fine-grained user profiling).
In this paper, we review the works that contributed to the state of the art of network traffic analysis
targeting mobile devices. In particular, we present a systematic classification of the works in
the literature according to three criteria: (i) the goal of the analysis; (ii) the point where the
network traffic is captured; and (iii) the targeted mobile platforms. In this survey, we consider
points of capturing such as Wi-Fi Access Points, software simulation, and inside real mobile devices
or emulators. For the surveyed works, we review and compare analysis techniques, validation methods,
and achieved results. We also discuss possible countermeasures, challenges and possible directions
for future research on mobile traffic analysis and other emerging domains (e.g., Internet of Things).
We believe our survey will be a reference work for researchers and practitioners in this research
field.
