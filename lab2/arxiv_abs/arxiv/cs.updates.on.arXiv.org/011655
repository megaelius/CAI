The screening of baggage using X-ray scanners is now routine in aviation security with automatic
threat detection approaches, based on 3D X-ray computed tomography (CT) images, known as Automatic
Threat Recognition (ATR) within the aviation security industry. These current strategies use
pre-defined threat material signatures in contrast to adaptability towards new and emerging threat
signatures. To address this issue, the concept of adaptive automatic threat recognition (AATR)
was proposed in previous work. In this paper, we present a solution to AATR based on such X-ray CT baggage
scan imagery. This aims to address the issues of rapidly evolving threat signatures within the screening
requirements. Ideally, the detection algorithms deployed within the security scanners should
be readily adaptable to different situations with varying requirements of threat characteristics
(e.g., threat material, physical properties of objects). We tackle this issue using a novel adaptive
machine learning methodology with our solution consisting of a multi-scale 3D CT image segmentation
algorithm, a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier for object material recognition
and a strategy to enable the adaptability of our approach. Experiments are conducted on both open
and sequestered 3D CT baggage image datasets specifically collected for the AATR study. Our proposed
approach performs well on both recognition and adaptation. Overall our approach can achieve the
probability of detection around 90% with a probability of false alarm below 20%. Our AATR shows the
capabilities of adapting to varying types of materials, even the unknown materials which are not
available in the training data, adapting to varying required probability of detection and adapting
to varying scales of the threat object.
