Systematic scientometric reviews, empowered by scientometric and visual analytic techniques,
offer opportunities to improve the timeliness, accessibility, and reproducibility of conventional
systematic reviews. While increasingly accessible science mapping tools enable end users to visualize
the structure and dynamics of a research field, a common bottleneck in the current practice is the
construction of a collection of scholarly publications as the input of the subsequent scientometric
analysis and visualization. End users often have to face a dilemma in the preparation process: the
more they know about a knowledge domain, the easier it is for them to find the relevant data to meet
their needs adequately; the little they know, the harder the problem is. What can we do to avoid missing
something valuable but beyond our initial description? In this article, we introduce a flexible
and generic methodology, cascading citation expansion, to increase the quality of constructing
a bibliographic dataset for systematic reviews. Furthermore, the methodology simplifies the
conceptualization of globalism and localism in science mapping and unifies them on a consistent
and continuous spectrum. We demonstrate an application of the methodology to the research of literature-based
discovery and compare five datasets constructed based on three use scenarios, namely a conventional
keyword-based search (one dataset), an expansion process starting with a groundbreaking article
of the knowledge domain (two datasets), and an expansion process starting with a recently published
review article by a prominent expert in the domain (two datasets). The unique coverage of each of
the datasets is inspected through network visualization overlays with reference to other datasets
in a broad and integrated context.
