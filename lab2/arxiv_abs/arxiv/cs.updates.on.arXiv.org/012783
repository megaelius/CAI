In the area of computer vision, deep learning techniques have recently been used to predict whether
urban scenes are likely to be considered beautiful: it turns out that these techniques are able to
make accurate predictions. Yet they fall short when it comes to generating actionable insights
for urban design. To support urban interventions, one needs to go beyond predicting beauty, and
tackle the challenge of recreating beauty. Unfortunately, deep learning techniques have not been
designed with that challenge in mind. Given their "black-box nature", these models cannot be directly
used to explain why a particular urban scene is deemed to be beautiful. To partly fix that, we propose
a deep learning framework called Facelift, that is able to both beautify existing urban scenes (Google
Street views) and explain which urban elements make those transformed scenes beautiful. To quantitatively
evaluate our framework, we cannot resort to any existing metric (as the research problem at hand
has never been tackled before) and need to formulate new ones. These new metrics should ideally capture
the presence/absence of elements that make urban spaces great. Upon a review of the urban planning
literature, we identify five main metrics: walkability, green spaces, openness, landmarks and
visual complexity. We find that, across all the five metrics, the beautified scenes meet the expectations
set by the literature on what great spaces tend to be made of. This result is further confirmed by a
20-participant expert survey in which FaceLift have been found to be effective in promoting citizen
participation. All this suggests that, in the future, as our framework's components are further
researched and become better and more sophisticated, it is not hard to imagine technologies that
will be able to accurately and efficiently support architects and planners in the design of spaces
we intuitively love.
