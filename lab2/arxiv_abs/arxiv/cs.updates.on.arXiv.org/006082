Ensemble control deals with the problem of using a finite number of control inputs to simultaneously
steer a large population (in the limit, a continuum) of control systems. Dual to the ensemble control
problem, ensemble estimation deals with the problem of using a finite number of measurement outputs
to estimate the initial condition of every individual system in the ensemble. We introduce in the
paper an innovative class of ensemble systems, termed distinguished ensemble systems, and establish
sufficient conditions for controllability and observability of such systems. Every distinguished
ensemble system has two key components, namely distinguished control vector fields and codistinguished
observation functions. Roughly speaking, a set of vector fields is distinguished if it is closed
(up to scaling) under Lie bracket, and moreover, every vector field in the set can be obtained by a
Lie bracket of two vector fields in the same set. Similarly, a set of functions is codistinguished
to a set of vector fields if the Lie derivatives of the functions along the given vector fields yield
(up to scaling) the same set of functions. We demonstrate in the paper that the structure of a distinguished
ensemble system can significantly simplify the analysis of ensemble controllability and observability,
and can be used as a principle for ensemble system design. We further address in the paper the existence
of a distinguished ensemble system for a given manifold. Specifically, we show that every connected,
semi-simple Lie group admits a set of distinguished vector fields, together with a set of codistinguished
functions. The proof is constructive, leveraging the structure theory of semi-simple real Lie
algebras and representation theory. Examples will be provided along the presentation illustrating
key definitions and main results.
