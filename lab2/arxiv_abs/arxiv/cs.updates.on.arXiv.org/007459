Microscopic traffic models describe how cars interact with their neighbors in an uninterrupted
traffic flow and are frequently used for reference in advanced vehicle control design. In this paper,
we propose a novel mechanical system inspired microscopic traffic model using a mass-spring-damper-clutch
system. This model naturally captures the ego vehicle's resistance to large relative speed and
deviation from a (driver and speed dependent) desired relative distance when following the lead
vehicle. Comparing to existing car following (CF) models, this model offers physically interpretable
insights on the underlying CF dynamics, and is able to characterize the impact of the ego vehicle
on the lead vehicle, which is neglected in existing CF models. Thanks to the nonlinear wave propagation
analysis techniques for mechanical systems, the proposed model therefore has great scalability
so that multiple mass-spring-damper-clutch system can be chained to study the macroscopic traffic
flow. We investigate the stability of the proposed model on the system parameters and the time delay
using spectral element method. We also develop a parallel recursive least square with inverse QR
decomposition (PRLS-IQR) algorithm to identify the model parameters online. These real-time
estimated parameters can be used to predict the driving trajectory that can be incorporated in advanced
vehicle longitudinal control systems for improved safety and fuel efficiency. The PRLS-IQR is
computationally efficient and numerically stable so it is suitable for online implementation.
The traffic model and the parameter identification algorithm are validated on both simulations
and naturalistic driving data from multiple drivers. Promising performance is demonstrated.
