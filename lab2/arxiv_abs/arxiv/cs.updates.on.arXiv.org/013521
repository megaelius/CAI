We consider a basic resource allocation game, where the players' strategy spaces are subsets of
$R^m$ and cost/utility functions are parameterized by some common vector $u\in R^m$ and, otherwise,
only depend on the own strategy choice. A strategy of a player can be interpreted as a vector of resource
consumption and a joint strategy profile naturally leads to an aggregate consumption vector. Resources
can be priced, that is, the game is augmented by a price vector $\lambda\in R^m_+$ and players have
quasi-linear overall costs/utilities meaning that in addition to the original costs/utilities,
a player needs to pay the corresponding price per consumed unit. We investigate the following question:
for which aggregated consumption vectors $u$ can we find prices $\lambda$ that induce an equilibrium
realizing the targeted consumption profile? For answering this question, we revisit a well-known
duality-based framework and derive several characterizations of the existence of such $u$ and
$\lambda$ using convexification techniques. We show that for finite strategy spaces or certain
concave games, the equilibrium existence problem reduces to solving a well-structured LP. We then
consider a class of monotone aggregative games having the property that the cost/utility functions
of players may depend on the induced load of a strategy profile. For this class, we show a sufficient
condition of enforceability based on the previous characterizations. We demonstrate that this
framework can help to unify parts of four largely independent streams in the literature: tolls in
transportation systems, Walrasian market equilibria, trading networks and congestion control
in communication networks.
