Most of the existing P2P content distribution schemes implement a random or rarest piece first dissemination
procedure to avoid duplicate transmission of the same pieces of data and rare pieces of data occurring
in the network. This problem can be solved using peer-to-peer content distribution based on network
coding scheme. Network coding scheme uses random linear combination of coded pieces. Hence the
above stated problem can be solved ease and simple. Our proposed mechanism uses network coding mechanism
in which several contents of same message is grouped into different group and coding operation is
performed only within the same group. The interested peers are also divided into several groups
with each group have the responsibility to spread one set of contents of some message. The coding
system is designed to assure the property that any subset of the messages can be utilized to decode
the original content as long as the size of the subset is suitably large. To meet this condition, dynamic
smart network coding scheme is defined which assures the preferred property, then peers are connected
in the same group to send the corresponding message, and connect peers in different groups to disseminate
messages for carrying out decoding operation. Moreover, the proposed system can be readily expanded
to support topology change to get better system performance further in terms of reliability, link
stress and throughput. The simulation results prove that the proposed system can attain 20 to 25%
higher throughput than existing systems, it also further attains good reliability, link failure
and robustness to peer churn.
