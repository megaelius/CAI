The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support long-term care is gaining
attention, also in the light of population ageing. Known in Scandinavian countries under the term
of welfare technology, it aims to increase the quality of life and independence of people with physical,
psychological or social impairments. In Germany, a new form of psychiatric home treatment, inpatient
equivalent treatment (IET), is offered since 2018. It should allow service users with severe mental
health issues to stay in their familiar environment during crisis, while being treated in the same
complexity and flexibility like in an inpatient unit. However, this change in delivering healthcare
services leads to sociotechnical challenges, such as coordination of work, integration into existing
healthcare workflows and ensuring continuity of care. Hence, the objective of this exploratory
study is to examine how information and communication technologies (ICT) interact in the new setting
and how this process can be improved. Further, we also ask how service users can participate in designing
home treatment services. Methodologically, this study follows a qualitative research approach.
Different methods including participant observation, interviews and focus groups were conducted
to answer the research questions. Data was collected during a field visit at the psychiatric department
of a German clinic in summer 2019. Field notes and interviews were analyzed using the R package for
qualitative data analysis RQDA. A list of socio-technical challenges and opportunities related
to IET were identified. New forms of communication, gaps in documentation practices and continuity
of care are seen to be highly relevant for designing and implementing home treatment services in
psychiatric care. We also discuss how service users and health professionals can take pro-active
part in designing these services.
