Accurate delineation of the intraprostatic gross tumour volume (GTV) is a prerequisite for treatment
approaches in patients with primary prostate cancer (PCa). Prostate-specific membrane antigen
positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) may outperform MRI in GTV detection. However, visual
GTV delineation underlies interobserver heterogeneity and is time consuming. The aim of this study
was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated segmentation of intraprostatic
tumour (GTV-CNN) in PSMA-PET. Methods: The CNN (3D U-Net) was trained on [68Ga]PSMA-PET images
of 152 patients from two different institutions and the training labels were generated manually
using a validated technique. The CNN was tested on two independent internal (cohort 1: [68Ga]PSMA-PET,
n=18 and cohort 2: [18F]PSMA-PET, n=19) and one external (cohort 3: [68Ga]PSMA-PET, n=20) test-datasets.
Accordance between manual contours and GTV-CNN was assessed with Dice-S{\o}rensen coefficient
(DSC). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the two internal test-datasets by using
whole-mount histology. Results: Median DSCs for cohorts 1-3 were 0.84 (range: 0.32-0.95), 0.81
(range: 0.28-0.93) and 0.83 (range: 0.32-0.93), respectively. Sensitivities and specificities
for GTV-CNN were comparable with manual expert contours: 0.98 and 0.76 (cohort 1) and 1 and 0.57 (cohort
2), respectively. Computation time was around 6 seconds for a standard dataset. Conclusion: The
application of a CNN for automated contouring of intraprostatic GTV in [68Ga]PSMA- and [18F]PSMA-PET
images resulted in a high concordance with expert contours and in high sensitivities and specificities
in comparison with histology reference. This robust, accurate and fast technique may be implemented
for treatment concepts in primary PCa. The trained model and the study's source code are available
in an open source repository.
