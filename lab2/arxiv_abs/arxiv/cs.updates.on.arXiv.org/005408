Graph similarity search is among the most important graph-based applications, e.g. finding the
chemical compounds that are most similar to a query compound. Graph similarity/distance computation,
such as Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), is the core operation of graph
similarity search and many other applications, but very costly to compute in practice. Inspired
by the recent success of neural network approaches to several graph applications, such as node or
graph classification, we propose a novel neural network based approach to address this classic
yet challenging graph problem, aiming to alleviate the computational burden while preserving
a good performance. The proposed approach, called SimGNN, combines two strategies. First, we design
a learnable embedding function that maps every graph into an embedding vector, which provides a
global summary of a graph. A novel attention mechanism is proposed to emphasize the important nodes
with respect to a specific similarity metric. Second, we design a pairwise node comparison method
to supplement the graph-level embeddings with fine-grained node-level information. Our model
can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, achieves better generalization on unseen graphs, and in
the worst case runs in quadratic time with respect to the number of nodes in two graphs. Taking GED
computation as an example, experimental results on three real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of our approach. Specifically, our model achieves smaller error rate and great time
reduction compared against a series of baselines, including several approximation algorithms
on GED computation, and many existing graph neural network based models. Our study suggests SimGNN
provides a new direction for future research on graph similarity computation and graph similarity
search.
