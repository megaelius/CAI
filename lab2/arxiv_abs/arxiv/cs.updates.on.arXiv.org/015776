Image compression is a widely used technique to reduce the spatial redundancy in images. Recently,
learning based image compression has achieved significant progress by using the powerful representation
ability from neural networks. However, the current state-of-the-art learning based image compression
methods suffer from the huge computational cost, which limits their capacity for practical applications.
In this paper, we propose a unified framework called Efficient Deep Image Compression (EDIC) based
on three new technologies, including a channel attention module, a Gaussian mixture model and a
decoder-side enhancement module. Specifically, we design an auto-encoder style network for learning
based image compression. To improve the coding efficiency, we exploit the channel relationship
between latent representations by using the channel attention module. Besides, the Gaussian mixture
model is introduced for the entropy model and improves the accuracy for bitrate estimation. Furthermore,
we introduce the decoder-side enhancement module to further improve image compression performance.
Our EDIC method can also be readily incorporated with the Deep Video Compression (DVC) framework
to further improve the video compression performance. Simultaneously, our EDIC method boosts
the coding performance significantly while bringing slightly increased computational cost.
More importantly, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the
current state-of-the-art image compression methods and is up to more than 150 times faster in terms
of decoding speed when compared with Minnen's method. The proposed framework also successfully
improves the performance of the recent deep video compression system DVC. Our code will be released
