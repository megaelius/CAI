An $(n,k,l)$ MDS code of length $n$, dimension $k$, and sub-packetization $l$ over a finite field
$F$ is a set of $n$ symbol vectors of length $l$ over $F$ with the property that any $k$ vectors can recover
the entire data of $kl$ symbols. When a node fails, we can recover it by downloading symbols from the
surviving nodes, and the total number of symbols downloaded in the worst case is the repair bandwidth
of the code. By the cut-set bound, the repair bandwidth of an $(n,k,l)$ MDS code is at least $(n-1)l/(n-k)$.
There are several constructions of $(n,k,l)$ MDS codes whose repair bandwidths meet or asymptotically
meet the cut-set bound. Letting $r=n-k$ denote the number of parities, Ye and Barg constructed $(n,k,r^{n})$
Reed--Solomon codes that asymptotically meet the cut-set bound. Ye and Barg also constructed optimal
bandwidth and optimal update $(n,k,r^{n})$ MDS codes. A key idea in these constructions is to expand
integers in base $r$. We show in this paper that, when $r$ is an integral power, we can significantly
reduce the sub-packetization of Ye's and Barg's constructions while achieving asymptotically
optimal repair bandwidth. As an example, when $r = 2^m$, we achieve the sub-packetization of $2^{m+n-1}$,
which improves upon the sub-packetization of $2^{mn}$ in Ye's and Barg's constructions. In general,
when $r = s^m$ for an integer $s \ge 2$, our codes have sub-packetization $l = s^{m+n-1} = rs^{n-1}$.
Specifically, when $r=s^{m}$, we obtain an $(n,k,s^{m+n-1})$ Reed--Solomon code and an optimal
update $(n,k,s^{m+n-1})$ MDS code, which both have asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth.
In order to obtain these results, we extend and generalize the $r$-ary expansion idea in Ye's and
Barg's constructions.
