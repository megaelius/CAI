Recent progress on intelligent fault diagnosis has greatly depended on the deep learning and plenty
of labeled data. However, the machine often operates with various working conditions or the target
task has different distributions with the collected data used for training (we called the domain
shift problem). This leads to the deep transfer learning based (DTL-based) intelligent fault diagnosis
which attempts to remit this domain shift problem. Besides, the newly collected testing data are
usually unlabeled, which results in the subclass DTL-based methods called unsupervised deep transfer
learning based (UDTL-based) intelligent fault diagnosis. Although it has achieved huge development
in the field of fault diagnosis, a standard and open source code framework and a comparative study
for UDTL-based intelligent fault diagnosis are not yet established. In this paper, commonly used
UDTL-based algorithms in intelligent fault diagnosis are integrated into a unified testing framework
and the framework is tested on five datasets. Extensive experiments are performed to provide a systematically
comparative analysis and the benchmark accuracy for more comparable and meaningful further studies.
To emphasize the importance and reproducibility of UDTL-based intelligent fault diagnosis, the
testing framework with source codes will be released to the research community to facilitate future
research. Finally, comparative analysis of results also reveals some open and essential issues
in DTL for intelligent fault diagnosis which are rarely studied including transferability of features,
influence of backbones, negative transfer, and physical priors. In summary, the released framework
and comparative study can serve as an extended interface and the benchmark results to carry out new
studies on UDTL-based intelligent fault diagnosis. The code framework is available at https://github.com/ZhaoZhibin/UDTL.
