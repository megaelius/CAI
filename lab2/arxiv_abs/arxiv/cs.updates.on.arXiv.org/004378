Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is a common procedure for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF).
A successful isolation produces a continuous lesion (scar) completely encircling the veins that
stops activation waves from propagating to the atrial body. Unfortunately, the encircling lesion
is often incomplete, becoming a combination of scar and gaps of healthy tissue. These gaps are potential
causes of AF recurrence, which requires a redo of the isolation procedure. Late-gadolinium enhanced
cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) is a non-invasive method that may also be used to detect gaps,
but it is currently a time-consuming process, prone to high inter-observer variability. In this
paper, we present a method to semi-automatically identify and quantify ablation gaps. Gap quantification
is performed through minimum path search in a graph where every node is a scar patch and the edges are
the geodesic distances between patches. We propose the Relative Gap Measure (RGM) to estimate the
percentage of gap around a vein, which is defined as the ratio of the overall gap length and the total
length of the path that encircles the vein. Additionally, an advanced version of the RGM has been
developed to integrate gap quantification estimates from different scar segmentation techniques
into a single figure-of-merit. Population-based statistical and regional analysis of gap distribution
was performed using a standardised parcellation of the left atrium. We have evaluated our method
on synthetic and clinical data from 50 AF patients who underwent PVI with radiofrequency ablation.
The population-based analysis concluded that the left superior PV is more prone to lesion gaps while
the left inferior PV tends to have less gaps (p<0.05 in both cases), in the processed data. This type
of information can be very useful for the optimization and objective assessment of PVI interventions.
