An increasing number of human activities are studied using data produced by individuals' ICT devices.
In particular, when ICT data contain spatial information, they represent an invaluable source
for analyzing urban dynamics. However, there have been relatively few contributions investigating
the robustness of this type of results against fluctuations of data characteristics. Here, we present
a stability analysis of higher-level information extracted from mobile phone data passively produced
during an entire year by 9 million individuals in Senegal. We focus on two information-retrieval
tasks: (a) the identification of land use in the region of Dakar from the temporal rhythms of the communication
activity; (b) the identification of home and work locations of anonymized individuals, which enable
to construct Origin-Destination (OD) matrices of commuting flows. Our analysis reveal that the
uncertainty of results highly depends on the sample size, the scale and the period of the year at which
the data were gathered. Nevertheless, the spatial distributions of land use computed for different
samples are remarkably robust: on average, we observe more than 75% of shared surface area between
the different spatial partitions when considering activity of at least 100,000 users whatever
the scale. The OD matrix is less stable and depends on the scale with a share of at least 75% of commuters
in common when considering all types of flows constructed from the home-work locations of 100,000
users. For both tasks, better results can be obtained at larger levels of aggregation or by considering
more users. These results confirm that ICT data are very useful sources for the spatial analysis
of urban systems, but that their reliability should in general be tested more thoroughly.
