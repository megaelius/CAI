Detailed whole brain segmentation is an essential quantitative technique, which provides a non-invasive
way of measuring brain regions from a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, deep
convolution neural network (CNN) has been applied to whole brain segmentation. However, restricted
by current GPU memory, 2D based methods, downsampling based 3D CNN methods, and patch-based high-resolution
3D CNN methods have been the de facto standard solutions. 3D patch-based high resolution methods
typically yield superior performance among CNN approaches on detailed whole brain segmentation
(>100 labels), however, whose performance are still commonly inferior compared with multi-atlas
segmentation methods (MAS) due to the following challenges: (1) a single network is typically used
to learn both spatial and contextual information for the patches, (2) limited manually traced whole
brain volumes are available (typically less than 50) for training a network. In this work, we propose
the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method to distribute multiple independent
3D fully convolutional networks (FCN) for high-resolution whole brain segmentation. To address
the first challenge, multiple spatially distributed networks were used in the SLANT method, in
which each network learned contextual information for a fixed spatial location. To address the
second challenge, auxiliary labels on 5111 initially unlabeled scans were created by multi-atlas
segmentation for training. Since the method integrated multiple traditional medical image processing
methods with deep learning, we developed a containerized pipeline to deploy the end-to-end solution.
From the results, the proposed method achieved superior performance compared with multi-atlas
segmentation methods, while reducing the computational time from >30 hours to 15 minutes (https://github.com/MASILab/SLANTbrainSeg).
