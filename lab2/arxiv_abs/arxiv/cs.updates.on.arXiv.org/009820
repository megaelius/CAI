Futurists have predicted that new technologies, embedded with artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML), will lead to substantial job loss in many sectors disrupting many aspects
of healthcare. Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden,
stigma, and shortage of care providers. Using Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified
and licensed physicians, we measured the opinions of psychiatrists about the likelihood that future
autonomous technology (referred to as AI/ML) would be able to fully replace the average psychiatrist
in performing 10 key tasks (e.g. mental status exam, suicidality assessment, treatment planning)
carried out in mental health care. Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries.
Only 3.8% of respondents felt that AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic
care. Documenting (e.g. updating medical records) and synthesizing information to reach a diagnosis
were the two tasks where a majority predicted that future AI/ML would replace human doctors. About
1 in 2 doctors believed their jobs could be changed substantially by future AI/ML. However, female
and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the possible benefits of AI would outweigh potential
risks, versus their male and global counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first global survey
to seek the opinions of physicians on the impact of autonomous AI/ML on the future of psychiatry.
Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about intelligent technologies
which may better help us integrate such tools and reskill doctors, as needed, to enhance mental health
care.
