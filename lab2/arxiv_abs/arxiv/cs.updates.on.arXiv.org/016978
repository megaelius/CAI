Due to the proliferation of smart devices and emerging applications, many next-generation technologies
have been paid for the development of wireless networks. Even though commercial 5G has just been
widely deployed in some countries, there have been initial efforts from academia and industrial
communities for 6G systems. In such a network, a very large number of devices and applications are
emerged, along with heterogeneity of technologies, architectures, mobile data, etc., and optimizing
such a network is of utmost importance. Besides convex optimization and game theory, swarm intelligence
(SI) has recently appeared as a promising optimization tool for wireless networks. As a new subdivision
of artificial intelligence, SI is inspired by the collective behaviors of societies of biological
species. In SI, simple agents with limited capabilities would achieve intelligent strategies
for high-dimensional and challenging problems, so it has recently found many applications in next-generation
wireless networks (NGN). However, researchers may not be completely aware of the full potential
of SI techniques. In this work, our primary focus will be the integration of these two domains: NGN
and SI. Firstly, we provide an overview of SI techniques from fundamental concepts to well-known
optimizers. Secondly, we review the applications of SI to settle emerging issues in NGN, including
spectrum management and resource allocation, wireless caching and edge computing, network security,
and several other miscellaneous issues. Finally, we highlight open challenges and issues in the
literature, and introduce some interesting directions for future research.
