Advances in computational science offer a principled pipeline for predictive modeling of cardiovascular
flows and aspire to provide a valuable tool for monitoring, diagnostics and surgical planning.
Such models can be nowadays deployed on large patient-specific topologies of systemic arterial
networks and return detailed predictions on flow patterns, wall shear stresses, and pulse wave
propagation. However, their success heavily relies on tedious pre-processing and calibration
procedures that typically induce a significant computational cost, thus hampering their clinical
applicability. In this work we put forth a machine learning framework that enables the seamless
synthesis of non-invasive in-vivo measurement techniques and computational flow dynamics models
derived from first physical principles. We illustrate this new paradigm by showing how one-dimensional
models of pulsatile flow can be used to constrain the output of deep neural networks such that their
predictions satisfy the conservation of mass and momentum principles. Once trained on noisy and
scattered clinical data of flow and wall displacement, these networks can return physically consistent
predictions for velocity, pressure and wall displacement pulse wave propagation, all without
the need to employ conventional simulators. A simple post-processing of these outputs can also
provide a cheap and effective way for estimating Windkessel model parameters that are required
for the calibration of traditional computational models. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques
is demonstrated through a series of prototype benchmarks, as well as a realistic clinical case involving
in-vivo measurements near the aorta/carotid bifurcation of a healthy human subject.
