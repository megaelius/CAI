Automated QRS detection methods depend on the ECG data which is sampled at a certain frequency, irrespective
of filter-based traditional methods or convolutional network (CNN) based deep learning methods.
These methods require a selection of the sampling frequency at which they operate in the very first
place. While working with data from two different datasets, which are sampled at different frequencies,
often, data from both the datasets may need to resample at a common target frequency, which may be
the frequency of either of the datasets or could be a different one. However, choosing data sampled
at a certain frequency may have an impact on the model's generalisation capacity, and complexity.
There exist some studies that investigate the effects of ECG sample frequencies on traditional
filter-based methods, however, an extensive study of the effect of ECG sample frequency on deep
learning-based models (convolutional networks), exploring their generalisability and complexity
is yet to be explored. This experimental research investigates the impact of six different sample
frequencies (50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000Hz) on four different convolutional network-based
models' generalisability and complexity in order to form a basis to decide on an appropriate sample
frequency for the QRS detection task for a particular performance requirement. Intra-database
tests report an accuracy improvement no more than approximately 0.6\% from 100Hz to 250Hz and the
shorter interquartile range for those two frequencies for all CNN-based models. The findings reveal
that convolutional network-based deep learning models are capable of scoring higher levels of
detection accuracies on ECG signals sampled at frequencies as low as 100Hz or 250Hz while maintaining
lower model complexity (number of trainable parameters and training time).
