We explore a prototype of an oscillatory neural network (ONN) based on vanadium dioxide switching
devices. The model system under study represents two oscillators based on thermally coupled VO2
switches. Numerical simulation shows that the effective action radius RTC of coupling depends
both on the total energy released during switching and on the average power. It is experimentally
and numerically proved that the temperature change dT commences almost synchronously with the
released power peak and T-coupling reveals itself up to a frequency of about 10 kHz. For the studied
switching structure configuration, the RTC value varies over a wide range from 4 to 45 mkm, depending
on the external circuit capacitance C and resistance Ri, but the variation of Ri is more promising
from the practical viewpoint. In the case of a "weak" coupling, synchronization is accompanied
by attraction effect and decrease of the main spectra harmonics width. In the case of a "strong" coupling,
the number of effects increases, synchronization can occur on subharmonics resulting in multilevel
stable synchronization of two oscillators. An advanced algorithm for synchronization efficiency
and subharmonic ratio calculation is proposed. It is shown that of the two oscillators the leading
one is that with a higher main frequency, and, in addition, the frequency stabilization effect is
observed. Also, in the case of a strong thermal coupling, the limit of the supply current parameters,
for which the oscillations exist, expands by ~ 10 %. The obtained results have a universal character
and open up a new kind of coupling in ONNs, namely, T-coupling, which allows for easy transition from
2D to 3D integration. The effect of subharmonic synchronization hold promise for application in
classification and pattern recognition.
