Optimising wind turbine performance involves maximising energy harvesting while seeking to minimise
load fatigues on the tower structure, blades and rotor. To improve turbine control performance,
wind preview measurement technologies such as Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) have been a point
of interest for researchers in recent years. In this paper, we explore the application of a classical
control methodology known as Exact Output Regulation (EOR) for improving the control performance
of a LIDAR-enhanced wind turbine. The EOR controller is designed to achieve the rejection of known
input disturbances, while also ensuring the system output tracks a desired reference signal. The
controller is comprised of a state feedback controller together with a feedforward gain. The LIDAR
wind preview information is used to obtain a low-order exosystem for modeling wind dynamics. This
wind exosystem is used to obtain the feedforward gain matrix that enables the EOR controller to effectively
reject the input disturbance and achieve the desired reference tracking. Extensive simulations
of the EOR controller with a broad range of wind speeds in both partial load and full load operating
regions are performed on the full nonlinear aero-elastic model of the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW reference wind turbine. For performance comparisons, we also implement
a baseline torque controller and a commonly used feedforward control method known as Disturbance
Accommodation Control (DAC). The results show that, in comparison with a baseline and DAC controller,
the EOR controller can provide substantially improved reduction of fatigue loads and smoother
power output, without compromising energy production levels.
