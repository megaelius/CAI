Predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy is a vexing challenge in breast cancer. In this study,
we evaluate the ability of deep learning to predict response to HER2-targeted neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
(NAC) from pre-treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI acquired prior to treatment. In
a retrospective study encompassing DCE-MRI data from a total of 157 HER2+ breast cancer patients
from 5 institutions, we developed and validated a deep learning approach for predicting pathological
complete response (pCR) to HER2-targeted NAC prior to treatment. 100 patients who received HER2-targeted
neoadjuvant chemotherapy at a single institution were used to train (n=85) and tune (n=15) a convolutional
neural network (CNN) to predict pCR. A multi-input CNN leveraging both pre-contrast and late post-contrast
DCE-MRI acquisitions was identified to achieve optimal response prediction within the validation
set (AUC=0.93). This model was then tested on two independent testing cohorts with pre-treatment
DCE-MRI data. It achieved strong performance in a 28 patient testing set from a second institution
(AUC=0.85, 95% CI 0.67-1.0, p=.0008) and a 29 patient multicenter trial including data from 3 additional
institutions (AUC=0.77, 95% CI 0.58-0.97, p=0.006). Deep learning-based response prediction
model was found to exceed a multivariable model incorporating predictive clinical variables (AUC
< .65 in testing cohorts) and a model of semi-quantitative DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic measurements
(AUC < .60 in testing cohorts). The results presented in this work across multiple sites suggest
that with further validation deep learning could provide an effective and reliable tool to guide
targeted therapy in breast cancer, thus reducing overtreatment among HER2+ patients.
