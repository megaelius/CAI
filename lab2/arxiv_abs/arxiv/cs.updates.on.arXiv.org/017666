In fluorescence microscopy live-cell imaging, there is a critical trade-off between the signal-to-noise
ratio and spatial resolution on one side, and the integrity of the biological sample on the other
side. To obtain clean high-resolution (HR) images, one can either use microscopy techniques, such
as structured-illumination microscopy (SIM), or apply denoising and super-resolution (SR) algorithms.
However, the former option requires multiple shots that can damage the samples, and although efficient
deep learning based algorithms exist for the latter option, no benchmark exists to evaluate these
algorithms on the joint denoising and SR (JDSR) tasks. To study JDSR on microscopy data, we propose
such a novel JDSR dataset, Widefield2SIM (W2S), acquired using a conventional fluorescence widefield
and SIM imaging. W2S includes 144,000 real fluorescence microscopy images, resulting in a total
of 360 sets of images. A set is comprised of noisy low-resolution (LR) widefield images with different
noise levels, a noise-free LR image, and a corresponding high-quality HR SIM image. W2S allows us
to benchmark the combinations of 6 denoising methods and 6 SR methods. We show that state-of-the-art
SR networks perform very poorly on noisy inputs. Our evaluation also reveals that applying the best
denoiser in terms of reconstruction error followed by the best SR method does not necessarily yield
the best final result. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that SR networks are sensitive
to noise and the sequential application of denoising and SR algorithms is sub-optimal. Lastly,
we demonstrate that SR networks retrained end-to-end for JDSR outperform any combination of state-of-the-art
deep denoising and SR networks
