Objective: Acute intracranial hypertension is an important risk factor of secondary brain damage
after traumatic brain injury. Hypertensive episodes are often diagnosed reactively, leading
to late detection and lost time for intervention planning. A pro-active approach that predicts
critical events several hours ahead of time could assist in directing attention to patients at risk.
Approach: We developed a prediction framework that forecasts onsets of acute intracranial hypertension
in the next 8 hours. It jointly uses cerebral auto-regulation indices, spectral energies and morphological
pulse metrics to describe the neurological state of the patient. One-minute base windows were compressed
by computing signal metrics, and then stored in a multi-scale history, from which physiological
features were derived. Main results: Our model predicted events up to 8 hours in advance with alarm
recall rates of 90% at a precision of 30.3% in the MIMIC-III waveform database, improving upon two
baselines from the literature. We found that features derived from high-frequency waveforms substantially
improved the prediction performance over simple statistical summaries of low-frequency time
series, and each of the three feature classes contributed to the performance gain. The inclusion
of long-term history up to 8 hours was especially important. Significance: Our results highlight
the importance of information contained in high-frequency waveforms in the neurological intensive
care unit. They could motivate future studies on pre-hypertensive patterns and the design of new
alarm algorithms for critical events in the injured brain.
