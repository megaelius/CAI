We present preconditioned stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms for the $\ell_1$ minimization
problem $\min_{x}\|A x - b\|_1$ in the overdetermined case, where there are far more constraints
than variables. Specifically, we have $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ for $n \gg d$. Commonly known
as the Least Absolute Deviations problem, $\ell_1$ regression can be used to solve many important
combinatorial problems, such as minimum cut and shortest path. SGD-based algorithms are appealing
for their simplicity and practical efficiency. Our primary insight is that careful preprocessing
can yield preconditioned matrices $\tilde{A}$ with strong properties (besides good condition
number and low-dimension) that allow for faster convergence of gradient descent. In particular,
we precondition using Lewis weights to obtain an isotropic matrix with fewer rows and strong upper
bounds on all row norms. We leverage these conditions to find a good initialization, which we use
along with recent smoothing reductions and accelerated stochastic gradient descent algorithms
to achieve $\epsilon$ relative error in $\tilde{O}(nnz(A) + d^{2.5} \epsilon^{-2})$ time with
high probability, where $nnz(A)$ is the number of non-zeros in $A$. This improves over the previous
best result using gradient descent for $\ell_1$ regression. We also match the best known running
times for interior point methods in several settings. Finally, we also show that if our original
matrix $A$ is approximately isotropic and the row norms are approximately equal, we can give an algorithm
that avoids using fast matrix multiplication and obtains a running time of $\tilde{O}(nnz(A) +
s d^{1.5}\epsilon^{-2} + d^2\epsilon^{-2})$, where $s$ is the maximum number of non-zeros in a
row of $A$. In this setting, we beat the best interior point methods for certain parameter regimes.
