The design of new devices and experiments in science and engineering has historically relied on
the intuitions of human experts. This credo, however, has changed. In many disciplines, computer-inspired
design processes, also known as inverse-design, have augmented the capability of scientists.
Here we visit different fields of physics in which computer-inspired designs are applied. We will
meet vastly diverse computational approaches based on topological optimization, evolutionary
strategies, deep learning, reinforcement learning or automated reasoning. Then we draw our attention
specifically on quantum physics. In the quest for designing new quantum experiments, we face two
challenges: First, quantum phenomena are unintuitive. Second, the number of possible configurations
of quantum experiments explodes combinatorially. To overcome these challenges, physicists began
to use algorithms for computer-designed quantum experiments. We focus on the most mature and \textit{practical}
approaches that scientists used to find new complex quantum experiments, which experimentalists
subsequently have realized in the laboratories. The underlying idea is a highly-efficient topological
search, which allows for scientific interpretability. In that way, some of the computer-designs
have led to the discovery of new scientific concepts and ideas -- demonstrating how computer algorithm
can genuinely contribute to science by providing unexpected inspirations. We discuss several
extensions and alternatives based on optimization and machine learning techniques, with the potential
of accelerating the discovery of practical computer-inspired experiments or concepts in the future.
Finally, we discuss what we can learn from the different approaches in the fields of physics, and
raise several fascinating possibilities for future research.
