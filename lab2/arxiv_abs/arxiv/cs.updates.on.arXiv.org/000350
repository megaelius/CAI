With the increasing number of mobile Apps developed, they are now closely integrated into daily
life. In this paper, we develop a framework to predict mobile Apps that are most likely to be used regarding
the current device status of a smartphone. Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial prerequisite
for fast App launching, intelligent user experience, and power management of smartphones. By analyzing
real App usage log data, we discover two kinds of features: The Explicit Feature (EF) from sensing
readings of built-in sensors, and the Implicit Feature (IF) from App usage relations. The IF feature
is derived by constructing the proposed App Usage Graph (abbreviated as AUG) that models App usage
transitions. In light of AUG, we are able to discover usage relations among Apps. Since users may
have different usage behaviors on their smartphones, we further propose one personalized feature
selection algorithm. We explore minimum description length (MDL) from the training data and select
those features which need less length to describe the training data. The personalized feature selection
can successfully reduce the log size and the prediction time. Finally, we adopt the kNN classification
model to predict Apps usage. Note that through the features selected by the proposed personalized
feature selection algorithm, we only need to keep these features, which in turn reduces the prediction
time and avoids the curse of dimensionality when using the kNN classifier. We conduct a comprehensive
experimental study based on a real mobile App usage dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed framework and show the predictive capability for App usage prediction.
