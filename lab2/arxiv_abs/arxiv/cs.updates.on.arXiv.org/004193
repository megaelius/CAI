Image based social networks are among the most popular social networking services in recent years.
With tremendous images uploaded everyday, understanding users' preferences to the user-generated
images and recommending them to users have become an urgent need. However, this is a challenging
task. On one hand, we have to overcome the extremely data sparsity issue in image recommendation.
On the other hand, we have to model the complex aspects that influence users' preferences to these
highly subjective content from the heterogeneous data. In this paper, we develop an explainable
social contextual image recommendation model to simultaneously explain and predict users' preferences
to images. Specifically, in addition to user interest modeling in the standard recommendation,
we identify three key aspects that affect each user's preference on the social platform, where each
aspect summarizes a contextual representation from the complex relationships between users and
images. We design a hierarchical attention model in recommendation process given the three contextual
aspects. Particularly, the bottom layered attention networks learn to select informative elements
of each aspect from heterogeneous data, and the top layered attention network learns to score the
aspect importance of the three identified aspects for each user. In this way, we could overcome the
data sparsity issue by leveraging the social contextual aspects from heterogeneous data, and explain
the underlying reasons for each user's behavior with the learned hierarchial attention scores.
Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets clearly show the superiority of our proposed
model.
