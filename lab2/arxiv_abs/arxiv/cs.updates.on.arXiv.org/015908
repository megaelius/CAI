Single-affiliation systems are observed across nature and society. Examples include collaboration,
organisational affiliations, and trade-blocs. The study of such systems is commonly approached
through network analysis. Multilayer networks extend the representation of network analysis
to include more information through increased dimensionality. Thus, they are able to more accurately
represent the systems they are modelling. However, multilayer networks are often represented
by rank-4 adjacency tensors, resulting in a N2M2 solution space. Single-affiliation systems are
unable to occupy the full extent of this space leading to sparse data where it is difficult to attain
statistical confidence through subsequent analysis. To overcome these limitations, this paper
presents a rank-3 tensor representation for single-affiliation systems. The representations
is able to maintain full information of single-affiliation networks in directionless networks,
maintain near full information in directed networks, reduce the solution space it resides in (N2M)
leading to statistically significant findings, and maintain the analytical capability of multilayer
approaches. This is shown through a comparison of the rank-3 and rank-4 representations which is
performed on two datasets: the University of Bath departmental journal co-authorship 2000-2017
and an Erdos-Renyi network with random single-affiliation. The results demonstrate that the structure
of the network is maintained through both representations, while the rank-3 representation provides
greater statistical confidence in node-based measures, and can readily show inter- and intra-affiliation
dynamics.
