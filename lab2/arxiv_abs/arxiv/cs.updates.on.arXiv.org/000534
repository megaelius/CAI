In open systems verification, to formally check for reliability, one needs an appropriate formalism
to model the interaction between agents and express the correctness of the system no matter how the
environment behaves. An important contribution in this context is given by modal logics for strategic
ability, in the setting of multi-agent games, such as ATL, ATL\star, and the like. Recently, Chatterjee,
Henzinger, and Piterman introduced Strategy Logic, which we denote here by CHP-SL, with the aim
of getting a powerful framework for reasoning explicitly about strategies. CHP-SL is obtained
by using first-order quantifications over strategies and has been investigated in the very specific
setting of two-agents turned-based games, where a non-elementary model-checking algorithm has
been provided. While CHP-SL is a very expressive logic, we claim that it does not fully capture the
strategic aspects of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we introduce and study a more general strategy
logic, denoted SL, for reasoning about strategies in multi-agent concurrent games. We prove that
SL includes CHP-SL, while maintaining a decidable model-checking problem. In particular, the
algorithm we propose is computationally not harder than the best one known for CHP-SL. Moreover,
we prove that such a problem for SL is NonElementarySpace-hard. This negative result has spurred
us to investigate here syntactic fragments of SL, strictly subsuming ATL\star, with the hope of
obtaining an elementary model-checking problem. Among the others, we study the sublogics SL[NG],
SL[BG], and SL[1G]. They encompass formulas in a special prenex normal form having, respectively,
nested temporal goals, Boolean combinations of goals and, a single goal at a time. About these logics,
we prove that the model-checking problem for SL[1G] is 2ExpTime-complete, thus not harder than
the one for ATL\star.
