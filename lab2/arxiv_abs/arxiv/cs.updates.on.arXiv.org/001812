Context: The success of Stack Overflow and other community-based question-and-answer (Q&A) sites
depends mainly on the will of their members to answer others' questions. In fact, when formulating
requests on Q&A sites, we are not simply seeking for information. Instead, we are also asking for
other people's help and feedback. Understanding the dynamics of the participation in Q&A communities
is essential to improve the value of crowdsourced knowledge. Objective: In this paper, we investigate
how information seekers can increase the chance of eliciting a successful answer to their questions
on Stack Overflow by focusing on the following actionable factors: affect, presentation quality,
and time. Method: We develop a conceptual framework of factors potentially influencing the success
of questions in Stack Overflow. We quantitatively analyze a set of over 87K questions from the official
Stack Overflow dump to assess the impact of actionable factors on the success of technical requests.
The information seeker reputation is included as a control factor. Furthermore, to understand
the role played by affective states in the success of questions, we qualitatively analyze questions
containing positive and negative emotions. Finally, a survey is conducted to understand how Stack
Overflow users perceive the guideline suggestions for writing questions. Results: We found that
regardless of user reputation, successful questions are short, contain code snippets, and do not
abuse with uppercase characters. As regards affect, successful questions adopt a neutral emotional
style. Conclusion: We provide evidence-based guidelines for writing effective questions on Stack
Overflow that software engineers can follow to increase the chance of getting technical help. As
for the role of affect, we empirically confirmed community guidelines that suggest avoiding rudeness
in question writing.
