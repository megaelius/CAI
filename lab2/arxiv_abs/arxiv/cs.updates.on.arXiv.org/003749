Insider threats are one of today's most challenging cybersecurity issues that are not well addressed
by commonly employed security solutions. Despite several scientific works published in this domain,
we argue that the field can benefit from the proposed structural taxonomy and novel categorization
of research that contribute to the organization and disambiguation of insider threat incidents
and the defense solutions used against them. The objective of our categorization is to systematize
knowledge in insider threat research, while leveraging existing grounded theory method for rigorous
literature review. The proposed categorization depicts the workflow among particular categories
that include: 1) Incidents and datasets, 2) Analysis of attackers, 3) Simulations, and 4) Defense
solutions. Special attention is paid to the definitions and taxonomies of the insider threat; we
present a structural taxonomy of insider threat incidents, which is based on existing taxonomies
and the 5W1H questions of the information gathering problem. Our survey will enhance researchers'
efforts in the domain of insider threat, because it provides: a) a novel structural taxonomy that
contributes to orthogonal classification of incidents and defining the scope of defense solutions
employed against them, b) an updated overview on publicly available datasets that can be used to
test new detection solutions against other works, c) references of existing case studies and frameworks
modeling insiders' behaviors for the purpose of reviewing defense solutions or extending their
coverage, and d) a discussion of existing trends and further research directions that can be used
for reasoning in the insider threat domain.
