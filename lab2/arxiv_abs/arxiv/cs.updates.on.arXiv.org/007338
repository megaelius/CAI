Automated brain lesion segmentation provides valuable information for the analysis and intervention
of patients. In particular, methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved
state-of-the-art segmentation performance. However, CNNs usually require a decent amount of
annotated data, which may be costly and time-consuming to obtain. Since unannotated data is generally
abundant, it is desirable to use unannotated data to improve the segmentation performance for CNNs
when limited annotated data is available. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL)
approach to brain lesion segmentation, where unannotated data is incorporated into the training
of CNNs. We adapt the mean teacher model, which is originally developed for SSL-based image classification,
for brain lesion segmentation. Assuming that the network should produce consistent outputs for
similar inputs, a loss of segmentation consistency is designed and integrated into a self-ensembling
framework. Specifically, we build a student model and a teacher model, which share the same CNN architecture
for segmentation. The student and teacher models are updated alternately. At each step, the student
model learns from the teacher model by minimizing the weighted sum of the segmentation loss computed
from annotated data and the segmentation consistency loss between the teacher and student models
computed from unannotated data. Then, the teacher model is updated by combining the updated student
model with the historical information of teacher models using an exponential moving average strategy.
For demonstration, the proposed approach was evaluated on ischemic stroke lesion segmentation,
where it improves stroke lesion segmentation with the incorporation of unannotated data.
