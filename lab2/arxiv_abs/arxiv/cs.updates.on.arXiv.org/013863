Context: With the rising complexity and scale of software systems, there is an ever-increasing
demand for sophisticated and cost-effective software testing. To meet such a demand, there is a
need for a highly-skilled software testing work-force (test engineers) in the industry. To address
that need, many university educators worldwide have included software-testing education in their
software engineering (SE) or computer science (CS) programs. Objective: Our objective in this
paper is to summarize the body of experience and knowledge in the area of software-testing education
to benefit the readers (both educators and researchers) in designing and delivering software testing
courses in university settings, and to also conduct further education research in this area. Method:
To address the above need, we conducted a systematic literature mapping (SLM) to synthesize what
the community of educators have published on this topic. After compiling a candidate pool of 307
papers, and applying a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, our final pool included 204 papers
published between 1992 and 2019. Results: The topic of software-testing education is becoming
more active, as we can see by the increasing number of papers. Many pedagogical approaches (how to
best teach testing), course-ware, and specific tools for testing education have been proposed.
Many challenges in testing education and insights on how to overcome those challenges have been
proposed. Conclusion: This paper provides educators and researchers with a classification of
existing studies within software-testing education. We further synthesize challenges and insights
reported when teaching software testing. The paper also provides a reference ("index") to the vast
body of knowledge and experience on teaching software testing.
