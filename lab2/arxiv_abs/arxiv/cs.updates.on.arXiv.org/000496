We measure synergy for the Russian national, provincial, and regional innovation systems as reduction
of uncertainty using mutual information among the three distributions of firm sizes, technological
knowledge-bases of firms, and geographical locations. Half a million data at firm level in 2011
were obtained from the Orbis database of Bureau Van Dijk. The firm level data were aggregated at the
levels of eight Federal Districts, the regional level of 83 Federal Subjects, and the single level
of the Russian Federation. Not surprisingly, the knowledge base of the economy is concentrated
in the Moscow region (22.8%); St. Petersburg follows with 4.0%. Only 0.4% of the firms are classified
as high-tech, and 2.7% as medium-tech manufacturing (NACE, Rev. 2). Except in Moscow itself, high-tech
manufacturing does not add synergy to any other unit at any of the various levels of geographical
granularity; instead it disturbs regional coordination even in the region surrounding Moscow
("Moscow Region"). In the case of medium-tech manufacturing, there is also synergy in St. Petersburg.
Knowledge-intensive services (KIS; including laboratories) contribute 12.8% to the economy
in terms of establishments and contribute to the synergy in all Federal Districts (except the North-Caucasian
Federal District), but only in 30 of the 83 Federal Subjects. The synergy in KIS is concentrated in
centers of administration. Unlike Western European countries, the knowledge-intensive services
(which are often state-affiliated) thus provide backbone to an emerging knowledge-based economy
at the level of Federal Districts, but the economy is otherwise not knowledge-based (except for
the Moscow region).
