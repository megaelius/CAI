Interactions between elements, which are usually represented by networks, have to delineate potentially
unequal relationships in terms of their relative importance or direction. The intrinsic unequal
relationships of such kind, however, are opaque or hidden in numerous real systems. For instance,
when a node in a network with limited interaction capacity spends its capacity to its neighboring
nodes, the allocation of the total amount of interactions to them can be vastly diverse. Even if such
potentially heterogeneous interactions epitomized by weighted networks are observable, as a
result of the aforementioned ego-centric allocation of interactions, the relative importance
or dependency between two interacting nodes can only be implicitly accessible. In this work, we
precisely pinpoint such relative dependency by proposing the framework to discover hidden dependent
relations extracted from weighted networks. For a given weighted network, we provide a systematic
criterion to select the most essential interactions for individual nodes based on the concept of
information entropy. The criterion is symbolized by assigning the effective number of neighbors
or the effective out-degree to each node, and the resultant directed subnetwork decodes the hidden
dependent relations by leaving only the most essential directed interactions. We apply our methodology
to two time-stamped empirical network data, namely the international trade relations between
nations in the world trade web (WTW) and the network of people in the historical record of Korea, Annals
of the Joseon Dynasty (AJD). Based on the data analysis, we discover that the properties of mutual
dependency encoded in the two systems are vastly different.
