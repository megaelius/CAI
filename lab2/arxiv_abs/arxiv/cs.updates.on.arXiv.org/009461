A firm understanding and control of viscous fingering (VF) and miscible displacement will be vital
to a wide range of industrial, environmental, and pharmaceutical applications, such as geological
carbon-dioxide sequestration, enhanced oil recovery, and drug delivery. We restrict our study
to VF, a well-known hydrodynamic instability, in miscible fluid systems but consider double-diffusive
(DD) effects---the combined effect of compositional changes because of solute transport and temperature.
One often uses numerical formulations to study VF with DD effects. The primary aim of the current
study is to show that popular formulations have limitations to study VF with DD effect. These limitations
include exhibiting node-to-node spurious oscillations, violating physical constraints such
as the non-negativity of the concentration field or mathematical principles such as the maximum
principle, and suppressing physical instabilities. We will use several popular stabilized finite
element formulations---the SUPG formulations and three modifications based on the SOLD approach---in
our study. Using representative numerical results, we will illustrate two critical limitations.
First, we document that these formulations do not respect the non-negative constraint and the maximum
principle for the concentration field. We will also show the impact of these violations on how viscous
fingers develop. Second, we show that these stabilized formulations, often used to suppress numerical
instabilities, may also suppress physical instabilities, such as viscous fingering. Our study
will be valuable to practitioners who use existing numerical formulations and to computational
mathematicians who develop new formulations.
