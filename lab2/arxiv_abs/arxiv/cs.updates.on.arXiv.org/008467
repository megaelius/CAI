Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are providing more flexible wireless data services to attract
subscribers and increase revenues. For example, the data trading market enables user-flexibility
by allowing users to sell leftover data to or buy extra data from each other. The rollover mechanism
enables time-flexibility by allowing a user to utilize his own leftover data from the previous month
in the current month. In this paper, we investigate the economic viability of offering the data trading
market together with the rollover mechanism, to gain a deeper understanding of the interrelationship
between the user-flexibility and the time-flexibility. We formulate the interactions between
the MNO and mobile users as a multi-slot dynamic game. Specifically, in each time slot (e.g., every
day), the MNO first determines the selling and buying prices with the goal of revenue maximization,
then each user decides his trading action (by solving a dynamic programming problem) to maximize
his long-term payoff. Due to the availability of monthly data rollover, a user's daily trading decision
corresponds to a dynamic programming problem with two time scales (i.e., day-to-day and month-to-month).
Our analysis reveals an optimal trading policy with a target interval structure, specified by a
buy-up-to threshold and a sell-down-to threshold in each time slot. Moreover, we show that the rollover
mechanism makes users sell less and buy more data given the same trading prices, hence it increases
the total demand while decreasing the total supply in the data trading market. Finally, numerical
results based on real-world data unveil that the time-flexible rollover mechanism plays a positive
role in the user-flexible data trading market, increasing the MNO's revenue by 25% and all users'
payoff by 17% on average.
