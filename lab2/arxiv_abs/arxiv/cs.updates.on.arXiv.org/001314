Influence maximization serves as the main goal of a variety of social network activities such as
viral marketing and campaign advertising. The independent cascade model for the influence spread
assumes a one-time chance for each activated node to influence its neighbors. This reasonable assumption
cannot be bypassed, since otherwise the influence probabilities of the nodes, modeled by the edge
weights, would be altered. On the other hand, the manually activated seed set nodes can be reselected
without violating the model parameters or assumptions. The reselection of a seed set node, simply
means paying extra budget to a previously paid node in order for it to retry its influential skills
on its uninfluenced neighbors. This view divides the influence maximization process into two cases:
the simple case where the reselection of the nodes is not considered and the reselection case. In
this study we will analyze the behavior of real world networks on the difference between these two
influence maximization cases. First we will show that the difference between the simple and the
reselection cases constitutes a wide spectrum of networks ranging from the reselection-independent
ones, where the reselection case has no noticeable advantage to the simple case, to the reselection-friendly
ones, where the influence spread in the reselection case is twice the one in the simple case. Then
we will correlate this dynamic to other influence maximization dynamics of the network. Finally,
a significant entanglement between this dynamic and the network structure is shown and verified
by the experiments. In other words, a series of conditions on the network structure is specified
whose fulfilment is a sign for a reselection-friendly network. As a result of this entanglement,
reselection-friendly networks can be spotted without performing the time consuming influence
maximization algorithms.
