Decision making based on behavioral and neural observations of living systems has been extensively
studied in brain science, psychology, and other disciplines. Decision-making mechanisms have
also been experimentally implemented in physical processes, such as single photons and chaotic
lasers. The findings of these experiments suggest that there is a certain common basis in describing
decision making, regardless of its physical realizations. In this study, we propose a local reservoir
model to account for choice-based learning (CBL). CBL describes decision consistency as a phenomenon
where making a certain decision increases the possibility of making that same decision again later,
which has been intensively investigated in neuroscience, psychology, etc. Our proposed model
is inspired by the viewpoint that a decision is affected by its local environment, which is referred
to as a local reservoir. If the size of the local reservoir is large enough, consecutive decision
making will not be affected by previous decisions, thus showing lower degrees of decision consistency
in CBL. In contrast, if the size of the local reservoir decreases, a biased distribution occurs within
it, which leads to higher degrees of decision consistency in CBL. In this study, an analytical approach
on local reservoirs is presented, as well as several numerical demonstrations. Furthermore, a
physical architecture for CBL based on single photons is discussed, and the effects of local reservoirs
is numerically demonstrated. Decision consistency in human decision-making tasks and in recruiting
empirical data are evaluated based on local reservoir. In summary, the proposed local reservoir
model paves a path toward establishing a foundation for computational mechanisms and the systematic
analysis of decision making on different levels.
