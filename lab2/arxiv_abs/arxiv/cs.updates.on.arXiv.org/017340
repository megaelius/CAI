In order to solve the problem of low automation of Aero-engine Turbine shaft assembly and the difficulty
of non-contact high-precision measurement, a structured light binocular measurement technology
for key components of aero-engine is proposed in this paper. Combined with three-dimensional point
cloud data processing and assembly position matching algorithm, the high-precision measurement
of shaft hole assembly posture in the process of turbine shaft docking is realized. Firstly, the
screw thread curve on the bolt surface is segmented based on PCA projection and edge point cloud clustering,
and Hough transform is used to model fit the three-dimensional thread curve. Then the preprocessed
two-dimensional convex hull is constructed to segment the key hole location features, and the mounting
surface and hole location obtained by segmentation are fitted based on RANSAC method. Finally,
the geometric feature matching is used the evaluation index of turbine shaft assembly is established
to optimize the pose. The final measurement accuracy of mounting surface matching is less than 0.05mm,
and the measurement accuracy of mounting hole matching based on minimum ance optimization is less
than 0.1 degree. The measurement algorithm is implemented on the automatic assembly test-bed of
a certain type of aero-engine low-pressure turbine rotor. In the narrow installation space, the
assembly process of the turbine shaft assembly, such as the automatic alignment and docking of the
shaft hole, the automatic heating and temperature measurement of the installation seam, and the
automatic tightening of the two guns, are realized in the narrow installation space Guidance, real-time
inspection and assembly result evaluation.
