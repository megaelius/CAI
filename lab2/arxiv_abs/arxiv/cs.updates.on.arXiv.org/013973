In recent years, the use of object proposal as a preprocessing step for target detection to improve
computational efficiency has become an effective method. Good object proposal methods should
have high object detection recall rate and low computational cost, as well as good location accuracy
and repeatability. However, it is difficult for current advanced algorithms to achieve a good balance
in the above performance. Therefore, it is especially important to ensure that the recall rate and
location quality are not degraded while accelerating object generation.For this problem, we propose
a class-independent object proposal algorithm BIHL. It combines the advantages of window scoring
and superpixel merging. First, a binarized horizontal high frequency component feature and a linear
classifier are used to learn and generate a set of candidate boxs with a objective score. Then, the
candidate boxs are merged based on the principle of location and score proximity. Different from
superpixel merging algorithm, our method does not use pixel level operation to avoid a lot of computation
without losing performance. Experimental results on the VOC2007 dataset and the VOC2007 synthetic
interference dataset containing 297,120 test images show that when including difficult-to-identify
objects with an IOU threshold of 0.5 and 10000 budget proposals, our method achieves a 99.3% detection
recall and an mean average best overlap of 81.1% . The average processing time of our method for all
test set images is 0.0015 seconds, which is nearly 3 times faster than the current fastest method.
In repeatability testing, our method is the method with the highest average repeatability among
the methods that achieve good repeatability to various disturbances, and the average repeatability
is 10% higher than RPN. The code will be published in {https://github.com/JiangChao2009/BIHL}
