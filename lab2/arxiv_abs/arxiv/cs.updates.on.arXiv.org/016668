Previous research has demonstrated that various properties of infectious diseases can be inferred
from online search behaviour. In this work we use time series of online search query frequencies
to gain insights about the prevalence of COVID-19 in multiple countries. We first develop unsupervised
modelling techniques based on associated symptom categories identified by the United Kingdom's
National Health Service and Public Health England. We then attempt to minimise an expected bias
in these signals caused by public interest -- as opposed to infections -- using the proportion of
news media coverage devoted to COVID-19 as a proxy indicator. Our analysis indicates that models
based on online searches precede the reported confirmed cases and deaths by 16.7 (10.2 - 23.2) and
22.1 (17.4 - 26.9) days, respectively. We also investigate transfer learning techniques for mapping
supervised models from countries where the spread of disease has progressed extensively to countries
that are in earlier phases of their respective epidemic curves. Furthermore, we compare time series
of online search activity against confirmed COVID-19 cases or deaths jointly across multiple countries,
uncovering interesting querying patterns, including the finding that rarer symptoms are better
predictors than common ones. Finally, we show that web searches improve the short-term forecasting
accuracy of autoregressive models for COVID-19 deaths. Our work provides evidence that online
search data can be used to develop complementary public health surveillance methods to help inform
the COVID-19 response in conjunction with more established approaches.
