An optimized heat pump control for building heating was developed for minimizing CO2 emissions
from related electrical power generation. The control is using weather and CO2 emission forecasts
as input to a Model Predictive Control (MPC) - a multivariate control algorithm using a dynamic process
model, constraints and a cost function to be minimized. In a simulation study the control was applied
using weather and power grid conditions during a full year period in 2017-2018 for the power bidding
zone DK2 (East, Denmark). Two scenarios were studied; one with a family house and one with an office
building. The buildings were dimensioned on the basis of standards and building codes. The main
results are measured as the CO2 emission savings relative to a classical thermostatic control.
Note that this only measures the gain achieved using the MPC control, i.e. the energy flexibility,
not the absolute savings. The results show that around 16% savings could have been achieved during
the period in well insulated new buildings with floor heating. Further, a sensitivity analysis
was carried out to evaluate the effect of various building properties, e.g. level of insulation
and thermal capacity. Danish building codes from 1977 and forward was used as benchmarks for insulation
levels. It was shown that both insulation and thermal mass influence the achievable flexibility
savings, especially for floor heating. Buildings that comply with codes later than 1979 could provide
flexibility emission savings of around 10%, while buildings that comply with earlier codes provided
savings in the range of 0-5% depending on the heating system and thermal mass.
