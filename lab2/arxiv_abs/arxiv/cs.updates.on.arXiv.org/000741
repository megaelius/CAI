This paper develops tools for welfare and revenue analyses of Bayes-Nash equilibria in asymmetric
auctions with single-dimensional agents. We employ these tools to derive price of anarchy results
for social welfare and revenue. Our approach separates the standard smoothness framework into
two distinct parts, isolating the analysis common to any auction from the analysis specific to a
given auction. The first part relates a bidder's contribution to welfare in equilibrium to their
contribution to welfare in the optimal auction using the price the bidder faces for additional allocation.
Intuitively, either an agent's utility and hence contribution to welfare is high, or the price she
has to pay for additional allocation is high relative to her value. We call this condition value covering;
it holds in every Bayes-Nash equilibrium of any auction. The second part, revenue covering, relates
the prices bidders face for additional allocation to the revenue of the auction, using an auction's
rules and feasibility constraints. Combining the two parts gives approximation results to the
optimal welfare, and, under the right conditions, the optimal revenue. In mechanisms with reserve
prices, our welfare results show approximation with respect to the optimal mechanism with the same
reserves. As a center-piece result, we analyze the single-item first-price auction with individual
monopoly reserves. When each distribution satisfies a regularity condition the auction's revenue
is at least a $2e/(e-1) \approx 3.16$ approximation to the revenue of the optimal auction. We also
give bounds for matroid auctions with first-price or all-pay semantics, and the generalized first-price
position auction. Finally, we give an extension theorem for simultaneous composition, i.e., when
multiple auctions are run simultaneously, with single-valued, unit-demand agents.
