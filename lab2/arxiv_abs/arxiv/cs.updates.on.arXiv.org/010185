Semi-supervised anomaly detection is referred as an approach to identify rare data instances (i.e,
anomalies) on the assumption that all the available training data belong to the majority (i.e.,
the normal class). A typical strategy is to model the distribution of normal data, then identify
data samples far from the distribution as anomalies. Nowadays, backpropagation based neural networks
(i.e., BP-NNs) have been drawing attention as well as in the field of semi-supervised anomaly detection
because of their high generalization capability for real-world high dimensional data. As a typical
application, such BP-NN based models are iteratively optimized in server machines with accumulated
data gathered from edge devices. However, there are two issues in this framework: (1) BP-NNs' iterative
optimization approach often takes too long time to follow changes of the distribution of normal
data (i.e., concept drift), and (2) data transfers between servers and edge devices have a potential
risk to cause data breaches. To address these underlying issues, we propose an ON-device sequential
Learning semi-supervised Anomaly Detector called ONLAD. The aim of this work is to propose the algorithm,
and also to implement it as an IP core called ONLAD Core so that various kinds of edge devices can adopt
our approach at low power consumption. Experimental results using open datasets show that ONLAD
has favorable anomaly detection capability especially in a testbed which simulates concept drift.
Experimental results on hardware performance of the FPGA based ONLAD Core show that its training
latency and prediction latency are x1.95 - x4.51 and x2.29 - x4.73 faster than those of BP-NN based
software implementations. It is also confirmed that our on-board implementation of ONLAD Core
actually works at x6.7 - x27.1 lower power consumption than the other software implementations
at a high workload.
