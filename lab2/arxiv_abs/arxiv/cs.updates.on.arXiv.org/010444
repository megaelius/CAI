This article develops a new mathematical method for holistic analysis of nonlinear dynamic compartmental
systems in the context of ecology. The method is based on the novel dynamic system and subsystem partitioning
methodologies through which compartmental systems are decomposed to the utmost level. The dynamic
system and subsystem partitioning enable tracking the evolution of the initial stocks, environmental
inputs, and intercompartmental system flows, as well as the associated storages derived from these
stocks, inputs, and flows individually and separately within the system. Moreover, the transient
and the dynamic direct, indirect, acyclic, cycling, and transfer (diact) flows and associated
storages transmitted along a given flow path or from one compartment, directly or indirectly, to
any other are analytically characterized, systematically classified, and mathematically formulated.
Further, the article develops a dynamic technique based on the diact transactions for the quantitative
classification of interspecific interactions and the determination of their strength within
food webs. Major concepts and quantities of the current static network analyses are also extended
to nonlinear dynamic settings and integrated with the proposed dynamic measures and indices within
the proposed unifying mathematical framework. Therefore, the proposed methodology enables a
holistic view and analysis of ecological systems. We consider that this methodology brings a novel
complex system theory to the service of urgent and challenging environmental problems of the day
and has the potential to lead the way to a more formalistic ecological science.
