We give a number of formal proofs of theorems from the field of computable analysis. Many of our results
specify executable algorithms that work on infinite inputs by means of operating on finite approximations
and are proven correct in the sense of computable analysis. The development is done in the proof assistant
Coq and heavily relies on the Incone library for information theoretic continuity. This library
is developed by one of the authors and the paper can be used as an introduction to the library as it describes
many of its most important features in detail. While the ability to have full executability in a formal
development of mathematical statements about real numbers and the like is not a feature that is unique
to the Incone library, its original contribution is to adhere to the conventions of computable analysis
to provide a general purpose interface for algorithmic reasoning on continuous structures. The
results that provide complete computational content include that the algebraic operations and
the efficient limit operator on the reals are computable, that certain countably infinite products
are isomorphic to spaces of functions, compatibility of the enumeration representation of subsets
of natural numbers with the abstract definition of the space of open subsets of the natural numbers,
and that continuous realizability implies sequential continuity. We also formalize proofs of
non-computational results that support the correctness of our definitions. These include that
the information theoretic notion of continuity used in the library is equivalent to the metric notion
of continuity on Baire space, a complete comparison of the different concepts of continuity that
arise from metric and represented-space structures and the discontinuity of the unrestricted
limit operator on the real numbers and the task of selecting an element of a closed subset of the natural
numbers.
