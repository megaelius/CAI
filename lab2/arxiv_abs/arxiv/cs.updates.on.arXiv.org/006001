Data today fuels both the economy and advances in machine learning and AI. All aspects of decision
making, at the personal and enterprise level and in governments are increasingly data-driven.
In this context, however, there are still some fundamental questions that remain unanswered with
respect to data. \textit{What is meant by data value? How can it be quantified, in a general sense?}.
The "value" of data is not understood quantitatively until it is used in an application and output
is evaluated, and hence currently it is not possible to assess the value of large amounts of data that
companies hold, categorically. Further, there is overall consensus that good data is important
for any analysis but there is no independent definition of what constitutes good data. In our paper
we try to address these gaps in the valuation of data and present a framework for users who wish to assess
the value of data in a categorical manner. Our approach is to view the data as composed of various attributes
or characteristics, which we refer to as facets, and which in turn comprise many sub-facets. We define
the notion of values that each sub-facet may take, and provide a seed scoring mechanism for the different
values. The person assessing the data is required to fill in the values of the various sub-facets
that are relevant for the data set under consideration, through a questionnaire that attempts to
list them exhaustively. Based on the scores assigned for each set of values, the data set can now be
quantified in terms of its properties. This provides a basis for the comparison of the relative merits
of two or more data sets in a structured manner, independent of context. The presence of context adds
additional information that improves the quantification of the data value.
