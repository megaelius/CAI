Researchers traditionally solve the computational problems through rigorous and deterministic
algorithms called as Hard Computing. These precise algorithms have widely been realized using
digital technology as an inherently reliable and accurate implementation platform, either in
hardware or software forms. This rigid form of implementation which we refer as Hard Realization
relies on strict algorithmic accuracy constraints dictated to digital design engineers. Hard
realization admits paying as much as necessary implementation costs to preserve computation precision
and determinism throughout all the design and implementation steps. Despite its prior accomplishments,
this conventional paradigm has encountered serious challenges with today's emerging applications
and implementation technologies. Unlike traditional hard computing, the emerging soft and bio-inspired
algorithms do not rely on fully precise and deterministic computation. Moreover, the incoming
nanotechnologies face increasing reliability issues that prevent them from being efficiently
exploited in hard realization of applications. This article examines Soft Realization, a novel
bio-inspired approach to design and implementation of an important category of applications noticing
the internal brain structure. The proposed paradigm mitigates major weaknesses of hard realization
by (1) alleviating incompatibilities with today's soft and bio-inspired algorithms such as artificial
neural networks, fuzzy systems, and human sense signal processing applications, and (2) resolving
the destructive inconsistency with unreliable nanotechnologies. Our experimental results on
a set of well-known soft applications implemented using the proposed soft realization paradigm
in both reliable and unreliable technologies indicate that significant energy, delay, and area
savings can be obtained compared to the conventional implementation.
