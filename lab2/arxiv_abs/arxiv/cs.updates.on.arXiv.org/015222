The overfitting is one of the cursing subjects in the deep learning field. To solve this challenge,
many approaches were proposed to regularize the learning models. They add some hyper-parameters
to the model to extend the generalization; however, it is a hard task to determine these hyper-parameters
and a bad setting diverges the training process. In addition, most of the regularization schemes
decrease the learning speed. Recently, Tai et al. [1] proposed low-rank tensor decomposition as
a constrained filter for removing the redundancy in the convolution kernels of CNN. With a different
viewpoint, we use Low-Rank matrix Factorization (LRF) to drop out some parameters of the learning
model along the training process. However, this scheme similar to [1] probably decreases the training
accuracy when it tries to decrease the number of operations. Instead, we use this regularization
scheme adaptively when the complexity of a layer is high. The complexity of any layer can be evaluated
by the nonlinear condition numbers of its learning system. The resulted method entitled "AdaptiveLRF"
neither decreases the training speed nor vanishes the accuracy of the layer. The behavior of AdaptiveLRF
is visualized on a noisy dataset. Then, the improvements are presented on some small-size and large-scale
datasets. The preference of AdaptiveLRF on famous dropout regularizers on shallow networks is
demonstrated. Also, AdaptiveLRF competes with dropout and adaptive dropout on the various deep
networks including MobileNet V2, ResNet V2, DenseNet, and Xception. The best results of AdaptiveLRF
on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets are 98%, 94.1% F-measure, and 97.9%, 94% accuracy. Finally, we state
the usage of the LRF-based loss function to improve the quality of the learning model.
