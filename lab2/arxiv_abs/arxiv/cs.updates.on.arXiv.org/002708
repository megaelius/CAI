The requirement of high data-rate in the fifth generation wireless systems (5G) calls for the ultimate
utilization of the wide bandwidth in the mmWave frequency band. Researchers seeking to compensate
for mmWave's high path loss and to achieve both gain and directivity have proposed that mmWave multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems make use of beamforming systems. Hybrid beamforming in mmWave
demonstrates promising performance in achieving high gain and directivity by using phase shifters
at the analog processing block. What remains a problem, however, is the actual implementation of
mmWave beamforming systems; to fabricate such a system is costly and complex. With the aim of reducing
such cost and complexity, this article presents actual prototypes of the lens antenna as an effective
device to be used in the future 5G mmWave hybrid beamforming systems. Using a lens as a passive phase
shifter enables beamforming without the heavy network of active phase shifters, while gain and
directivity are achieved by the energy-focusing property of the lens. Proposed in this article
are two types of lens antennas, one for static and the other for mobile usage. Their performance is
evaluated using measurements and simulation data along with link-level analysis via a software
defined radio (SDR) platform. Results show the promising potential of the lens antenna for its high
gain and directivity, and its improved beam-switching feasibility compared to when a lens is not
used. System-level evaluations reveal the significant throughput enhancement in both real indoor
and outdoor environments. Moreover, the lens antenna's design issues are also discussed by evaluating
different lens sizes.
