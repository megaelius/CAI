Data is being produced in larger quantities than ever before in human history. It's only natural
to expect a rise in demand for technology that aids humans in sifting through and analyzing this inexhaustible
supply of information. This need exists in the market research industry, where large amounts of
consumer research data is collected through video recordings. At present, the standard method
for analyzing video data is human labor. Market researchers manually review the vast majority of
consumer research video in order to identify relevant portions - highlights. The industry state
of the art turnaround ratio is 2.2 - for every hour of video content 2.2 hours of manpower are required.
In this study we present a novel approach for NLP-based highlight identification and extraction
based on a supervised learning model that aides market researchers in sifting through their data.
Our approach hinges on a manually curated user-generated highlight clips constructed from long
and short-form video data. The problem is best suited for an NLP approach due to the availability
of video transcription. We evaluate multiple classes of models, from gradient boosting to recurrent
neural networks, comparing their performance in extraction and identification of highlights.
The best performing models are then evaluated using four sampling methods designed to analyze documents
much larger than the maximum input length of the classifiers. We report very high performances for
the standalone classifiers, ROC AUC scores in the range 0.93-0.94, but observe a significant drop
in effectiveness when evaluated on large documents. Based on our results we suggest combinations
of models/sampling algorithms for various use cases.
