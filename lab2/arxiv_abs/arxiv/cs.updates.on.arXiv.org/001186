We envision a decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) design, that we call ClaimChain, where
each user or device maintains repositories of claims regarding their own key material, and their
beliefs about public keys and, generally, state of other users of the system. High integrity of the
repositories is maintained by virtue of storing claims on authenticated data structures, namely
hash chains and Merkle trees, and their authenticity and non-repudiation by the use of digital signatures.
We introduce the concept of cross-referencing of hash chains as a way of efficient and verifiable
vouching about states of other users. ClaimChain allows to detect chain compromises, manifested
as forks of hash chains, and to implement various social policies for deriving decisions about the
latest state of users in the system. The claims about keys of other people introduces a privacy problem
that does not exist in the centralized PKI design. Such information can reveal the social graph,
and sometimes even communication patterns. To solve this, we use cryptographic verifiable random
functions to derive private identifiers that are re-randomized on each chain update. This allows
to openly and verifiably publish claims that can only be read by the authorized users, ensuring privacy
of the social graph. Moreover, the specific construction of Merkle trees in ClaimChain, along with
the usage of verifiable random functions, ensures users can not equivocate about the state of other
people. ClaimChain is flexible with respect to deployment options, supporting fully decentralized
deployments, as well as centralized, federated, and hybrid modes of operation.
