This paper proposes a charge-conserving, variational, spatio-temporal discretization for the
drift-kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell system, utilizing finite-elements for the electromagnetic fields
and the particle-in-cell approach for the Vlasov distribution. The proposed scheme is fully electromagnetic,
dealing with fields instead of potentials, and includes the effects of polarization and magnetization
in the Gauss and Amp\`ere-Maxwell laws, a consequence of reducing the full particle dynamics to
drift-center dynamics. There is, however, no need to invert the Gauss law: it is satisfied automatically
at every time-step as a result of a discrete Noether symmetry, and the electric field is updated directly
from the Amp\`ere-Maxwell equation. The method provides an update for the magnetic field that is
fully explicit, involving only local operations. The update for particles is implicit for each
particle individually, also leading to local operations only. The update for the electric field
is linearly implicit due to the presence of a finite-element mass matrix and polarization and magnetization
effects in the Amp\`ere-Maxwell equation, hence involving a sparse matrix inversion once at every
time step. Because the scheme deals with the electromagnetic fields and not the potentials, it also
provides the first serious attempt at constructing a structure-preserving numerical scheme for
the mixed kinetic-ion--drift-kinetic-electron Vlasov-Maxwell model. Consequently, the proposed
method could be used to simulate electromagnetic turbulence in fusion experiments or space plasmas
that exhibit a strong background magnetic field while retaining all of the ion physics, most of the
necessary electron physics, yet eliminating perhaps the biggest obstacle in reaching macroscopic
transport time scales in kinetic simulations, namely the electron cyclotron time scale.
