Group signature is a fundamental cryptographic primitive, aiming to protect anonymity and ensure
accountability of users. It allows group members to anonymously sign messages on behalf of the whole
group, while incorporating a tracing mechanism to identify the signer of any suspected signature.
Most of the existing group signature schemes, however, do not guarantee security once users' secret
keys are exposed. To reduce potential damages caused by key exposure attacks, Song (CCS 2001) put
forward the concept of forward-secure group signatures (FSGS). For the time being, all known secure
FSGS schemes are based on number-theoretic assumptions, and are vulnerable against quantum computers.
In this work, we construct the first lattice-based FSGS scheme. In Nakanishi et al.'s model, our
scheme achieves forward-secure traceability under the Short Integer Solution (SIS) assumption,
and offers full anonymity under the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. At the heart of our construction
is a scalable lattice-based key-evolving mechanism, allowing users to periodically update their
secret keys and to efficiently prove in zero-knowledge that the key-evolution process is done correctly.
To realize this essential building block, we first employ the Bonsai-tree structure by Cash et al.
(EUROCRYPT 2010) to handle the key evolution process, and then develop Langlois et al.'s construction
(PKC 2014) to design its supporting zero-knowledge protocol. In comparison to all known lattice-based
group signatures (that are \emph{not} forward-secure), our scheme only incurs a very reasonable
overhead: the bit-sizes of keys and signatures are at most O(log N), where N is the number of group
users; and at most O(log^3 T), where T is the number of time periods.
