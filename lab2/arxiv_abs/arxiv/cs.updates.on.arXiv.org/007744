The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect everyday physical objects to the internet. These objects
will produce a significant amount of data. The traditional cloud computing architecture aims to
process data in the cloud. As a result, a significant amount of data needs to be communicated to the
cloud. This creates a number of challenges, such as high communication latency between the devices
and the cloud, increased energy consumption of devices during frequent data upload to the cloud,
high bandwidth consumption, while making the network busy by sending the data continuously, and
less privacy because of less control on the transmitted data to the server. Fog computing has been
proposed to counter these weaknesses. Fog computing aims to process data at the edge and substantially
eliminate the necessity of sending data to the cloud. However, combining the Service Oriented Architecture
(SOA) with the fog computing architecture is still an open challenge. In this paper, we propose to
decompose services to create linked-microservices (LMS). Linked-microservices are services
that run on multiple nodes but closely linked to their linked-partners. Linked-microservices
allow distributing the computation across different computing nodes in the IoT architecture.
Using four different types of architectures namely cloud, fog, hybrid and fog+cloud, we explore
and demonstrate the effectiveness of service decomposition by applying four experiments to three
different type of datasets. Evaluation of the four architectures shows that decomposing services
into nodes reduce the data consumption over the network by 10% - 70%. Overall, these results indicate
that the importance of decomposing services in the context of fog computing for enhancing the quality
of service.
