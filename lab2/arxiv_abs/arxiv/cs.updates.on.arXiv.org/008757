This paper investigates the problem of utilizing network topology and partial timestamps to detect
the information source in a network. The problem incurs prohibitive cost under canonical maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) of the source due to the exponential number of possible infection paths.
Our main idea of source detection, however, is to approximate the MLE by an alternative infection
path based estimator, the essence of which is to identify the most likely infection path that is consistent
with observed timestamps. The source node associated with that infection path is viewed as the estimated
source $\hat{v}$. We first study the case of tree topology, where by transforming the infection
path based estimator into a linear integer programming, we find a reduced search region that remarkably
improves the time efficiency. Within this reduced search region, the estimator $\hat{v}$ is provably
always on a path which we term as \emph{candidate path}. This notion enables us to analyze the distribution
of $d(v^{\ast},\hat{v})$, the error distance between $\hat{v}$ and the true source $v^{\ast}$,
on arbitrary tree, which allows us to obtain for the first time, in the literature provable performance
guarantee of the estimator under limited timestamps. Specifically, on the infinite $g$-regular
tree with uniform sampled timestamps, we get a refined performance guarantee in the sense of a constant
bounded $d(v^{\ast},\hat{v})$. By virtue of time labeled BFS tree, the estimator still performs
fairly well when extended to more general graphs. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets
further demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms.
