ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. Due
to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys
contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike.
Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological
and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical
limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging
imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science.
Due to these new and emerging challenges in scientific imaging, ImageJ is at a critical development
crossroads. We present ImageJ2, a total redesign of ImageJ offering a host of new functionality.
It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration
with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows
everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community.
The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly
common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility
is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ
interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. ImageJ2
provides a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well
as accommodate future needs.
