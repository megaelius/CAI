Traditional feature matching methods such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) usually
use image intensity or gradient information to detect and describe feature points; however, both
intensity and gradient are sensitive to nonlinear radiation distortions (NRD). To solve the problem,
this paper proposes a novel feature matching algorithm that is robust to large NRD. The proposed
method is called radiation-invariant feature transform (RIFT). There are three main contributions
in RIFT: first, RIFT uses phase congruency (PC) instead of image intensity for feature point detection.
RIFT considers both the number and repeatability of feature points, and detects both corner points
and edge points on the PC map. Second, RIFT originally proposes a maximum index map (MIM) for feature
description. MIM is constructed from the log-Gabor convolution sequence and is much more robust
to NRD than traditional gradient map. Thus, RIFT not only largely improves the stability of feature
detection, but also overcomes the limitation of gradient information for feature description.
Third, RIFT analyzes the inherent influence of rotations on the values of MIM, and realizes rotation
invariance. We use six different types of multi-model image datasets to evaluate RIFT, including
optical-optical, infrared-optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-optical, depth-optical,
map-optical, and day-night datasets. Experimental results show that RIFT is much more superior
to SIFT and SAR-SIFT. To the best of our knowledge, RIFT is the first feature matching algorithm that
can achieve good performance on all the above-mentioned types of multi-model images. The source
code of RIFT and multi-modal remote sensing image datasets are made public .
