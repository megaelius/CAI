Reliance on wheelchairs after spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to many medical co-morbidities. Treatment
of these conditions contributes to the majority of SCI health care costs. Restoring able-body-like
ambulation after SCI may reduce the incidence of these conditions, and increase independence and
quality of life. However, no biomedical solution exists that can reverse this lost neurological
function, and hence novel methods are needed. Brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled lower
extremity prosthesis may constitute one such novel approach. One subject with able-body and one
with paraplegia due to SCI underwent electroencephalogram (EEG) recording while engaged in alternating
epochs of idling and walking kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI). These data were analyzed to generate
an EEG prediction model for online BCI operation. A commercial robotic gait orthosis (RoGO) system
(treadmill suspended), was interfaced with the BCI computer. In an online test, the subjects were
tasked to ambulate using the BCI-RoGO system when prompted by computerized cues. The performance
of this system was assessed with cross-correlation analysis, and omission and false alarm rates.
The offline accuracy of the EEG prediction model averaged 86.3%. The cross-correlation between
instructional cues and BCI-RoGO walking epochs averaged 0.812 +/- 0.048 (p-value<10^-4).
There were on average 0.8 false alarms per session and no omissions. This is the first time a person
with parapegia due to SCI regained basic brain-controlled ambulation, thereby indicating that
restoring brain-controlled ambulation is feasible. Future work will test this system in a population
of individuals with SCI. If successful, this may justify future development of invasive BCI-controlled
lower extremity prostheses. This system may also be applied to incomplete SCI to improve neurological
outcomes beyond those of standard physiotherapy.
