In this paper, an Air-Ground Integrated VEhicular Network (AGIVEN) architecture is proposed,
where the aerial High Altitude Platforms (HAPs) proactively push contents to vehicles through
large-area broadcast while the ground roadside units (RSUs) provide high-rate unicast services
on demand. To efficiently manage the multi-dimensional heterogeneous resources, a service-oriented
network slicing approach is introduced, where the AGIVEN is virtually divided into multiple slices
and each slice supports a specific application with guaranteed quality of service (QoS). Specifically,
the fundamental problem of multi-resource provisioning in AGIVEN slicing is investigated, by
taking into account typical vehicular applications of location-based map and popularity-based
content services. For the location-based map service, the capability of HAP-vehicle proactive
pushing is derived with respect to the HAP broadcast rate and vehicle cache size, wherein a saddle
point exists indicating the optimal communication-cache resource trading. For the popular contents
of common interests, the average on-board content hit ratio is obtained, with HAPs pushing newly
generated contents to keep on-board cache fresh. Then, the minimal RSU transmission rate is derived
to meet the average delay requirements of each slice. The obtained analytical results reveal the
service-dependent resource provisioning and trading relationships among RSU transmission rate,
HAP broadcast rate, and vehicle cache size, which provides guidelines for multi-resource network
slicing in practice. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AGIVEN network slicing
approach matches the multi-resources across slices, whereby the RSU transmission rate can be saved
by 40% while maintaining the same QoS.
