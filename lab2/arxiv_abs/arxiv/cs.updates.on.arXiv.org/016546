We study the gathering problem requiring a team of mobile agents to gather at a single node in arbitrary
networks. The team consists of $k$ agents with unique identifiers (IDs), and $f$ of them are weakly
Byzantine agents, which behave arbitrarily except falsifying their identifiers. The agents move
in synchronous rounds and cannot leave any information on nodes. If the number of nodes $n$ is given
to agents, the existing fastest algorithm tolerates any number of weakly Byzantine agents and achieves
gathering with simultaneous termination in $O(n^4\cdot|\Lambda_{good}|\cdot X(n))$ rounds,
where $|\Lambda_{good}|$ is the length of the maximum ID of non-Byzantine agents and $X(n)$ is the
number of rounds required to explore any network composed of $n$ nodes. In this paper, we ask the question
of whether we can reduce the time complexity if we have a strong team, i.e., a team with a few Byzantine
agents, because not so many agents are subject to faults in practice. We give a positive answer to
this question by proposing two algorithms in the case where at least $4f^2+9f+4$ agents exist and
all the agents awake at the same time. Both the algorithms take the upper bound $N$ of $n$ as input.
The first algorithm achieves gathering with non-simultaneous termination in $O((f+|\Lambda_{good}|)\cdot
X(N))$ rounds. The second algorithm achieves gathering with simultaneous termination in $O((f+|\Lambda_{all}|)\cdot
X(N))$ rounds, where $|\Lambda_{all}|$ is the length of the maximum ID of all agents. If $n$ is given
to agents, the second algorithm significantly reduces the time complexity compared to the existing
one if $|\Lambda_{all}|=O(|\Lambda_{good}|)$ holds.
