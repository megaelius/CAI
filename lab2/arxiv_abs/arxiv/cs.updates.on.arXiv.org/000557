We study discrete preference games that have been used to model issues such as the formation of opinions
or the adoption of innovations in the context of a social network. In these games, the payoff of each
agent depends on the agreement of her strategy to her internal belief and on its coordination with
the strategies of her neighbors in the social network. We consider the question of whether the public
opinion can be different than the public belief. We show that strategic behavior typically leads
to changes of the public opinion compared to the public belief. We completely characterize the social
networks where such changes can happen and furthermore study the complexity of such transitions.
We show that deciding whether a minority belief can become the majority opinion is NP-hard even when
the initial number of supporters of this belief is very close to 1/4 of the social network size. Next,
motivated by the limited expressive power of discrete preference games, we define and study the
novel class of generalized discrete preference games. These games have additional characteristics
and can model social relations to allies or competitors, introduce different levels of strength
for each relation, and personalize the dependence of each agent to its neighborhood. We show that
these games admit generalized ordinal potential functions. More importantly, we show that every
two-strategy game that admits a generalized ordinal potential function is structurally equivalent
to a generalized discrete preference game. This implies that the these new games capture the full
generality of two-strategy games in which the existence of equilibria is guaranteed by topological
arguments.
