Online search data is routinely used to monitor the prevalence of infectious diseases, such as influenza.
Previous work has focused on supervised learning solutions, where ground truth data, in the form
of historical syndromic surveillance reports, can be used to train machine learning models. However,
no sufficient data -- in terms of accuracy and time span -- exist to apply such approaches for monitoring
the emerging COVID-19 infectious disease pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, unsupervised, or semi-supervised solutions should be sought. Recent outcomes have
shown that it is possible to transfer an online search based model for influenza-like illness from
a source to a target country without using ground truth data for the target location. The transferred
model's accuracy depends on choosing search queries and their corresponding weights wisely, via
a transfer learning methodology, for the target location. In this work, we draw a parallel to previous
findings and attempt to develop an unsupervised model for COVID-19 by: (i) carefully choosing search
queries that refer to related symptoms as identified by a survey from the National Health Service
in the United Kingdom (UK), and (ii) weighting them based on their reported ratio of occurrence in
people infected by COVID-19. Furthermore, understanding that online searches may be also driven
by concern rather than infections, we devise a preliminary approach that attempts to minimise this
part of the signal by incorporating a basic news media coverage metric in association with confirmed
COVID-19 cases. Finally, we propose a transfer learning method for mapping supervised COVID-19
models from a country to another, in an effort to transfer knowledge from areas where the disease
has a more extended progression.
