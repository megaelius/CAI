Rationale: Computer aided detection (CAD) algorithms for Pulmonary Embolism (PE) algorithms
have been shown to increase radiologists' sensitivity with a small increase in specificity. However,
CAD for PE has not been adopted into clinical practice, likely because of the high number of false
positives current CAD software produces. Objective: To generate a database of annotated computed
tomography pulmonary angiographies, use it to compare the sensitivity and false positive rate
of current algorithms and to develop new methods that improve such metrics. Methods: 91 Computed
tomography pulmonary angiography scans were annotated by at least one radiologist by segmenting
all pulmonary emboli visible on the study. 20 annotated CTPAs were open to the public in the form of
a medical image analysis challenge. 20 more were kept for evaluation purposes. 51 were made available
post-challenge. 8 submissions, 6 of them novel, were evaluated on the 20 evaluation CTPAs. Performance
was measured as per embolus sensitivity vs. false positives per scan curve. Results: The best algorithms
achieved a per-embolus sensitivity of 75% at 2 false positives per scan (fps) or of 70% at 1 fps, outperforming
the state of the art. Deep learning approaches outperformed traditional machine learning ones,
and their performance improved with the number of training cases. Significance: Through this work
and challenge we have improved the state-of-the art of computer aided detection algorithms for
pulmonary embolism. An open database and an evaluation benchmark for such algorithms have been
generated, easing the development of further improvements. Implications on clinical practice
will need further research.
