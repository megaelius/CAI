The onerous task of repeatedly resolving certain parametrized partial differential equations
(pPDEs) in, e.g. the optimization context, makes it imperative to design vastly more efficient
numerical solvers without sacrificing any accuracy. The reduced basis method (RBM) presents itself
as such an option. With a mathematically rigorous error estimator, RBM seeks a surrogate solution
in a carefully-built subspace of the parameter-induced high fidelity solution manifold. It can
improve efficiency by several orders of magnitudes leveraging an offline-online decomposition
procedure. However, this decomposition, usually through the empirical interpolation method
(EIM) when the PDE is nonlinear or its parameter dependence nonaffine, is either challenging to
implement, or severely degrading to the online efficiency. In this paper, we augment and extend
the EIM approach in the context of solving pPDEs in two different ways, resulting in the Reduced Over-Collocation
methods (ROC). These are stable and capable of avoiding the efficiency degradation inherent to
a direct application of EIM. There are two ingredients of these methods. First is a strategy to collocate
at about twice as many locations as the number of bases for the surrogate space. The second is an efficient
approach for the strategic selection of the parameter values to build the reduced solution space
for which we study two choices, a recent empirical L1 approach and a new indicator based on the reduced
residual. Together, these two ingredients render the schemes, L1-ROC and R2-ROC, online efficient
and immune from the efficiency degradation of EIM for nonlinear and nonaffine problems offline
and online. Numerical tests on three different families of nonlinear problems demonstrate the
high efficiency and accuracy of these new algorithms and their superior stability performance.
