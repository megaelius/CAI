In modern cryptography, block encryption is a fundamental cryptographic primitive. However,
it is impossible for block encryption to achieve the same security as one-time pad. Quantum mechanics
has changed the modern cryptography, and lots of researches have shown that quantum cryptography
can outperform the limitation of traditional cryptography. This article proposes a new constructive
mode for private quantum encryption, named $\mathcal{EHE}$, which is a very simple method to construct
quantum encryption from classical primitive. Based on $\mathcal{EHE}$ mode, we construct a quantum
block encryption (QBE) scheme from pseudorandom functions. If the pseudorandom functions are
standard secure, our scheme is indistinguishable encryption under chosen plaintext attack. If
the pseudorandom functions are permutation on the key space, our scheme can achieve perfect security.
In our scheme, the key can be reused and the randomness cannot, so a $2n$-bit key can be used in an exponential
number of encryptions, where the randomness will be refreshed in each time of encryption. Thus $2n$-bit
key can perfectly encrypt $O(n2^n)$ qubits, and the perfect secrecy would not be broken if the $2n$-bit
key is reused for only exponential times. Comparing with quantum one-time pad (QOTP), our scheme
can be the same secure as QOTP, and the secret key can be reused (no matter whether the eavesdropping
exists or not). Thus, the limitation of perfectly secure encryption (Shannon's theory) is broken
in the quantum setting. Moreover, our scheme can be viewed as a positive answer to the open problem
in quantum cryptography "how to unconditionally reuse or recycle the whole key of private-key quantum
encryption". In order to physically implement the QBE scheme, we only need to implement two kinds
of single-qubit gates (Pauli $X$ gate and Hadamard gate), so it is within reach of current quantum
technology.
