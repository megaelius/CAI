With the rapid development of manufacturing industry, machine fault diagnosis has become increasingly
significant to ensure safe equipment operation and production. Consequently, multifarious approaches
have been explored and developed in the past years, of which intelligent algorithms develop particularly
rapidly. Convolutional neural network, as a typical representative of intelligent diagnostic
models, has been extensively studied and applied in recent five years, and a large amount of literature
has been published in academic journals and conference proceedings. However, there has not been
a systematic review to cover these studies and make a prospect for the further research. To fill in
this gap, this work attempts to review and summarize the development of the Convolutional Network
based Fault Diagnosis (CNFD) approaches comprehensively. Generally, a typical CNFD framework
is composed of the following steps, namely, data collection, model construction, and feature learning
and decision making, thus this paper is organized by following this stream. Firstly, data collection
process is described, in which several popular datasets are introduced. Then, the fundamental
theory from the basic convolutional neural network to its variants is elaborated. After that, the
applications of CNFD are reviewed in terms of three mainstream directions, i.e. classification,
prediction and transfer diagnosis. Finally, conclusions and prospects are presented to point
out the characteristics of current development, facing challenges and future trends. Last but
not least, it is expected that this work would provide convenience and inspire further exploration
for researchers in this field.
