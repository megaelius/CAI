Case records on identified victims of human trafficking are highly sensitive, yet the ability to
share such data is critical to evidence-based practice and policy development across government,
business, and civil society. We propose new methods to anonymize, publish, and explore data on identified
victims of trafficking, implemented as a single pipeline producing three data artifacts: (1) synthetic
microdata modelled on sensitive case records and released in their place, mitigating the privacy
risk that traffickers might link distinctive combinations of attributes in published records
to known victims; (2) aggregate data summarizing the precomputed frequencies of all short attribute
combinations, mitigating the utility risk that synthetic data might misrepresent statistics
needed for official reporting; and (3) visual analytics interfaces for parallel exploration and
evaluation of synthetic data representations and sensitive data aggregates, mitigating the accessibility
risk that privacy mechanisms or analysis tools might not be understandable or usable by all stakeholders.
Central to our mitigation of these risks is the notion of k-synthetic data, which we generate through
a distributed machine learning pipeline. k-synthetic data preserves privacy by ensuring that
longer combinations of attributes are not rare in the sensitive dataset and thus potentially identifying;
it preserves utility by ensuring that shorter combinations of attributes are both present and frequent
in the sensitive dataset; and it improves accessibility by being easy to explain and apply. We present
our work as a design study motivated by the goal of creating a new privacy-preserving data platform
for the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC), transforming how the world's largest
database of identified victims is made available for global collaboration against human trafficking.
