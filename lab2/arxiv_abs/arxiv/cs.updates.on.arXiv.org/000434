The depth-$3$ model has recently gained much importance, as it has become a stepping-stone to understanding
general arithmetic circuits. Its restriction to multilinearity has known exponential lower bounds
but no nontrivial blackbox identity tests. In this paper we take a step towards designing such hitting-sets.
We define a notion of distance for multilinear depth-$3$ circuits (say, in $n$ variables and $k$
product gates) that measures how far are the partitions from a mere refinement. The $1$-distance
strictly subsumes the set-multilinear model, while $n$-distance captures general multilinear
depth-$3$. We design a hitting-set in time poly($n^{\delta\log k}$) for $\delta$-distance. Further,
we give an extension of our result to models where the distance is large (close to $n$) but it is small
when restricted to certain variables. This implies the first subexponential whitebox PIT for the
sum of constantly many set-multilinear depth-$3$ circuits. We also explore a new model of read-once
algebraic branching programs (ROABP) where the factor-matrices are invertible (called invertible-factor
ROABP). We design a hitting-set in time poly($\text{size}^{w^2}$) for width-$w$ invertible-factor
ROABP. Further, we could do without the invertibility restriction when $w=2$. Previously, the
best result for width-$2$ ROABP was quasi-polynomial time (Forbes-Saptharishi-Shpilka, arXiv
2013). The common thread in all these results is the phenomenon of low-support `rank concentration'.
We exploit the structure of these models to prove rank-concentration after a `small shift' in the
variables. Our proof techniques are stronger than the results of Agrawal-Saha-Saxena (STOC 2013)
and Forbes-Saptharishi-Shpilka (arXiv 2013); giving us quasi-polynomial-time hitting-sets
for models where no subexponential whitebox algorithms were known before.
