The approach develops Wheeler concept of Observer Participator Bit, defines information process
from probabilistic observation, emerging time space microprocess, entanglement, qubit, encoding
bits, evolving macroprocess, and extends to Observer information self-organization,cognition,intelligence,and
understanding communicating information. Studying information originating in quantum process
focuses not on particle physics but on natural interactive impulse modeling standard unit of information
Bit composing information observer. Information emerges from random field of Kolmogorov probabilities
when sequences of 1-0 probabilities link the Bayesian Markov process probabilities increasing
each posteriori correlation and reducing conditional entropy measures. These objective yes-no
probabilities measure virtual probing impulses in observation which process interactive impulse
cutting the correlation entropy that reveals information hidden in the correlation connections.
Inside merging probing impulse emerges microprocess with yes-no conjugated entangled entropy
and geometry. Cutting information of observing process moves and self-organizes information
geometrical structure creating Information Observer. Virtual observation has symmetric temporal
time arrow, information observer holds the asymmetric physical. The impulse conversion of observing
uncertainty to certainty under complimentary maxmin minimax principle unifies observer regularities:
integral measuring observing process in multiple trials, generation of impulse microprocess
and multiimpulse macroprocess, enclosing macrodynamics in information network IN logic. Observer
self-creates hierarchical cognition which self-encodes the observer intelligence in multilevel
encoding. The logic requests new information extending the intelligence code. Communicating
observers enable understanding the message meaning.
