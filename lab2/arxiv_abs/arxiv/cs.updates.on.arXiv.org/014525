The imbalanced data classification is one of the most crucial tasks facing modern data analysis.
Especially when combined with other difficulty factors, such as the presence of noise, overlapping
class distributions, and small disjuncts, data imbalance can significantly impact the classification
performance. Furthermore, some of the data difficulty factors are known to affect the performance
of the existing oversampling strategies, in particular SMOTE and its derivatives. This effect
is especially pronounced in the multi-class setting, in which the mutual imbalance relationships
between the classes complicate even further. Despite that, most of the contemporary research in
the area of data imbalance focuses on the binary classification problems, while their more difficult
multi-class counterparts are relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel oversampling
technique, a Multi-Class Combined Cleaning and Resampling (MC-CCR) algorithm. The proposed method
utilizes an energy-based approach to modeling the regions suitable for oversampling, less affected
by small disjuncts and outliers than SMOTE. It combines it with a simultaneous cleaning operation,
the aim of which is to reduce the effect of overlapping class distributions on the performance of
the learning algorithms. Finally, by incorporating a dedicated strategy of handling the multi-class
problems, MC-CCR is less affected by the loss of information about the inter-class relationships
than the traditional multi-class decomposition strategies. Based on the results of experimental
research carried out for many multi-class imbalanced benchmark datasets, the high robust of the
proposed approach to noise was shown, as well as its high quality compared to the state-of-art methods.
