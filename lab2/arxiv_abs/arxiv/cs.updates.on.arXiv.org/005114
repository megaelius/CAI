This study aims to investigate the Taiwanese researchers' awareness toward bibliometric indicators
and the principles from Leiden Manifesto. The online survey was conducted and obtained a total of
417 valid responses. The results show that evoking the right concept of use of bibliometric indicators
and research evaluation has a long way to go. The lack of recognition of bibliometric indicators
exists in Taiwanese academia. Generally speaking, researchers may hear of the certain indicator,
but they are not familiar with its definition and calculation process. Only JIF and h-index are considered
as well-known indicators. The results also suggest that the ten principles from Leiden Manifesto
can be considered as the universal guideline in research evaluation since most of Taiwanese researchers
agree the contents. Especially for the principle 6 "Account for variation by field in publication
and citation practices" has highest degree of agreement. However, it is interesting to compare
the result of recognition of relative citation ratio, only few researchers have fully understood
the definition. This result indicates the scientometricians should make more effort to disseminate
the concept of field-normalization in bibliometric indicators. The researchers do have understanding
about the importance of comparison on the same basis, at the meantime, they may use the inappropriate
indicators just because of lacking of enough knowledge on the variety of indicators. Hence, it is
important to initiate the education of informetrics to all of the stakeholders in research evaluation
so that the misuse and abuse of bibliometric indicators may possibly not happen again, and the bibliometric
analysis is able to turn to contextualization-based analysis in the future.
