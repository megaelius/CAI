The study of student engagement has attracted growing interests to address problems such as low
academic performance, disaffection, and high dropout rates. Existing approaches to measuring
student engagement typically rely on survey-based instruments. While effective, those approaches
are time-consuming and labour-intensive. Meanwhile, both the response rate and quality of the
survey are usually poor. As an alternative, in this paper, we investigate whether we can infer and
predict engagement at multiple dimensions, just using sensors. We hypothesize that multidimensional
student engagement can be translated into physiological responses and activity changes during
the class, and also be affected by the environmental changes. Therefore, we aim to explore the following
questions: Can we measure the multiple dimensions of high school student's learning engagement
including emotional, behavioural and cognitive engagement with sensing data in the wild? Can we
derive the activity, physiological, and environmental factors contributing to the different
dimensions of student engagement? If yes, which sensors are the most useful in differentiating
each dimension of the engagement? Then, we conduct an in-situ study in a high school from 23 students
and 6 teachers in 144 classes over 11 courses for 4 weeks. We present the n-Gage, a student engagement
sensing system using a combination of sensors from wearables and environments to automatically
detect student in-class multidimensional learning engagement. Experiment results show that
n-Gage can accurately predict multidimensional student engagement in real-world scenarios with
an average MAE of 0.788 and RMSE of 0.975 using all the sensors. We also show a set of interesting findings
of how different factors (e.g., combinations of sensors, school subjects, CO2 level) affect each
dimension of the student learning engagement.
