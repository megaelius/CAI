We consider here an extended SIR model, including several features of the recent COVID-19 outbreak:
in particular the infected and recovered individuals can either be detected (+) or undetected (-)
and we also integrate an intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Our model enables a tractable quantitative
analysis of the optimal policy for the control of the epidemic dynamics using both lockdown and detection
intervention levers. With parametric specification based on literature on COVID-19, we investigate
the sensitivities of various quantities on the optimal strategies, taking into account the subtle
trade-off between the sanitary and the socio-economic cost of the pandemic, together with the limited
capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as an intervention structured in
4 successive phases: First a quick and strong lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth
of the contagion; second a short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long
period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to normal social interactions
with disappearance of the virus. The optimal scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection,
provided the lockdown is released sufficiently slowly. We also provide optimal intervention measures
with increasing ICU capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on detection of infectious
and immune individuals. Whenever massive resources are introduced to detect infected individuals,
the pressure on social distancing can be released, whereas the impact of detection of immune individuals
reveals to be more moderate.
