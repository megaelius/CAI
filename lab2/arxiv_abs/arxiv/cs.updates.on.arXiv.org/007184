Knowledge of whole heart anatomy is a prerequisite for many clinical applications. Whole heart
segmentation (WHS), which delineates substructures of the heart, can be very valuable for modeling
and analysis of the anatomy and functions of the heart. However, automating this segmentation can
be arduous due to the large variation of the heart shape, and different image qualities of the clinical
data. To achieve this goal, a set of training data is generally needed for constructing priors or
for training. In addition, it is difficult to perform comparisons between different methods, largely
due to differences in the datasets and evaluation metrics used. This manuscript presents the methodologies
and evaluation results for the WHS algorithms selected from the submissions to the Multi-Modality
Whole Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2017. The challenge provides
120 three-dimensional cardiac images covering the whole heart, including 60 CT and 60 MRI volumes,
all acquired in clinical environments with manual delineation. Ten algorithms for CT data and eleven
algorithms for MRI data, submitted from twelve groups, have been evaluated. The results show that
many of the deep learning (DL) based methods achieved high accuracy, even though the number of training
datasets was limited. A number of them also reported poor results in the blinded evaluation, probably
due to overfitting in their training. The conventional algorithms, mainly based on multi-atlas
segmentation, demonstrated robust and stable performance, even though the accuracy is not as good
as the best DL method in CT segmentation. The challenge, including the provision of the annotated
training data and the blinded evaluation for submitted algorithms on the test data, continues as
an ongoing benchmarking resource via its homepage (\url{www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mmwhs/}).
