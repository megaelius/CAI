Automatic lesion segmentation in dermoscopy images is an essential step for computer-aided diagnosis
of melanoma. The dermoscopy images exhibits rotational and reflectional symmetry, however, this
geometric property has not been encoded in the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks
based skin lesion segmentation methods. In this paper, we present a deeply supervised rotation
equivariant network for skin lesion segmentation by extending the recent group rotation equivariant
network~\cite{cohen2016group}. Specifically, we propose the G-upsampling and G-projection
operations to adapt the rotation equivariant classification network for our skin lesion segmentation
problem. To further increase the performance, we integrate the deep supervision scheme into our
proposed rotation equivariant segmentation architecture. The whole framework is equivariant
to input transformations, including rotation and reflection, which improves the network efficiency
and thus contributes to the segmentation performance. We extensively evaluate our method on the
ISIC 2017 skin lesion challenge dataset. The experimental results show that our rotation equivariant
networks consistently excel the regular counterparts with the same model complexity under different
experimental settings. Our best model achieves 77.23\%(JA) on the test dataset, outperforming
the state-of-the-art challenging methods and further demonstrating the effectiveness of our
proposed deeply supervised rotation equivariant segmentation network. Our best model also outperforms
the state-of-the-art challenging methods, which further demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed deeply supervised rotation equivariant segmentation network.
