The Analog Ensemble (AnEn) method tries to estimate the probability distribution of the future
state of the atmosphere with a set of past observations that correspond to the best analogs of a deterministic
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). This model post-processing method has been successfully
used to improve the forecast accuracy for several weather-related applications including air
quality, and short-term wind and solar power forecasting, to name a few. In order to provide a meaningful
probabilistic forecast, the AnEn method requires storing a historical set of past predictions
and observations in memory for a period of at least several months and spanning the seasons relevant
for the prediction of interest. Although the memory and computing costs of the AnEn method are less
expensive than using a brute-force dynamical ensemble approach, for a large number of stations
and large datasets, the amount of memory required for AnEn can easily become prohibitive. Furthermore,
in order to find the best analogs associated with a certain prediction produced by a NWP model, the
current approach requires searching over the entire dataset by applying a certain metric. This
approach requires applying the metric over the entire historical dataset, which may take a substantial
amount of time. In this work, we investigate an alternative way to implement the AnEn method using
deep generative models. By doing so, a generative model can entirely or partially replace the dataset
of pairs of predictions and observations, reducing the amount of memory required to produce the
probabilistic forecast by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the generative model can
generate a meaningful set of analogs associated with a certain forecast in constant time without
performing any search, saving a considerable amount of time even in the presence of huge historical
datasets.
