Recently there has been a growing concern about machine bias, where trained statistical models
grow to reflect controversial societal asymmetries, such as gender or racial bias. A significant
number of AI tools have recently been suggested to be harmfully biased towards some minority, with
reports of racist criminal behavior predictors, Iphone X failing to differentiate between two
Asian people and Google photos' mistakenly classifying black people as gorillas. Although a systematic
study of such biases can be difficult, we believe that automated translation tools can be exploited
through gender neutral languages to yield a window into the phenomenon of gender bias in AI. In this
paper, we start with a comprehensive list of job positions from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) and used it to build sentences in constructions like "He/She is an Engineer" in 12 different
gender neutral languages such as Hungarian, Chinese, Yoruba, and several others. We translate
these sentences into English using the Google Translate API, and collect statistics about the frequency
of female, male and gender-neutral pronouns in the translated output. We show that GT exhibits a
strong tendency towards male defaults, in particular for fields linked to unbalanced gender distribution
such as STEM jobs. We ran these statistics against BLS' data for the frequency of female participation
in each job position, showing that GT fails to reproduce a real-world distribution of female workers.
We provide experimental evidence that even if one does not expect in principle a 50:50 pronominal
gender distribution, GT yields male defaults much more frequently than what would be expected from
demographic data alone. We are hopeful that this work will ignite a debate about the need to augment
current statistical translation tools with debiasing techniques which can already be found in
the scientific literature.
