Being one of the most promising applications enabled by connected and automated vehicles (CAV)
technology, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is expected to be deployed in the near term
on public roads.} Thus far, the majority of the CACC studies have been focusing on the overall network
performance with limited insights on the potential impacts of CAVs on human-driven vehicles (HVs).This
paper aims to quantify such impacts by studying the high-resolution vehicle trajectory data that
are obtained from microscopic simulation. Two platoon clustering strategies for CACC- an ad hoc
coordination strategy and a local coordination strategy-are implemented. Results show that the
local coordination outperforms the ad hoc coordination across all tested market penetration rates
(MPRs) in terms of network throughput and productivity. According to the two-sample Kolmogorov-\textcolor{re}{Smirnov}
test, however, the distributions of the hard braking events (as a potential safety impact) for HVs
change significantly under local coordination strategy. For both of the clustering strategy,
CAVs increase the average lane change frequency for HVs. The break-even point for average lane change
frequency between the two strategies is observed at 30% MPR, which decreases from 5.42 to 5.38 per
vehicle. The average lane change frequency following a monotonically increasing pattern in response
to MPR, and it reaches the highest 5.48 per vehicle at 40% MPR. Lastly, the interaction state of the
car-following model for HVs is analyzed. It is revealed that the composition of the interaction
state could be influenced by CAVs as well. One of the apparent trends is that the time spent on approaching
state declines with the increasing presence of CAVs.
