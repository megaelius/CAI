We present ParaDRAM, a high-performance Parallel Delayed-Rejection Adaptive Metropolis Markov
Chain Monte Carlo software for optimization, sampling, and integration of mathematical objective
functions encountered in scientific inference. ParaDRAM is currently accessible from several
popular programming languages including C/C++, Fortran, MATLAB, Python and is part of the ParaMonte
open-source project with the following principal design goals: 1. full automation of Monte Carlo
simulations, 2. interoperability of the core library with as many programming languages as possible,
thus, providing a unified Application Programming Interface and Monte Carlo simulation environment
across all programming languages, 3. high-performance 4. parallelizability and scalability
of simulations from personal laptops to supercomputers, 5. virtually zero-dependence on external
libraries, 6. fully-deterministic reproducibility of simulations, 7. automatic comprehensive
reporting and post-processing of the simulation results. We present and discuss several novel
techniques implemented in ParaDRAM to automatically and dynamically ensure the good-mixing and
the diminishing-adaptation of the resulting pseudo-Markov chains from ParaDRAM. We also discuss
the implementation of an efficient data storage method used in ParaDRAM that reduces the average
memory and storage requirements of the algorithm by, a factor of 4 for simple simulation problems,
to an order of magnitude and more for sampling complex high-dimensional mathematical objective
functions. Finally, we discuss how the design goals of ParaDRAM can help users readily and efficiently
solve a variety of machine learning and scientific inference problems on a wide range of computing
platforms.
