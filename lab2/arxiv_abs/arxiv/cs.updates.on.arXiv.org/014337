A densely-sampled light field (LF) is highly desirable in various applications, such as 3-D reconstruction,
post-capture refocusing and virtual reality. However, it is costly to acquire such data. Although
many computational methods have been proposed to reconstruct a densely-sampled LF from a sparsely-sampled
one, they still suffer from either low reconstruction quality, low computational efficiency,
or the restriction on the regularity of the sampling pattern. To this end, we propose a novel learning-based
method, which accepts sparsely-sampled LFs with irregular structures, and produces densely-sampled
LFs with arbitrary angular resolution accurately and efficiently. We also propose a simple yet
effective method for optimizing the sampling pattern. Our proposed method, an end-to-end trainable
network, reconstructs a densely-sampled LF in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, the coarse
sub-aperture image (SAI) synthesis module first explores the scene geometry from an unstructured
sparsely-sampled LF and leverages it to independently synthesize novel SAIs, in which a confidence-based
blending strategy is proposed to fuse the information from different input SAIs, giving an intermediate
densely-sampled LF. Then, the efficient LF refinement module learns the angular relationship
within the intermediate result to recover the LF parallax structure. Comprehensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method on both real-world and synthetic LF images
when compared with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we illustrate the benefits and advantages
of the proposed approach when applied in various LF-based applications, including image-based
rendering and depth estimation enhancement.
