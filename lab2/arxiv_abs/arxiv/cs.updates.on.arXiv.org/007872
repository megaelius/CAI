Although state-of-the-art PDF malware classifiers can be trained with almost perfect test accuracy
(99%) and extremely low false positive rate (under 0.1%), it has been shown that even a simple adversary
can evade them. A practically useful malware classifier must be robust against evasion attacks.
However, achieving such robustness is an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we take the
first steps towards training robust PDF malware classifiers with verifiable robustness properties.
For instance, a robustness property can enforce that no matter how many pages from benign documents
are inserted into a PDF malware, the classifier must still classify it as malicious. We demonstrate
how the worst-case behavior of a malware classifier with respect to specific robustness properties
can be formally verified. Furthermore, we find that training classifiers that satisfy formally
verified robustness properties can increase the computation cost of unbounded (i.e., not bounded
by the robustness properties) attackers by eliminating simple evasion attacks. Specifically,
we propose a new distance metric that operates on the PDF tree structure and specify two classes of
robustness properties including subtree insertions and deletions. We utilize state-of-the-art
verifiably robust training method to build robust PDF malware classifiers. Our results show that,
we can achieve 99% verified robust accuracy, while maintaining 99.80% accuracy and 0.41% false
positive rate. With simple robustness properties, the state-of-the-art unbounded attacker found
no successful evasion on the robust classifier in 6 hours. Even for a new unbounded adaptive attacker
we have designed, the number of successful evasions within a fixed time budget is cut down by 4x.
