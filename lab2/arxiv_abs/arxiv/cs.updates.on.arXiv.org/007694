Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in clinical practice for visualizing both biological
structure and function, but its use has been traditionally limited by its slow data acquisition.
Recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) techniques for MRI that exploit sparsity models of images
reduce acquisition time while maintaining high image quality. Whereas classical CS assumes the
images are sparse in a known analytical dictionary or transform domain, methods that use learned
image models for reconstruction have become popular in recent years. The model could be learned
from a dataset and used for reconstruction or learned simultaneously with the reconstruction,
a technique called blind CS (BCS). While the well-known synthesis dictionary model has been exploited
for MRI reconstruction, recent advances in transform learning (TL) provide an efficient alternative
framework for sparse modeling in MRI. TL-based methods enjoy numerous advantages including exact
sparse coding, transform update, and clustering solutions, cheap computation, and convergence
guarantees, and provide high quality results in MRI as well as in other inverse problems compared
to popular competing methods. This paper provides a review of key works in MRI reconstruction from
limited data, with focus on the recent class of TL-based reconstruction methods. A unified framework
for incorporating various TL-based models is presented. We discuss the connections between transform
learning and convolutional or filterbank models and corresponding multi-layer extensions, as
well as connections to unsupervised and supervised deep learning. Finally, we discuss recent trends
in MRI, open problems, and future directions for the field.
