Few-shot learning aims to learn a new concept when only a few training examples are available, which
has been extensively explored in recent years. However, most of the current works heavily rely on
a large-scale labeled auxiliary set to train their models in an episodic-training paradigm. Such
a kind of supervised setting basically limits the widespread use of few-shot learning algorithms,
especially in real-world applications. Instead, in this paper, we develop a novel framework called
\emph{Unsupervised Few-shot Learning via Distribution Shift-based Data Augmentation} (ULDA),
which pays attention to the distribution diversity inside each constructed pretext few-shot task
when using data augmentation. Importantly, we highlight the value and importance of the distribution
diversity in the augmentation-based pretext few-shot tasks. In ULDA, we systemically investigate
the effects of different augmentation techniques and propose to strengthen the distribution diversity
(or difference) between the query set and support set in each few-shot task, by augmenting these
two sets separately (i.e. shifting). In this way, even incorporated with simple augmentation techniques
(e.g. random crop, color jittering, or rotation), our ULDA can produce a significant improvement.
In the experiments, few-shot models learned by ULDA can achieve superior generalization performance
and obtain state-of-the-art results in a variety of established few-shot learning tasks on \emph{mini}ImageNet
and \emph{tiered}ImageNet. %The code will be released soon. The source code is available in \textcolor{blue}{\emph{https://github.com/WonderSeven/ULDA}}.
