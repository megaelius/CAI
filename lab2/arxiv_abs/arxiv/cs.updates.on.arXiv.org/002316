Stochastic geometry models are used to study wireless networks, particularly cellular phone networks,
but most of the research focuses on the typical user, often ignoring atypical events, which can be
highly disruptive and of interest to network operators. We examine atypical events when a unexpected
large proportion of users are disconnected or connected by proposing a hybrid approach based on
ray launching simulation and point process theory. This work is motivated by recent results using
large deviations theory applied to the signal-to-interference ratio. This theory provides a tool
for the stochastic analysis of atypical but disruptive events, particularly when the density of
transmitters is high. For a section of a European city, we introduce a new stochastic model of a single
network cell that uses ray launching data generated with the open source RaLaNS package, giving
deterministic path loss values. We collect statistics on the fraction of (dis)connected users
in the uplink, and observe that the probability of an unexpected large proportion of disconnected
users decreases exponentially when the transmitter density increases. This observation implies
that denser networks become more stable in the sense that the probability of the fraction of (dis)connected
users deviating from its mean, is exponentially small. We also empirically obtain and illustrate
the density of users for network configurations in the disruptive event, which highlights the fact
that such bottleneck behaviour not only stems from too many users at the cell boundary, but also from
the near-far effect of many users in the immediate vicinity of the base station. We discuss the implications
of these findings and outline possible future research directions.
