According to data from the United Nations, more than 3000 people have died each day in the world due
to road traffic collision. Considering recent researches, the human error may be considered as
the main responsible for these fatalities. Because of this, researchers seek alternatives to transfer
the vehicle control from people to autonomous systems. However, providing this technological
innovation for the people may demand complex challenges in the legal, economic and technological
areas. Consequently, carmakers and researchers have divided the driving automation in safety
and emergency systems that improve the driver perception on the road. This may reduce the human error.
Therefore, the main contribution of this study is to propose a driving simulator platform to develop
and evaluate safety and emergency systems, in the first design stage. This driving simulator platform
has an advantage: a flexible software structure.This allows in the simulation one adaptation for
development or evaluation of a system. The proposed driving simulator platform was tested in two
applications: cooperative vehicle system development and the influence evaluation of a Driving
Assistance System (\textit{DAS}) on a driver. In the cooperative vehicle system development,
the results obtained show that the increment of the time delay in the communication among vehicles
($V2V$) is determinant for the system performance. On the other hand, in the influence evaluation
of a \textit{DAS} in a driver, it was possible to conclude that the \textit{DAS'} model does not have
the level of influence necessary in a driver to avoid an accident.
