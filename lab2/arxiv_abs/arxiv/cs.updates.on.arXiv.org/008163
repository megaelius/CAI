Purpose: Recently, several attempts were conducted to transfer deep learning to medical image
reconstruction. An increasingly number of publications follow the concept of embedding the CT
reconstruction as a known operator into a neural network. However, most of the approaches presented
lack an efficient CT reconstruction framework fully integrated into deep learning environments.
As a result, many approaches are forced to use workarounds for mathematically unambiguously solvable
problems. Methods: PYRO-NN is a generalized framework to embed known operators into the prevalent
deep learning framework Tensorflow. The current status includes state-of-the-art parallel-,
fan- and cone-beam projectors and back-projectors accelerated with CUDA provided as Tensorflow
layers. On top, the framework provides a high level Python API to conduct FBP and iterative reconstruction
experiments with data from real CT systems. Results: The framework provides all necessary algorithms
and tools to design end-to-end neural network pipelines with integrated CT reconstruction algorithms.
The high level Python API allows a simple use of the layers as known from Tensorflow. To demonstrate
the capabilities of the layers, the framework comes with three baseline experiments showing a cone-beam
short scan FDK reconstruction, a CT reconstruction filter learning setup, and a TV regularized
iterative reconstruction. All algorithms and tools are referenced to a scientific publication
and are compared to existing non deep learning reconstruction frameworks. The framework is available
as open-source software at \url{https://github.com/csyben/PYRO-NN}. Conclusions: PYRO-NN
comes with the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow and allows to setup end-to-end trainable
neural networks in the medical image reconstruction context. We believe that the framework will
be a step towards reproducible research
