Community detection is a fundamental problem in social network analysis consisting, roughly speaking,
in dividing social actors (modelled as nodes in a social graph) with certain social connections
(modelled as edges in the social graph) into densely knitted and highly related groups with each
group well separated from the others. Classical approaches for community detection usually deal
only with the structure of the network and ignore features of the nodes, although major real-world
networks provide additional actors' information such as age, gender, interests, etc., traditionally
called node attributes. It is known that the attributes may clarify and enrich the knowledge about
the actors and give sense to the detected communities. This has led to a relatively novel direction
in community detection --- constructing algorithms that use both the structure and the attributes
of the network (modelled already via a node-attributed graph) to yield more informative and qualitative
results. During the last decade many methods based on different ideas and techniques have appeared
in this direction. Although there exist some partial overviews of them, a recent survey is a necessity
as the growing number of the methods may cause uncertainty in practice. In this paper we aim at clarifying
the overall situation by proposing a clear classification of the methods and providing a comprehensive
survey of the available results. We not only group and analyse the corresponding methods but also
focus on practical aspects, including the information which methods outperform others and which
datasets and quality measures are used for evaluation.
