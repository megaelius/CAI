Starting with Michail, Chatzigiannakis, and Spirakis work, the problem of Counting the number
of nodes in Anonymous Dynamic Networks has attracted a lot of attention. The problem is challenging
because nodes are indistinguishable (they lack identifiers and execute the same program) and the
topology may change arbitrarily from round to round of communication, as long as the network is connected
in each round. The problem is central in distributed computing as the number of participants is frequently
needed to make important decisions, such as termination, agreement, synchronization, and many
others. A variety of algorithms built on top of mass-distribution techniques have been presented,
analyzed, and also experimentally evaluated; some of them assumed additional knowledge of network
characteristics, such as bounded degree or given upper bound on the network size. However, the question
of whether Counting can be solved deterministically in sub-exponential time remained open. In
this work, we answer this question positively by presenting Methodical Counting, which runs in
polynomial time and requires no knowledge of network characteristics. Moreover, we also show how
to extend Methodical Counting to compute the sum of input values and more complex functions without
extra cost. Our analysis leverages previous work on random walks in evolving graphs, combined with
carefully chosen alarms in the algorithm that control the process and its parameters. To the best
of our knowledge, our Counting algorithm and its extensions to other algebraic and Boolean functions
are the first that can be implemented in practice with worst-case guarantees.
