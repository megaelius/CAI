The past few years have witnessed the great potential of exploiting channel state information retrieved
from commodity WiFi devices for respiration monitoring. However, existing approaches only work
when the target is close to the WiFi transceivers and the performance degrades significantly when
the target is far away. On the other hand, most home environments only have one WiFi access point and
it may not be located in the same room as the target. This sensing range constraint greatly limits
the application of the proposed approaches in real life. This paper presents FarSense--the first
real-time system that can reliably monitor human respiration when the target is far away from the
WiFi transceiver pair. FarSense works well even when one of the transceivers is located in another
room, moving a big step towards real-life deployment. We propose two novel schemes to achieve this
goal: (1) Instead of applying the raw CSI readings of individual antenna for sensing, we employ the
ratio of CSI readings from two antennas, whose noise is mostly canceled out by the division operation
to significantly increase the sensing range; (2) The division operation further enables us to utilize
the phase information which is not usable with one single antenna for sensing. The orthogonal amplitude
and phase are elaborately combined to address the "blind spots" issue and further increase the sensing
range. Extensive experiments show that FarSense is able to accurately monitor human respiration
even when the target is 8 meters away from the transceiver pair, increasing the sensing range by more
than 100%. We believe this is the first system to enable through-wall respiration sensing with commodity
WiFi devices and the proposed method could also benefit other sensing applications.
