We study an optimal control problem for a multi-agent system modeled by an undirected formation
graph with nodes describing the kinematics of each agent, given by a left invariant control system
on a Lie group. The agents should avoid collision between them in the workspace. This is accomplished
by introducing appropriate potential functions into the cost functional for the optimal control
problem, corresponding to fictitious forces, induced by the formation constraint among agents,
that break the symmetry of the individual agents and the cost functions, and render the optimal control
problem partially invariant by a Lie group of symmetries. Reduced necessary conditions for the
existence of normal extrema are obtained using techniques from variational calculus on manifolds.
The Hamiltonian formalism associated with the optimal control problem is explored through an application
of Pontryagin's maximum principle for left-invariant systems where necessary conditions for
the existence of normal extrema are obtained as integral curves of a Hamiltonian vector field associated
to a reduced Hamiltonian function. By means of the Legendre transformation we show the equivalence
of both frameworks. The discrete-time version of optimal control for multi-agent systems is studied
in order to develop a variational integrator based on the discretization of an augmented cost functional
in analogy with the Hamiltonian picture of the problem through the Hamilton-Pontryagin variational
principle. Such integrator defines a well defined (local) flow to integrate the necessary conditions
for local extrema in the optimal control problem. As an application we study an optimal control problem
for multiple unicycles.
