Given a graph G, a q-open neighborhood conflict-free coloring or q-ONCF-coloring is a vertex coloring
$c:V(G) \rightarrow \{1,2,\ldots,q\}$ such that for each vertex $v \in V(G)$ there is a vertex in
$N(v)$ that is uniquely colored from the rest of the vertices in $N(v)$. When we replace $N(v)$ by
the closed neighborhood $N[v]$, then we call such a coloring a q-closed neighborhood conflict-free
coloring or simply q-CNCF-coloring. In this paper, we study the NP-hard decision questions of whether
for a constant q an input graph has a q-ONCF-coloring or a q-CNCF-coloring. We will study these two
problems in the parameterized setting. First of all, we study running time bounds on FPT-algorithms
for these problems, when parameterized by treewidth. We improve the existing upper bounds, and
also provide lower bounds on the running time under ETH and SETH. Secondly, we study the kernelization
complexity of both problems, using vertex cover as the parameter. We show that both $(q \geq 2)$-ONCF-coloring
and $(q \geq 3)$-CNCF-coloring cannot have polynomial kernels when parameterized by the size of
a vertex cover unless $NP \in coNP/poly$. However, we obtain a polynomial kernel for 2-CNCF-coloring
parameterized by vertex cover. We conclude with some combinatorial results. Denote $\chi_{ON}(G)$
and $\chi_{CN}(G)$ to be the minimum number of colors required to ONCF-color and CNCF-color G, respectively.
Upper bounds on $\chi_{CN}(G)$ with respect to structural parameters like minimum vertex cover
size, minimum feedback vertex set size and treewidth are known. To the best of our knowledge only
an upper bound on $\chi_{ON}(G)$ with respect to minimum vertex cover size was known. We provide
tight bounds for $\chi_{ON}(G)$ with respect to minimum vertex cover size. Also, we provide the
first upper bounds on $\chi_{ON}(G)$ with respect to minimum feedback vertex set size and treewidth.
