Precise and efficient automated identification of Gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases can help
doctors treat more patients and improve the rate of disease detection and identification. Currently,
automatic analysis of diseases in the GI tract is a hot topic in both computer science and medical-related
journals. Nevertheless, the evaluation of such an automatic analysis is often incomplete or simply
wrong. Algorithms are often only tested on small and biased datasets, and cross-dataset evaluations
are rarely performed. A clear understanding of evaluation metrics and machine learning models
with cross datasets is crucial to bring research in the field to a new quality level. Towards this
goal, we present comprehensive evaluations of five distinct machine learning models using Global
Features and Deep Neural Networks that can classify 16 different key types of GI tract conditions,
including pathological findings, anatomical landmarks, polyp removal conditions, and normal
findings from images captured by common GI tract examination instruments. In our evaluation, we
introduce performance hexagons using six performance metrics such as recall, precision, specificity,
accuracy, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient to demonstrate how to determine the
real capabilities of models rather than evaluating them shallowly. Furthermore, we perform cross-dataset
evaluations using different datasets for training and testing. With these cross-dataset evaluations,
we demonstrate the challenge of actually building a generalizable model that could be used across
different hospitals. Our experiments clearly show that more sophisticated performance metrics
and evaluation methods need to be applied to get reliable models rather than depending on evaluations
of the splits of the same dataset, i.e., the performance metrics should always be interpreted together
rather than relying on a single metric.
