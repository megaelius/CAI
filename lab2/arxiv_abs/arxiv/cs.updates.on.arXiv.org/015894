Motion planning under uncertainty is essential for reliable robot operation. Despite substantial
advances over the past decade, the problem remains difficult for systems with complex dynamics.
Most state-of-the-art methods perform search that relies on a large number of forward simulations.
For systems with complex dynamics, this generally require costly numerical integrations which
significantly slows down the planning process. Linearization-based methods have been proposed
that can alleviate the above problem. However, it is not clear how linearization affects the quality
of the generated motion strategy, and when such simplifications are admissible. We propose a non-linearity
measure, called Statistical-distance-based Non-linearity Measure (SNM), that can identify
where linearization is beneficial and where it should be avoided. We show that when the problem is
framed as the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, the value difference between the optimal
strategy for the original model and the linearized model can be upper bounded by a function linear
in SNM. Comparisons with an existing measure on various scenarios indicate that SNM is more suitable
in estimating the effectiveness of linearization-based solvers. To test the applicability of
SNM in motion planning, we propose a simple on-line planner that uses SNM as a heuristic to switch
between a general and a linearization-based solver. Results on a car-like robot with second order
dynamics and 4-DOFs and 7-DOFs torque-controlled manipulators indicate that SNM can appropriately
decide if and when a linearization-based solver should be used.
