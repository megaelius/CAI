This paper studies federated learning (FL) in a classic wireless network, where learning clients
share a common wireless link to a coordinating server to perform federated model training using
their local data. In such wireless federated learning networks (WFLNs), optimizing the learning
performance depends crucially on how clients are selected and how bandwidth is allocated among
the selected clients in every learning round, as both radio and client energy resources are limited.
While existing works have made some attempts to allocate the limited wireless resources to optimize
FL, they focus on the problem in individual learning rounds, overlooking an inherent yet critical
feature of federated learning. This paper brings a new long-term perspective to resource allocation
in WFLNs, realizing that learning rounds are not only temporally interdependent but also have varying
significance towards the final learning outcome. To this end, we first design data-driven experiments
to show that different temporal client selection patterns lead to considerably different learning
performance. With the obtained insights, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem for joint
client selection and bandwidth allocation under long-term client energy constraints, and develop
a new algorithm that utilizes only currently available wireless channel information but can achieve
long-term performance guarantee. Further experiments show that our algorithm results in the desired
temporal client selection pattern, is adaptive to changing network environments and far outperforms
benchmarks that ignore the long-term effect of FL.
