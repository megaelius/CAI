Artificial intelligence has been applied in wildfire science and management since the 1990s, with
early applications including neural networks and expert systems. Since then the field has rapidly
progressed congruently with the wide adoption of machine learning (ML) in the environmental sciences.
Here, we present a scoping review of ML in wildfire science and management. Our objective is to improve
awareness of ML among wildfire scientists and managers, as well as illustrate the challenging range
of problems in wildfire science available to data scientists. We first present an overview of popular
ML approaches used in wildfire science to date, and then review their use in wildfire science within
six problem domains: 1) fuels characterization, fire detection, and mapping; 2) fire weather and
climate change; 3) fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk; 4) fire behavior prediction; 5)
fire effects; and 6) fire management. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of various
ML approaches and identify opportunities for future advances in wildfire science and management
within a data science context. We identified 298 relevant publications, where the most frequently
used ML methods included random forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees,
support vector machines, and genetic algorithms. There exists opportunities to apply more current
ML methods (e.g., deep learning and agent based learning) in wildfire science. However, despite
the ability of ML models to learn on their own, expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure
realistic modelling of fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods
requires sophisticated knowledge for their application. Finally, we stress that the wildfire
research and management community plays an active role in providing relevant, high quality data
for use by practitioners of ML methods.
