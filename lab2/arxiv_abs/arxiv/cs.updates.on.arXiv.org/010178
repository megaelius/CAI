The safety, mobility, environmental, energy, and economic benefits of transportation systems,
which are the focus of recent connected vehicle (CV) programs, are potentially dramatic. However,
realization of these benefits largely hinges on the timely integration of digital technology into
upcoming as well as existing transportation infrastructure. CVs must be enabled to broadcast and
receive data to and from other CVs [vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication], to and from infrastructure
[vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication], and to and from other road users, such as bicyclists
or pedestrians (vehicle-to-other road users communication). Further, the infrastructure and
transportation agencies that manage V2I-focused applications must be able to collect, process,
distribute, and archive these data quickly, reliably, and securely. This paper focuses on V2I applications
and investigates current digital roadway infrastructure initiatives. It highlights the importance
of including digital infrastructure investment alongside investment in more traditional transportation
infrastructure to keep up with the auto industry push toward increasing intervehicular communication.
By studying current CV testbeds and smart-city initiatives, this paper identifies digital infrastructure
being used by public agencies. It also examines public agencies limited budgeting for digital infrastructure
and finds that current expenditure is inadequate for realizing the potential benefits of V2I applications.
Finally, the paper presents a set of recommendations, based on a review of current practices and
future needs, designed to guide agencies responsible for transportation infrastructure. It stresses
the importance of collaboration for establishing national and international platforms for the
planning, deployment, and management of digital infrastructure to support connected transportation
systems.
