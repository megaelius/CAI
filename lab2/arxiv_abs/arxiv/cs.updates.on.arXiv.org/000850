This paper develops the sparse matrix discrete empirical interpolation method, a novel approach
to compute matrix approximations with applications to the reduced order modeling framework. The
technique enables the construction of accurate reduced Jacobian matrices of nonlinear terms and
provides a highly efficient online/offline decomposition. The sparse algorithm developed herein
relies on the discrete empirical interpolation method using only samples of nonzero entries of
the matrix series. The proposed approach can approximate very large matrices, unlike the current
matrix discrete empirical interpolation method which is limited by its large computational memory
requirements. The empirical interpolation indexes obtained by the sparse algorithm differ from
the ones computed by the matrix discrete empirical interpolation method -- the two matrix approximations
are distinct. Numerical experiments use the 1D Burgers and 2D Shallow Water Equations test problems
where the quadratic reduced nonlinearities are computed via discrete empirical interpolation
method. The new sparse strategy is compared against five existing methods for computing reduced
Jacobians: a) matrix discrete empirical interpolation method, b) discrete empirical interpolation
method, c) tensorial calculus, d) full Jacobian projection onto the reduced basis subspace, and
e) directional derivatives of the model along the reduced basis functions. The sparse matrix method
outperforms all other algorithms. The use of matrix discrete empirical interpolation method is
not possible for more than $10^5$ mesh points due to the memory requirements. The reduced order sparse
matrix discrete interpolation Shallow Water Equations model is $1.43,~3.12,~2744,~2759$ and
$3785$ times faster than tensorial, discrete empirical interpolation method, direct projection,
directional derivative, and high-fidelity models, respectively.
