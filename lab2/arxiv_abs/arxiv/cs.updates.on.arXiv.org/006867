Computing environment is moving towards human-centered designs instead of computer centered
designs and human's tend to communicate wealth of information through affective states or expressions.
Traditional Human Computer Interaction (HCI) based systems ignores bulk of information communicated
through those affective states and just caters for user's intentional input. Generally, for evaluating
and benchmarking different facial expression analysis algorithms, standardized databases are
needed to enable a meaningful comparison. In the absence of comparative tests on such standardized
databases it is difficult to find relative strengths and weaknesses of different facial expression
recognition algorithms. In this article we present a novel video database for Children's Spontaneous
facial Expressions (LIRIS-CSE). Proposed video database contains six basic spontaneous facial
expressions shown by 12 ethnically diverse children between the ages of 6 and 12 years with mean age
of 7.3 years. To the best of our knowledge, this database is first of its kind as it records and shows
spontaneous facial expressions of children. Previously there were few database of children expressions
and all of them show posed or exaggerated expressions which are different from spontaneous or natural
expressions. Thus, this database will be a milestone for human behavior researchers. This database
will be a excellent resource for vision community for benchmarking and comparing results. In this
article, we have also proposed framework for automatic expression recognition based on convolutional
neural network (CNN) architecture with transfer learning approach. Proposed architecture achieved
average classification accuracy of 75% on our proposed database i.e. LIRIS-CSE.
