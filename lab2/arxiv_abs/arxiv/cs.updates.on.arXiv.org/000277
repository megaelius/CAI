The polar coordinate transformation (PCT) method has been extensively used to treat various singular
integrals in the boundary element method (BEM). However, the resultant integrands of the PCT tend
to become nearly singular when (1) the aspect ratio of the element is large or (2) the field point is
closed to the element boundary; thus a large number of quadrature points are needed to achieve a relatively
high accuracy. In this paper, the first problem is circumvented by using a conformal transformation
so that the geometry of the curved physical element is preserved in the transformed domain. The second
problem is alleviated by using a sigmoidal transformation, which makes the quadrature points more
concentrated around the near singularity. By combining the proposed two transformations with
the Guiggiani's method in [M. Guiggiani, \emph{et al}. A general algorithm for the numerical solution
of hypersingular boundary integral equations. \emph{ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics}, 59(1992),
604-614], one obtains an efficient and robust numerical method for computing the weakly-, strongly-
and hyper-singular integrals in high-order BEM with curved elements. Numerical integration results
show that, compared with the original PCT, the present method can reduce the number of quadrature
points considerably, for given accuracy. For further verification, the method is incorporated
into a 2-order Nystr\"om BEM code for solving acoustic Burton-Miller boundary integral equation.
It is shown that the method can retain the convergence rate of the BEM with much less quadrature points
than the existing PCT. The method is implemented in C language and freely available.
