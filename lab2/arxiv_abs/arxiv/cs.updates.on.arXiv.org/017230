We present a real-time stamp classifier of astronomical events for the ALeRCE (Automatic Learning
for the Rapid Classification of Events) broker. The classifier is based on a convolutional neural
network with an architecture designed to exploit rotational invariance of the images, and trained
on alerts ingested from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Using only the \textit{science, reference}
and \textit{difference} images of the first detection as inputs, along with the metadata of the
alert as features, the classifier is able to correctly classify alerts from active galactic nuclei,
supernovae (SNe), variable stars, asteroids and bogus classes, with high accuracy ($\sim$94\%)
in a balanced test set. In order to find and analyze SN candidates selected by our classifier from
the ZTF alert stream, we designed and deployed a visualization tool called SN Hunter, where relevant
information about each possible SN is displayed for the experts to choose among candidates to report
to the Transient Name Server database. We have reported 3060 SN candidates to date (9.2 candidates
per day on average), of which 394 have been confirmed spectroscopically. Our ability to report objects
using only a single detection means that 92\% of the reported SNe occurred within one day after the
first detection. ALeRCE has only reported candidates not otherwise detected or selected by other
groups, therefore adding new early transients to the bulk of objects available for early follow-up.
Our work represents an important milestone toward rapid alert classifications with the next generation
of large etendue telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.
