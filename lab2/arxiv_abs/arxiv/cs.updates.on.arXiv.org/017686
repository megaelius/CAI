This study investigates global properties of literary and non-literary texts. Within the literary
texts, a distinction is made between canonical and non-canonical works. The central hypothesis
of the study is that the three text types (non-literary, literary/canonical and literary/non-canonical)
exhibit systematic differences with respect to structural design features as correlates of aesthetic
responses in readers. To investigate these differences, we compiled a corpus containing texts
of the three categories of interest, the Jena Textual Aesthetics Corpus. Two aspects of global structure
are investigated, variability and self-similar (fractal) patterns, which reflect long-range
correlations along texts. We use four types of basic observations, (i) the frequency of POS-tags
per sentence, (ii) sentence length, (iii) lexical diversity in chunks of text, and (iv) the distribution
of topic probabilities in chunks of texts. These basic observations are grouped into two more general
categories, (a) the low-level properties (i) and (ii), which are observed at the level of the sentence
(reflecting linguistic decoding), and (b) the high-level properties (iii) and (iv), which are
observed at the textual level (reflecting comprehension). The basic observations are transformed
into time series, and these time series are subject to multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis
(MFDFA). Our results show that low-level properties of texts are better discriminators than high-level
properties, for the three text types under analysis. Canonical literary texts differ from non-canonical
ones primarily in terms of variability. Fractality seems to be a universal feature of text, more
pronounced in non-literary than in literary texts. Beyond the specific results of the study, we
intend to open up new perspectives on the experimental study of textual aesthetics.
