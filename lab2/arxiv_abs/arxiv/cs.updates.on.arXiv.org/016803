Computing systems have undergone several inflexion points - while Moore's law guided the semiconductor
industry to cram more and more transistors and logic into the same volume, the limits of instruction-level
parallelism (ILP) and the end of Dennard's scaling drove the industry towards multi-core chips.
We have now entered the era of domain-specific architectures for new workloads like AI and ML. These
trends continue, arguably with other limits, along with challenges imposed by tighter integration,
extreme form factors and diverse workloads, making systems more complex from an energy efficiency
perspective. Many research surveys have covered different aspects of techniques in hardware and
microarchitecture across devices, servers, HPC, data center systems along with software, algorithms,
frameworks for energy efficiency and thermal management. Somewhat in parallel, the semiconductor
industry has developed techniques and standards around specification, modeling and verification
of complex chips; these areas have not been addressed in detail by previous research surveys. This
survey aims to bring these domains together and is composed of a systematic categorization of key
aspects of building energy efficient systems - (a) specification - the ability to precisely specify
the power intent or properties at different layers (b) modeling and simulation of the entire system
or subsystem (hardware or software or both) so as to be able to perform what-if analysis, (c) techniques
used for implementing energy efficiency at different levels of the stack, (d) verification techniques
used to provide guarantees that the functionality of complex designs are preserved, and (e) energy
efficiency standards and consortiums that aim to standardize different aspects of energy efficiency,
including cross-layer optimizations.
