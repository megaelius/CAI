In this paper, we study the privacy of online health data. We present a novel online health data De-Anonymization
(DA) framework, named De-Health. De-Health consists of two phases: Top-K DA, which identifies
a candidate set for each anonymized user, and refined DA, which de-anonymizes an anonymized user
to a user in its candidate set. By employing both candidate selection and DA verification schemes,
De-Health significantly reduces the DA space by several orders of magnitude while achieving promising
DA accuracy. Leveraging two real world online health datasets WebMD (89,393 users, 506K posts)
and HealthBoards (388,398 users, 4.7M posts), we validate the efficacy of De-Health. Further,
when the training data are insufficient, De-Health can still successfully de-anonymize a large
portion of anonymized users. We develop the first analytical framework on the soundness and effectiveness
of online health data DA. By analyzing the impact of various data features on the anonymity, we derive
the conditions and probabilities for successfully de-anonymizing one user or a group of users in
exact DA and Top-K DA. Our analysis is meaningful to both researchers and policy makers in facilitating
the development of more effective anonymization techniques and proper privacy polices. We present
a linkage attack framework which can link online health/medical information to real world people.
Through a proof-of-concept attack, we link 347 out of 2805 WebMD users to real world people, and find
the full names, medical/health information, birthdates, phone numbers, and other sensitive information
for most of the re-identified users. This clearly illustrates the fragility of the notion of privacy
of those who use online health forums.
