When an individual purchases a home, they simultaneously purchase its structural features, its
accessibility to work, and the neighborhood amenities. Some amenities, such as air quality, are
measurable while others, such as the prestige or the visual impression of a neighborhood, are difficult
to quantify. Despite the well-known impacts intangible housing features have on house prices,
limited attention has been given to systematically quantifying these difficult to measure amenities.
Two issues have led to this neglect. Not only do few quantitative methods exist that can measure the
urban environment, but that the collection of such data is both costly and subjective. We show that
street image and satellite image data can capture these urban qualities and improve the estimation
of house prices. We propose a pipeline that uses a deep neural network model to automatically extract
visual features from images to estimate house prices in London, UK. We make use of traditional housing
features such as age, size, and accessibility as well as visual features from Google Street View
images and Bing aerial images in estimating the house price model. We find encouraging results where
learning to characterize the urban quality of a neighborhood improves house price prediction,
even when generalizing to previously unseen London boroughs. We explore the use of non-linear vs.
linear methods to fuse these cues with conventional models of house pricing, and show how the interpretability
of linear models allows us to directly extract proxy variables for visual desirability of neighborhoods
that are both of interest in their own right, and could be used as inputs to other econometric methods.
This is particularly valuable as once the network has been trained with the training data, it can
be applied elsewhere, allowing us to generate vivid dense maps of the visual appeal of London streets.
