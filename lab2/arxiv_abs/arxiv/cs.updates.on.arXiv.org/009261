In this work we introduce the numerical constant, LOPI, N LOPI is congruent to LOPI mod 18, equal to
the lowest odd partition identity in conjunction with the reduced residue system Modulo 18, a complete
disjoint covering residue system when considered in its whole set of residues from 0 to 17. By convolution
of specific LOPI Dirichlet linear progressions for each LOPI superset, the non-prime elements
of the 6 reduced residue congruence classes mod 18 are generated sequentially and uniquely. Through
set generation and complete composite number subset generation based on the pattern of sequential
factor generation for all composite numbers in each LOPI congruence class, multiplicity becomes
a possible tool to define degree of primality. We show that the lowest sum of the digits of an integer,
even or odd, is a constant unrestricted partition identity contained each natural number and is
equal to one of the residues in Mod 18. We term this constant the lowest odd or even partition identity
or LOPI or LEPI. When integers are viewed as partitions of the core LOPI-LEPI value, the infinite
natural numbers represent the residues of Mod 18 as extended each time toward infinity by sequential
cycles of 18. LOPI mod 18 is a factor generation system that demonstrates why the primes are not generated
through convolution of specific Dirichlet linear progressions into the LOPI non-prime subset
matrices, revealing the pattern of the primes to be actually six cyclic patterns. In querying the
multiplicity in these 3,4 specific non prime matrices we suggest another definition of prime and
non-prime based on this multiplicity, where 0 is Prime, 1 is a secondary prime and so on. An Ox, Ox3
efficient deterministic algorithm is attached describing the process of factor generation and
primality testing.
