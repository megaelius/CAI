Current clinical practice guidelines for managing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) account for general
cardiovascular risk factors. However, they do not present a framework that considers personalized
patient-specific characteristics. Using the electronic health records of 21,460 patients, we
created data-driven models for personalized CAD management that significantly improve health
outcomes relative to the standard of care. We develop binary classifiers to detect whether a patient
will experience an adverse event due to CAD within a 10-year time frame. Combining the patients'
medical history and clinical examination results, we achieve 81.5% AUC. For each treatment, we
also create a series of regression models that are based on different supervised machine learning
algorithms. We are able to estimate with average R squared = 0.801 the time from diagnosis to a potential
adverse event (TAE) and gain accurate approximations of the counterfactual treatment effects.
Leveraging combinations of these models, we present ML4CAD, a novel personalized prescriptive
algorithm. Considering the recommendations of multiple predictive models at once, ML4CAD identifies
for every patient the therapy with the best expected outcome using a voting mechanism. We evaluate
its performance by measuring the prescription effectiveness and robustness under alternative
ground truths. We show that our methodology improves the expected TAE upon the current baseline
by 24.11%, increasing it from 4.56 to 5.66 years. The algorithm performs particularly well for the
male (24.3% improvement) and Hispanic (58.41% improvement) subpopulations. Finally, we create
an interactive interface, providing physicians with an intuitive, accurate, readily implementable,
and effective tool.
