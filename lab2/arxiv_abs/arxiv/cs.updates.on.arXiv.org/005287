Multiparametric radiological imaging is vital for detection, characterization and diagnosis
of many different diseases. The use of radiomics for quantitative extraction of textural features
from radiological imaging is increasing moving towards clinical decision support. However, current
methods in radiomics are limited to using single images for the extraction of these textural features
and may limit the applicable scope of radiomics in different clinical settings. Thus, in the current
form, they are not capable of capturing the true underlying tissue characteristics in high dimensional
multiparametric imaging space. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a multiparametric
imaging radiomic framework termed MPRAD for extraction of radiomic features from high dimensional
datasets. MPRAD was tested on two different organs and diseases; breast cancer and cerebrovascular
accidents in brain, commonly referred to as stroke. The MPRAD framework classified malignant from
benign breast lesions with excellent sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 80.5% respectively
with an AUC of 0.88 providing a 9%-28% increase in AUC over single radiomic parameters. More importantly,
in breast, the glandular tissue MPRAD were similar between each group with no significance differences.
Similarly, the MPRAD features in brain stroke demonstrated increased performance in distinguishing
the perfusion-diffusion mismatch compared to single parameter radiomics and there were no differences
within the white and gray matter tissue. In conclusion, we have introduced the use of multiparametric
radiomics into a clinical setting
