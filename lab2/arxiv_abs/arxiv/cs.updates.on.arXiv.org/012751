This paper introduces a new learning paradigm called eXtreme Regression (XR) whose objective is
to accurately predict the numerical degrees of relevance of an extremely large number of labels
to a data point. XR can provide elegant solutions to many large-scale ranking and recommendation
applications including Dynamic Search Advertising (DSA). XR can learn more accurate models than
the recently popular extreme classifiers which incorrectly assume strictly binary-valued label
relevances. Traditional regression metrics which sum the errors over all the labels are unsuitable
for XR problems since they could give extremely loose bounds for the label ranking quality. Also,
the existing regression algorithms won't efficiently scale to millions of labels. This paper addresses
these limitations through: (1) new evaluation metrics for XR which sum only the k largest regression
errors; (2) a new algorithm called XReg which decomposes XR task into a hierarchy of much smaller
regression problems thus leading to highly efficient training and prediction. This paper also
introduces a (3) new labelwise prediction algorithm in XReg useful for DSA and other recommendation
tasks. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrated that XReg can outperform the state-of-the-art
extreme classifiers as well as large-scale regressors and rankers by up to 50% reduction in the new
XR error metric, and up to 2% and 2.4% improvements in terms of the propensity-scored precision metric
used in extreme classification and the click-through rate metric used in DSA respectively. Deployment
of XReg on DSA in Bing resulted in a relative gain of 58% in revenue and 27% in query coverage. XReg's
