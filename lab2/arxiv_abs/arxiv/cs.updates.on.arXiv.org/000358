In this paper, we propose a novel multi-channel network with infrastructure support, called an
\textit{MC-IS} network, which has not been studied in the literature. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to study such an \textit{MC-IS} network. Our \textit{MC-IS} network is equipped
with a number of infrastructure nodes which can communicate with common nodes using a number of channels
where a communication between a common node and an infrastructure node is called an infrastructure
communication and a communication between two common nodes is called an ad-hoc communication.
Our proposed \textit{MC-IS} network has a number of advantages over three existing conventional
networks, namely a single-channel wireless ad hoc network (called an \textit{SC-AH} network),
a multi-channel wireless ad hoc network (called an \textit{MC-AH} network) and a single-channel
network with infrastructure support (called an \textit{SC-IS} network). In particular, the \textit{network
capacity} of our proposed \textit{MC-IS} network is $\sqrt{n \log n}$ times higher than that of
an \textit{SC-AH} network and an \textit{MC-AH} network and the same as that of an \textit{SC-IS}
network, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. The \textit{average delay} of our \textit{MC-IS}
network is $\sqrt{\log n/n}$ times lower than that of an \textit{SC-AH} network and an \textit{MC-AH}
network, and $\min(C_I,m)$ times lower than the average delay of an \textit{SC-IS} network, where
$C_I$ and $m$ denote the number of channels dedicated for infrastructure communications and the
number of interfaces mounted at each infrastructure node, respectively.
