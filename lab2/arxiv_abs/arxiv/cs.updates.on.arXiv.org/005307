In recent years, crowd analysis is important for applications such as smart cities, intelligent
transportation system, customer behavior prediction, and visual surveillance. Understanding
the characteristics of the individual motion in a crowd can be beneficial for social event detection
and abnormal detection, but it has rarely been studied. In this paper, we focus on the extraversion
measure of individual motions in crowds based on trajectory data. Extraversion is one of typical
personalities that is often observed in human crowd behaviors and it can reflect not only the characteristics
of the individual motion, but also the that of the holistic crowd motions. To our best knowledge,
this is the first attempt to analyze individual extraversion of crowd motions based on trajectories.
To accomplish this, we first present a effective composite motion descriptor, which integrates
the basic individual motion information and social metrics, to describe the extraversion of each
individual in a crowd. The social metrics consider both the neighboring distribution and their
interaction pattern. Since our major goal is to learn a universal scoring function that can measure
the degrees of extraversion across varied crowd scenes, we incorporate and adapt the active learning
technique to the relative attribute approach. Specifically, we assume the social groups in any
crowds contain individuals with the similar degree of extraversion. Based on such assumption,
we significantly reduce the computation cost by clustering and ranking the trajectories actively.
Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed method by measuring the degree of extraversion
for real individual trajectories in crowds and analyzing crowd scenes from a real-world dataset.
