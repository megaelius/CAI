This work explores a sequential decision making problem with agents having diverse expertise and
mismatched beliefs. We consider an $N$-agent sequential binary hypothesis test in which each agent
sequentially makes a decision based not only on a private observation, but also on previous agents'
decisions. In addition, the agents have their own beliefs instead of the true prior, and have varying
expertise in terms of the noise variance in the private signal. We focus on the risk of the last-acting
agent, where precedent agents are selfish. Thus, we call this advisor(s)-advisee sequential decision
making. We first derive the optimal decision rule by recursive belief update and conclude, counterintuitively,
that beliefs deviating from the true prior could be optimal in this setting. The impact of diverse
noise levels (which means diverse expertise levels) in the two-agent case is also considered and
the analytical properties of the optimal belief curves are given. These curves, for certain cases,
resemble probability weighting functions from cumulative prospect theory, and so we also discuss
the choice of Prelec weighting functions as an approximation for the optimal beliefs, and the possible
psychophysical optimality of human beliefs. Next, we consider an advisor selection problem wherein
the advisee of a certain belief chooses an advisor from a set of candidates with varying beliefs.
We characterize the decision region for choosing such an advisor and argue that an advisee with beliefs
varying from the true prior often ends up selecting a suboptimal advisor, indicating the need for
a social planner. We close with a discussion on the implications of the study toward designing artificial
intelligence systems for augmenting human intelligence.
