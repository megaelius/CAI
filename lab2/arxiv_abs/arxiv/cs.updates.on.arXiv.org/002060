The proliferation of online biometric authentication has necessitated security requirements
of biometric templates. The existing secure biometric authentication schemes feature a server-centric
model, where a service provider maintains a biometric database and is fully responsible for the
security of the templates. The end-users have to fully trust the server in storing, processing and
managing their private templates. As a result, the end-users' templates could be compromised by
outside attackers or even the service provider itself. In this paper, we propose a user-centric
biometric authentication scheme (PassBio) that enables end-users to encrypt their own templates
with our proposed light-weighted encryption scheme. During authentication, all the templates
remain encrypted such that the server will never see them directly. However, the server is able to
determine whether the distance of two encrypted templates is within a pre-defined threshold. Our
security analysis shows that no critical information of the templates can be revealed under both
passive and active attacks. PassBio follows a "compute-then-compare" computational model over
encrypted data. More specifically, our proposed Threshold Predicate Encryption (TPE) scheme
can encrypt two vectors x and y in such a manner that the inner product of x and y can be evaluated and
compared to a pre-defined threshold. TPE guarantees that only the comparison result is revealed
and no key information about x and y can be learned. Furthermore, we show that TPE can be utilized as
a flexible building block to evaluate different distance metrics such as Hamming distance and Euclidean
distance over encrypted data. Such a compute-then-compare computational model, enabled by TPE,
can be widely applied in many interesting applications such as searching over encrypted data while
ensuring data security and privacy.
