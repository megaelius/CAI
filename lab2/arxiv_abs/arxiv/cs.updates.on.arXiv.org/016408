This paper discusses Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs) and to what extent they have lived up to the
promise, particularly of reusability. Reusable Learning Objects have actually been discussed
in the literature for the last 20 years and yet true large scale sharing of learning and teaching materials
remains relatively rare and challenging. This paper argues that part of the reason is that the granularity
of the learning objects that are in use today is not conducive to true reuse. Certainly whole PowerPoint
slide decks and word documents are kept in individual files and folders. It is not an ideal situation.
As a result, educators, teachers, course designers, are constantly reinventing the wheel, or searching
for where that one excellent assignment, explanation, definition was last seen so it can be copied
forward. This paper argues that to achieve effective reuse of Learning Objects, the following are
required: smaller, more granular (micro) learning objects; means to combine them into larger presentation
products; and modern revision and version control. The paper proposes applying approaches originating
in the software engineering community, such as agile methodology, version control and management,
markup languages, and agile publishing, which together form the Agile Approach of the title of the
paper. With that foundation laid, the paper examines CourseGen, an open source software platform
designed for creating, sharing, reusing and publishing reusable course content. CourseGen uses
a modified markdown format augmented by CourseGen specific directives, such as $link to and $include
topic. The CourseGen compiler converts a collection of CourseGen files into the final format such
as a web site or a PowerPoint. CourseGen was designed, used and refined over the last three years in
several Computer Science Courses at Brandeis University.
