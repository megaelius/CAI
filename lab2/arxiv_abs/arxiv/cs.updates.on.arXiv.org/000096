We investigate the behavior of the recently proposed quantum Google algorithm, or quantum PageRank,
in large complex networks. Applying the quantum algorithm to a part of the real World Wide Web, we
find that the algorithm is able to univocally reveal the underlying scale-free topology of the network
and to clearly identify and order the most relevant nodes (hubs) of the graph according to their importance
in the network structure. Moreover, for the class of scale-free graphs our results show that the
quantum PageRank algorithm outperforms the classical PageRank algorithm in the sense that quantum
effects generically lead to changes in the classical ranking hierarchy. Moreover, as compared
to its classical counterpart, the quantum algorithm is capable to clearly highlight the structure
of secondary hubs of the network, and to partially resolve the degeneracy in importance of the low
lying part of the list of rankings, which represents a typical shortcoming of the classical PageRank
algorithm. Complementary to this study, our analysis shows that the algorithm is able to clearly
distinguish scale-free networks from other widespread and important classes of complex networks,
such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks and hierarchical graphs. We show that the ranking capabilities
of the quantum PageRank algorithm are related to an increased stability with respect to a variation
of the damping parameter $\alpha$ that appears in the Google algorithm, and to a more clearly pronounced
power-law behavior in the distribution of importance among the nodes, as compared to the classical
algorithm. Finally, we study to which extent the increased sensitivity of the quantum algorithm
persists under coordinated attacks of the most important nodes in scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs.
