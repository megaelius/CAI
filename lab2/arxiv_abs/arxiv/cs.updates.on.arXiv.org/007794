As new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are integrated into Critical National Infrastructures
(CNI), new cybersecurity threats emerge that require specific security solutions. Approaches
used for analysis include the modelling and simulation of critical infrastructure systems using
attributes, functionalities, operations, and behaviours to support various security analysis
viewpoints, recognising and appropriately managing associated security risks. With several
critical infrastructure protection approaches available, the question of how to effectively
model the complex behaviour of interconnected CNI elements and to configure their protection as
a system-of-systems remains a challenge. Using a systematic review approach, existing critical
infrastructure protection approaches (tools and techniques) are examined to determine their
suitability given trends like IoT, and effective security modelling and analysis issues. It is
found that empirical-based, agent-based, system dynamics-based, and network-based modelling
are more commonly applied than economic-based and equation-based techniques, and empirical-based
modelling is the most widely used. The energy and transportation critical infrastructure sectors
reflect the most responsive sectors, and no one Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) approach
- tool, technique, methodology or framework -- provides a fit-for-all capacity for all-round attribute
modelling and simulation of security risks. Typically, deciding factors for CIP choices to adopt
are often dominated by trade-offs between complexity of use and popularity of approach, as well
as between specificity and generality of application in sectors.
