This work is concerned with the iterative solution of systems of quasi-static multiple-network
poroelasticity (MPET) equations describing flow in elastic porous media that is permeated by single
or multiple fluid networks. Here the focus is on a three-field formulation of the problem in which
the displacement field of the elastic matrix and, additionally, one velocity field and one pressure
field for each of the $n \ge 1$ fluid networks are the unknown physical quantities. Generalizing
Biot's model of consolidation, which is obtained for $n=1$, the MPET equations for $n\ge1$ exhibit
a double saddle point structure. The proposed approach is based on a framework of augmenting and
splitting this three-by-three block system in such a way that the resulting block Gauss-Seidel
preconditioner defines a fully decoupled iterative scheme for the flux-, pressure-, and displacement
fields. In this manner, one obtains an augmented Lagrangian Uzawa-type method, the analysis of
which is the main contribution of this work. The parameter-robust uniform linear convergence of
this fixed-point iteration is proved by showing that its rate of contraction is strictly less than
one independent of all physical and discretization parameters. The theoretical results are confirmed
by a series of numerical tests that compare the new fully decoupled scheme to the partially decoupled
fixed-stress split iterative method, which decouples only flow--the flux and pressure fields
remain coupled in this case--from the mechanics problem. We further test the performance of the
block triangular preconditioner defining the new scheme when used to accelerate the GMRES algorithm.
