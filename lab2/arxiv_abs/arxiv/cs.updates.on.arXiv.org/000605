Mobility pattern of nodes in a mobile network has significant impact on the connectivity properties
of the network. One such mobile network that has drawn attention of researchers in the past few years
is the Airborne Networks (AN) due to its importance in civil and military purpose and due to the several
complex issues in these domains. Since the nodes in an airborne network (AN) are heterogeneous and
mobile, the design of a reliable and robust AN is highly complex and challenging. In this paper a persistent
backbone based architecture for an AN has been considered where a set of airborne networking platforms
(ANPs - aircrafts, UAVs and satellites) form the backbone of the AN. End to end connectivity of the
backbone nodes is crucial in providing the communication among the hosts. Since ANPs are prone to
failure because of attacks like EMP attack or jamming, another important issue is to improve the
robustness of the backbone network against these attacks. Such attacks will impact specific geographic
regions at specific times and if an ANP is within the fault region during the time of attack, it will
fail. This paper focuses on connectivity and fault-tolerance issues in ANs and studies algorithms
to compute the minimum transmission range of ANPs in fault free and faulty scenarios to ensure network
connectivity all the times. It also considers the scenario where the network may have to operate
in a disconnected mode for some part of time and data transmissions may be tolerant to some amount
of delay. Hence, ANPs may not need to have end-to-end paths all the time but they should be able to transmit
data to each other within bounded time.
