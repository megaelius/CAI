Combinatorial preference aggregation has many applications in AI. Given the exponential nature
of these preferences, compact representations are needed and ($m$)CP-nets are among the most studied
ones. Sequential and global voting are two ways to aggregate preferences over CP-nets. In the former,
preferences are aggregated feature-by-feature. Hence, when preferences have specific feature
dependencies, sequential voting may exhibit voting paradoxes, i.e., it might select sub-optimal
outcomes. To avoid paradoxes in sequential voting, one has often assumed the $\mathcal{O}$-legality
restriction, which imposes a shared topological order among all the CP-nets. On the contrary, in
global voting, CP-nets are considered as a whole during preference aggregation. For this reason,
global voting is immune from paradoxes, and there is no need to impose restrictions over the CP-nets'
topological structure. Sequential voting over $\mathcal{O}$-legal CP-nets has extensively
been investigated. On the other hand, global voting over non-$\mathcal{O}$-legal CP-nets has
not carefully been analyzed, despite it was stated in the literature that a theoretical comparison
between global and sequential voting was promising and a precise complexity analysis for global
voting has been asked for multiple times. In quite few works, very partial results on the complexity
of global voting over CP-nets have been given. We start to fill this gap by carrying out a thorough
complexity analysis of Pareto and majority global voting over not necessarily $\mathcal{O}$-legal
acyclic binary polynomially connected (m)CP-nets. We settle these problems in the polynomial
hierarchy, and some of them in PTIME or LOGSPACE, whereas EXPTIME was the previously known upper
bound for most of them. We show various tight lower bounds and matching upper bounds for problems
that up to date did not have any explicit non-obvious lower bound.
