With the expansion of electronic publishing, a new dynamics of scientific articles dissemination
was initiated. Still substantially important, citations became a longer term effect. Nowadays,
many works become widely disseminated even before publication, in the form of preprints. Another
important new element concerns the visualizations of published articles. Thanks to the availability
of respective data by some journals, it became possible to develop investigations on how papers
are viewed along time, often before the first citations appear. This provides the main theme of the
present work. Our research was initiated in observations that the view profiles along time tend
to present a piecewise linear nature. A methodology was then delineated that in order to identify
the main segments in the view profiles, which allowed to obtain several related measurements. In
particular, we focused on the inclination and length of each subsequent segment. Basic statistics
indicated that the inclination tends to decrease along subsequent segments, while the segment
lengths resulted more stable. Complementary joint statistics analysis, considering pairwise
correlations, provided further information, especially the tendency of highly inclined segments
being followed by shorter ones. Another interesting finding relates to the observation that short
segments tend to be followed by long segments with low inclination. Given that the joint densities
suggested the presence of clusters, we proceeded to a respective systematic investigation. It
was found that models incorporating joint dependencies between the properties of the segments
provided the most accurate results among the considered alternatives. The several reported findings
corroborate that the view profiles have intricate structure and tend to clusterize, suggesting
correlate real-world mechanisms.
