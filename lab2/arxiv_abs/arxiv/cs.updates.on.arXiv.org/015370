Non-recurrent traffic congestion (NRTC) usually brings unexpected delays to commuters. Hence,
it is critical to accurately detect and recognize the NRTC in a real-time manner. The advancement
of road traffic detectors and loop detectors provides researchers with a large-scale multivariable
temporal-spatial traffic data, which allows the deep research on NRTC to be conducted. However,
it remains a challenging task to construct an analytical framework through which the natural spatial-temporal
structural properties of multivariable traffic information can be effectively represented and
exploited to better understand and detect NRTC. In this paper, we present a novel analytical training-free
framework based on coupled scalable Bayesian robust tensor factorization (Coupled SBRTF). The
framework can couple multivariable traffic data including traffic flow, road speed, and occupancy
through sharing a similar or the same sparse structure. And, it naturally captures the high-dimensional
spatial-temporal structural properties of traffic data by tensor factorization. With its entries
revealing the distribution and magnitude of NRTC, the shared sparse structure of the framework
compasses sufficiently abundant information about NRTC. While the low-rank part of the framework,
expresses the distribution of general expected traffic condition as an auxiliary product. Experimental
results on real-world traffic data show that the proposed method outperforms coupled Bayesian
robust principal component analysis (coupled BRPCA), the rank sparsity tensor decomposition
(RSTD), and standard normal deviates (SND) in detecting NRTC. The proposed method performs even
better when only traffic data in weekdays are utilized, and hence can provide more precise estimation
of NRTC for daily commuters.
