The aim of medical knowledge representation is to capture the detailed domain knowledge in a clinically
efficient manner and to offer a reliable resolution with the acquired knowledge. The knowledge
base to be used by a medical expert system should allow incremental growth with inclusion of updated
knowledge over the time. As knowledge are gathered from a variety of knowledge sources by different
knowledge engineers, the problem of redundancy is an important concern here due to increased processing
time of knowledge and occupancy of large computational storage to accommodate all the gathered
knowledge. Also there may exist many inconsistent knowledge in the knowledge base. In this paper,
we have proposed a rough set based lattice structure for knowledge representation in medical expert
systems which overcomes the problem of redundancy and inconsistency in knowledge and offers computational
efficiency with respect to both time and space. We have also generated an optimal set of decision
rules that would be used directly by the inference engine. The reliability of each rule has been measured
using a new metric called credibility factor, and the certainty and coverage factors of a decision
rule have been re-defined. With a set of decisions rules arranged in descending order according
to their reliability measures, the medical expert system will consider the highly reliable and
certain rules at first, then it would search for the possible and uncertain rules at later stage,
if recommended by physicians. The proposed knowledge representation technique has been illustrated
using an example from the domain of low back pain. The proposed scheme ensures completeness, consistency,
integrity, non-redundancy, and ease of access.
