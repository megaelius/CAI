In this paper, we propose an unsupervised collaborative representation deep network (UCRDNet)
which consists of novel collaborative representation RBM (crRBM) and collaborative representation
GRBM (crGRBM). The UCRDNet is a novel deep collaborative feature extractor for exploring more sophisticated
probabilistic models of real-valued and binary data. Unlike traditional representation methods,
one similarity relation between the input instances and another similarity relation between the
features of the input instances are collaboratively fused together in the representation process
of the crGRBM and crRBM models. Here, we use the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) method to divide
the input instance matrix into many mini blocks which contain similar instance and local features.
Then, we expect the hidden layer feature units of each block gather to block center as much as possible
in the training processes of the crRBM and crGRBM. Hence, the correlations between the instances
and features as collaborative relations are fused in the hidden layer features. In the experiments,
we use K-means and Spectral Clustering (SC) algorithms based on four contrast deep networks to verify
the deep collaborative representation capability of the UCRDNet architecture. One architecture
of the UCRDNet is composed with a crGRBM and two crRBMs for modeling real-valued data and another
architecture of it is composed with three crRBMs for modeling binary data. The experimental results
show that the proposed UCRDNet has more outstanding performance than the Autoencoder and DeepFS
deep networks (without collaborative representation strategy) for unsupervised clustering
on the MSRA-MM2.0 and UCI datasets. Furthermore, the proposed UCRDNet shows more excellent collaborative
representation capabilities than the CDL deep collaborative networks for unsupervised clustering.
