The concept of Reload cost in a graph refers to the cost that occurs while traversing a vertex via two
of its incident edges. This cost is uniquely determined by the colors of the two edges. This concept
has various applications in transportation networks, communication networks, and energy distribution
networks. Various problems using this model are defined and studied in the literature. The problem
of finding a spanning tree whose diameter with respect to the reload costs is the smallest possible,
the problems of finding a path, trail or walk with minimum total reload cost between two given vertices,
problems about finding a proper edge coloring of a graph such that the total reload cost is minimized,
the problem of finding a spanning tree such that the sum of the reload costs of all paths between all
pairs of vertices is minimized, and the problem of finding a set of cycles of minimum reload cost,
that cover all the vertices of a graph, are examples of such problems. % In this work we focus on the
last problem. Noting that a cycle cover of a graph is a 2-factor of it, we generalize the problem to
that of finding an $r$-factor of minimum reload cost of an edge colored graph. We prove several NP-hardness
results for special cases of the problem. Namely, bounded degree graphs, planar graphs, bounded
total cost, and bounded number of distinct costs. For the special case of $r=2$, our results imply
an improved NP-hardness result. On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time solvable special
case which provides a tight boundary between the polynomial and hard cases in terms of $r$ and the
maximum degree of the graph. We then investigate the parameterized complexity of the problem, prove
W[1]-hardness results and present an FPT algorithm.
