There is a growing interest in the automated analysis of chest X-Ray (CXR) as a sensitive and inexpensive
means of screening susceptible populations for pulmonary tuberculosis. In this work we evaluate
the latest version of CAD4TB, a commercial software platform designed for this purpose. Version
6 of CAD4TB was released in 2018 and is here tested on a fully independent dataset of 5565 CXR images
with GeneXpert (Xpert) sputum test results available (854 Xpert positive subjects). A subset of
500 subjects (50% Xpert positive) was reviewed and annotated by 5 expert observers independently
to obtain a radiological reference standard. The latest version of CAD4TB is found to outperform
all previous versions in terms of area under receiver operating curve (ROC) with respect to both
Xpert and radiological reference standards. Improvements with respect to Xpert are most apparent
at high sensitivity levels with a specificity of 76% obtained at a fixed 90% sensitivity. When compared
with the radiological reference standard, CAD4TB v6 also outperformed previous versions by a considerable
margin and achieved 98% specificity at the 90% sensitivity setting. No substantial difference
was found between the performance of CAD4TB v6 and any of the various expert observers against the
Xpert reference standard. A cost and efficiency analysis on this dataset demonstrates that in a
standard clinical situation, operating at 90% sensitivity, users of CAD4TB v6 can process 132 subjects
per day at n average cost per screen of \$5.95 per subject, while users of version 3 process only 85
subjects per day at a cost of \$8.38 per subject. At all tested operating points version 6 is shown
to be more efficient and cost effective than any other version.
