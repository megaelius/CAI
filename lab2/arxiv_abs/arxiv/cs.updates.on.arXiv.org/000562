This paper introduces three sets of sufficient conditions, for generating bijective simplicial
mappings of manifold meshes. A necessary condition for a simplicial mapping of a mesh to be injective
is that it either maintains the orientation of all elements or flips all the elements. However, these
conditions are known to be insufficient for injectivity of a simplicial map. In this paper we provide
additional simple conditions that, together with the above mentioned necessary conditions guarantee
injectivity of the simplicial map. The first set of conditions generalizes classical global inversion
theorems to the mesh (piecewise-linear) case. That is, proves that in case the boundary simplicial
map is bijective and the necessary condition holds then the map is injective and onto the target domain.
The second set of conditions is concerned with mapping of a mesh to a polytope and replaces the (often
hard) requirement of a bijective boundary map with a collection of linear constraints and guarantees
that the resulting map is injective over the interior of the mesh and onto. These linear conditions
provide a practical tool for optimizing a map of the mesh onto a given polytope while allowing the
boundary map to adjust freely and keeping the injectivity property in the interior of the mesh. The
third set of conditions adds to the second set the requirement that the boundary maps are orientation
preserving as-well (with a proper definition of boundary map orientation). This set of conditions
guarantees that the map is injective on the boundary of the mesh as-well as its interior. Several
experiments using the sufficient conditions are shown for mapping triangular meshes. A secondary
goal of this paper is to advocate and develop the tool of degree in the context of mesh processing.
