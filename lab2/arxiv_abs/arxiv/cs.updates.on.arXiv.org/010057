Composite temporal event sequence visualizations have included sentinel event alignment techniques
to cope with data volume and variety. Prior work has demonstrated the utility of using single-event
alignment for understanding the precursor, co-occurring, and aftereffect events surrounding
a sentinel event. However, the usefulness of single-event alignment has not been sufficiently
evaluated in composite visualizations. Furthermore, recently proposed dual-event alignment
techniques have not been empirically evaluated. In this work, we designed tasks around temporal
event sequence and timing analysis and conducted a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical
Turk to examine four sentinel event alignment approaches: no sentinel event alignment (NoAlign),
single-event alignment (SingleAlign), dual-event alignment with left justification (DualLeft),
and dual-event alignment with stretch justification (DualStretch). Differences between approaches
were most pronounced with more rows of data. For understanding intermediate events between two
sentinel events, dual-event alignment was the clear winner for correctness---71% vs. 18% for NoAlign
and SingleAlign. For understanding the duration between two sentinel events, NoAlign was the clear
winner: correctness---88% vs. 36% for DualStretch---completion time---55 seconds vs. 101 seconds
for DualLeft---and error---1.5% vs. 8.4% for DualStretch. For understanding precursor and aftereffect
events, there was no significant difference among approaches. A free copy of this paper, the evaluation
