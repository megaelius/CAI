In this paper we consider the problem of tracking the progression of reading through eye-gaze measurements.
Such an algorithm is novel and will ultimately help to develop a method of analyzing eye-gaze data
which had been collected during reading activity in order to uncover crucial information regarding
the individual's interest level and quality of experience while reading a passage of text or book.
Additionally, such an approach will serve as a "visual signature" - a method of verifying if an individual
has indeed given adequate attention to critical text-based information. Further, an accurate
"reading-progression-tracker" has potential applications in educational institutions, e-readers
and parenting solutions. Tracking the progression of reading remains a challenging problem due
to the fact that eye-gaze movements are highly noisy and the eye-gaze is easily distracted in a limited
space, like an e-book. In a prior work, we proposed an approach to analyze eye-gaze fixation points
collected while reading a page of text in order to classify each measurement to a line of text; this
approach did not consider tracking the progression of reading along the line of text. In this paper,
we extend the capabilities of the previous algorithm in order to accurately track the progression
of reading along each line. the proposed approach employs least squares batch estimation in order
to estimate three states of the horizontal saccade: position, velocity and acceleration. First,
the proposed approach is objectively evaluated on a simulated eye-gaze dataset. Then, the proposed
algorithm is demonstrated on real data collected by a Gazepoint eye-tracker while the subject is
reading several pages from an electronic book.
