Journal of the History of Biology provides a fifty-year long record for examining the evolution
of the history of biology as a scholarly discipline. In this paper, we present a new dataset and preliminary
quantitative analysis of the thematic content of JHB from the perspectives of geography, organisms,
and thematic fields. The geographic diversity of authors whose work appears in JHB has increased
steadily since 1968, but the geographic coverage of the content of JHB articles remains strongly
lopsided toward the United States, United Kingdom, and western Europe and has diversified much
less dramatically over time. The taxonomic diversity of organisms discussed in JHB increased steadily
between 1968 and the late 1990s but declined in later years, mirroring broader patterns of diversification
previously reported in the biomedical research literature. Finally, we used a combination of topic
modeling and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques to develop a model of multi-article
fields within JHB. We found evidence for directional changes in the representation of fields on
multiple scales. The diversity of JHB with regard to the representation of thematic fields has increased
overall, with most of that diversification occurring in recent years. Drawing on the dataset generated
in the course of this analysis, as well as web services in the emerging digital history and philosophy
of science ecosystem, we have developed an interactive web platform for exploring the content of
JHB, and we provide a brief overview of the platform in this article. As a whole, the data and analyses
presented here provide a starting-place for further critical reflection on the evolution of the
history of biology over the past half-century.
