This paper presents a new approach for Gaussian process (GP) regression for large datasets. The
approach involves partitioning the regression input domain into multiple local regions with a
different local GP model fitted in each region. Unlike existing local partitioned GP approaches,
we introduce a technique for patching together the local GP models nearly seamlessly to ensure that
the local GP models for two neighboring regions produce nearly the same response prediction and
prediction error variance on the boundary between the two regions. This effectively solves the
well-known discontinuity problem that degrades the boundary accuracy of existing local partitioned
GP methods. Our main innovation is to represent the continuity conditions as additional pseudo-observations
that the differences between neighboring GP responses are identically zero at an appropriately
chosen set of boundary input locations. To predict the response at any input location, we simply
augment the actual response observations with the pseudo-observations and apply standard GP prediction
methods to the augmented data. In contrast to heuristic continuity adjustments, this has an advantage
of working within a formal GP framework, so that the GP-based predictive uncertainty quantification
remains valid. Our approach also inherits a sparse block-like structure for the sample covariance
matrix, which results in computationally efficient closed-form expressions for the predictive
mean and variance. In addition, we provide a new spatial partitioning scheme based on a recursive
space partitioning along local principal component directions, which makes the proposed approach
applicable for regression domains having more than two dimensions. Using three spatial datasets
and three higher dimensional datasets, we investigate the numerical performance of the approach
and compare it to several state-of-the-art approaches.
