Memorability measures how easily an image is to be memorized after glancing, which may contribute
to designing magazine covers, tourism publicity materials, and so forth. Recent works have shed
light on the visual features that make generic images, object images or face photographs memorable.
However, these methods are not able to effectively predict the memorability of outdoor natural
scene images. To overcome this shortcoming of previous works, in this paper, we provide an attempt
to answer: "what exactly makes outdoor natural scenes memorable". To this end, we first establish
a large-scale outdoor natural scene image memorability (LNSIM) database, containing 2,632 outdoor
natural scene images with their ground truth memorability scores and the multi-label scene category
annotations. Then, similar to previous works, we mine our database to investigate how low-, middle-
and high-level handcrafted features affect the memorability of outdoor natural scenes. In particular,
we find that the high-level feature of scene category is rather correlated with outdoor natural
scene memorability, and the deep features learnt by deep neural network (DNN) are also effective
in predicting the memorability scores. Moreover, combining the deep features with the category
feature can further boost the performance of memorability prediction. Therefore, we propose an
end-to-end DNN based outdoor natural scene memorability (DeepNSM) predictor, which takes advantage
of the learned category-related features. Then, the experimental results validate the effectiveness
of our DeepNSM model, exceeding the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we try to understand the
reason of the good performance for our DeepNSM model, and also study the cases that our DeepNSM model
succeeds or fails to accurately predict the memorability of outdoor natural scenes.
