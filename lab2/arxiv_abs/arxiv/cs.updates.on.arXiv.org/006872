In this paper we propose a unified framework to simultaneously discover the number of clusters and
group the data points into them using subspace clustering. Real data distributed in a high-dimensional
space can be disentangled into a union of low-dimensional subspaces, which can benefit various
applications. To explore such intrinsic structure, state-of-the-art subspace clustering approaches
often optimize a self-representation problem among all samples, to construct a pairwise affinity
graph for spectral clustering. However, a graph with pairwise similarities lacks robustness for
segmentation, especially for samples which lie on the intersection of two subspaces. To address
this problem, we design a hyper-correlation based data structure termed as the \textit{triplet
relationship}, which reveals high relevance and local compactness among three samples. The triplet
relationship can be derived from the self-representation matrix, and be utilized to iteratively
assign the data points to clusters. Three samples in each triplet are encouraged to be highly correlated
and are considered as a meta-element during clustering, which show more robustness than pairwise
relationships when segmenting two densely distributed subspaces. Based on the triplet relationship,
we propose a unified optimizing scheme to automatically calculate clustering assignments. Specifically,
we optimize a model selection reward and a fusion reward by simultaneously maximizing the similarity
of triplets from different clusters while minimizing the correlation of triplets from same cluster.
The proposed algorithm also automatically reveals the number of clusters and fuses groups to avoid
over-segmentation. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.
