In this paper, we investigate the exact controllability properties of an advection-diffusion
equation on a bounded domain, using time- and space-dependent velocity fields as the control parameters.
This partial differential equation (PDE) is the Kolmogorov forward equation for a reflected diffusion
process that models the spatiotemporal evolution of a swarm of agents. We prove that if a target probability
density has bounded first-order weak derivatives and is uniformly bounded from below by a positive
constant, then it can be reached in finite time using control inputs that are bounded in space and
time. We then extend this controllability result to a class of advection-diffusion-reaction PDEs
that corresponds to a hybrid-switching diffusion process (HSDP), in which case the reaction parameters
are additionally incorporated as the control inputs. Our proof for controllability of the advection-diffusion
equation is constructive and is based on linear operator semigroup theoretic arguments and spectral
properties of the multiplicatively perturbed Neumann Laplacian. For the HSDP, we first constructively
prove controllability of the associated continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) system, in which
the state space is finite. Then we show that our controllability results for the advection-diffusion
equation and the CTMC can be combined to establish controllability of the forward equation of the
HSDP. Lastly, we provide constructive solutions to the problem of asymptotically stabilizing
an HSDP to a target non-negative stationary distribution using time-independent state feedback
laws, which correspond to spatially-dependent coefficients of the associated system of PDEs.
