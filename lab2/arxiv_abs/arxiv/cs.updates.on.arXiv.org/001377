A classical difficult isomorphism testing problem is to test isomorphism of p-groups of class 2
and exponent p in time polynomial in the group order. It is known that this problem can be reduced to
solving the alternating matrix space isometry problem over a finite field in time polynomial in
the underlying vector space size. We propose a venue of attack for the latter problem by viewing it
as a linear algebraic analogue of the graph isomorphism problem. This viewpoint leads us to explore
the possibility of transferring techniques for graph isomorphism to this long-believed bottleneck
case of group isomorphism. In 1970's, Babai, Erd\H{o}s, and Selkow presented the first average-case
efficient graph isomorphism testing algorithm (SIAM J Computing, 1980). Inspired by that algorithm,
we devise an average-case efficient algorithm for the alternating matrix space isometry problem
over a key range of parameters, in a random model of alternating matrix spaces in vein of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
model of random graphs. For this, we develop a linear algebraic analogue of the classical individualisation
technique, a technique belonging to a set of combinatorial techniques that has been critical for
the progress on the worst-case time complexity for graph isomorphism, but was missing in the group
isomorphism context. This algorithm also enables us to improve Higman's 57-year-old lower bound
on the number of p-groups (Proc. of the LMS, 1960). We finally show that Luks' dynamic programming
technique for graph isomorphism (STOC 1999) can be adapted to slightly improve the worst-case time
complexity of the alternating matrix space isometry problem in a certain range of parameters.
