Knowledge bases (KBs) are not static entities: new information constantly appears and some of the
previous knowledge becomes obsolete. In order to reflect this evolution of knowledge, KBs should
be expanded with the new knowledge and contracted from the obsolete one. This problem is well-studied
for propositional but much less for first-order KBs. In this work we investigate knowledge expansion
and contraction for KBs expressed in DL-Lite, a family of description logics (DLs) that underlie
the tractable fragment OWL 2 QL of the Web Ontology Language OWL 2. We start with a novel knowledge
evolution framework and natural postulates that evolution should respect, and compare our postulates
to the well-established AGM postulates. We then review well-known model and formula-based approaches
for expansion and contraction for propositional theories and show how they can be adapted to the
case of DL-Lite. In particular, we show intrinsic limitations of model-based approaches: besides
the fact that some of them do not respect the postulates we have established, they ignore the structural
properties of KBs. This leads to undesired properties of evolution results: evolution of DL-Lite
KBs cannot be captured in DL-Lite. Moreover, we show that well-known formula-based approaches
are also not appropriate for DL-Lite expansion and contraction: they either have a high complexity
of computation, or they produce logical theories that cannot be expressed in DL-Lite. Thus, we propose
a novel formula-based approach that respects our principles and for which evolution is expressible
in DL-Lite. For this approach we also propose polynomial time deterministic algorithms to compute
evolution of DL-Lite KBs when evolution affects only factual data.
