Modern vehicles are entirely controlled by electronic devices and networks that expose them to
the threat of cyberattacks. Alongside, there is an enormous increase in the number of electric vehicles
(EVs) within the transportation fleet. Cyber vulnerabilities are magnified with EVs due to unique
risks associated with EV battery packs. The batteries provide a fixed driving range for a finite
lifetime, causing the well known `range anxiety' for vehicle operators. Further, there are fire-related
safety concerns with Li-ion batteries. In this study, we develop a systematic framework to assess
the impact of cyberattacks on EVs and EV subsystems. We categorize this impact into physical, financial
or strategic losses; each of which could be due to range, lifetime or safety of the battery packs.
While the current focus of automotive cyberattacks is on short-term physical safety, we believe
that it is crucial to consider long-term cyberattacks that aim to cause financial and strategic
losses. Compromised charging systems such as control of the voltage regulator could lead to cyberattacks
that can shorten the lifetime of a new battery pack to less than a year. Further, this also poses potential
physical safety risks via the triggering of thermal (fire) events. Attacks on EV subsystems, such
as auxiliary components, undoubtedly lead to the trivial effect of draining the battery, which
could be up to 20% per hour and could deteriorate the performance over longer time spans. We also develop
a heuristic for stealthiness to augment traditional threat models for automotive systems. The
methodology and the approach presented here will help in building the foundational principles
for cybersecurity in the context of electric vehicles: a nascent but critical topic in the coming
years.
