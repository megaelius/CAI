Recently, probabilistic range query (PRQ) over uncertain moving objects is attracting more and
more attentions, due to the fact it can help people extract their interested moving objects with
quantitative probability. Previous works usually assumed objects moving on a well defined route,
or assumed objects moving freely in 2D space. The Recently, probabilistic range query (PRQ) over
uncertain moving objects has attracted more and more attentions, due to the fact it can help people
extract their interested moving objects with quantitative probability. Previous works usually
assumed objects moving on a well defined route, or assumed objects moving freely in 2D space. The
first assumption is appropriate for \underline{q}uery processing on \underline{r}oad \underline{n}etworks
(called "qRN" for convenience) where the roads are represented as a series of line segments. This
assumption, however, can not work for \underline{q}uery processing on \underline{r}egion (called
"qR"). In contrast, the second assumption is suitable for "qR", but it is impractical in real applications
since various obstacles may limit the movement of moving objects. In this paper, we introduce the
concept of restricted areas, and we are interested in "qR". Specifically, we consider the problem
of PRQ over uncertain moving objects in constrained 2D space. To achieve these goals is significant,
since it is closer to the real applications, and contributes to returning more authentic answers.
In order to tackle the above problem, we proposed our solution and demonstrated the effectiveness
and efficiency of our proposed approaches by extensive experiments under various experimental
settings.
