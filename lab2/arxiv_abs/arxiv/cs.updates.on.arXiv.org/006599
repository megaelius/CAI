Donald Trump was lagging behind in nearly all opinion polls leading up to the 2016 US presidential
election, but he surprisingly won the election. This raises the following important questions:
1) why most opinion polls were not accurate in 2016? and 2) how to improve the accuracies of opinion
polls? In this paper, we study the inaccuracies of opinion polls in the 2016 election through the
lens of information theory. We first propose a general framework of parameter estimation, called
clean sensing (polling), which performs optimal parameter estimation with sensing cost constraints,
from heterogeneous and potentially distorted data sources. We then cast the opinion polling as
a problem of parameter estimation from potentially distorted heterogeneous data sources, and
derive the optimal polling strategy using heterogenous and possibly distorted data under cost
constraints. Our results show that a larger number of data samples do not necessarily lead to better
polling accuracy, which give a possible explanation of the inaccuracies of opinion polls in 2016.
The optimal sensing strategy should instead optimally allocate sensing resources over heterogenous
data sources according to several factors including data quality, and, moreover, for a particular
data source, it should strike an optimal balance between the quality of data samples, and the quantity
of data samples. As a byproduct of this research, in a general setting, we derive a group of new lower
bounds on the mean-squared errors of general unbiased and biased parameter estimators. These new
lower bounds can be tighter than the classical Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) and Chapman-Robbins
bound. Our derivations are via studying the Lagrange dual problems of certain convex programs.
The classical Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound and Chapman-Robbins bound follow naturally from our results
for special cases of these convex programs.
