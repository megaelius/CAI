PURPOSE: The medical literature relevant to germline genetics is growing exponentially. Clinicians
need tools monitoring and prioritizing the literature to understand the clinical implications
of the pathogenic genetic variants. We developed and evaluated two machine learning models to classify
abstracts as relevant to the penetrance (risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers) or prevalence
of germline genetic mutations. METHODS: We conducted literature searches in PubMed and retrieved
paper titles and abstracts to create an annotated dataset for training and evaluating the two machine
learning classification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which learns
a linear decision rule based on the bag-of-ngrams representation of each title and abstract. Our
second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which learns a complex nonlinear decision
rule based on the raw title and abstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification
of papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. RESULTS: For penetrance classification, we
annotated 3740 paper titles and abstracts and used 60% for training the model, 20% for tuning the
model, and 20% for evaluating the model. The SVM model achieves 89.53% accuracy (percentage of papers
that were correctly classified) while the CNN model achieves 88.95 % accuracy. For prevalence classification,
we annotated 3753 paper titles and abstracts. The SVM model achieves 89.14% accuracy while the CNN
model achieves 89.13 % accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts
as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. By facilitating literature review, this tool could help
clinicians and researchers keep abreast of the burgeoning knowledge of gene-cancer associations
and keep the knowledge bases for clinical decision support tools up to date.
