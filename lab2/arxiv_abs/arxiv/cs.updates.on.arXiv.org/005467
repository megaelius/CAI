This work introduces an innovative parallel, fully-distributed finite element framework for
growing geometries and its application to metal additive manufacturing. It is well-known that
virtual part design and qualification in additive manufacturing requires highly-accurate multiscale
and multiphysics analyses. Only high performance computing tools are able to handle such complexity
in time frames compatible with time-to-market. However, efficiency, without loss of accuracy,
has rarely been the focus in the numerical community. Here, in contrast, the framework is designed
to adequately exploit the resources of high-end distributed-memory machines. It is grounded on
three building blocks: (1) Hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement with octree-based meshes; (2)
a parallel strategy to model the geometry growth; (3) the customization of a parallel iterative
linear solver, which leverages the so-called balancing domain decomposition by constraints preconditioning
approach for fast convergence and high parallel scalability. Computational experiments consider
the part-scale thermal analysis of the printing process by powder-bed technologies. After verification
against a 3D benchmark, a strong scaling analysis is carried out for a simulation of 48 layers printed
in a cuboid. The cuboid is adaptively meshed to model a layer-by-layer metal deposition process
and the average global problem size amounts to 10.3 million unknowns. An unprecedented scalability
for problems with growing domains is achieved, with the capability of simulating the printing and
recoat of a single layer in 8 seconds average on 3,072 processors. Hence, this framework contributes
to take on higher complexity and/or accuracy, not only of part-scale simulations of metal or polymer
additive manufacturing, but also in welding, sedimentation, atherosclerosis, or any other physical
problem with growing-in-time geometries.
