The computation of genomic distances has been a very active field of computational comparative
genomics over the last 25 years. Substantial results include the polynomial-time computability
of the inversion distance by Hannenhalli and Pevzner in 1995 and the introduction of the double-cut
and join (DCJ) distance by Yancopoulos et al. in 2005. Both results, however, rely on the assumption
that the genomes under comparison contain the same set of unique markers (syntenic genomic regions,
sometimes also referred to as genes). In 2015, Shao, Lin and Moret relax this condition by allowing
for duplicate markers in the analysis. This generalized version of the genomic distance problem
is NP-hard, and they give an ILP solution that is efficient enough to be applied to real-world datasets.
A restriction of their approach is that it can be applied only to balanced genomes, that have equal
numbers of duplicates of any marker. Therefore it still needs a delicate preprocessing of the input
data in which excessive copies of unbalanced markers have to be removed. In this paper we present
an algorithm solving the genomic distance problem for natural genomes, in which any marker may occur
an arbitrary number of times. Our method is based on a new graph data structure, the multi-relational
diagram, that allows an elegant extension of the ILP by Shao, Lin and Moret to count runs of markers
that are under- or over-represented in one genome with respect to the other and need to be inserted
or deleted, respectively. With this extension, previous restrictions on the genome configurations
are lifted, for the first time enabling an uncompromising rearrangement analysis. Any marker sequence
can directly be used for the distance calculation. The evaluation of our approach shows that it can
be used to analyze genomes with up to a few ten thousand markers, which we demonstrate on simulated
and real data.
