Nowadays, competition is getting tougher as market shrinks because of financial crisis of the late
2000s. Organizations are tensely forced to leverage their core competencies to survive through
attracting more customers and gaining more efficacious operations. In such a situation, diversified
corporations which run multiple businesses have opportunities to get competitive advantage and
differentiate themselves by executing horizontal strategy. Since this strategy completely engages
a number of business units of a diversified corporation through resource sharing among them, any
effort to implement it will fail if being not supported by enough information. However, for successful
execution of horizontal strategy, managers should have reliable information concerning its success
probability in advance. To provide such a precious information, a three-step framework has been
developed. In the first step, major influencers on successful execution of horizontal strategy
have been captured through literature study and interviewing subject matter experts. In the second
step through the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology, critical
success factors (CSFs) have been extracted from major influencers and a success probability assessment
index system (SPAIS) has been formed. In the third step, due to the statistical nature (multivariate
and distribution free) of SPAIS, an artificial neural network has been designed for enabling organizational
managers to forecast the success probability of horizontal strategy execution in a multi-business
corporation far better than other classical models.
