Collections of biological specimens are fundamental to scientific understanding and characterization
of natural diversity. This paper presents a system for liberating useful information from physical
collections by bringing specimens into the digital domain so they can be more readily shared, analyzed,
annotated and compared. It focuses on insects and is strongly motivated by the desire to accelerate
and augment current practices in insect taxonomy which predominantly use text, 2D diagrams and
images to describe and characterize species. While these traditional kinds of descriptions are
informative and useful, they cannot cover insect specimens "from all angles" and precious specimens
are still exchanged between researchers and collections for this reason. Furthermore, insects
can be complex in structure and pose many challenges to computer vision systems. We present a new
prototype for a practical, cost-effective system of off-the-shelf components to acquire natural-colour
3D models of insects from around 3mm to 30mm in length. Colour images are captured from different
angles and focal depths using a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera rig and two-axis turntable.
These 2D images are processed into 3D reconstructions using software based on a visual hull algorithm.
The resulting models are compact (around 10 megabytes), afford excellent optical resolution,
and can be readily embedded into documents and web pages, as well as viewed on mobile devices. The
system is portable, safe, relatively affordable, and complements the sort of volumetric data that
can be acquired by computed tomography. This system provides a new way to augment the description
and documentation of insect species holotypes, reducing the need to handle or ship specimens. It
opens up new opportunities to collect data for research, education, art, entertainment, biodiversity
assessment and biosecurity control.
