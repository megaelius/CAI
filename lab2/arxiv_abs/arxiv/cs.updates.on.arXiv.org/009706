Literature-based knowledge discovery process identifies the important but implicit relations
among information embedded in published literature. Existing techniques from Information Retrieval
and Natural Language Processing attempt to identify the hidden or unpublished connections between
information concepts within published literature, however, these techniques undermine the concept
of predicting the future and emerging relations among scientific knowledge components encapsulated
within the literature. Keyword Co-occurrence Network (KCN), built upon author selected keywords
(i.e., knowledge entities), is considered as a knowledge graph that focuses both on these knowledge
components and knowledge structure of a scientific domain by examining the relationships between
knowledge entities. Using data from two multidisciplinary research domains other than the medical
domain, capitalizing on bibliometrics, the dynamicity of temporal KCNs, and a Long Short Term Memory
recurrent neural network, this study proposed a framework to successfully predict the future literature-based
discoveries - the emerging connections among knowledge units. Framing the problem as a dynamic
supervised link prediction task, the proposed framework integrates some novel node and edge-level
features. Temporal importance of keywords computed from both bipartite and unipartite networks,
communities of keywords, built upon genealogical relations, and relative importance of temporal
citation counts used in the feature construction process. Both node and edge-level features were
input into an LSTM network to forecast the feature values for positive and negatively labeled non-connected
keyword pairs and classify them accurately. High classification performance rates suggest that
these features are supportive both in predicting the emerging connections between scientific
knowledge units and emerging trend analysis.
