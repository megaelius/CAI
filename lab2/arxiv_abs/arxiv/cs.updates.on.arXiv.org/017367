Screening mammograms is the gold standard for detecting breast cancer early. While a good amount
of work has been performed on mammography image classification, especially with deep neural networks,
there has not been much exploration into the confidence or uncertainty measurement of the classification.
In this paper, we propose a confidence measure-based evaluation metric for breast cancer screening.
We propose a modular network architecture, where a traditional neural network is used as a feature
extractor with transfer learning, followed by a simple Bayesian neural network. Utilizing a two-stage
approach helps reducing the computational complexity, making the proposed framework attractive
for wider deployment. We show that by providing the medical practitioners with a tool to tune two
hyperparameters of the Bayesian neural network, namely, fraction of sampled number of networks
and minimum probability, the framework can be adapted as needed by the domain expert. Finally, we
argue that instead of just a single number such as accuracy, a tuple (accuracy, coverage, sampled
number of networks, and minimum probability) can be utilized as an evaluation metric of our framework.
We provide experimental results on the CBIS-DDSM dataset, where we show the trends in accuracy-coverage
tradeoff while tuning the two hyperparameters. We also show that our confidence tuning results
in increased accuracy with a reduced set of images with high confidence when compared to the baseline
transfer learning. To make the proposed framework readily deployable, we provide (anonymized)
source code with reproducible results at https://git.io/JvRqE.
