The rapid development of the Internet has led to introducing new methods for e-recruitment and human
resources management. These methods aim to systematically address the limitations of conventional
recruitment procedures through incorporating natural language processing tools and semantics-based
methods. In this context, for a given job post, applicant resumes (usually uploaded as free-text
unstructured documents in different formats such as .pdf, .doc, or .rtf) are matched/screened
out using the conventional keyword-based model enriched by additional resources such as occupational
categories and semantics-based techniques. Employing these techniques has proved to be effective
in reducing the cost, time, and efforts required in traditional recruitment and candidate selection
methods. However, the skill gap, i.e. the propensity to precisely detect and extract relevant skills
in applicant resumes and job posts, and the hidden semantic dimensions encoded in applicant resumes
still form a major obstacle for e-recruitment systems. This is due to the fact that resources exploited
by current e-recruitment systems are obtained from generic domain-independent sources, therefore
resulting in knowledge incompleteness and the lack of domain coverage. In this paper, we review
state-of-the-art e-recruitment approaches and highlight recent advancements in this domain.
An e-recruitment framework addressing current shortcomings through the use of multiple cooperative
semantic resources, feature extraction techniques and skill relatedness measures is detailed.
An instantiation of the proposed framework is proposed and an experimental validation using a real-world
recruitment dataset from two employment portals demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.
