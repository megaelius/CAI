Advancing our understanding of software vulnerabilities, automating their identification,
the analysis of their impact, and ultimately their mitigation is necessary to enable the development
of software that is more secure. While operating a vulnerability assessment tool that we developed
and that is currently used by hundreds of development units at SAP, we manually collected and curated
a dataset of vulnerabilities of open-source software and the commits fixing them. The data was obtained
both from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and from project-specific Web resources that
we monitor on a continuous basis. From that data, we extracted a dataset that maps 624 publicly disclosed
vulnerabilities affecting 205 distinct open-source Java projects, used in SAP products or internal
tools, onto the 1282 commits that fix them. Out of 624 vulnerabilities, 29 do not have a CVE identifier
at all and 46, which do have a CVE identifier assigned by a numbering authority, are not available
in the NVD yet. The dataset is released under an open-source license, together with supporting scripts
that allow researchers to automatically retrieve the actual content of the commits from the corresponding
repositories and to augment the attributes available for each instance. Also, these scripts allow
to complement the dataset with additional instances that are not security fixes (which is useful,
for example, in machine learning applications). Our dataset has been successfully used to train
classifiers that could automatically identify security-relevant commits in code repositories.
The release of this dataset and the supporting code as open-source will allow future research to
be based on data of industrial relevance; also, it represents a concrete step towards making the
maintenance of this dataset a shared effort involving open-source communities, academia, and
the industry.
