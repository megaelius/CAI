We build upon previous work out of UC Berkeley's energy, controls, and applications laboratory
(eCal) that developed a model for price prediction of the energy day-ahead market (DAM) and a stochastic
load scheduling for distributed energy resources (DER) with DAM based objective\cite{Travacca}.
In similar fashion to the work of Travacca et al., in this project we take the standpoint of a DER aggregator
pooling a large number of electricity consumers - each of which have an electric vehicle and solar
PV panels - to bid their pooled energy resources into the electricity markets. The primary contribution
of this project is the optimization of an aggregated load schedule for participation in the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO) real time (15-minute) electricity market. The goal of the
aggregator is to optimally manage its pool of resources, particularly the flexible resources,
in order to minimize its cost in the real time market. We achieves this through the use of a model predictive
control scheme. A critical difference between the prior work in \cite{Travacca} is that the structure
of the optimization problem is drastically different. Based upon our review of the current and public
literature, no similar approaches exist. The main objective of this project were building methods.
Nevertheless, to illustrate a simulation with 100 prosumers was realized. The results should therefore
be taken with a grain of salt. We find that the Real Time operation does not substantially decrease
or increase the total cost the aggregator faces in the RT market, but this is probably due to parameters
that need further tuning and data, that need better processing.
