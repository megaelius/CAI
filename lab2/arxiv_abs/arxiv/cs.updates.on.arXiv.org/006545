The safety, mobility, environmental, energy, and economic benefits of transportation systems,
which are the focus of recent Connected Vehicles (CVs) programs, are potentially dramatic. However,
realization of these benefits largely hinges on the timely integration of the digital technology
into the existing transportation infrastructure. CVs must be enabled to broadcast and receive
data to and from other CVs (Vehicle-to-Vehicle, or V2V communication), to and from infrastructure
(Vehicle-to-Infrastructure, or V2I, communication) and to and from other road users, such as bicyclists
or pedestrians (Vehicle-to-Other road users communication). Further, for V2I-focused applications,
the infrastructure and the transportation agencies that manage it must be able to collect, process,
distribute, and archive these data quickly, reliably, and securely. This paper focuses V2I applications,
and studies current digital roadway infrastructure initiatives. It highlights the importance
of including digital infrastructure investment alongside investment in more traditional transportation
infrastructure to keep up with the auto industrys push towards connecting vehicles to other vehicles.
By studying the current CV testbeds and Smart City initiatives, this paper identifies digital infrastructure
components being used by public agencies. It also examines public agencies limited budgeting for
digital infrastructure, and finds current expenditure is inadequate for realizing the potential
benefits of V2I applications. Finally, the paper presents a set of recommendations, based on a review
of current practices and future needs, designed to guide agencies responsible for transportation
infrastructure.
