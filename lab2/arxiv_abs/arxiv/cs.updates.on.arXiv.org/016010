For very high capacity networks (VHC), the main objective is to improve the quality of the end-user
experience. This implies compliance with key performance indicators (KPIs) required by applications.
Key performance indicators at the application level are throughput, download time, round trip
time, and video delay. They depend on the end-to-end connection between the server and the end-user
device. For VHC networks, Telco operators must provide the required application quality. Moreover,
they must meet the objectives of economic sustainability. Today, Telco operators rarely achieve
the above objectives, mainly due to the push to increase the bit-rate of access networks without
considering the end-to-end KPIs of the applications. The main contribution of this paper concerns
the definition of a deployment framework to address performance and cost issues for VHC networks.
We show three actions on which it is necessary to focus. First, limiting bit-rate through video compression.
Second, contain the rate of packet loss through artificial intelligence algorithms for line stabilization.
Third, reduce latency (i.e., round-trip time) with edge-cloud computing. The concerted and gradual
application of these measures can allow a Telco to get out of the ultra-broadband "trap" of the access
network, as defined in the paper. We propose to work on end-to-end optimization of the bandwidth
utilization ratio. This leads to a better performance experienced by the end-user. It also allows
a Telco operator to create new business models and obtain new revenue streams at a sustainable cost.
To give a clear example, we describe how to realize mobile virtual and augmented reality, which is
one of the most challenging future services.
