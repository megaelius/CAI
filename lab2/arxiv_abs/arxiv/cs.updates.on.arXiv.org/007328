Network motifs are patterns of over-represented node interactions in a network which have been
previously used as building blocks to understand various aspects of the social networks. In this
paper, we use motif patterns to characterize the information diffusion process in social networks.
We study the lifecycle of information cascades to understand what leads to saturation of growth
in terms of cascade reshares, thereby resulting in expiration, an event we call ``diffusion inhibition''.
In an attempt to understand what causes inhibition, we use motifs to dissect the network obtained
from information cascades coupled with traces of historical diffusion or social network links.
Our main results follow from experiments on a dataset of cascades from the Weibo platform and the
Flixster movie ratings. We observe the temporal counts of 5-node undirected motifs from the cascade
temporal networks leading to the inhibition stage. Empirical evidences from the analysis lead
us to conclude the following about stages preceding inhibition: (1) individuals tend to adopt information
more from users they have known in the past through social networks or previous interactions thereby
creating patterns containing triads more frequently than acyclic patterns with linear chains
and (2) users need multiple exposures or rounds of social reinforcement for them to adopt an information
and as a result information starts spreading slowly thereby leading to the death of the cascade.
Following these observations, we use motif based features to predict the edge cardinality of the
network exhibited at the time of inhibition. We test features of motif patterns by using regression
models for both individual patterns and their combination and we find that motifs as features are
better predictors of the future network organization than individual node centralities.
