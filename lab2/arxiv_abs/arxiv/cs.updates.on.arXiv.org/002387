Physical activity and sleep play a major role in the prevention and management of many chronic conditions.
It is not a trivial task to understand their impact on chronic conditions. Currently, data from electronic
health records (EHRs), sleep lab studies, and activity/sleep logs are used. The rapid increase
in the popularity of wearable health devices provides a significant new data source, making it possible
to track the user's lifestyle real-time through web interfaces, both to consumer as well as their
healthcare provider, potentially. However, at present there is a gap between lifestyle data (e.g.,
sleep, physical activity) and clinical outcomes normally captured in EHRs. This is a critical barrier
for the use of this new source of signal for healthcare decision making. Applying deep learning to
wearables data provides a new opportunity to overcome this barrier. To address the problem of the
unavailability of clinical data from a major fraction of subjects and unrepresentative subject
populations, we propose a novel unsupervised (task-agnostic) time-series representation learning
technique called act2vec. act2vec learns useful features by taking into account the co-occurrence
of activity levels along with periodicity of human activity patterns. The learned representations
are then exploited to boost the performance of disorder-specific supervised learning models.
Furthermore, since many disorders are often related to each other, a phenomenon referred to as co-morbidity,
we use a multi-task learning framework for exploiting the shared structure of disorder inducing
life-style choices partially captured in the wearables data. Empirical evaluation using actigraphy
data from 4,124 subjects shows that our proposed method performs and generalizes substantially
better than the conventional time-series symbolic representational methods and task-specific
deep learning models.
