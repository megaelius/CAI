With ever-increasing volumes of scientific data produced by HPC applications, significantly
reducing data size is critical because of limited capacity of storage space and potential bottlenecks
on I/O or networks in writing/reading or transferring data. SZ and ZFP are the two leading lossy compressors
available to compress scientific data sets. However, their performance is not consistent across
different data sets and across different fields of some data sets: for some fields SZ provides better
compression performance, while other fields are better compressed with ZFP. This situation raises
the need for an automatic online (during compression) selection between SZ and ZFP, with a minimal
overhead. In this paper, the automatic selection optimizes the rate-distortion, an important
statistical quality metric based on the signal-to-noise ratio. To optimize for rate-distortion,
we investigate the principles of SZ and ZFP. We then propose an efficient online, low-overhead selection
algorithm that predicts the compression quality accurately for two compressors in early processing
stages and selects the best-fit compressor for each data field. We implement the selection algorithm
into an open-source library, and we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed solution against
plain SZ and ZFP in a parallel environment with 1,024 cores. Evaluation results on three data sets
representing about 100 fields show that our selection algorithm improves the compression ratio
up to 70% with the same level of data distortion because of very accurate selection (around 99%) of
the best-fit compressor, with little overhead (less than 7% in the experiments).
