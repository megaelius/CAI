A binary matrix has the consecutive ones property ($C1P$) for rows (columns) if there is a permutation
of its columns (rows) that arranges the ones consecutively in all the rows (columns). A binary matrix
has the simultaneous consecutive ones property ($SC1P$) if it has both the $C1P$ for rows and columns.
We consider the following two categories of problems: Simultaneous Consecutive Ones Submatrix
($SC1S$) and Simultaneous Consecutive Ones Editing ($SC1E$) in a similar spirit as that of Consecutive
Ones Submatrix and Consecutive Ones Editing problems. For a given binary matrix $M$, Consecutive
Ones Submatrix problem decides if there is a submatrix of $M$ that satisfies the $C1P$ for rows and
Consecutive Ones Editing problem decides if there is a set of $1$-entries of size at most $k$ in $M$
whose flipping results in a matrix with the $C1P$ for rows. $SC1S$ problems focus on deleting a minimum
number of rows (columns) to establish the $SC1P$ whereas $SC1E$ problem deals with flipping a minimum
number of $1$s to obtain the $SC1P$. We consider the parameterized versions of $SC1S$ and $SC1E$
problems with $k$ as the parameter and are defined as follows. Given a binary matrix $M$ and a positive
integer $k$, $k$-$SC1S$-$R$ ($k$-$SC1S$-$C$) problem decides whether there exists a set of rows
(columns) of size at most $k$ whose deletion results in a matrix with the $SC1P$. The $k$-$SC1P$-$1E$
problem decides whether there exists a set of $1$-entries of size at most $k$ whose flipping results
in a matrix with the $SC1P$. We show that $k$-$SC1S$-$R$, $k$-$SC1S$-$C$ and $k$-$SC1P$-$1E$ are
fixed-parameter tractable on $(2,*)$-matrices and $(*,2)$-matrices. We observe that using our
algorithm, $k$-$SC1S$-$R$, $k$-$SC1S$-$C$ and $k$-$SC1P$-$1E$ can be approximated in polynomial-time
on $(2,*)$-matrices and $(*,2)$-matrices.
