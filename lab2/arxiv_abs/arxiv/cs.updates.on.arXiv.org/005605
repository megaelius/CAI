Chessboard and chess piece recognition is a computer vision problem that has not yet been efficiently
solved. However, its solution is crucial for many experienced players who wish to compete against
AI bots, but also prefer to make decisions based on the analysis of a physical chessboard. It is also
important for organizers of chess tournaments who wish to digitize play for online broadcasting
or ordinary players who wish to share their gameplay with friends. Typically, such digitization
tasks are performed by humans or with the aid of specialized chessboards and pieces. However, neither
solution is easy or convenient. To solve this problem, we propose a novel algorithm for digitizing
chessboard configurations. We designed a method that is resistant to lighting conditions and the
angle at which images are captured, and works correctly with numerous chessboard styles. The proposed
algorithm processes pictures iteratively. During each iteration, it executes three major sub-processes:
detecting straight lines, finding lattice points, and positioning the chessboard. Finally, we
identify all chess pieces and generate a description of the board utilizing standard notation.
For each of these steps, we designed our own algorithm that surpasses existing solutions. We support
our algorithms by utilizing machine learning techniques whenever possible. The described method
performs extraordinarily well and achieves an accuracy over $99.5\%$ for detecting chessboard
lattice points (compared to the $74\%$ for the best alternative), $95\%$ (compared to $60\%$ for
the best alternative) for positioning the chessboard in an image, and almost $95\%$ for chess piece
recognition.
