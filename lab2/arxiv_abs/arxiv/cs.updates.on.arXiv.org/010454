Complex spatiotemporal dynamics of physicochemical processes are often modeled at a microscopic
level (through e.g. atomistic, agent-based or lattice models) based on first principles. Some
of these processes can also be successfully modeled at the macroscopic level using e.g. partial
differential equations (PDEs) describing the evolution of the right few macroscopic observables
(e.g. concentration and momentum fields). Deriving good macroscopic descriptions (the so-called
"closure problem") is often a time-consuming process requiring deep understanding/intuition
about the system of interest. Recent developments in data science provide alternative ways to effectively
extract/learn accurate macroscopic descriptions approximating the underlying microscopic
observations. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven framework for the identification of unavailable
coarse-scale PDEs from microscopic observations via machine learning algorithms. Specifically,
using Gaussian Processes, Artificial Neural Networks, and/or Diffusion Maps, the proposed framework
uncovers the relation between the relevant macroscopic space fields and their time evolution (the
right-hand-side of the explicitly unavailable macroscopic PDE). Interestingly, several choices
equally representative of the data can be discovered. The framework will be illustrated through
the data-driven discovery of macroscopic, concentration-level PDEs resulting from a fine-scale,
Lattice Boltzmann level model of a reaction/transport process. Once the coarse evolution law is
identified, it can be simulated to produce long-term macroscopic predictions. Different features
(pros as well as cons) of alternative machine learning algorithms for performing this task (Gaussian
Processes and Artificial Neural Networks), are presented and discussed.
