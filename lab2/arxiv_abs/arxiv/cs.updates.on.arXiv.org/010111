We present BrainPainter, a software that automatically generates images of highlighted brain
structures given a list of numbers corresponding to the output colours of each region. Compared
to existing visualisation software (i.e. Freesurfer, SPM, 3D Slicer), BrainPainter has three
key advantages: (1) it does not require the input data to be in a specialised format, allowing BrainPainter
to be used in combination with any neuroimaging analysis tools, (2) it can visualise both cortical
and subcortical structures and (3) it can be used to generate movies showing dynamic processes,
e.g. propagation of pathology on the brain. We highlight three use cases where BrainPainter was
used in existing neuroimaging studies: (1) visualisation of the degree of atrophy through interpolation
along a user-defined gradient of colours, (2) visualisation of the progression of pathology in
Alzheimer's disease as well as (3) visualisation of pathology in subcortical regions in Huntington's
disease. Moreover, through the design of BrainPainter we demonstrate the possibility of using
a powerful 3D computer graphics engine such as Blender to generate brain visualisations for the
neuroscience community. Blender's capabilities, e.g. particle simulations, motion graphics,
UV unwrapping, raster graphics editing, raytracing and illumination effects, open a wealth of
possibilities for brain visualisation not available in current neuroimaging software. BrainPainter
is customisable, easy to use, and can run straight from the web browser: https://brainpainter.csail.mit.edu
, as well as from source-code packaged in a docker container: https://github.com/mrazvan22/brain-coloring
. It can be used to visualise biomarker data from any brain imaging modality, or simply to highlight
a particular brain structure for e.g. anatomy courses.
