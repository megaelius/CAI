We study the problem of assigning a group of mobile robots to an equal number of distinct static targets,
seeking to minimize the total distance traveled by all robots until each target is occupied by a robot.
In the first half of our paper, the robots assume limited communication and target-sensing range;
otherwise, the robots have no prior knowledge of target locations. Under these assumptions, we
present a necessary and sufficient condition under which true distance optimality can be achieved.
Moreover, we provide an explicit, non-asymptotic formula for computing the number of robots needed
for achieving distance optimality in terms of the robots' communication and target-sensing ranges
with arbitrary guaranteed probabilities. We also show that the same bounds are asymptotically
tight. Because a large number of robots is required for guaranteeing distance optimality with high
probability, in the second half of our study, we present suboptimal strategies when the number of
robots cannot be freely chosen. Assuming that each robot is aware of all target locations, we first
work under a hierarchical communication model such that at each hierarchy level, the workspace
is partitioned into disjoint regions; robots can communicate with one another if they belong to
the same region. The communication model leads naturally to hierarchical strategies, which, under
mild assumptions, yield constant approximations of true distance-optimal solutions. We then
revisit the range-based communication model and show that combining hierarchical strategies
with simple rendezvous-based strategies results in decentralized strategies which again achieve
constant approximation ratios on distance optimality. Results from simulation show that the approximation
ratio is as low as 1.4.
