Introduction of spectrum-sharing in 5G and subsequent generation networks demand base-station(s)
with the capability to characterize the wideband spectrum spanned over licensed, shared and unlicensed
non-contiguous frequency bands. Spectrum characterization involves the identification of vacant
bands along with center frequency and parameters (energy, modulation, etc.) of occupied bands.
Such characterization at Nyquist sampling is area and power-hungry due to the need for high-speed
digitization. Though sub-Nyquist sampling (SNS) offers an excellent alternative when the spectrum
is sparse, it suffers from poor performance at low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and demands careful
design and integration of digital reconstruction, tunable channelizer and characterization
algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning framework via a single unified pipeline
to accomplish two tasks: 1)~Reconstruct the signal directly from sub-Nyquist samples, and 2)~Wideband
spectrum characterization. The proposed approach eliminates the need for complex signal conditioning
between reconstruction and characterization and does not need complex tunable channelizers.
We extensively compare the performance of our framework for a wide range of modulation schemes,
SNR and channel conditions. We show that the proposed framework outperforms existing SNS based
approaches and characterization performance approaches to Nyquist sampling-based framework
with an increase in SNR. Easy to design and integrate along with a single unified deep learning framework
make the proposed architecture a good candidate for reconfigurable platforms.
