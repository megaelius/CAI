Proliferation of cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) that allow pseudo-anonymous transactions,
has made it easier for ransomware developers to demand ransom by encrypting sensitive user data.
The recently revealed strikes of ransomware attacks have already resulted in significant economic
losses and societal harm across different sectors, ranging from local governments to health care.
Most modern ransomware use Bitcoin for payments. However, although Bitcoin transactions are permanently
recorded and publicly available, current approaches for detecting ransomware depend only on a
couple of heuristics and/or tedious information gathering steps (e.g., running ransomware to
collect ransomware related Bitcoin addresses). To our knowledge, none of the previous approaches
have employed advanced data analytics techniques to automatically detect ransomware related
transactions and malicious Bitcoin addresses. By capitalizing on the recent advances in topological
data analysis, we propose an efficient and tractable data analytics framework to automatically
detect new malicious addresses in a ransomware family, given only a limited records of previous
transactions. Furthermore, our proposed techniques exhibit high utility to detect the emergence
of new ransomware families, that is, ransomware with no previous records of transactions. Using
the existing known ransomware data sets, we show that our proposed methodology provides significant
improvements in precision and recall for ransomware transaction detection, compared to existing
heuristic based approaches, and can be utilized to automate ransomware detection.
