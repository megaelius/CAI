Recently, Bravyi, Gosset, and K\"{o}nig (Science, 2018) exhibited a search problem called the
2D Hidden Linear Function (2D HLF) problem that can be solved exactly by a constant-depth quantum
circuit using bounded fan-in gates (or QNC^0 circuits), but cannot be solved by any constant-depth
classical circuit using bounded fan-in AND, OR, and NOT gates (or NC^0 circuits). In other words,
they exhibited a search problem in QNC^0 that is not in NC^0. We strengthen their result by proving
that the 2D HLF problem is not contained in AC^0, the class of classical, polynomial-size, constant-depth
circuits over the gate set of unbounded fan-in AND and OR gates, and NOT gates. We also supplement
this worst-case lower bound with an average-case result: There exists a simple distribution under
which any AC^0 circuit (even of nearly exponential size) has exponentially small correlation with
the 2D HLF problem. Our results are shown by constructing a new problem in QNC^0, which we call the
Relaxed Parity Halving Problem, which is easier to work with. We prove our AC^0 lower bounds for this
problem, and then show that it reduces to the 2D HLF problem. As a step towards even stronger lower
bounds, we present a search problem that we call the Parity Bending Problem, which is in QNC^0/qpoly
(QNC^0 circuits that are allowed to start with a quantum state of their choice that is independent
of the input), but is not even in AC^0[2] (the class AC^0 with unbounded fan-in XOR gates). All the
quantum circuits in our paper are simple, and the main difficulty lies in proving the classical lower
bounds. For this we employ a host of techniques, including a refinement of H{\aa}stad's switching
lemmas for multi-output circuits that may be of independent interest, the Razborov-Smolensky
AC^0[2] lower bound, Vazirani's XOR lemma, and lower bounds for non-local games.
