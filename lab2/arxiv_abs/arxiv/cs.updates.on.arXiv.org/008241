Road detection from the perspective of moving vehicles is a challenging issue in autonomous driving.
Recently, many deep learning methods spring up for this task because they can extract high-level
local features to find road regions from raw RGB data, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). However, how to detect the boundary of road accurately
is still an intractable problem. In this paper, we propose a siamesed fully convolutional networks
(named as ``s-FCN-loc''), which is able to consider RGB-channel images, semantic contours and
location priors simultaneously to segment road region elaborately. To be specific, the s-FCN-loc
has two streams to process the original RGB images and contour maps respectively. At the same time,
the location prior is directly appended to the siamesed FCN to promote the final detection performance.
Our contributions are threefold: (1) An s-FCN-loc is proposed that learns more discriminative
features of road boundaries than the original FCN to detect more accurate road regions; (2) Location
prior is viewed as a type of feature map and directly appended to the final feature map in s-FCN-loc
to promote the detection performance effectively, which is easier than other traditional methods,
namely different priors for different inputs (image patches); (3) The convergent speed of training
s-FCN-loc model is 30\% faster than the original FCN, because of the guidance of highly structured
contours. The proposed approach is evaluated on KITTI Road Detection Benchmark and One-Class Road
Detection Dataset, and achieves a competitive result with state of the arts.
