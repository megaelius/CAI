This paper considers the problem of resource-constrained and noise-limited localization and
estimation of dynamic targets that are sparsely distributed over a large area. We generalize an
existing framework [Bashan et al, 2008] for adaptive allocation of sensing resources to the dynamic
case, accounting for time-varying target behavior such as transitions to neighboring cells and
varying amplitudes over a potentially long time horizon. The proposed adaptive sensing policy
is driven by minimization of a modified version of the previously introduced ARAP objective function,
which is a surrogate function for mean squared error within locations containing targets. We provide
theoretical upper bounds on the performance of adaptive sensing policies by analyzing solutions
with oracle knowledge of target locations, gaining insight into the effect of target motion and
amplitude variation as well as sparsity. Exact minimization of the multi-stage objective function
is infeasible, but myopic optimization yields a closed-form solution. We propose a simple non-myopic
extension, the Dynamic Adaptive Resource Allocation Policy (D-ARAP), that allocates a fraction
of resources for exploring all locations rather than solely exploiting the current belief state.
Our numerical studies indicate that D-ARAP has the following advantages: (a) it is more robust than
the myopic policy to noise, missing data, and model mismatch; (b) it performs comparably to well-known
approximate dynamic programming solutions but at significantly lower computational complexity;
and (c) it improves greatly upon non-adaptive uniform resource allocation in terms of estimation
error and probability of detection.
