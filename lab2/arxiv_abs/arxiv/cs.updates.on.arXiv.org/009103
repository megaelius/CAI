Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women, affecting more than 10% of women worldwide.
Microscopic analysis of a biopsy remains one of the most important methods to diagnose the type of
breast cancer. This requires specialized analysis by pathologists, in a task that i) is highly time-
and cost-consuming and ii) often leads to nonconsensual results. The relevance and potential of
automatic classification algorithms using hematoxylin-eosin stained histopathological images
has already been demonstrated, but the reported results are still sub-optimal for clinical use.
With the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in automatic classification, the Grand Challenge
on BreAst Cancer Histology images (BACH) was organized in conjunction with the 15th International
Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition (ICIAR 2018). A large annotated dataset, composed
of both microscopy and whole-slide images, was specifically compiled and made publicly available
for the BACH challenge. Following a positive response from the scientific community, a total of
64 submissions, out of 677 registrations, effectively entered the competition. From the submitted
algorithms it was possible to push forward the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy (87%) in automatic
classification of breast cancer with histopathological images. Convolutional neuronal networks
were the most successful methodology in the BACH challenge. Detailed analysis of the collective
results allowed the identification of remaining challenges in the field and recommendations for
future developments. The BACH dataset remains publically available as to promote further improvements
to the field of automatic classification in digital pathology.
