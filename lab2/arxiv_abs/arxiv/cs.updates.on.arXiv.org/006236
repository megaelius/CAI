Protein interactions constitute the fundamental building block of almost every life activity.
Identifying protein communities from Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks is essential
to understand the principles of cellular organization and explore the causes of various diseases.
It is critical to integrate multiple data resources to identify reliable protein communities that
have biological significance and improve the performance of community detection methods for large-scale
PPI networks. In this paper, we propose a Multi-source Learning based Protein Community Detection
(MLPCD) algorithm by integrating Gene Expression Data (GED) and a parallel solution of MLPCD using
cloud computing technology. To effectively discover the biological functions of proteins that
participating in different cellular processes, GED under different conditions is integrated
with the original PPI network to reconstruct a Weighted-PPI (WPPI) network. To flexibly identify
protein communities of different scales, we define community modularity and functional cohesion
measurements and detect protein communities from WPPI using an agglomerative method. In addition,
we respectively compare the detected communities with known protein complexes and evaluate the
functional enrichment of protein function modules using Gene Ontology annotations. Moreover,
we implement a parallel version of the MLPCD algorithm on the Apache Spark platform to enhance the
performance of the algorithm for large-scale realistic PPI networks. Extensive experimental
results indicate the superiority and notable advantages of the MLPCD algorithm over the relevant
algorithms in terms of accuracy and performance.
