Increasing interest in securing the Android ecosystem has spawned numerous efforts to assist app
developers in building secure apps. These efforts have resulted in tools and techniques capable
of detecting vulnerabilities (and malicious behaviors) in apps. However, there has been no evaluation
of the effectiveness of these tools and techniques in detecting known vulnerabilities. The absence
of such evaluations puts app developers at a disadvantage when choosing security analysis tools
to secure their apps. In this regard, we evaluated the effectiveness of vulnerability detection
tools for Android apps. We reviewed 64 tools and empirically evaluated 14 vulnerability detection
tools (incidentally along with five malicious behavior detection tools) against 42 known unique
vulnerabilities captured by Ghera benchmarks, which are composed of both vulnerable and secure
apps. Of the 24 observations from the evaluation, the main observation is existing vulnerability
detection tools for Android apps are very limited in their ability to detect known vulnerabilities
--- all of the evaluated tools together could only detect 30 of the 42 known unique vulnerabilities.
More effort is required if security analysis tools are to help developers build secure apps. We hope
the observations from this evaluation will help app developers choose appropriate security analysis
tools and persuade tool developers and researchers to identify and address limitations in their
tools and techniques. We also hope this evaluation will catalyze or spark a conversation in the software
engineering and security communities to require a more rigorous and explicit evaluation of security
analysis tools and techniques.
