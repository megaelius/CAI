Purpose: To remove retinal shadows from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the optic
nerve head(ONH). Methods:2328 OCT images acquired through the center of the ONH using a Spectralis
OCT machine for both eyes of 13 subjects were used to train a generative adversarial network (GAN)
using a custom loss function. Image quality was assessed qualitatively (for artifacts) and quantitatively
using the intralayer contrast: a measure of shadow visibility ranging from 0 (shadow-free) to 1
(strong shadow) and compared to compensated images. This was computed in the Retinal Nerve Fiber
Layer (RNFL), the Inner Plexiform Layer (IPL), the Photoreceptor layer (PR) and the Retinal Pigment
Epithelium (RPE) layers. Results: Output images had improved intralayer contrast in all ONH tissue
layers. On average the intralayer contrast decreased by 33.7$\pm$6.81%, 28.8$\pm$10.4%, 35.9$\pm$13.0%,
and43.0$\pm$19.5%for the RNFL, IPL, PR, and RPE layers respectively, indicating successful shadow
removal across all depths. This compared to 70.3$\pm$22.7%, 33.9$\pm$11.5%, 47.0$\pm$11.2%,
26.7$\pm$19.0%for compensation. Output images were also free from artifacts commonly observed
with compensation. Conclusions: DeshadowGAN significantly corrected blood vessel shadows in
OCT images of the ONH. Our algorithm may be considered as a pre-processing step to improve the performance
of a wide range of algorithms including those currently being used for OCT image segmentation, denoising,
and classification. Translational Relevance: DeshadowGAN could be integrated to existing OCT
devices to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of ocular pathologies.
