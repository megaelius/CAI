Amino acid sequence portrays most intrinsic form of a protein and expresses primary structure of
protein. The order of amino acids in a sequence enables a protein to acquire a particular stable conformation
that is responsible for the functions of the protein. This relationship between a sequence and its
function motivates the need to analyse the sequences for predicting protein functions. Early generation
computational methods using BLAST, FASTA, etc. perform function transfer based on sequence similarity
with existing databases and are computationally slow. Although machine learning based approaches
are fast, they fail to perform well for long protein sequences (i.e., protein sequences with more
than 300 amino acid residues). In this paper, we introduce a novel method for construction of two
separate feature sets for protein sequences based on analysis of 1) single fixed-sized segments
and 2) multi-sized segments, using bi-directional long short-term memory network. Further, model
based on proposed feature set is combined with the state of the art Multi-lable Linear Discriminant
Analysis (MLDA) features based model to improve the accuracy. Extensive evaluations using separate
datasets for biological processes and molecular functions demonstrate promising results for
both single-sized and multi-sized segments based feature sets. While former showed an improvement
of +3.37% and +5.48%, the latter produces an improvement of +5.38% and +8.00% respectively for two
datasets over the state of the art MLDA based classifier. After combining two models, there is a significant
improvement of +7.41% and +9.21% respectively for two datasets compared to MLDA based classifier.
Specifically, the proposed approach performed well for the long protein sequences and superior
overall performance.
