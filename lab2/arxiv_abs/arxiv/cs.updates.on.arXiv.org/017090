Machine translation is one of the applications of natural language processing which has been explored
in different languages. Recently researchers started paying attention towards machine translation
for resource-poor languages and closely related languages. A widespread and underlying problem
for these machine translation systems is the variation in orthographic conventions which causes
many issues to traditional approaches. Two languages written in two different orthographies are
not easily comparable, but orthographic information can also be used to improve the machine translation
system. This article offers a survey of research regarding orthography's influence on machine
translation of under-resourced languages. It introduces under-resourced languages in terms
of machine translation and how orthographic information can be utilised to improve machine translation.
We describe previous work in this area, discussing what underlying assumptions were made, and showing
how orthographic knowledge improves the performance of machine translation of under-resourced
languages. We discuss different types of machine translation and demonstrate a recent trend that
seeks to link orthographic information with well-established machine translation methods. Considerable
attention is given to current efforts of cognates information at different levels of machine translation
and the lessons that can be drawn from this. Additionally, multilingual neural machine translation
of closely related languages is given a particular focus in this survey. This article ends with a
discussion of the way forward in machine translation with orthographic information, focusing
on multilingual settings and bilingual lexicon induction.
