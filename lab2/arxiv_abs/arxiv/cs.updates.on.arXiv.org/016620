Brain imaging of mental health, neurodevelopmental and learning disorders has coupled with machine
learning to identify patients based only on their brain activation, and ultimately identify features
that generalize from smaller samples of data to larger ones. However, the success of machine learning
classification algorithms on neurofunctional data has been limited to more homogeneous data sets
of dozens of participants. More recently, larger brain imaging data sets have allowed for the application
of deep learning techniques to classify brain states and clinical groups solely from neurofunctional
features. Deep learning techniques provide helpful tools for classification in healthcare applications,
including classification of structural 3D brain images. Recent approaches improved classification
performance of larger functional brain imaging data sets, but they fail to provide diagnostic insights
about the underlying conditions or provide an explanation from the neural features that informed
the classification. We address this challenge by leveraging a number of network visualization
techniques to show that, using such techniques in convolutional neural network layers responsible
for learning high-level features, we are able to provide meaningful images for expert-backed insights
into the condition being classified. Our results show not only accurate classification of developmental
dyslexia from the brain imaging alone, but also provide automatic visualizations of the features
involved that match contemporary neuroscientific knowledge, indicating that the visual explanations
do help in unveiling the neurological bases of the disorder being classified.
