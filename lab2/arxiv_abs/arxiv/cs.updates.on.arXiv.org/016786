In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system is proposed for brain tumor segmentation.
The system consists of three parts, a pre-processing block to reduce the data volume, an application-specific
CNN(ASCNN) to segment tumor areas precisely, and a refinement block to detect/remove false positive
pixels. The CNN, designed specifically for the task, has 7 convolution layers, 16 channels per layer,
requiring only 11716 parameters. The convolutions combined with max-pooling in the first half
of the CNN are performed to localize tumor areas. Two convolution modes, namely depthwise convolution
and standard convolution, are performed in parallel in the first 2 layers to extract elementary
features efficiently. For a fine classification of pixel-wise precision in the second half of the
CNN, the feature maps are modulated by adding the weighted local features generated in the first
half of the CNN. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated by an online platform with
dataset BRATS2018. Requiring a very low computation volume, the proposed system delivers a high
segmentation quality indicated by its average Dice scores of 0.75, 0.88 and 0.76 for enhancing tumor,
whole tumor and tumor core, respectively, and the median Dice scores of 0.85, 0.92, and 0.86. The
consistency in system performance has also been measured, demonstrating that the system is able
to reproduce almost the same output to the same input after retraining. The simple structure of the
proposed system facilitates its implementation in computation restricted environment, and a
wide range of applications can thus be expected.
