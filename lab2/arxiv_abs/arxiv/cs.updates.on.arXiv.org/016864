Deep Learning-based object detectors can enhance the capabilities of smart camera systems in a
wide spectrum of machine vision applications including video surveillance, autonomous driving,
robots and drones, smart factory, and health monitoring. Pedestrian detection plays a key role
in all these applications and deep learning can be used to construct accurate state-of-the-art
detectors. However, such complex paradigms do not scale easily and are not traditionally implemented
in resource-constrained smart cameras for on-device processing which offers significant advantages
in situations when real-time monitoring and robustness are vital. Efficient neural networks can
not only enable mobile applications and on-device experiences but can also be a key enabler of privacy
and security allowing a user to gain the benefits of neural networks without needing to send their
data to the server to be evaluated. This work addresses the challenge of achieving a good trade-off
between accuracy and speed for efficient deployment of deep-learning-based pedestrian detection
in smart camera applications. A computationally efficient architecture is introduced based on
separable convolutions and proposes integrating dense connections across layers and multi-scale
feature fusion to improve representational capacity while decreasing the number of parameters
and operations. In particular, the contributions of this work are the following: 1) An efficient
backbone combining multi-scale feature operations, 2) a more elaborate loss function for improved
localization, 3) an anchor-less approach for detection, The proposed approach called YOLOpeds
is evaluated using the PETS2009 surveillance dataset on 320x320 images. Overall, YOLOpeds provides
real-time sustained operation of over 30 frames per second with detection rates in the range of 86%
outperforming existing deep learning models.
