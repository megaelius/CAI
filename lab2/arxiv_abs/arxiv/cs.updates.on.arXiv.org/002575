Increasingly, Internet of Things (IoT) domains, such as sensor networks, smart cities, and social
networks, generate vast amounts of data. Such data are not only unbounded and rapidly evolving.
Rather, the content thereof dynamically evolves over time, often in unforeseen ways. These variations
are due to so-called concept drifts, caused by changes in the underlying data generation mechanisms.
In a classification setting, concept drift causes the previously learned models to become inaccurate,
unsafe and even unusable. Accordingly, concept drifts need to be detected, and handled, as soon
as possible. In medical applications and emergency response settings, for example, change in behaviours
should be detected in near real-time, to avoid potential loss of life. To this end, we introduce the
McDiarmid Drift Detection Method (MDDM), which utilizes McDiarmid's inequality in order to detect
concept drift. The MDDM approach proceeds by sliding a window over prediction results, and associate
window entries with weights. Higher weights are assigned to the most recent entries, in order to
emphasize their importance. As instances are processed, the detection algorithm compares a weighted
mean of elements inside the sliding window with the maximum weighted mean observed so far. A significant
difference between the two weighted means, upper-bounded by the McDiarmid inequality, implies
a concept drift. Our extensive experimentation against synthetic and real-world data streams
show that our novel method outperforms the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MDDM yields shorter
detection delays as well as lower false negative rates, while maintaining high classification
accuracies.
