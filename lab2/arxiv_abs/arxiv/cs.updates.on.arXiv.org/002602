There is an increasing role for the IT design community to play in regulation of emerging IT. Article
25 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016 puts this on a strict legal basis by establishing
the need for information privacy by design and default (PbD) for personal data-driven technologies.
Against this backdrop, we examine legal, commercial and technical perspectives around the newly
created legal right to data portability (RTDP) in GDPR. We are motivated by a pressing need to address
regulatory challenges stemming from the Internet of Things (IoT). We need to find channels to support
the protection of these new legal rights for users in practice. In Part I we introduce the internet
of things and information PbD in more detail. We briefly consider regulatory challenges posed by
the IoT and the nature and practical challenges surrounding the regulatory response of information
privacy by design. In Part II, we look in depth at the legal nature of the RTDP, determining what it
requires from IT designers in practice but also limitations on the right and how it relates to IoT.
In Part III we focus on technical approaches that can support the realisation of the right. We consider
the state of the art in data management architectures, tools and platforms that can provide portability,
increased transparency and user control over the data flows. In Part IV, we bring our perspectives
together to reflect on the technical, legal and business barriers and opportunities that will shape
the implementation of the RTDP in practice, and how the relationships may shape emerging IoT innovation
and business models. We finish with brief conclusions about the future for the RTDP and PbD in the
IoT.
