Face hallucination is a technique that reconstruct high-resolution (HR) faces from low-resolution
(LR) faces, by using the prior knowledge learned from HR/LR face pairs. Most state-of-the-arts
leverage position-patch prior knowledge of human face to estimate the optimal representation
coefficients for each image patch. However, they focus only the position information and usually
ignore the context information of image patch. In addition, when they are confronted with misalignment
or the Small Sample Size (SSS) problem, the hallucination performance is very poor. To this end,
this study incorporates the contextual information of image patch and proposes a powerful and efficient
context-patch based face hallucination approach, namely Thresholding Locality-constrained
Representation and Reproducing learning (TLcR-RL). Under the context-patch based framework,
we advance a thresholding based representation method to enhance the reconstruction accuracy
and reduce the computational complexity. To further improve the performance of the proposed algorithm,
we propose a promotion strategy called reproducing learning. By adding the estimated HR face to
the training set, which can simulates the case that the HR version of the input LR face is present in
the training set, thus iteratively enhancing the final hallucination result. Experiments demonstrate
that the proposed TLcR-RL method achieves a substantial increase in the hallucinated results,
both subjectively and objectively. Additionally, the proposed framework is more robust to face
misalignment and the SSS problem, and its hallucinated HR face is still very good when the LR test
face is from the real-world. The MATLAB source code is available at https://github.com/junjun-jiang/TLcR-RL
