Automatic segmentation of retinal vessels in fundus images plays an important role in the diagnosis
of some diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. In this paper, we propose Deformable U-Net (DUNet),
which exploits the retinal vessels' local features with a U-shape architecture, in an end to end
manner for retinal vessel segmentation. Inspired by the recently introduced deformable convolutional
networks, we integrate the deformable convolution into the proposed network. The DUNet, with upsampling
operators to increase the output resolution, is designed to extract context information and enable
precise localization by combining low-level feature maps with high-level ones. Furthermore,
DUNet captures the retinal vessels at various shapes and scales by adaptively adjusting the receptive
fields according to vessels' scales and shapes. Three public datasets DRIVE, STARE and CHASE_DB1
are used to train and test our model. Detailed comparisons between the proposed network and the deformable
neural network, U-Net are provided in our study. Results show that more detailed vessels are extracted
by DUNet and it exhibits state-of-the-art performance for retinal vessel segmentation with a global
accuracy of 0.9697/0.9722/0.9724 and AUC of 0.9856/0.9868/0.9863 on DRIVE, STARE and CHASE_DB1
respectively. Moreover, to show the generalization ability of the DUNet, we used another two retinal
vessel data sets, one is named WIDE and the other is a synthetic data set with diverse styles, named
SYNTHE, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed and compared with other methods. Results
indicates that DUNet outperforms other state-of-the-arts.
