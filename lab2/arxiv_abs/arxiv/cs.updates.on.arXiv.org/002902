This thesis addresses the problem of verifying the geographic locations of Internet clients. First,
we demonstrate how current state-of-the-art delay-based geolocation techniques are susceptible
to evasion through delay manipulations, which involve both increasing and decreasing the Internet
delays that are observed between a client and a remote measuring party. We then propose Client Presence
Verification (CPV) as a delay-based technique to verify an assertion about a client's physical
presence in a prescribed geographic region. Three verifiers geographically encapsulating a client's
asserted location are used to corroborate that assertion by measuring the delays between themselves
and the client. CPV infers geographic distances from these delays and thus, using the smaller of
the forward and reverse one-way delay between each verifier and the client is expected to result
in a more accurate distance inference than using the conventional round-trip times. Accordingly,
we devise a novel protocol for accurate one-way delay measurements between the client and the three
verifiers to be used by CPV, taking into account that the client could manipulate the measurements
to defeat the verification process. We evaluate CPV through extensive real-world experiments
with legitimate clients (those truly present at where they asserted to be) modeled to use both wired
and wireless access networks. Wired evaluation is done using the PlanetLab testbed, during which
we examine various factors affecting CPV's efficacy, such as the client's geographical nearness
to the verifiers. For wireless evaluation, we leverage the Internet delay information collected
for wired clients from PlanetLab, and model additional delays representing the last-mile wireless
link. Finally, we reinforce CPV against a (hypothetical) middlebox that an adversary specifically
customizes to defeat CPV.
