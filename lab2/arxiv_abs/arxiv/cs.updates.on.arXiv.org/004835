In this thesis, we design algorithms for several NP-hard problems in both worst and beyond worst
case settings. In the first part of the thesis, we apply the traditional worst case methodology and
design approximation algorithms for the Hub Labeling problem; Hub Labeling is a preprocessing
technique introduced to speed up shortest path queries. Before this work, Hub Labeling had been
extensively studied mainly in the beyond worst case analysis setting, and in particular on graphs
with low highway dimension. In this work, we significantly improve our theoretical understanding
of the problem and design (worst-case) algorithms for various classes of graphs, such as general
graphs, graphs with unique shortest paths and trees, as well as provide matching inapproximability
lower bounds for the problem in its most general settings. Finally, we demonstrate a connection
between computing a Hub Labeling on a tree and searching for a node in a tree. In the second part of the
thesis, we turn to beyond worst case analysis and extensively study the stability model introduced
by Bilu and Linial in an attempt to describe real-life instances of graph partitioning and clustering
problems. Informally, an instance of a combinatorial optimization problem is stable if it has a
unique optimal solution that remains the unique optimum under small multiplicative perturbations
of the parameters of the input. Utilizing the power of convex relaxations for stable instances,
we obtain several results for problems such as Edge/Node Multiway Cut, Independent Set (and its
equivalent, in terms of exact solvability, Vertex Cover), clustering problems such as $k$-center
and $k$-median and the symmetric Traveling Salesman problem. We also provide strong lower bounds
for certain families of algorithms for covering problems, thus exhibiting potential barriers
towards the design of improved algorithms in this framework.
