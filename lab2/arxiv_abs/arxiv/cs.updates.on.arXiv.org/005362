Human action recognition refers to automatic recognizing human actions from a video clip, which
is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision. In reality, a video stream is often weakly-annotated
with a set of relevant human action labels at a global level rather than assigning each label to a specific
video episode corresponding to a single action, which leads to a multi-label learning problem.
Furthermore, there are a great number of meaningful human actions in reality but it would be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to collect/annotate video clips regarding all of various human actions,
which leads to a zero-shot learning scenario. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that has
addressed all the above issues together in human action recognition. In this paper, we formulate
a real-world human action recognition task as a multi-label zero-shot learning problem and propose
a framework to tackle this problem. Our framework simultaneously tackles the issue of unknown temporal
boundaries between different actions for multi-label learning and exploits the side information
regarding the semantic relationship between different human actions for zero-shot learning.
As a result, our framework leads to a joint latent embedding representation for multi-label zero-shot
human action recognition. The joint latent embedding is learned with two component models by exploring
temporal coherence underlying video data and the intrinsic relationship between visual and semantic
domain. We evaluate our framework with different settings, including a novel data split scheme
designed especially for evaluating multi-label zero-shot learning, on two weakly annotated multi-label
human action datasets: Breakfast and Charades. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our framework in multi-label zero-shot human action recognition.
