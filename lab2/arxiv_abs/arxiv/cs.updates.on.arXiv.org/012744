Principal Component Regression (PCR) is a simple, but powerful and ubiquitously utilized method.
Its effectiveness is well established when the covariates exhibit low-rank structure. However,
its ability to handle settings with noisy, missing, and mixed (discrete and continuous) valued
covariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge. As the main contribution
of this work, we establish the robustness of PCR (without any change) in this respect and provide
meaningful finite-sample analysis. In the process, we establish that PCR is equivalent to performing
Linear Regression after pre-processing the covariate matrix via Hard Singular Value Thresholding
(HSVT). That is, PCR is equivalent to the recently proposed robust variant of the Synthetic Control
method \cite{amjad} in the context of counterfactual analysis using observational data. As an
immediate consequence, we obtain finite-sample analysis of the Robust Synthetic Control (RSC)
estimator that was previously absent. As an important contribution to the Synthetic Control literature,
we establish that an (approximate linear) synthetic control always exists in the setting of a generalized
factor model (or latent variable model) and need not be assumed as an axiom as is traditionally done
in the literature. We further discuss a surprising implication of the robustness property of PCR
with respect to noise, i.e., PCR can learn a good predictive model even if the covariates are tactfully
transformed to preserve (differential) privacy. Finally, this work advances the state-of-the-art
analysis for HSVT by establishing stronger guarantees with respect to the $\ell_{2, \infty}$-norm
rather than the Frobenius norm as is commonly done in the matrix estimation literature, which may
be of interest in its own right.
