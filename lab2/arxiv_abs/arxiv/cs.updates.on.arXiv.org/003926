As one indispensable use case for the 5G wireless systems on the roadmap, ultra-reliable and low
latency communications (URLLC) is a crucial requirement for the coming era of wireless industrial
automation. This paper aims to develop communication techniques for making such a paradigm shift
from the conventional human-type broadband communications to the emerging machine-type URLLC.
One fundamental task for URLLC is to deliver a short command from the controller to each actuator
within the stringent delay requirement and also with high-reliability in the downlink. Motivated
by the geographic feature in industrial automation that in the factories many tasks are assigned
to different groups of devices who work in close proximity to each other and thus can form clusters
of reliable device-to-device (D2D) networks, this paper proposes a novel two-phase transmission
protocol for achieving the above goal. Specifically, in the first phase within the latency requirement,
the multi-antenna base station (BS) combines the messages of each group together and multicasts
them to the corresponding groups; while in the second phase, the devices that have decoded the messages
successfully, who are defined as the leaders, help relay the messages to the other devices in their
groups. Under this protocol, we further design an innovative leader selection based beamforming
strategy at the BS by utilizing the sparse optimization technique, which leads to the desired sparsity
pattern in user activity, i.e., at least one leader exists in each group, in the first phase, thus
making full utilization of the reliable D2D networks in the second phase. Simulation results are
provided to show that the proposed two-phase transmission protocol considerably improves the
reliability of the whole system within the stringent latency requirement as compared to other existing
schemes for URLLC such as Occupy CoW.
