Many processes, from gene interaction in biology to computer networks to social media, can be modeled
more precisely as temporal hypergraphs than by regular graphs. This is because hypergraphs generalize
graphs by extending edges to connect any number of vertices, allowing complex relationships to
be described more accurately and predict their behavior over time. However, the interactive exploration
and seamless refinement of such hypergraph-based prediction models still pose a major challenge.
We contribute Hyper-Matrix, a novel visual analytics technique that addresses this challenge
through a tight coupling between machine-learning and interactive visualizations. In particular,
the technique incorporates a geometric deep learning model as a blueprint for problem-specific
models while integrating visualizations for graph-based and category-based data with a novel
combination of interactions for an effective user-driven exploration of hypergraph models. To
eliminate demanding context switches and ensure scalability, our matrix-based visualization
provides drill-down capabilities across multiple levels of semantic zoom, from an overview of
model predictions down to the content. We facilitate a focused analysis of relevant connections
and groups based on interactive user-steering for filtering and search tasks, a dynamically modifiable
partition hierarchy, various matrix reordering techniques, and interactive model feedback.
We evaluate our technique in a case study and through formative evaluation with law enforcement
experts using real-world internet forum communication data. The results show that our approach
surpasses existing solutions in terms of scalability and applicability, enables the incorporation
of domain knowledge, and allows for fast search-space traversal. With the technique, we pave the
way for the visual analytics of temporal hypergraphs in a wide variety of domains.
