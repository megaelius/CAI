There is an increasing need to reconstruct objects in four or more dimensions corresponding to space,
time and other independent parameters. The best 4D reconstruction algorithms use regularized
iterative reconstruction approaches such as model based iterative reconstruction (MBIR), which
depends critically on the quality of the prior modeling. Recently, Plug-and-Play methods have
been shown to be an effective way to incorporate advanced prior models using state-of-the-art denoising
algorithms designed to remove additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). However, state-of-the-art
denoising algorithms such as BM4D and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are primarily
available for 2D and sometimes 3D images. In particular, CNNs are difficult and computationally
expensive to implement in four or more dimensions, and training may be impossible if there is no associated
high-dimensional training data. In this paper, we present Multi-Slice Fusion, a novel algorithm
for 4D and higher-dimensional reconstruction, based on the fusion of multiple low-dimensional
denoisers. Our approach uses multi-agent consensus equilibrium (MACE), an extension of Plug-and-Play,
as a framework for integrating the multiple lower-dimensional prior models. We apply our method
to the problem of 4D cone-beam X-ray CT reconstruction for Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) of moving
parts. This is done by solving the MACE equations using lower-dimensional CNN denoisers implemented
in parallel on a heterogeneous cluster. Results on experimental CT data demonstrate that Multi-Slice
Fusion can substantially improve the quality of reconstructions relative to traditional 4D priors,
while also being practical to implement and train.
