The past decade has witnessed great success of deep learning technology in many disciplines, especially
in computer vision and image processing. However, deep learning-based video coding remains in
its infancy. This paper reviews the representative works about using deep learning for image/video
coding, which has been an actively developing research area since the year of 2015. We divide the
related works into two categories: new coding schemes that are built primarily upon deep networks
(deep schemes), and deep network-based coding tools (deep tools) that shall be used within traditional
coding schemes or together with traditional coding tools. For deep schemes, pixel probability
modeling and auto-encoder are the two approaches, that can be viewed as predictive coding scheme
and transform coding scheme, respectively. For deep tools, there have been several proposed techniques
using deep learning to perform intra-picture prediction, inter-picture prediction, cross-channel
prediction, probability distribution prediction, transform, post- or in-loop filtering, down-
and up-sampling, as well as encoding optimizations. In the hope of advocating the research of deep
learning-based video coding, we present a case study of our developed prototype video codec, namely
Deep Learning Video Coding (DLVC). DLVC features two deep tools that are both based on convolutional
neural network (CNN), namely CNN-based in-loop filter (CNN-ILF) and CNN-based block adaptive
resolution coding (CNN-BARC). Both tools help improve the compression efficiency by a significant
margin. With the two deep tools as well as other non-deep coding tools, DLVC is able to achieve on average
39.6\% and 33.0\% bits saving than HEVC, under random-access and low-delay configurations, respectively.
The source code of DLVC has been released for future researches.
