This paper is concerned with a compositional approach for constructing infinite abstractions
of interconnected discrete-time stochastic control systems. The proposed approach uses the interconnection
matrix and joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems and their abstractions described
by a new notion of so-called stochastic storage functions. The interconnected abstraction framework
is based on new notions of so-called stochastic simulation functions, using which one can quantify
the distance between original interconnected stochastic control systems and interconnected
abstractions in the probabilistic setting. In the first part of the paper, we derive dissipativity-type
compositional reasoning for the quantification of the distance in probability between the interconnection
of stochastic control subsystems and that of their abstractions. Moreover, we consider specifications
expressed as syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic formulae and show how a synthesized policy
for the abstract system can be refined to a policy for the original system while providing guarantee
on the probability of satisfaction. In the second part of the paper, we focus on a class of discrete-time
nonlinear stochastic control systems with independent noises in the abstract and concrete subsystems,
and propose a computational scheme to construct abstractions together with their corresponding
stochastic storage functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results by constructing
an abstraction (totally 3 dimensions) of the interconnection of three discrete-time nonlinear
stochastic control subsystems (together 222 dimensions) in a compositional fashion. We also employ
the abstraction as a substitute to synthesize a controller enforcing a syntactically co-safe linear
temporal logic specification.
