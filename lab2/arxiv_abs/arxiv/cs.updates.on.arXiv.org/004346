Motion scoring of cardiac myocardium is of paramount importance for early detection and diagnosis
of various cardiac disease. It aims at identifying regional wall motions into one of the four types
including normal, hypokinetic, akinetic, and dyskinetic, and is extremely challenging due to
the complex myocardium deformation and subtle inter-class difference of motion patterns. All
existing work on automated motion analysis are focused on binary abnormality detection to avoid
the much more demanding motion scoring, which is urgently required in real clinical practice yet
has never been investigated before. In this work, we propose Cardiac-MOS, the first powerful method
for cardiac motion scoring from cardiac MR sequences based on deep convolution neural network.
Due to the locality of convolution, the relationship between distant non-local responses of the
feature map cannot be explored, which is closely related to motion difference between segments.
In Cardiac-MOS, such non-local relationship is modeled with non-local neural network within each
segment and across all segments of one subject, i.e., segment- and subject-level non-local modeling,
and lead to obvious performance improvement. Besides, Cardiac-MOS can effectively extract motion
information from MR sequences of various lengths by interpolating the convolution kernel along
the temporal dimension, therefore can be applied to MR sequences of multiple sources. Experiments
on 1440 myocardium segments of 90 subjects from short axis MR sequences of multiple lengths prove
that Cardiac-MOS achieves reliable performance, with correlation of 0.926 for motion score index
estimation and accuracy of 77.4\% for motion scoring. Cardiac-MOS also outperforms all existing
work for binary abnormality detection. As the first automatic motion scoring solution, Cardiac-MOS
demonstrates great potential in future clinical application.
