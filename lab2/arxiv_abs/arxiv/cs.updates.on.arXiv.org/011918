We study the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem (SBP) with nonlinear prior dynamics. In control-theoretic
language, this is a problem of minimum effort steering of a given joint state probability density
function (PDF) to another over a finite time horizon, subject to a controlled stochastic differential
evolution of the state vector. For generic nonlinear drift, we reduce the SBP to solving a system
of forward and backward Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs) that are coupled through
the boundary conditions, with unknowns being the "Schr\"{o}dinger factors" -- so named since their
product at any time yields the optimal controlled joint state PDF at that time. We show that if the
drift is a gradient vector field, or is of mixed conservative-dissipative nature, then it is possible
to transform these PDEs into a pair of initial value problems (IVPs) involving the same forward Kolmogorov
operator. Combined with a recently proposed fixed point recursion that is contractive in the Hilbert
metric, this opens up the possibility to numerically solve the SBPs in these cases by computing the
Schr\"{o}dinger factors via a single IVP solver for the corresponding (uncontrolled) forward
Kolmogorov PDE. The flows generated by such forward Kolmogorov PDEs, for the two aforementioned
types of drift, in turn, enjoy gradient descent structures on the manifold of joint PDFs with respect
to suitable distance functionals. We employ a proximal algorithm developed in our prior work, that
exploits this geometric viewpoint, to solve these IVPs and compute the Schr\"{o}dinger factors
via weighted scattered point cloud evolution in the state space. We provide the algorithmic details
and illustrate the proposed framework of solving the SBPs with nonlinear prior dynamics by numerical
examples.
