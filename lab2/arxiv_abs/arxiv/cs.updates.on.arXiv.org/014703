Network Science provides a universal formalism for modelling and studying complex systems based
on pairwise interactions between agents. However, many real networks in the social, biological
or computer sciences involve interactions among more than two agents, having thus an inherent structure
of a simplicial complex. We propose new notions of higher-order degrees of adjacency for simplices
in a simplicial complex, allowing any dimensional comparison among them and their faces, which
as far as we know were lacked in the literature. We introduce multi-parameter boundary and coboundary
operators in an oriented simplicial complex and also a novel multi-combinatorial Laplacian is
defined, which generalises the graph and combinatorial Laplacian. To illustrate the potential
applications of these theoretical results, we perform a structural analysis of higher-order connectivity
in simplicial-complex networks by studying the associated distributions with these simplicial
degrees in 17 real-world datasets coming from different domains such as coauthor networks, cosponsoring
Congress bills, contacts in schools, drug abuse warning networks, e-mail networks or publications
and users in online forums. We find rich and diverse higher-order connectivity structures and observe
that datasets of the same type reflect similar higher-order collaboration patterns. Furthermore,
we show that if we use what we have called the maximal simplicial degree (which counts the distinct
maximal communities in which our simplex and all its strict sub-communities are contained), then
its degree distribution is, in general, surprisingly different from the classical node degree
distribution.
