Introduction: Increasingly, the label data trust is being applied to repeatable mechanisms or
approaches to sharing data in a timely, fair, safe and equitable way. However, there is a gap in terms
of practical guidance about how to establish and operate a data trust. Aim and Approach: In December
2019, the Canadian Institute for Health Information and the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence
convened a working meeting of 19 people representing 15 Canadian organizations/initiatives involved
in data sharing, most of which focus on public sector health data. The objective was to identify essential
requirements for the establishment and operation of data trusts. Preliminary findings were presented
during the meeting then refined as participants and co-authors identified relevant literature
and contributed to this manuscript. Results: Twelve (12) minimum specification requirements
(min specs) for data trusts were identified. The foundational min spec is that data trusts must meet
all legal requirements, including legal authority to collect, hold or share data. In addition,
there was agreement that data trusts must have (i) an accountable governing body which ensures the
data trust advances its stated purpose and is transparent, (ii) comprehensive data management
including responsible parties and clear processes for the collection, storage, access, disclosure
and use of data, (iii) training and accountability requirements for all data users and (iv) ongoing
public and stakeholder engagement. Conclusion / Implications: Based on a review of the literature
and advice from participants from 15 Canadian organizations/initiatives, practical guidance
in the form of twelve min specs for data trusts were agreed on. Public engagement and continued exchange
of insights and experience is recommended on this evolving topic.
