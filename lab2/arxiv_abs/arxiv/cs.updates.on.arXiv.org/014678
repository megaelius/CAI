On December 31st 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of
cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City. The cause of the syndrome was a new
type of coronavirus isolated on January 7th 2020 and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since January
2020 an ever increasing number of scientific works have appeared in literature. Identifying relevant
research outcomes at very early stages is challenging.In this work we use COVID-19 as a use-case
for investigating: (i) which toos and frameworkds are mostly used for early scholarly communication;
(ii) to what extent altmetrics can be used to identify potential impactful research in tight (i.e.
{\em quasi-zero-day}) time-windows. A literature review with rigorous eligibility criteria
is performed for gathering a sample composed of scientific papers about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 appeared
in literature in the tight time-window ranging from January 15th 2020 to February 24th 2020. This
sample is used for building a knowledge graph that represents the knowledge about papers and indicators
formally. This knowledge graph feeds a data analysis process which is applied for experimenting
with altmetrics as impact indicators. We find moderate correlation among traditional citation
count, citations on social media, and mentions on news and blogs. This suggests there is a common
intended meaning of the citational acts associated with aforementioned indicators. Additionally,
we define a method that harmonises different indicators for providing a multi-dimensional impact
indicator.
