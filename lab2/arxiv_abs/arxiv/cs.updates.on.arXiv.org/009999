This document is one of the deliverable reports created for the ESCAPE project. ESCAPE stands for
Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather Prediction at Exascale. The project develops
world-class, extreme-scale computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather
prediction and future climate models. This is done by identifying Weather & Climate dwarfs which
are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit of the Berkeley dwarfs).
These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware architectures (single and multi-node)
and alternative algorithms are explored. Performance portability is addressed through the use
of domain specific languages. In this deliverable we report on energy consumption measurements
of a number of NWP models/dwarfs on the Intel E5-2697v4 processor. The chosen energy metrics and
energy measurement methods are documented. Energy measurements are performed on the Bi-Fourier
dwarf (BiFFT), the Acraneb dwarf, the ALARO 2.5 km Local Area Model reference configuration (B\'enard
et al. 2010, Bubnova et al. 1995) and on the COSMO-EULAG Local Area Model reference configuration
(Piotrowski et al. 2018). The results show a U-shaped dependence of the consumed energy on the wall-clock
time performance. This shape can be explained from the dependence of the average power of the compute
nodes on the total number of cores used. We compare the energy consumption of the BiFFT dwarf on the
E5-2697v4 processor to that on the Optalysys optical processors. The latter are found to be much
less energy costly, but at the same time it is also the only metric where they outperform the classical
CPU. They are non-competitive as far as wall-clock time and especially numerical precision are
concerned.
