Deep learning models are often trained on datasets that contain sensitive information such as individuals'
shopping transactions, personal contacts, and medical records. An increasingly important line
of work therefore has sought to train neural networks subject to privacy constraints that are specified
by differential privacy or its divergence-based relaxations. These privacy definitions, however,
have weaknesses in handling certain important primitives (composition and subsampling), thereby
giving loose or complicated privacy analyses of training neural networks. In this paper, we consider
a recently proposed privacy definition termed \textit{$f$-differential privacy} [18] for a refined
privacy analysis of training neural networks. Leveraging the appealing properties of $f$-differential
privacy in handling composition and subsampling, this paper derives analytically tractable expressions
for the privacy guarantees of both stochastic gradient descent and Adam used in training deep neural
networks, without the need of developing sophisticated techniques as [3] did. Our results demonstrate
that the $f$-differential privacy framework allows for a new privacy analysis that improves on
the prior analysis~[3], which in turn suggests tuning certain parameters of neural networks for
a better prediction accuracy without violating the privacy budget. These theoretically derived
improvements are confirmed by our experiments in a range of tasks in image classification, text
classification, and recommender systems. Python code to calculate the privacy cost for these experiments
is publicly available in the \texttt{TensorFlow Privacy} library.
