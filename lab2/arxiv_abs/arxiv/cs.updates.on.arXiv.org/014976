The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory syndrome that resembles pneumonia. The
current diagnostic procedure of COVID-19 follows reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) based approach which however is less sensitive to identify the virus at the initial stage.
Hence, a more robust and alternate diagnosis technique is desirable. Recently, with the release
of publicly available datasets of corona positive patients comprising of computed tomography
(CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) imaging; scientists, researchers and healthcare experts are contributing
for faster and automated diagnosis of COVID-19 by identifying pulmonary infections using deep
learning approaches to achieve better cure and treatment. These datasets have limited samples
concerned with the positive COVID-19 cases, which raise the challenge for unbiased learning. Following
from this context, this article presents the random oversampling and weighted class loss function
approach for unbiased fine-tuned learning (transfer learning) in various state-of-the-art deep
learning approaches such as baseline ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNet-v2, DenseNet169,
and NASNetLarge to perform binary classification (as normal and COVID-19 cases) and also multi-class
classification (as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal case) of posteroanterior CXR images. Accuracy,
precision, recall, loss, and area under the curve (AUC) are utilized to evaluate the performance
of the models. Considering the experimental results, the performance of each model is scenario
dependent; however, NASNetLarge displayed better scores in contrast to other architectures.
This article also added the visual explanation to illustrate the basis of model classification
and perception of COVID-19 in CXR images.
