The property of proportional representation in approval-based committee elections has appeared
in the social choice literature for over a century, and is typically understood as avoiding the underrepresentation
of minorities. However, we argue that the security of some distributed systems is directly linked
to the opposite goal of avoiding the overrepresentation of any minority, a goal which leads us to
an optimization objective known as Maximin Support, closely related to the axiom of Proportional
Justified Representation (PJR). We provide an inapproximability result for this objective, and
propose a new election rule inspired in Phragmen's methods that achieves a) a constant-factor approximation
guarantee for the objective, and b) the PJR property. Furthermore, a structural property allows
one to quickly verify that the winning committee satisfies the two aforementioned properties,
even if the algorithm is executed by an untrusted party who only communicates the output. Finally,
we present an efficient post-computation that, when paired with any approximation algorithm for
Maximin Support, returns a new solution that a) preserves the approximation guarantee, b) satisfies
PJR, and c) can be efficiently verified to satisfy PJR. Our work is motivated by an application on
blockchains that implement Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS), where the community must elect a
committee of validators to participate in its consensus protocol, and where fighting overrepresentation
protects the system against attacks by an adversarial minority. Our election rule enables a validator
election protocol with formal and verifiable guarantees on security and proportionality. We propose
a specific protocol that can be successfully implemented in spite of the stringent time constraints
of a blockchain architecture, and that will be the basis for an implementation in the Polkadot network,
launched in 2020.
