Multi-label classification studies the task where each example belongs to multiple labels simultaneously.
As a representative method, Ranking Support Vector Machine (Rank-SVM) aims to minimize the Ranking
Loss and can also mitigate the negative influence of the class-imbalance issue. However, due to
its stacking-style way for thresholding, it may suffer error accumulation and thus reduces the
final classification performance. Binary Relevance (BR) is another typical method, which aims
to minimize the Hamming Loss and only needs one-step learning. Nevertheless, it might have the class-imbalance
issue and does not take into account label correlations. To address the above issues, we propose
a novel multi-label classification model, which joints Ranking support vector machine and Binary
Relevance with robust Low-rank learning (RBRL). RBRL inherits the ranking loss minimization advantages
of Rank-SVM, and thus overcomes the disadvantages of BR suffering the class-imbalance issue and
ignoring the label correlations. Meanwhile, it utilizes the hamming loss minimization and one-step
learning advantages of BR, and thus tackles the disadvantages of Rank-SVM including another thresholding
learning step. Besides, a low-rank constraint is utilized to further exploit high-order label
correlations under the assumption of low dimensional label space. Furthermore, to achieve nonlinear
multi-label classifiers, we derive the kernelization RBRL. Two accelerated proximal gradient
methods (APG) are used to solve the optimization problems efficiently. Extensive comparative
experiments with several state-of-the-art methods illustrate a highly competitive or superior
performance of our method RBRL.
