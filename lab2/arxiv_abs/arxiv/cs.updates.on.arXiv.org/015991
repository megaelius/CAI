The last few decades, crowd simulation for crisis management is highlighted as an important topic
of interest for many scientific fields. As the continues evolution of computational resources
increases, along with the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence, the demand for better and more
realistic simulation has become more attractive and popular to scientists. Along those years,
there have been published hundreds of research articles and have been created numerous different
systems that aim to simulate crowd behaviors, crisis cases and emergency evacuation scenarios.
For better outcomes, recent research has focused on the separation of the problem of crisis management,
to multiple research sub-fields (categories), such as the navigation of the simulated pedestrians,
their psychology, the group dynamics etc. There have been extended research works suggesting new
methods and techniques for those categories of problems. In this paper, we propose three main research
categories, each one consist of several sub-categories, relying on crowd simulation for crisis
management aspects and we present the outcomes of the last decade, focusing mostly on works exploiting
multi-agent technologies. We analyze a number of technologies, methodologies, techniques, tools
and systems introduced throughout the last years. A comparative review and discussion of the proposed
categories is presented towards the identification of the most efficient aspects of the proposed
categories. A general framework, towards the future crowd simulation for crisis management is
presented based on the most efficient to yield the most realistic outcomes of the last decades. The
paper is concluded with some highlights and open questions for future directions.
