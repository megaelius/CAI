Context: Researchers, both in industry and academia, are facing the challenge of leveraging the
benefits of goal oriented requirements engineering (GORE) techniques to business compliance
management. This requires analyzing goal models along with their semantics. However, most prominent
goal modeling frameworks have no means of capturing the semantics of goals (except what is trivially
conveyed by their nomenclature). Objective: In this paper, we propose the Annotation of Functional
Satisfaction Conditions and their Reconciliation (AFSCR) framework for doing the same. The entire
framework is presented with respect to i* modeling constructs. Method: This is a semi-automated
framework that requires analysts to annotate individual goals with their immediate goal satisfaction
conditions. The AFSCR framework can then reconcile these satisfaction conditions for every goal
and verify whether the derived set of cumulative satisfaction conditions is in harmony with the
intended set of goal satisfaction conditions. Result: If the derived and intended sets of satisfaction
conditions are in conflict, the framework raises entailment and/or consistency flags. Whenever
a conflict is flagged, the framework also provides alternate solutions and possible workaround
strategies to the analysts by refactoring the given i* model. Conclusion: In this paper we present
a new framework that uses satisfaction conditions for going beyond the nomenclature and capturing
the functional semantics of the goals within i* models. The analysis performed during the reconciliation
process is generic enough and can be adapted to any goal modeling framework if required.
