Hyperbolic random graphs (HRG) and geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRG) are two similar
generative network models that were designed to resemble complex real world networks. In particular,
they have a power-law degree distribution with controllable exponent $\beta$, and high clustering
that can be controlled via the temperature $T$. We present the first implementation of an efficient
GIRG generator running in expected linear time. Besides varying temperatures, it also supports
underlying geometries of higher dimensions. It is capable of generating graphs with ten million
edges in under a second on commodity hardware. The algorithm can be adapted to HRGs. Our resulting
implementation is the fastest sequential HRG generator, despite the fact that we support non-zero
temperatures. Though non-zero temperatures are crucial for many applications, most existing
generators are restricted to $T = 0$. Our generators support parallelization, although this is
not the focus of this paper. We note that our generators draw from the correct probability distribution,
i.e., they involve no approximation. Besides the generators themselves, we also provide an efficient
algorithm to determine the non-trivial dependency between the average degree of the resulting
graph and the input parameters of the GIRG model. This makes it possible to specify the expected average
degree as input. Moreover, we investigate the differences between HRGs and GIRGs, shedding new
light on the nature of the relation between the two models. Although HRGs represent, in a certain
sense, a special case of the GIRG model, we find that a straight-forward inclusion does not hold in
practice. However, the difference is negligible for most use cases.
