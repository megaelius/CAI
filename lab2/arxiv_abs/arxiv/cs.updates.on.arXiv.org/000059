Peer to peer systems are the networks consisting of a group of nodes possible to be as wide as the Internet.
These networks are required of evaluation mechanisms and distributed control and configurations,
so each peer will be able to communicate with other peers. Resilience to faults, failures and attacks,
are the main requirements of most communication systems and networks today. Thus, since P2P networks
can be individually used as an infrastructure and an alternative for many other communication networks,
they have to be more reliable, and resilient to the faults, failures and attacks compared to the client
and server approach. In this work, we present a detailed study on the behavior of various P2P networks
toward faults and failures, and focus on fault-tolerance subject. We consider two different static
failure scenarios: a)a random strategy in which nodes or edges of the network will be removed with
an equal probability and without any knowledge of the networks infrastructure, b)a targeted strategy
that uses some information about the nodes, and in which the nodes with the highest degree have the
most priority to be attacked. By static faults, we mean a situation where the nodes or components
encounter some faults before the network starts to work or through its operation, and will remain
faulty to the end of the work session. Our goal is to introduce various measures to analyzing P2P networks
evaluating their vulnerability rate. The presented criteria can be used for evaluating the reliability
and vulnerability of P2P networks toward both random and targeted failures. There is no limit to
the number and types of failures, the presented measures are able to be used for different types of
failures and even a wide range of networks.
