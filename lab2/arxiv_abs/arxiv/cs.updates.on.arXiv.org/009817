Computerized registration between maxillofacial cone-beam computed tomography (CT) images
and a scanned dental model is an essential prerequisite in surgical planning for dental implants
or orthognathic surgery. We propose a novel method that performs fully automatic registration
between a cone-beam CT image and an optically scanned model. To build a robust and automatic initial
registration method, our method applies deep-pose regression neural networks in a reduced domain
(i.e., 2-dimensional image). Subsequently, fine registration is performed via optimal clusters.
Majority voting system achieves globally optimal transformations while each cluster attempts
to optimize local transformation parameters. The coherency of clusters determines their candidacy
for the optimal cluster set. The outlying regions in the iso-surface are effectively removed based
on the consensus among the optimal clusters. The accuracy of registration was evaluated by the Euclidean
distance of 10 landmarks on a scanned model which were annotated by the experts in the field. The experiments
show that the proposed method's registration accuracy, measured in landmark distance, outperforms
other existing methods by 30.77% to 70%. In addition to achieving high accuracy, our proposed method
requires neither human-interactions nor priors (e.g., iso-surface extraction). The main significance
of our study is twofold: 1) the employment of light-weighted neural networks which indicates the
applicability of neural network in extracting pose cues that can be easily obtained and 2) the introduction
of an optimal cluster-based registration method that can avoid metal artifacts during the matching
procedures.
