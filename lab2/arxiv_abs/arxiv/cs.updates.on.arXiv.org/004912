Peripheral authentication is an important aspect in the vehicle networks to provide services to
only authenticated peripherals and a security to internal vehicle modules such as anti-lock braking
system, power-train control module, engine control unit, transmission control unit, and tire
pressure monitoring. In this paper a three-way handshake scheme is proposed for a vehicle to a keyfob
authentication. A keyfob is a key with a secure hardware that communicates and authenticates the
vehicle over the wireless channel. Conventionally, a vehicle to keyfob authentication is realized
through a challenge-response verification protocol. An authentic coupling between the vehicle
identity and the keyfob avoids any illegal access to the vehicle. However, these authentication
messages can be relayed by an active adversary, thereby, can amplify the actual distance between
an authentic vehicle and a keyfob. Eventually, an adversary can possibly gain access to the vehicle
by relaying wireless signals and without any effort to generate or decode the secret credentials.
Hence, the vehicle to keyfob authentication scheme must contain an additional attribute verification
such as physical movement of a keyfob holder. Our solution is a two-party and three-way handshake
scheme with proactive and reactive commitment verification. The proposed solution also uses a
time interval verification such that both vehicle and keyfob would yield a similar locomotion pattern
of a dynamic keyfob within a similar observational time interval. Hence, the solution is different
from the distance bounding protocols that require multiple iterations for the round-trip delay
measurement. The proposed scheme is shown to be adaptable with the existing commitment scheme such
as Schnorr identification scheme and Pedersen commitment scheme.
