Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown impressive performance in generating photo-realistic
images. They fit generative models by minimizing certain distance measure between the real image
distribution and the generated data distribution. Several distance measures have been used, such
as Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-divergence, and Wasserstein distance, and choosing an appropriate
distance measure is very important for training the generative network. In this paper, we choose
to use the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as the distance metric, which has several nice theoretical
guarantees. In fact, generative moment matching network (GMMN) (Li, Swersky, and Zemel 2015) is
such a generative model which contains only one generator network $G$ trained by directly minimizing
MMD between the real and generated distributions. However, it fails to generate meaningful samples
on challenging benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and LSUN. To improve on GMMN, we propose to add
an extra network $F$, called mapper. $F$ maps both real data distribution and generated data distribution
from the original data space to a feature representation space $\mathcal{R}$, and it is trained
to maximize MMD between the two mapped distributions in $\mathcal{R}$, while the generator $G$
tries to minimize the MMD. We call the new model generative adversarial mapping networks (GAMNs).
We demonstrate that the adversarial mapper $F$ can help $G$ to better capture the underlying data
distribution. We also show that GAMN significantly outperforms GMMN, and is also superior to or
comparable with other state-of-the-art GAN based methods on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Bedrooms
datasets.
