In this study, we explore peer-interaction effects in online networks on speaking skill development.
In particular, we present an evidence for gradual buildup of skills in a small-group setting that
has not been reported in the literature. We introduce a novel dataset of six online communities consisting
of 158 participants focusing on improving their speaking skills. They video-record speeches for
5 prompts in 10 days and exchange comments and performance-ratings with their peers. We ask (i) whether
the participants' ratings are affected by their interaction patterns with peers, and (ii) whether
there is any gradual buildup of speaking skills in the communities towards homogeneity. To analyze
the data, we employ tools from the emerging field of Graph Signal Processing (GSP). GSP enjoys a distinction
from Social Network Analysis in that the latter is concerned primarily with the connection structures
of graphs, while the former studies signals on top of graphs. We study the performance ratings of
the participants as graph signals atop underlying interaction topologies. Total variation analysis
of the graph signals show that the participants' rating differences decrease with time (slope=-0.04,
p<0.01), while average ratings increase (slope=0.07, p<0.05)--thereby gradually building up
the ratings towards community-wide homogeneity. We provide evidence for peer-influence through
a prediction formulation. Our consensus-based prediction model outperforms baseline network-agnostic
regression models by about 23% in predicting performance ratings. This, in turn, shows that participants'
ratings are affected by their peers' ratings and the associated interaction patterns, corroborating
previous findings. Then, we formulate a consensus-based diffusion model that captures these observations
of peer-influence from our analyses.
