We propose a disease classification model, called the QC-SPHARM, for the early detection of the
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The proposed QC-SPHARM can distinguish between normal control (NC)
subjects and AD patients, as well as between amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients
having high possibility progressing into AD and those who do not. Using the spherical harmonics
(SPHARM) based registration, hippocampal surfaces segmented from the ADNI data are individually
registered to a template surface constructed from the NC subjects using SPHARM. Local geometric
distortions of the deformation from the template surface to each subject are quantified in terms
of conformality distortions and curvatures distortions. The measurements are combined with the
spherical harmonics coefficients and the total volume change of the subject from the template.
Afterwards, a t-test based feature selection method incorporating the bagging strategy is applied
to extract those local regions having high discriminating power of the two classes. The disease
diagnosis machine can therefore be built using the data under the Support Vector Machine (SVM) setting.
Using 110 NC subjects and 110 AD patients from the ADNI database, the proposed algorithm achieves
85:2% testing accuracy on 80 random samples as testing subjects, with the incorporation of surface
geometry in the classification machine. Using 20 aMCI patients who has advanced to AD during a two-year
period and another 20 aMCI patients who remain non-AD for the next two years, the algorithm achieves
81:2% accuracy using 10 randomly picked subjects as testing data. Our proposed method is 6%-15%
better than other classification models without the incorporation of surface geometry. The results
demonstrate the advantages of using local geometric distortions as the discriminating criterion
for early AD diagnosis.
