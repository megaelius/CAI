By achieving their purposes through interactions with the physical world, Cyber-Physical Systems
(CPS) pose new challenges in terms of dependability. Indeed, the evolution of the physical systems
they control with transducers can be affected by surrounding physical processes over which they
have no control and which may potentially hamper the achievement of their purposes. While it is illusory
to hope for a comprehensive model of the physical environment at design time to anticipate and remove
faults that may occur once these systems are deployed, it becomes necessary to evaluate their degree
of effectiveness in vivo. In this paper, the degree of effectiveness is formally defined and generalized
in the context of the measure theory. The measure is developed in the context of the Transferable
Belief Model (TBM), an elaboration on the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence so as to handle
epistemic and aleatory uncertainties respectively pertaining the users' expectations and the
natural variability of the physical environment. The TBM is used in conjunction with the Input/Output
Hidden Markov Modeling framework (we denote by Ev-IOHMM) to specify the expected evolution of the
physical system controlled by the CPS and the tolerances towards uncertainties. The measure of
effectiveness is then obtained from the forward algorithm, leveraging the conflict entailed by
the successive combinations of the beliefs obtained from observations of the physical system and
the beliefs corresponding to its expected evolution. The proposed approach is applied to autonomous
vehicles and show how the degree of effectiveness can be used for bench-marking their controller
relative to the highway code speed limitations and passengers' well-being constraints, both modeled
through an Ev-IOHMM.
