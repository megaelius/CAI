Biomedical ontology refers to a shared conceptualization for a biomedical domain of interest that
has vastly improved data management and data sharing through the open data movement. The rapid growth
and availability of biomedical data make it impractical and computationally expensive to perform
manual analysis and query processing with the large scale ontologies. The lack of ability in analyzing
ontologies from such a variety of sources, and supporting knowledge discovery for clinical practice
and biomedical research should be overcome with new technologies. In this study, we developed a
Medical Topic discovery and Query generation framework (MedTQ), which was composed by a series
of approaches and algorithms. A predicate neighborhood pattern-based approach introduced has
the ability to compute the similarity of predicates (relations) in ontologies. Given a predicate
similarity metric, machine learning algorithms have been developed for automatic topic discovery
and query generation. The topic discovery algorithm, called the hierarchical K-Means algorithm
was designed by extending an existing supervised algorithm (K-means clustering) for the construction
of a topic hierarchy. In the hierarchical K-Means algorithm, a level-by-level optimization strategy
was selected for consistent with the strongly association between elements within a topic. Automatic
query generation was facilitated for discovered topic that could be guided users for interactive
query design and processing. Evaluation was conducted to generate topic hierarchy for DrugBank
ontology as a case study. Results demonstrated that the MedTQ framework can enhance knowledge discovery
by capturing underlying structures from domain specific data and ontologies.
