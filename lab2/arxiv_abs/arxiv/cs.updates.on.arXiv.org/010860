Controlled interacting particle systems such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the feedback
particle filter (FPF) are numerical algorithms to approximate the solution of the nonlinear filtering
problem in continuous time. The distinguishing feature of these algorithms is that the Bayesian
update step is implemented using a feedback control law. It has been noted in the literature that
the control law is not unique. This is the main problem addressed in this paper. To obtain a unique
control law, the filtering problem is formulated here as an optimal transportation problem. An
explicit formula for the (mean-field type) optimal control law is derived in the linear Gaussian
setting. Comparisons are made with the control laws for different types of EnKF algorithms described
in the literature. Via empirical approximation of the mean-field control law, a finite-$N$ controlled
interacting particle algorithm is obtained. For this algorithm, the equations for empirical mean
and covariance are derived and shown to be identical to the Kalman filter. This allows strong conclusions
on convergence and error properties based on the classical filter stability theory for the Kalman
filter. It is shown that, under certain technical conditions, the mean squared error (m.s.e.) converges
to zero even with a finite number of particles. A detailed propagation of chaos analysis is carried
out for the finite-$N$ algorithm. The analysis is used to prove weak convergence of the empirical
distribution as $N\rightarrow\infty$. For a certain simplified filtering problem, analytical
comparison of the m.s.e. with the importance sampling-based algorithms is described. The analysis
helps explain the favorable scaling properties of the control-based algorithms reported in several
numerical studies in recent literature.
