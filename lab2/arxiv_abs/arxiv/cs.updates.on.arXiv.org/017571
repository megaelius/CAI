The design of future mobility solutions (autonomous vehicles, micromobility solutions, etc.)
and the design of the mobility systems they enable are closely coupled. Indeed, knowledge about
the intended service of novel mobility solutions would impact their design and deployment process,
whilst insights about their technological development could significantly affect transportation
management policies. This requires tools to study such a coupling and co-design future mobility
systems in terms of different objectives. This paper presents a framework to address such co-design
problems. In particular, we leverage the recently developed mathematical theory of co-design
to frame and solve the problem of designing and deploying an intermodal mobility system, whereby
autonomous vehicles service travel demands jointly with micromobility solutions such as shared
bikes and e-scooters, and public transit, in terms of fleets sizing, vehicle characteristics,
and public transit service frequency. Our framework is modular and compositional, allowing one
to describe the design problem as the interconnection of its individual components and to tackle
it from a system-level perspective. Moreover, it only requires very general monotonicity assumptions
and it naturally handles multiple objectives, delivering the rational solutions on the Pareto
front and thus enabling policy makers to select a policy. To showcase our methodology, we present
a real-world case study for Washington D.C., USA. Our work suggests that it is possible to create
user-friendly optimization tools to systematically assess the costs and benefits of interventions,
and that such analytical techniques might inform policy-making in the future.
