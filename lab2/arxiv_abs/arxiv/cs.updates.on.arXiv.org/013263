Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future
for society. Its legacy is linked with the Millennium Development Goals, set up in 2000. A bibliometric
analysis was conducted to 1) measure "core" research output from 2000-2017, with the aim to map the
global research of sustainability goals, 2) describe thematic specialization based on keywords
co-occurrence analysis and strongest citation burst, 3) present a methodology to classify scientific
output (based on an ad-hoc glossary) and assess SDGs interconnections. Sustainability goals publications
(core+expand based on direct citations) were identified in-house CWTS Web of Science by using search
terms in titles, abstracts, and keywords. 25,299 bibliographic records were analyzed, from which
21,653 (85.59%) are from HEIs and research centres (RC). The purpose of this paper is to analyze the
role of these organizations in sustainability research. The findings reveal the increasing participation
of these organizations in this research (660 institutions in 2000-2005 to 1744 institutions involved
in 2012-2017). In terms of specialization, some institutions present a higher production and specialization
on the topic (e.g., London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and World Health Organization);
however, others present less production but higher specialization (e.g., Stockholm Environment
Institute). Regarding the topics, health (especially in developing countries), women and socio-economic
aspects are the most prominent ones. Moreover, it is observed the interlinked nature of SDGs between
some SDGs in research output (e.g., SDG11 and SDG3). This study provides important orientation
for HEIs and RCs in terms of Research, Development and Innovation (R&D+i) to respond to major societal
challenges and could be useful for the policymakers in order to promote the research agenda on this
topic.
