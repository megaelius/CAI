Constrained counting and sampling are two fundamental problems in Computer Science with numerous
applications, including network reliability, privacy, probabilistic reasoning, and constrained-random
verification. In constrained counting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given
weighting function, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained sampling,
the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting function, from the set of solutions to
a set of given constraints. Consequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject
to intense theoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however, offered
either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or approaches with proven guarantees
but poor performance in practice. In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic
framework for constrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic technique
of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial reasoning tools, in particular,
SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The resulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling
(UniGen) can handle formulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from
the prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of variables. If the initial set
of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial
Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By exploiting
the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the distribution of solutions
in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we introduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that
reduced the size of XOR constraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much
as two orders of magnitude.
