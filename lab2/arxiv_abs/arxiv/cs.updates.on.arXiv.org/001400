We present ExaGeoStat, a high performance framework for geospatial statistics in climate and environment
modeling. In contrast to simulation based on partial differential equations derived from first-principles
modeling, ExaGeoStat employs a statistical model based on the evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood
function, which operates on a large dense covariance matrix. Generated by the parametrizable Matern
covariance function, the resulting matrix is symmetric and positive definite. The computational
tasks involved during the evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood function become daunting
as the number n of geographical locations grows, as O(n2) storage and O(n3) operations are required.
While many approximation methods have been devised from the side of statistical modeling to ameliorate
these polynomial complexities, we are interested here in the complementary approach of evaluating
the exact algebraic result by exploiting advances in solution algorithms and many-core computer
architectures. Using state-of-the-art high performance dense linear algebra libraries associated
with various leading edge parallel architectures (Intel KNLs, NVIDIA GPUs, and distributed-memory
systems), ExaGeoStat raises the game for statistical applications from climate and environmental
science. ExaGeoStat provides a reference evaluation of statistical parameters, with which to
assess the validity of the various approaches based on approximation. The framework takes a first
step in the merger of large-scale data analytics and extreme computing for geospatial statistical
applications, to be followed by additional complexity reducing improvements from the solver side
that can be implemented under the same interface. Thus, a single uncompromised statistical model
can ultimately be executed in a wide variety of emerging exascale environments.
