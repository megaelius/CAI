Actor-critic algorithms learn an explicit policy (actor), and an accompanying value function
(critic). The actor performs actions in the environment, while the critic evaluates the actor's
current policy. However, despite their stability and promising convergence properties, current
actor-critic algorithms do not outperform critic-only ones in practice. We believe that the fact
that the critic learns Q^pi, instead of the optimal Q-function Q*, prevents state-of-the-art robust
and sample-efficient off-policy learning algorithms from being used. In this paper, we propose
an elegant solution, the Actor-Advisor architecture, in which a Policy Gradient actor learns from
unbiased Monte-Carlo returns, while being shaped (or advised) by the Softmax policy arising from
an off-policy critic. The critic can be learned independently from the actor, using any state-of-the-art
algorithm. Being advised by a high-quality critic, the actor quickly and robustly learns the task,
while its use of the Monte-Carlo return helps overcome any bias the critic may have. In addition to
a new Actor-Critic formulation, the Actor-Advisor, a method that allows an external advisory policy
to shape a Policy Gradient actor, can be applied to many other domains. By varying the source of advice,
we demonstrate the wide applicability of the Actor-Advisor to three other important subfields
of RL: safe RL with backup policies, efficient leverage of domain knowledge, and transfer learning
in RL. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the Actor-Advisor compared to state-of-the-art
actor-critic methods, illustrate its applicability to the three other application scenarios
listed above, and show that many important challenges of RL can now be solved using a single elegant
solution.
