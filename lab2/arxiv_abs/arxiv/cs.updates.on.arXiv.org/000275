While passwords, by definition, are meant to be secret, recent trends have witnessed an increasing
number of people sharing their email passwords with friends, colleagues, and significant others.
However, leading websites like Google advise their users not to share their passwords with anyone,
to avoid security and privacy breaches. To understand users' general password sharing behavior
and practices, we conducted an online survey with 209 Indian participants and found that 64.35%
of the participants felt a need to share their email passwords. Further, about 77% of the participants
said that they would want to use a system which could provide them access control features, to maintain
their privacy while sharing emails. To address the privacy concerns of users who need to share emails,
we propose ChaMAILeon, a system which enables users to share their email passwords while maintaining
their privacy. ChaMAILeon allows users to create multiple passwords for their email account. Each
such password corresponds to a different set of access control rules, and gives a different view
of the same email account. We conducted a controlled experiment with 30 participants to evaluate
the usability of the system. Each participant was required to perform 5 tasks. Each task corresponded
to different access control rules, which the participant was required to set, for a dummy email account.
We found that, with a reasonable number of multiple attempts, all 30 participants were able to perform
all 5 tasks given to them. The system usability score was found out to be 75.42. Moreover, 56.6% of
the participants said that they would like to use ChaMAILeon frequently.
