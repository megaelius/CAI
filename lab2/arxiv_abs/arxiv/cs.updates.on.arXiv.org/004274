The Fourier Entropy-Influence (FEI) Conjecture of Friedgut and Kalai states that ${\bf H}[f] \leq
C \cdot {\bf I}[f]$ holds for every Boolean function $f$, where ${\bf H}[f]$ denotes the spectral
entropy of $f$, ${\bf I}[f]$ is its total influence, and $C > 0$ is a universal constant. Despite significant
interest in the conjecture it has only been shown to hold for some classes of Boolean functions such
as symmetric functions and read-once formulas. In this work, we prove the conjecture for extremal
cases, functions with small influence and functions with high entropy. Specifically, we show that:
* FEI holds for the class of functions with ${\bf I}[f] \leq 2^{-cn}$ with the constant $C = 4 \cdot
\frac{c+1}{c}$. Furthermore, proving FEI for a class of functions with ${\bf I}[f] \leq 2^{-s(n)}$
for some $s(n) = o(n)$ will imply FEI for the class of all Boolean functions. * FEI holds for the class
of functions with ${\bf H}[f] \geq cn$ with the constant $C = \frac{1 + c}{h^{-1}(c^2)}$. Furthermore,
proving FEI for a class of functions with ${\bf H}[f] \geq s(n)$ for some $s(n) = o(n)$ will imply FEI
for the class of all Boolean functions. Additionally, we show that FEI holds for the class of functions
with constant $\|\widehat{f}\|_1$, completing the results of Chakhraborty et al. that bounded
the entropy of such functions. We also improve the result of Wan et al. for read-k decision trees,
from ${\bf H}[f] \leq O(k) \cdot {\bf I}[f]$ to ${\bf H}[f] \leq O(\sqrt{k}) \cdot {\bf I}[f]$. Finally,
we suggest a direction for proving FEI for read-k DNFs, and prove the Fourier Min-Entropy/Influence
(FMEI) Conjecture for regular read-k DNFs.
