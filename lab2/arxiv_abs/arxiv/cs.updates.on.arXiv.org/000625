Compressive sensing (CS) has been widely studied and applied in many fields. Recently, the way to
perform secure compressive sensing (SCS) has become a topic of growing interest. The existing works
on SCS usually take the sensing matrix as a key and the resultant security level is not evaluated in
depth. They can only be considered as a preliminary exploration on SCS, but a concrete and operable
encipher model is not given yet. In this paper, we are going to investigate SCS in a systematic way.
The relationship between CS and symmetric-key cipher indicates some possible encryption models.
To this end, we propose the two-level protection models (TLPM) for SCS which are developed from measurements
taking and something else, respectively. It is believed that these models will provide a new point
of view and stimulate further research in both CS and cryptography. Specifically, an efficient
and secure encryption scheme for parallel compressive sensing (PCS) is designed by embedding a
two-layer protection in PCS using chaos. The first layer is undertaken by random permutation on
a two-dimensional signal, which is proved to be an acceptable permutation with overwhelming probability.
The other layer is to sample the permuted signal column by column with the same chaotic measurement
matrix, which satisfies the restricted isometry property of PCS with overwhelming probability.
Both the random permutation and the measurement matrix are constructed under the control of a chaotic
system. Simulation results show that unlike the general joint compression and encryption schemes
in which encryption always leads to the same or a lower compression ratio, the proposed approach
of embedding encryption in PCS actually improves the compression performance. Besides, the proposed
approach possesses high transmission robustness against additive Gaussian white noise and cropping
attack.
