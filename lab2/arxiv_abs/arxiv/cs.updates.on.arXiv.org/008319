During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard
for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with
many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns
providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With
a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications
for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications
over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application-specific. To address
this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art
performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification
and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power
electronics and motor-fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost
hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that
perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive
review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering
applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art
performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and
the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publically shared in a dedicated
website.
