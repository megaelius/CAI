The blockchain space is changing constantly. New chains are being implemented frequently with
different use cases in mind. As more and more types of crypto assets are getting real world value there
is an increasing need for blockchain interoperability. Exchange services today are still dominated
by central parties which require custody of funds. This trust imposes costs and security risks as
frequent breaches testify. Atomic cross-chain swaps (ACCS) allow mutual distrusting parties
to securely exchange crypto assets in a peer-to-peer manner while preserving self-custody. Fundamental
ACCS protocols leveraged the scripting capabilities of blockchains to conditionalize the transfer
of funds between trading parties. Recent work showed that such protocols can be realized in a scriptless
setting. This has many benefits to blockchains throughput, efficiency of swap protocols and also
to fungibility and privacy. The proposed protocols are limited to assets transferable by either
Schnorr signatures or ECDSA that are assuming the same elliptic curve parameters. In this work we
present JugglingSwap, a scriptless atomic cross-chain swap protocol with a higher degree of interoperability.
We weaken the assumptions about blockchains that can be included in the ACCS protocol, and only require
that (1) a threshold variant exists to the underlying digital signature scheme and (2) it is based
on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). The fair exchange is achieved by a gradual
release of secrets. To achieve this we use a new building block we call Juggling: a public key verifiable
encryption scheme to transfer segments of secret shares between parties, which can also be of separate
interest. Juggling is then tailored to a specific private key management system design with threshold
signatures security.
