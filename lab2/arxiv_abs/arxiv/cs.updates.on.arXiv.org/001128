Privacy-minded Internet service operators anonymize IPv6 addresses by truncating them to a fixed
length, perhaps due to long-standing use of this technique with IPv4 and a belief that it's "good
enough." We claim that simple anonymization by truncation is suspect since it does not entail privacy
guarantees nor does it take into account some common address assignment practices observed today.
To investigate, with standard activity logs as input, we develop a counting method to determine
a lower bound on the number of active IPv6 addresses that are simultaneously assigned, such as those
of clients that access World-Wide Web services. In many instances, we find that these empirical
measurements offer no evidence that truncating IPv6 addresses to a fixed number of bits, e.g., 48
in common practice, protects individuals' privacy. To remedy this problem, we propose kIP anonymization,
an aggregation method that ensures a certain level of address privacy. Our method adaptively determines
variable truncation lengths using parameter k, the desired number of active (rather than merely
potential) addresses, e.g., 32 or 256, that can not be distinguished from each other once anonymized.
We describe our implementation and present first results of its application to millions of real
IPv6 client addresses active over a week's time, demonstrating both feasibility at large scale
and ability to automatically adapt to each network's address assignment practice and synthesize
a set of anonymous aggregates (prefixes), each of which is guaranteed to cover (contain) at least
k of the active addresses. Each address is anonymized by truncating it to the length of its longest
matching prefix in that set.
