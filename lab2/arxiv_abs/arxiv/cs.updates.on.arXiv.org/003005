Hate speech, offensive language, sexism, racism and other types of abusive behavior have become
a common phenomenon in many online social media platforms. In recent years, such diverse abusive
behaviors have been manifesting with increased frequency and levels of intensity. This is due to
the openness and willingness of popular media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, to host content
of sensitive or controversial topics. However, these platforms have not adequately addressed
the problem of online abusive behavior, and their responsiveness to the effective detection and
blocking of such inappropriate behavior remains limited. In the present paper, we study this complex
problem by following a more holistic approach, which considers the various aspects of abusive behavior.
To make the approach tangible, we focus on Twitter data and analyze user and textual properties from
different angles of abusive posting behavior. We propose a deep learning architecture, which utilizes
a wide variety of available metadata, and combines it with automatically-extracted hidden patterns
within the text of the tweets, to detect multiple abusive behavioral norms which are highly inter-related.
We apply this unified architecture in a seamless, transparent fashion to detect different types
of abusive behavior (hate speech, sexism vs. racism, bullying, sarcasm, etc.) without the need
for any tuning of the model architecture for each task. We test the proposed approach with multiple
datasets addressing different and multiple abusive behaviors on Twitter. Our results demonstrate
that it largely outperforms the state-of-art methods (between 21 and 45\% improvement in AUC, depending
on the dataset).
