When selling information, sometimes the seller can increase the revenue by giving away some partial
information to change the buyer's belief about the information product, so the buyer may be more
willing to purchase. This work studies the general problem of advertising information products
by revealing some partial information. We consider a buyer who needs to make a decision, the outcome
of which depends on the state of the world that is unknown to the buyer. There is an information seller
who has access to information about the state of the world. The seller can advertise the information
by revealing some partial information. We consider a seller who chooses an advertising strategy
and then commits to it. The buyer decides whether to purchase the full information product after
seeing the partial information. The seller's goal is to maximize the expected revenue. We prove
that finding the optimal advertising strategy is hard, even in the simple case that the buyer type
is known. Nevertheless, we show that when the buyer type is known, the problem is equivalent to finding
the concave closure of a function. Based on this observation, we prove some properties of the optimal
mechanism, which allow us to solve the optimal mechanism by a convex program (with exponential size
in general, polynomial size for special cases). We also prove some interesting characterizations
of the optimal mechanisms based on these properties. For the general problem when the seller only
knows the type distribution of the buyer, it is NP-hard to find a constant factor approximation.
We thus look at special cases and provide an approximation algorithm that finds an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal
mechanism when it is not too hard to predict the possible type of buyer who will make the purchase.
