In the communication systems domain, constructing and maintaining network topologies via topology
control (TC) algorithms is an important cross-cutting research area. Network topologies are usually
modeled using attributed graphs whose nodes and edges represent the network nodes and their interconnecting
links. A key requirement of TC algorithms is to fulfill certain consistency and optimization properties
to ensure a high quality of service. Still, few attempts have been made to constructively integrate
these properties into the development process of TC algorithms. Furthermore, even though many
TC algorithms share substantial parts (such as structural patterns or tie-breaking strategies),
few works constructively leverage these commonalities and differences of TC algorithms systematically.
In previous work, we addressed the constructive integration of consistency properties into the
development process. We outlined a constructive, model-driven methodology for designing individual
TC algorithms. Valid and high-quality topologies are characterized using declarative graph constraints;
TC algorithms are specified using programmed graph transformation. We applied a well-known static
analysis technique to refine a given TC algorithm in a way that the resulting algorithm preserves
the specified graph constraints. In this paper, we extend our constructive methodology by generalizing
it to support the specification of families of TC algorithms. To show the feasibility of our approach,
we reneging six existing TC algorithms and develop e-kTC, a novel energy-efficient variant of the
TC algorithm kTC. Finally, we evaluate a subset of the specified TC algorithms using a new tool integration
of the graph transformation tool eMoflon and the Simonstrator network simulation framework.
