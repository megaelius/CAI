Linear mixed modelling is a popular approach for detecting and correcting spurious sample correlations
due to hidden confounders in genome-wide gene expression data. In applications where some confounding
factors are known, estimating simultaneously the contribution of known and latent variance components
in linear mixed models is a challenge that has so far relied on numerical gradient-based optimizers
to maximize the likelihood function. This is unsatisfactory because the resulting solution is
poorly characterized and the efficiency of the method may be suboptimal. Here we prove analytically
that maximum-likelihood latent variables can always be chosen orthogonal to the known confounding
factors, in other words, that maximum-likelihood latent variables explain sample covariances
not already explained by known factors. Based on this result we propose a restricted maximum-likelihood
method which estimates the latent variables by maximizing the likelihood on the restricted subspace
orthogonal to the known confounding factors, and show that this reduces to probabilistic PCA on
that subspace. The method then estimates the variance-covariance parameters by maximizing the
remaining terms in the likelihood function given the latent variables, using a newly derived analytic
solution for this problem. Compared to gradient-based optimizers, our method attains equal or
higher likelihood values, can be computed using standard matrix operations, results in latent
factors that don't overlap with any known factors, and has a runtime reduced by several orders of
magnitude. We anticipate that the restricted maximum-likelihood method will facilitate the application
of linear mixed modelling strategies for learning latent variance components to much larger gene
expression datasets than currently possible.
