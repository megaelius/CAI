We address the problem of weakly supervised object localization where only image-level annotations
are available for training object detectors. Numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this
problem through mining object proposals. However, a substantial amount of noise in object proposals
causes ambiguities for learning discriminative object models. Such approaches are sensitive
to model initialization and often converge to undesirable local minimum solutions. In this paper,
we propose to overcome these drawbacks by progressive representation adaptation with two main
steps: 1) classification adaptation and 2) detection adaptation. In classification adaptation,
we transfer a pre-trained network to a multi-label classification task for recognizing the presence
of a certain object in an image. Through the classification adaptation step, the network learns
discriminative representations that are specific to object categories of interest. In detection
adaptation, we mine class-specific object proposals by exploiting two scoring strategies based
on the adapted classification network. Class-specific proposal mining helps remove substantial
noise from the background clutter and potential confusion from similar objects. We further refine
these proposals using multiple instance learning and segmentation cues. Using these refined object
bounding boxes, we fine-tune all the layer of the classification network and obtain a fully adapted
detection network. We present detailed experimental validation on the PASCAL VOC and ILSVRC datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our progressive representation adaptation algorithm
performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.
