Open-ended survey data constitute an important basis in research as well as for making business
decisions. Collecting and manually analysing free-text survey data is generally more costly than
collecting and analysing survey data consisting of answers to multiple-choice questions. Yet
free-text data allow for new content to be expressed beyond predefined categories and are a very
valuable source of new insights into people's opinions. At the same time, surveys always make ontological
assumptions about the nature of the entities that are researched, and this has vital ethical consequences.
Human interpretations and opinions can only be properly ascertained in their richness using textual
data sources; if these sources are analyzed appropriately, the essential linguistic nature of
humans and social entities is safeguarded. Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers possibilities
for meeting this ethical business challenge by automating the analysis of natural language and
thus allowing for insightful investigations of human judgements. We present a computational pipeline
for analysing large amounts of responses to open-ended questions in surveys and extract keywords
that appropriately represent people's opinions. This pipeline addresses the need to perform such
tasks outside the scope of both commercial software and bespoke analysis, exceeds the performance
to state-of-the-art systems, and performs this task in a transparent way that allows for scrutinising
and exposing potential biases in the analysis. Following the principle of Open Data Science, our
code is open-source and generalizable to other datasets.
