The application of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to harness high-content screening
images or 2D compound representations is gaining increasing attention in drug discovery. However,
existing applications often require large data sets for training, or sophisticated pretraining
schemes for the networks. Here, we show on eight cytotoxicity IC50 data sets from ChEMBL 23 that the
in vitro activity of compounds on cancer cell lines can be accurately predicted on a continuous scale
from their Kekul\'e structure representations alone by extending existing architectures (AlexNet,
DenseNet-201, ResNet152 and VGG-19), which were pretrained on unrelated image data sets. We show
that the predictive power of the generated models, which just require standard 2D compound representations
as input, is comparable to that of Random Forest (RF) models trained on circular (Morgan) fingerprints,
a combination which is considered to be the state of the art. Notably, including additional fully-connected
layers further increases the predictive power of the networks by up to 10%. Analysis of the predictions
generated by RF models and ConvNets shows that by simply averaging the output of the RF models and
ConvNets we constantly obtain significantly lower errors in prediction (4-12% decrease in RMSE
on the test set) than those obtained with either model alone, indicating that the features extracted
by the convolutional layers of the ConvNets provide complementary predictive signal to Morgan
fingerprints. Overall, in this work we present a set of ConvNet architectures for the prediction
of compound activity from their Kekul\'e structure representations with state-of-the-art performance,
that require no generation of compound descriptors or use of sophisticated image processing techniques.
