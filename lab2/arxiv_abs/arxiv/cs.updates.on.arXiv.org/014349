When solving ill-posed inverse problems, a good choice of the prior is critical for the computation
of a reasonable solution. A common approach is to include a Gaussian prior, which is defined by a mean
vector and a symmetric and positive definite covariance matrix, and to use iterative projection
methods to solve the corresponding regularized problem. However, a main challenge for many of these
iterative methods is that the prior covariance matrix must be known and fixed (up to a constant) before
starting the solution process. In this paper, we develop hybrid projection methods for inverse
problems with mixed Gaussian priors where the prior covariance matrix is a convex combination of
matrices and the mixing parameter and the regularization parameter do not need to be known in advance.
Such scenarios may arise when data is used to generate a sample prior covariance matrix (e.g., in
data assimilation) or when different priors are needed to capture different qualities of the solution.
The proposed hybrid methods are based on a mixed Golub-Kahan process, which is an extension of the
generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization, and a distinctive feature of the proposed approach
is that both the regularization parameter and the weighting parameter for the covariance matrix
can be estimated automatically during the iterative process. Furthermore, for problems where
training data are available, various data-driven covariance matrices (including those based
on learned covariance kernels) can be easily incorporated. Numerical examples from tomographic
reconstruction demonstrate the potential for these methods.
