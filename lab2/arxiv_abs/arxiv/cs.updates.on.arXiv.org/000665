The purpose of modeling enterprise architecture and analysis of it is to ease decision making about
architecture of information systems. Planning is one of the most important tasks in an organization
and has a major role in increasing the productivity of it. Scope of this paper is scheduling processes
in the enterprise architecture. Scheduling is decision making on execution start time of processes
that are used in manufacturing and service systems. Different methods and tools have been proposed
for modeling enterprise architecture. Colored Petri net is extension of traditional Petri net
that its modeling capability has grown dramatically. A developed model with Colored Petri net is
suitable for verification of operational aspects and performance evaluation of information systems.
With having ability of hierarchical modeling, colored Petri nets permits that using predesigned
modules for smaller parts of the system and with a general algorithm, any kind of enterprise architecture
can be modeled. A two level hierarchical model is presented as a building block for modeling architecture
of Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) in this paper. This model schedules and runs processes
based on a predetermined non-preemptive scheduling method. The model can be used for scheduling
of processes with four non-preemptive methods named, priority based (PR), shortest job first (SJF),
first come first served (FCFS) and highest response ratio next (HRRN). The presented model is designed
such can be used as one of the main components in modeling any type of enterprise architecture. Most
enterprise architectures can be modeled by putting together appropriate number of these modules
and proper composition of them.
