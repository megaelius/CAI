In order to prevent the disclosure of privacy-sensitive data, such as names and relations between
users, social network graphs have to be anonymised before publication. Naive anonymisation of
social network graphs often consists in deleting all identifying information of the users, while
maintaining the original graph structure. Various types of attacks on naively anonymised graphs
have been developed. Active attacks form a special type of such privacy attacks, in which the adversary
enrols a number of fake users, often called sybils, to the social network, allowing the adversary
to create unique structural patterns later used to re-identify the sybil nodes and other users after
anonymisation. Several studies have shown that adding a small amount of noise to the published graph
already suffices to mitigate such active attacks. Consequently, active attacks have been dubbed
a negligible threat to privacy-preserving social graph publication. In this paper, we argue that
these studies unveil shortcomings of specific attacks, rather than inherent problems of active
attacks as a general strategy. In order to support this claim, we develop the notion of a robust active
attack, which is an active attack that is resilient to small perturbations of the social network
graph. We formulate the design of robust active attacks as an optimisation problem and we give definitions
of robustness for different stages of the active attack strategy. Moreover, we introduce various
heuristics to achieve these notions of robustness and experimentally show that the new robust attacks
are considerably more resilient than the original ones, while remaining at the same level of feasibility.
