For a fixed collection of graphs ${\cal F}$, the ${\cal F}$-M-Deletion problem consists in, given
a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide whether there exists $S \subseteq V(G)$ with $|S| \leq k$ such
that $G \setminus S$ does not contain any of the graphs in ${\cal F}$ as a minor. We are interested in
its parameterized complexity when the parameter is the treewidth of $G$, denoted by $tw$. Our objective
is to determine, for a fixed ${\cal F}$, the smallest function $f_{{\cal F}}$ such that ${\cal F}$-M-Deletion
can be solved in time $f_{{\cal F}}(tw) \cdot n^{O(1)}$ on $n$-vertex graphs. We prove that $f_{{\cal
F}}(tw)=2^{2^{O(tw\log tw)}}$ for every collection ${\cal F}$, that $f_{{\cal F}}(tw)=2^{O(tw\log
tw)}$ if all the graphs in ${\cal F}$ are connected and at least one of them is planar, and that $f_{{\cal
F}}(tw)=2^{O(tw)}$ if in addition the input graph $G$ is planar or embedded in a surface. When ${\cal
F}$ contains a single connected planar graph $H$, we obtain a tight dichotomy about the asymptotic
complexity of $\{H\}$-M-Deletion. Namely, we prove that $f_{\{H\}}(tw)=2^{\Theta(tw)}$ if
$H$ is a minor of the banner (that is, the graph consisting of a $C_4$ plus a pendent edge) that is different
from $P_5$, and that $f_{\{H\}}(tw)=2^{\Theta(tw\log tw)}$ otherwise. All the lower bounds hold
under the ETH. We also consider the version of the problem where the graphs in ${\cal F}$ are forbidden
as topological minors, and prove similar results, except that, in the algorithms, instead of requiring
${\cal F}$ to contain a planar graph, we need it to contain a subcubic planar graph. We also prove that,
for this problem, $f_{\{K_{1,i}\}}(tw)=2^{\Theta(tw)}$ for every $i \geq 1$, while for the minor
version it holds that $f_{\{K_{1,i}\}}(tw)=2^{\Theta(tw\log tw)}$ for every $i \geq 4$.
