We show that if evolution is algorithmic in any form and can thus be considered a program in software
space, the emergence of a natural algorithmic probability distribution has the potential to become
an accelerating mechanism. When the strategy produces unfit organisms massive extinctions occur
and modularity provides an evolutionary advantage evolving a genetic memory. We simulate the application
of these mutations (no recombination) based on numerical approximations to algorithmic probability,
in what constitutes the first experiments in artificial life based on aspects of Algorithmic Information
Theory. We find that recurring structures can rapidly become pervasive, potentially explaining
some aspects of convergent evolution, and that the emergence of information modules by local evolution
is unavoidable, requiring memory support reminiscent of functional structures such as genes and
biological information carriers such as DNA. We demonstrate that such regular structures are preserved
and carried on when they first occur and can also lead to an accelerated production of diversity and
extinction, possibly explaining natural phenomena such as periods of accelerated growth of the
number of species and the occurrence of massive extinctions whose causes are a matter of considerable
debate. The approach introduced here appears to be a better approximation to actual biological
evolution than models based upon the application of mutation from uniform probability distributions,
and because evolution by algorithmic probability converges faster to regular structures (both
artificial and natural, as tested on a small biological network), it also approaches a formal version
of open-ended evolution based on previous results. We also show that the procedure has the potential
to significantly accelerate solving optimization problems in the context of artificial evolutionary
algorithms.
