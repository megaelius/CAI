Stylometry can be used to profile or deanonymize authors against their will based on writing style.
Style transfer provides a defence. Current techniques typically use either encoder-decoder architectures
or rule-based algorithms. Crucially, style transfer must reliably retain original semantic content
to be actually deployable. We conduct a multifaceted evaluation of three state-of-the-art encoder-decoder
style transfer techniques, and show that all fail at semantic retainment. In particular, they do
not produce appropriate paraphrases, but only retain original content in the trivial case of exactly
reproducing the text. To mitigate this problem we propose ParChoice: a technique based on the combinatorial
application of multiple paraphrasing algorithms. ParChoice strongly outperforms the encoder-decoder
baselines in semantic retainment. Additionally, compared to baselines that achieve non-negligible
semantic retainment, ParChoice has superior style transfer performance. We also apply ParChoice
to multi-author style imitation (not considered by prior work), where we achieve up to 75% imitation
success among five authors. Furthermore, when compared to two state-of-the-art rule-based style
transfer techniques, ParChoice has markedly better semantic retainment. Combining ParChoice
with the best performing rule-based baseline (Mutant-X) also reaches the highest style transfer
success on the Brennan-Greenstadt and Extended-Brennan-Greenstadt corpora, with much less impact
on original meaning than when using the rule-based baseline techniques alone. Finally, we highlight
a critical problem that afflicts all current style transfer techniques: the adversary can use the
same technique for thwarting style transfer via adversarial training. We show that adding randomness
to style transfer helps to mitigate the effectiveness of adversarial training.
