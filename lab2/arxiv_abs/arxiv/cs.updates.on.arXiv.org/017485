Every 20 seconds, a limb is amputated somewhere in the world due to diabetes. This is a global health
problem that requires a global solution. The MICCAI challenge discussed in this paper, which concerns
the automated detection of diabetic foot ulcers using machine learning techniques, will accelerate
the development of innovative healthcare technology to address this unmet medical need. In an effort
to improve patient care and reduce the strain on healthcare systems, recent research has focused
on the creation of cloud-based detection algorithms. These can be consumed as a service by a mobile
app that patients (or a carer, partner or family member) could use themselves at home to monitor their
condition and to detect the appearance of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). Collaborative work between
Manchester Metropolitan University, Lancashire Teaching Hospital and the Manchester University
NHS Foundation Trust has created a repository of 4,000 DFU images for the purpose of supporting research
toward more advanced methods of DFU detection. Based on a joint effort involving the lead scientists
of the UK, US, India and New Zealand, this challenge will solicit original work, and promote interactions
between researchers and interdisciplinary collaborations. This paper presents a dataset description
and analysis, assessment methods, benchmark algorithms and initial evaluation results. It facilitates
the challenge by providing useful insights into state-of-the-art and ongoing research. This grand
challenge takes on even greater urgency in a peri and post-pandemic period, where stresses on resource
utilization will increase the need for technology that allows people to remain active, healthy
and intact in their home.
