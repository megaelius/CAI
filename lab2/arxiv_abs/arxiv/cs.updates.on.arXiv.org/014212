The freshness of status information is of great importance for time-critical Internet of Things
(IoT) applications. A metric measuring status freshness is the age-of-information (AoI), which
captures the time elapsed from the status being generated at the source node (e.g., a sensor) to the
latest status update.However, in intelligent IoT applications such as video surveillance, the
status information is revealed after some computation intensive and time-consuming data processing
operations, which would affect the status freshness. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, age-of-processing
(AoP), to quantify such status freshness, which captures the time elapsed of the newest received
processed status data since it is generated. Compared with AoI, AoP further takes the data processing
time into account. Since an IoT device has limited computation and energy resource, the device can
choose to offload the data processing to the nearby edge server under constrained status sampling
frequency.We aim to minimize the average AoP in a long-term process by jointly optimizing the status
sampling frequency and processing offloading policy. We formulate this online problem as an infinite-horizon
constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with average reward criterion. We then transform the
CMDP problem into an unconstrained Markov decision process (MDP) by leveraging a Lagrangian method,
and propose a Lagrangian transformation framework for the original CMDP problem. Furthermore,
we integrate the framework with perturbation based refinement for achieving the optimal policy
of the CMDP problem. Extensive numerical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
the benchmarks, with an average AoP reduction up to 30%.
