Today's recommender systems are criticized for recommending items that are too obvious to arouse
users' interest. That's why the recommender systems research community has advocated some "beyond
accuracy" evaluation metrics such as novelty, diversity, coverage, and serendipity with the hope
of promoting information discovery and sustain users' interest over a long period of time. While
bringing in new perspectives, most of these evaluation metrics have not considered individual
users' difference: an open-minded user may favor highly novel or diversified recommendations
whereas a conservative user's appetite for novelty or diversity may not be that large. In this paper,
we developed a model to approximate an individual's curiosity distribution over different levels
of stimuli guided by the well-known Wundt curve in Psychology. We measured an item's surprise level
to assess the stimulation level and whether it is in the range of the user's appetite for stimulus.
We then proposed a recommendation system framework that considers both user preference and appetite
for stimulus where the curiosity is maximally aroused. Our framework differs from a typical recommender
system in that it leverages human's curiosity to promote intrinsic interest with the system. A series
of evaluation experiments have been conducted to show that our framework is able to rank higher the
items with not only high ratings but also high response likelihood. The recommendation list generated
by our algorithm has higher potential of inspiring user curiosity compared to traditional approaches.
The personalization factor for assessing the stimulus (surprise) strength further helps the recommender
achieve smaller (better) inter-user similarity.
