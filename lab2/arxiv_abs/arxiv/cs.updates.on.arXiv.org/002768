Brain extraction or skull stripping is a fundamental procedure in most of neuroimaging processing
systems. The performance of this procedure has had a critical impact on the success of neuroimaging
analysis. After several years of research and development, brain extraction still remains a challenging
problem. In this paper, we propose an effective method for skull stripping in Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) scans named ASM-CNN. Our system is a combination of Active Shape Model (ASM) and Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN), taking full advantage of these two methods to achieve remarkable results.
Instead of working with 3D structures, we process 2D image sequences in sagittal plane. First, we
divide images into different groups such that, in each group, the shapes and structures of brain
boundaries have similar appearances. This allows developing precise algorithms for each group
in order to produce high performance segmentation results. Second, a modified version of ASM is
used to detect the brain boundary in images by utilizing prior knowledge of each group. Finally,
CNN and the post-processing methods such as Conditional Random Field, Gaussian Process and some
special rules are applied to refine segmentation contour produced by ASM. We compared ASM-CNN with
the latest version of five state-of-the-art, publicly available methods, namely BET, BSE, 3DSS,
ROBEX and BEAST. The evaluation was carried out by using three public datasets IBSR, LPBA and OASIS.
The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms five states-of-the-art algorithms,
surpassing all the other methods by a significant margin in all experiments.
