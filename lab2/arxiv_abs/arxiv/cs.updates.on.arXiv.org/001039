In this paper, we study contention resolution protocols from a game-theoretic perspective. In
a recent work, we considered acknowledgment-based protocols, where a user gets feedback from the
channel only when she attempts transmission. In this case she will learn whether her transmission
was successful or not. One of the main results of ESA2016 was that no acknowledgment-based protocol
can be in equilibrium. In fact, it seems that many natural acknowledgment-based protocols fail
to prevent users from unilaterally switching to persistent protocols that always transmit with
probability 1. It is therefore natural to ask how powerful a protocol must be so that it can beat persistent
deviators. In this paper we consider age-based protocols, which can be described by a sequence of
probabilities of transmitting in each time step. Those probabilities are given beforehand and
do not change based on the transmission history. We present a 3-player age-based protocol that can
prevent users from unilaterally deviating to a persistent protocol in order to decrease their expected
transmission time. It is worth noting that the answer to this question does not follow from the results
and proof ideas of ESA2016. Our protocol is non-trivial, in the sense that, when all players use it,
finite expected transmission time is guaranteed. In fact, we show that this protocol is preferable
to any deadline protocol in which, after some fixed time, attempt transmission with probability
1 in every subsequent step. An advantage of our protocol is that it is very simple to describe, and
users only need a counter to keep track of time. Whether there exist $n$-player age-based protocols
that do not use counters and can prevent persistence is left as an open problem for future research.
