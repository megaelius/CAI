Recently, link prediction has attracted more attentions from various disciplines such as computer
science, bioinformatics and economics. In this problem, unknown links between nodes are discovered
based on numerous information such as network topology, profile information and user generated
contents. Most of the previous researchers have focused on the structural features of the networks.
While the recent researches indicate that contextual information can change the network topology.
Although, there are number of valuable researches which combine structural and content information,
but they face with the scalability issue due to feature engineering. Because, majority of the extracted
features are obtained by a supervised or semi supervised algorithm. Moreover, the existing features
are not general enough to indicate good performance on different networks with heterogeneous structures.
Besides, most of the previous researches are presented for undirected and unweighted networks.
In this paper, a novel link prediction framework called "DeepLink" is presented based on deep learning
techniques. In contrast to the previous researches which fail to automatically extract best features
for the link prediction, deep learning reduces the manual feature engineering. In this framework,
both the structural and content information of the nodes are employed. The framework can use different
structural feature vectors, which are prepared by various link prediction methods. It considers
all proximity orders that are presented in a network during the structural feature learning. We
have evaluated the performance of DeepLink on two real social network datasets including Telegram
and irBlogs. On both datasets, the proposed framework outperforms several structural and hybrid
approaches for link prediction problem.
