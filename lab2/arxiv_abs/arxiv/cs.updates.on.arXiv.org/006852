Compared to traditional distributed computing environments such as grids, cloud computing provides
a more cost-effective way to deploy scientific workflows. Each task of a scientific workflow requires
several large datasets that are located in different datacenters from the cloud computing environment,
resulting in serious data transmission delays. Edge computing reduces the data transmission delays
and supports the fixed storing manner for scientific workflow private datasets, but there is a bottleneck
in its storage capacity. It is a challenge to combine the advantages of both edge computing and cloud
computing to rationalize the data placement of scientific workflow, and optimize the data transmission
time across different datacenters. Traditional data placement strategies maintain load balancing
with a given number of datacenters, which results in a large data transmission time. In this study,
a self-adaptive discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with genetic algorithm operators
(GA-DPSO) was proposed to optimize the data transmission time when placing data for a scientific
workflow. This approach considered the characteristics of data placement combining edge computing
and cloud computing. In addition, it considered the impact factors impacting transmission delay,
such as the band-width between datacenters, the number of edge datacenters, and the storage capacity
of edge datacenters. The crossover operator and mutation operator of the genetic algorithm were
adopted to avoid the premature convergence of the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm,
which enhanced the diversity of population evolution and effectively reduced the data transmission
time. The experimental results show that the data placement strategy based on GA-DPSO can effectively
reduce the data transmission time during workflow execution combining edge computing and cloud
computing.
