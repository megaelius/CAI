Among many submissions to the NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) project, NewHope is a promising
key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on the Ring-Learning with errors (Ring-LWE) problem.
Since the most important factors to be considered for PQC are security and cost including bandwidth
and time/space complexity, in this paper, by doing exact noise analysis and using Bose Chaudhuri
Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, it is shown that the security and bandwidth efficiency of NewHope can be
substantially improved. In detail, the decryption failure rate (DFR) of NewHope is recalculated
by performing exact noise analysis, and it is shown that the DFR of NewHope has been too conservatively
calculated. Since the recalculated DFR is much lower than the required $2^{-128}$, this DFR margin
is exploited to improve the security up to 8.5 \% or the bandwidth efficiency up to 5.9 \% without changing
the procedure of NewHope. The additive threshold encoding (ATE) used in NewHope is a simple error
correcting code (ECC) robust to side channel attack, but its error-correction capability is relatively
weak compared with other ECCs. Therefore, if a proper error-correction scheme is applied to NewHope,
either security or bandwidth efficiency or both can be improved. Among various ECCs, BCH code has
been widely studied for its application to cryptosystems due to its advantages such as no error floor
problem. In this paper, the ATE and total noise channel are regarded as a super channel from an information-theoretic
viewpoint. Based on this super channel analysis, various concatenated coding schemes of ATE and
BCH code for NewHope have been investigated. Through numerical analysis, it is revealed that the
security and bandwidth efficiency of NewHope are substantially improved by using the proposed
error-correction schemes.
