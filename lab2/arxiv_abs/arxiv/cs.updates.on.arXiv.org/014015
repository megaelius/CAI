Nowadays designing a real recommendation system has been a critical problem for both academic and
industry. However, due to the huge number of users and items, the diversity and dynamic property
of the user interest, how to design a scalable recommendation system, which is able to efficiently
produce effective and diverse recommendation results on billion-scale scenarios, is still a challenging
and open problem for existing methods. In this paper, given the user-item interaction graph, we
propose RNE, a data-efficient Recommendation-based Network Embedding method, to give personalized
and diverse items to users. Specifically, we propose a diversity- and dynamics-aware neighbor
sampling method for network embedding. On the one hand, the method is able to preserve the local structure
between the users and items while modeling the diversity and dynamic property of the user interest
to boost the recommendation quality. On the other hand the sampling method can reduce the complexity
of the whole method theoretically to make it possible for billion-scale recommendation. We also
implement the designed algorithm in a distributed way to further improves its scalability. Experimentally,
we deploy RNE on a recommendation scenario of Taobao, the largest E-commerce platform in China,
and train it on a billion-scale user-item graph. As is shown on several online metrics on A/B testing,
RNE is able to achieve both high-quality and diverse results compared with CF-based methods. We
also conduct the offline experiments on Pinterest dataset comparing with several state-of-the-art
recommendation methods and network embedding methods. The results demonstrate that our method
is able to produce a good result while runs much faster than the baseline methods.
