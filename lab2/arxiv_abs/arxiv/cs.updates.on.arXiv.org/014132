The importance of area coverage with unmanned vehicles, in other words, traveling an area with an
unmanned vehicle such as a robot or a UAV completely or partially with minimum cost, is increasing
with the increase in usage of such vehicles today. Area coverage with unmanned vehicles is used today
in the exploration of an area with UAVs, sweeping mines with robots, cleaning ground with robots
in large shopping malls, mowing lawn in a large area etc. The problem has versions such as area coverage
with a single unmanned vehicle, area coverage with multiple unmanned vehicles, on-line area coverage
(The map of the area that will be covered is not known before starting the coverage) with unmanned
vehicles etc. In addition, the area may have obstacles that the vehicles cannot move over. Naturally,
many researches are working on the problem and a lot of researches have been done on the problem until
today. Spanning tree coverage is one of the major approaches to the problem. In this approach, at
the basic level, the planar area is divided into identical squares according to the range of sight
of the vehicle, and centers of these squares are assumed to be vertexes of a graph. The vertexes of
this graph are connected with the edges with unit costs and after finding the minimum spanning tree
of the graph, the vehicle strolls around the spanning tree. The method we propose suggests a way to
cover a non-planar area with unmanned vehicles. The method we propose also takes advantage of the
spanning-tree coverage approach, but instead of assigning unit costs to the edges, we assigned
a weight to each edge using slopes between vertexes those the edges connect. We have gotten noticeably
better results than the results we got when we did not consider the slope between two squares and used
the classical spanning tree approach.
