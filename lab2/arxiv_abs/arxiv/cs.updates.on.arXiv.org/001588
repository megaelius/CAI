Autonomous drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles) are increasingly popular for diverse
applications of light-weight delivery and as substitutions of manned operations in remote locations.
The computing systems for drones are becoming a new venue for research in cyber-physical systems.
Autonomous drones require integrated intelligent decision systems to control and manage their
flight missions in the absence of human operators. One of the most crucial aspects of drone mission
control and management is related to the optimization of battery lifetime. Typical drones are powered
by on-board batteries, with limited capacity. But drones are expected to carry out long missions.
Thus, a fully automated management system that can optimize the operations of battery-operated
autonomous drones to extend their operation time is highly desirable. This paper presents several
contributions to automated management systems for battery-operated drones: (1) We conduct empirical
studies to model the battery performance of drones, considering various flight scenarios. (2)
We study a joint problem of flight mission planning and recharging optimization for drones with
an objective to complete a tour mission for a set of sites of interest in the shortest time. This problem
captures diverse applications of delivery and remote operations by drones. (3) We present algorithms
for solving the problem of flight mission planning and recharging optimization. We implemented
our algorithms in a drone management system, which supports real-time flight path tracking and
re-computation in dynamic environments. We evaluated the results of our algorithms using data
from empirical studies. (4) To allow fully autonomous recharging of drones, we also develop a robotic
charging system prototype that can recharge drones autonomously by our drone management system.
