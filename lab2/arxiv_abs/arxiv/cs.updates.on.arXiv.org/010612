Objective: A median of 14.4% of patient undergone at least one adverse event during surgery and a
third of them are preventable. The occurrence of adverse events forces surgeons to implement corrective
strategies and, thus, deviate from the standard surgical process. Therefore, it is clear that the
automatic identification of adverse events is a major challenge for patient safety. In this paper,
we have proposed a method enabling us to identify such deviations. We have focused on identifying
surgeons' deviations from standard surgical processes due to surgical events rather than anatomic
specificities. This is particularly challenging, given the high variability in typical surgical
procedure workflows. Methods: We have introduced a new approach designed to automatically detect
and distinguish surgical process deviations based on multi-dimensional non-linear temporal
scaling with a hidden semi-Markov model using manual annotation of surgical processes. The approach
was then evaluated using cross-validation. Results: The best results have over 90% accuracy. Recall
and precision were superior at 70%. We have provided a detailed analysis of the incorrectly-detected
observations. Conclusion: Multi-dimensional non-linear temporal scaling with a hidden semi-Markov
model provides promising results for detecting deviations. Our error analysis of the incorrectly-detected
observations offers different leads in order to further improve our method. Significance: Our
method demonstrated the feasibility of automatically detecting surgical deviations that could
be implemented for both skill analysis and developing situation awareness-based computer-assisted
surgical systems.
