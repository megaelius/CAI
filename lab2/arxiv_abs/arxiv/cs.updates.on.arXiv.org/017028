Recently, E-commerce platforms have extensive impacts on our human life. To provide an efficient
platform, one of the most fundamental problem is how to balance the demand and supply in market segments.
While conventional machine learning models have achieved a great success on data-sufficient segments,
it may fail in a large-portion of segments in E-commerce platforms, where there are not sufficient
records to learn well-trained models. In this paper, we tackle this problem in the context of market
segment demand prediction. The goal is to facilitate the learning process in the target segments
even facing a shortage of related training data by leveraging the learned knowledge from data-sufficient
source segments. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm, RMLDP, to incorporate a multi-pattern
fusion network (MPFN) with a meta-learning paradigm. The multi-pattern fusion network considers
both local and global temporal patterns for segment demand prediction. In the meta-learning paradigm,
the transferable knowledge is regarded as the model parameter initializations of MPFN, which are
learned from diverse source segments. Furthermore, we capture the segment relations by combining
data-driven segment representation and segment knowledge graph representation and tailor the
segment-specific relations to customize transferable model parameter initializations. Thus,
even with limited data, the target segment can quickly find the most relevant transferred knowledge
and adapt to the optimal parameters. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale industrial
datasets. The results show that our RMLDP outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines. In addition,
RMLDP has also been deployed in Taobao, a real-world E-commerce platform. The online A/B testing
results further demonstrate the practicality of RMLDP.
