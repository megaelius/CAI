Currently, many intelligence systems contain the texts from multi-sources, e.g., bulletin board
system (BBS) posts, tweets and news. These texts can be ``comparative'' since they may be semantically
correlated and thus provide us with different perspectives toward the same topics or events. To
better organize the multi-sourced texts and obtain more comprehensive knowledge, we propose to
study the novel problem of Mutual Clustering on Comparative Texts (MCCT), which aims to cluster
the comparative texts simultaneously and collaboratively. The MCCT problem is difficult to address
because 1) comparative texts usually present different data formats and structures and thus they
are hard to organize, and 2) there lacks an effective method to connect the semantically correlated
comparative texts to facilitate clustering them in an unified way. To this aim, in this paper we propose
a Heterogeneous Information Network-based Text clustering framework HINT. HINT first models
multi-sourced texts (e.g. news and tweets) as heterogeneous information networks by introducing
the shared ``anchor texts'' to connect the comparative texts. Next, two similarity matrices based
on HINT as well as a transition matrix for cross-text-source knowledge transfer are constructed.
Comparative texts clustering are then conducted by utilizing the constructed matrices. Finally,
a mutual clustering algorithm is also proposed to further unify the separate clustering results
of the comparative texts by introducing a clustering consistency constraint. We conduct extensive
experimental on three tweets-news datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed method in addressing the MCCT problem.
