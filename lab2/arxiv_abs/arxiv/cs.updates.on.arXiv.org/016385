In modern healthcare systems, being able to share electronic health records is crucial for providing
quality care and for enabling a larger spectrum of health services. Health data sharing is dependent
on obtaining individual consent which, in turn, is hindered by a lack of resources. To this extend,
blockchain-based platforms facilitate data sharing by inherently creating a trusted distributed
network of users. These users are enabled to share their data without depending on the time and resources
of specific players (such as the health services). In blockchain-based platforms, data governance
mechanisms become very important due to the need to specify and monitor data sharing and data use
conditions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based data sharing consent model for access
control over individual health data. We use smart contracts to dynamically represent the individual
consent over health data and to enable data requesters to search and access them. The dynamic consent
model extends upon two ontologies: the Data Use Ontology (DUO) which models the individual consent
of users and the Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix (ADA-M) which describes queries from data
requesters. We deploy the model on Ethereum blockchain and evaluate different data sharing scenarios.
The contribution of this paper is to create an individual consent model for health data sharing platforms.
Such a model guarantees that individual consent is respected and that there is accountability for
all the participants in the data sharing platform. The evaluation of our solution indicates that
such a data sharing model provides a flexible approach to decide how the data is used by data requesters.
Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model is efficient and adapts to personalized
access control policies in data sharing.
