Large-scale location based traces, such as mobile phone data, have been identified as a promising
data source to complement or even enrich official statistics. In many cases, a prerequisite step
to deploy the massively gathered data is the detection of home location from individual users. The
problem is that little research exists on the validation (comparison with ground truth datasets)
or the uncertainty estimation of home detection methods, not at individual user level, nor at nation-wide
levels. In this paper, we present an extensive empirical analysis of home detection methods when
performed on a nation-wide mobile phone dataset from France. We analyze the validity of 9 different
Home Detection Algorithms (HDAs), and we assess different sources of uncertainty. Based on 225
different set-ups for the home detection of around 18 million users we discuss different measures
for validation and investigate sensitivity to user choices such as HDA parameter choice and observation
period restriction. Our findings show that nation-wide performance of home detection is moderate
at best, with correlations to ground truth maximizing at 0.60 only. Additionally, we show that time
and duration of observation have a clear effect on performance, and that the effect of HDA criteria
and parameter choice are rather small compared to other uncertainties. Our findings and discussion
offer welcoming insights to other practitioners who want to apply home detection on similar datasets,
or who are in need of an assessment of the challenges and uncertainties related to mobilizing mobile
phone data for official statistics.
