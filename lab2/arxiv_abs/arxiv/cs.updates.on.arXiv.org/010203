Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) has been extensively researched over the last decade. The
objective of NILM is to identify the power consumption of individual appliances and to detect when
particular devices are on or off from measuring the power consumption of an entire house. This information
allows households to receive customized advice on how to better manage their electrical consumption.
In this paper, we present an alternative NILM method that breaks down the aggregated power signal
into categories of appliances. The ultimate goal is to use this approach for demand-side management
to estimate potential flexibility within the electricity consumption of households. Our method
is implemented as an algorithm combining NILM and load profile simulation. This algorithm, based
on a Markov model, allocates an activity chain to each inhabitant of the household, deduces from
the whole-house power measurement and statistical data the appliance usage, generate the power
profile accordingly and finally returns the share of energy consumed by each appliance category
over time. To analyze its performance, the algorithm was benchmarked against several state-of-the-art
NILM algorithms and tested on three public datasets. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised; hence
it does not require any labeled data, which are expensive to acquire. Although better performance
is shown for the supervised algorithms, our proposed unsupervised algorithm achieves a similar
range of uncertainty while saving on the cost of acquiring labeled data. Additionally, our method
requires lower computational power compared to most of the tested NILM algorithms. It was designed
for low-sampling-rate power measurement (every 15 min), which corresponds to the frequency range
of most common smart meters.
