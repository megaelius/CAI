The treatment of malaria is a global health challenge that stands to benefit from the widespread
introduction of a vaccine for the disease. A method has been developed to create a live organism vaccine
using the sporozoites (SPZ) of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), which are concentrated
in the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes. Current manual dissection methods to obtain these
PfSPZ are not optimally efficient for large-scale vaccine production. We propose an improved dissection
procedure and a mechanical fixture that increases the rate of mosquito dissection and helps to deskill
this stage of the production process. We further demonstrate the automation of a key step in this
production process, the picking and placing of mosquitoes from a staging apparatus into a dissection
assembly. This unit test of a robotic mosquito pick-and-place system is performed using a custom-designed
micro-gripper attached to a four degree of freedom (4-DOF) robot under the guidance of a computer
vision system. Mosquitoes are autonomously grasped and pulled to a pair of notched dissection blades
to remove the head of the mosquito, allowing access to the salivary glands. Placement into these
blades is adapted based on output from computer vision to accommodate for the unique anatomy and
orientation of each grasped mosquito. In this pilot test of the system on 50 mosquitoes, we demonstrate
a 100% grasping accuracy and a 90% accuracy in placing the mosquito with its neck within the blade
notches such that the head can be removed. This is a promising result for this difficult and non-standard
pick-and-place task.
