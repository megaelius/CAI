In an epsilon-approximate Nash equilibrium, a player can gain at most epsilon in expectation by
unilateral deviation. An epsilon well-supported approximate Nash equilibrium has the stronger
requirement that every pure strategy used with positive probability must have payoff within epsilon
of the best response payoff. Daskalakis, Mehta and Papadimitriou conjectured that every win-lose
bimatrix game has a 2/3-well-supported Nash equilibrium that uses supports of cardinality at most
three. Indeed, they showed that such an equilibrium will exist subject to the correctness of a graph-theoretic
conjecture. Regardless of the correctness of this conjecture, we show that the barrier of a 2/3 payoff
guarantee cannot be broken with constant size supports; we construct win-lose games that require
supports of cardinality at least Omega((log n)^(1/3)) in any epsilon-well supported equilibrium
with epsilon < 2/3. The key tool in showing the validity of the construction is a proof of a bipartite
digraph variant of the well-known Caccetta-Haggkvist conjecture. A probabilistic argument shows
that there exist epsilon-well-supported equilibria with supports of cardinality O(log n/(epsilon^2)),
for any epsilon> 0; thus, the polylogarithmic cardinality bound presented cannot be greatly
improved. We also show that for any delta > 0, there exist win-lose games for which no pair of strategies
with support sizes at most two is a (1-delta)-well-supported Nash equilibrium. In contrast, every
bimatrix game with payoffs in [0,1] has a 1/2-approximate Nash equilibrium where the supports of
the players have cardinality at most two.
