Research significance: During the epidemic prevention and control period, our study can be helpful
in prognosis, diagnosis and screening for the patients infected with COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus)
based on breathing characteristics. According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory
pattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the common cold. One significant
symptom that occurs in the COVID-19 is Tachypnea. People infected with COVID-19 have more rapid
respiration. Our study can be utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device
can be preliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in situations of one
subject and two subjects can be downloaded online. Research details: Accurate detection of the
unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great
significance. In this work, we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve
this goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is not enough for
training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of different types of respiratory
patterns is large and the outer-class variation is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics
of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first
proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. Subsequently,
we first apply a GRU neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU)
to classify 6 clinically significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots,
Cheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea). The proposed deep model and the modeling ideas have the great
potential to be extended to large scale applications such as public places, sleep scenario, and
office environment.
