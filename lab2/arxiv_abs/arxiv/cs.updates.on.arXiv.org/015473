Cities around the world are expanding dramatically, with urban population growth reaching nearly
2.5 billion people in urban areas and road traffic growth exceeding 1.2 billion cars by 2050. The
economic contribution of the transport sector represents 5% of the GDP in Europe and costs an average
of US $482.05 billion in the United States. These figures indicate the rapid rise of industrial cities
and the urgent need to move from traditional cities to smart cities. This article provides a survey
of different approaches and technologies such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that
leverage communication technologies to help maintain road users safe while driving, as well as
support autonomous mobility through the optimization of control systems. The role of ITS is strengthened
when combined with accurate artificial intelligence models that are built to optimize urban planning,
analyze crowd behavior and predict traffic conditions. AI-driven ITS is becoming possible thanks
to the existence of a large volume of mobility data generated by billions of users through their use
of new technologies and online social media. The optimization of urban planning enhances vehicle
routing capabilities and solves traffic congestion problems, as discussed in this paper. From
an ecological perspective, we discuss the measures and incentives provided to foster the use of
mobility systems. We also underline the role of the political will in promoting open data in the transport
sector, considered as an essential ingredient for developing technological solutions necessary
for cities to become healthier and more sustainable.
