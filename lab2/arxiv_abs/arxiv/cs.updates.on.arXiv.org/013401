Nowadays, a significant portion of daily interacted posts in social media are infected by rumors.
This study investigates the problem of rumor analysis in different areas from other researches.
It tackles the unaddressed problem related to calculating the Spread Power of Rumor (SPR) for the
first time and seeks to examine the spread power as the function of multi-contextual features. For
this purpose, the theory of Allport and Postman will be adopted. In which it claims that there are
two key factors determinant to the spread power of rumors, namely importance and ambiguity. The
proposed Rumor Spread Power Measurement Model (RSPMM) computes SPR by utilizing a textual-based
approach which entails contextual features to compute the spread power of the rumors in two categories:
False Rumor (FR) and True Rumor (TR). Totally 51 contextual features are introduced to measure SPR
and their impact on classification are investigated, then 42 features in two categories "importance"
(28 features) and "ambiguity" (14 features) are selected to compute SPR. The proposed RSPMM is verified
on two labelled datasets, which are collected from Twitter and Telegram. The results show that (i)
the proposed new features are effective and efficient to discriminate between FRs and TRs. (ii)
the proposed RSPMM approach focused only on contextual features while existing techniques are
based on Structure and Content features, but RSPMM achieves considerably outstanding results
(F-measure=83%). (iii) The result of T-Test shows that SPR criteria can significantly distinguish
between FR and TR, in addition, it can be useful as a new method to verify trueness of rumors.
