Protein-ligand interaction is one of the fundamental molecular interactions of living systems.
Proteins are the building blocks of functions in life at the molecular level. Ligands are small molecules
that interact with proteins at specific regions on the surface of proteins called binding sites.
Understanding the physicochemical properties of ligand-binding sites is very important in the
field of drug discovery as well as understanding biological systems. Protein-ligand binding site
plays an essential role in the interaction between protein and ligand that is necessary for any living
system to survive. Comparing similarities between binding sites has been one of the main focus areas
since the last decade in bioinformatics and drug discovery. In this regard, several computational
methods have been developed to compare binding sites so far. Binding site comparison requires fast
and efficient method as the amount of three-dimensional protein structural information is increasing
rapidly nowadays. We report in this study, development of Site2Vec, a novel machine learning-based
method for reference frame invariant ligand-independent vector embedding of the 3D structure
of a protein-ligand binding site. Each binding site is represented in a $d$-dimensional vector
form. The 3D structures of binding sites are mapped to vector form such that similar binding sites
hash into proximal localities, and dissimilar sites fall across diverse regions. A sensitivity
analysis of rotation and perturbation and validation study is performed to understand the behavior
of the method. Benchmarking exercises have been carried out against state of the art binding site
comparison methods on state of the art datasets. The exercises validate our proposed method and
demonstrate that the proposed method is rotationally invariant and can handle natural perturbations
expected in the biological system.
