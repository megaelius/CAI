With recent advances in learning algorithms and hardware development, autonomous cars have shown
promise when operating in structured environments under good driving conditions. However, for
complex, cluttered and unseen environments with high uncertainty, autonomous driving systems
still frequently demonstrate erroneous or unexpected behaviors, that could lead to catastrophic
outcomes. Autonomous vehicles should ideally adapt to driving conditions; while this can be achieved
through multiple routes, it would be beneficial as a first step to be able to characterize Driveability
in some quantified form. To this end, this paper aims to create a framework for investigating different
factors that can impact driveability. Also, one of the main mechanisms to adapt autonomous driving
systems to any driving condition is to be able to learn and generalize from representative scenarios.
The machine learning algorithms that currently do so learn predominantly in a supervised manner
and consequently need sufficient data for robust and efficient learning. Therefore, we also perform
a comparative overview of 45 public driving datasets that enable learning and publish this dataset
index at https://sites.google.com/view/driveability-survey-datasets. Specifically, we
categorize the datasets according to use cases, and highlight the datasets that capture complicated
and hazardous driving conditions which can be better used for training robust driving models. Furthermore,
by discussions of what driving scenarios are not covered by existing public datasets and what driveability
factors need more investigation and data acquisition, this paper aims to encourage both targeted
dataset collection and the proposal of novel driveability metrics that enhance the robustness
of autonomous cars in adverse environments.
