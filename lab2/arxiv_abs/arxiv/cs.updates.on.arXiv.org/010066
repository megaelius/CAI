Neural plasticity is an important functionality of human brain, in which number of neurons and synapses
can shrink or expand in response to stimuli throughout the span of life. We model this dynamic learning
process as an $L_0$-norm regularized binary optimization problem, in which each unit of a neural
network (e.g., weight, neuron or channel, etc.) is attached with a stochastic binary gate, whose
parameters determine the level of activity of a unit in the network. At the beginning, only a small
portion of binary gates (therefore the corresponding neurons) are activated, while the remaining
neurons are in a hibernation mode. As the learning proceeds, some neurons might be activated or deactivated
if doing so can be justified by the cost-benefit tradeoff measured by the $L_0$-norm regularized
objective. As the training gets mature, the probability of transition between activation and deactivation
will diminish until a final hardening stage. We demonstrate that all of these learning dynamics
can be modulated by a single parameter $k$ seamlessly. Our neural plasticity network (NPN) can prune
or expand a network depending on the initial capacity of network provided by the user; it also unifies
dropout (when $k=0$), traditional training of DNNs (when $k=\infty$) and interpolates between
these two. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning framework that unifies network
sparsification and network expansion in an end-to-end training pipeline. Extensive experiments
on synthetic dataset and multiple image classification benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance
of NPN. We show that both network sparsification and network expansion can yield compact models
of similar architectures and of similar predictive accuracies that are close to or sometimes even
higher than baseline networks. We plan to release our code to facilitate the research in this area.
