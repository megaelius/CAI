The ability to predict the evolution of a pathogen would significantly improve the ability to control,
prevent, and treat disease. Despite significant progress in other problem spaces, deep learning
has yet to contribute to the issue of predicting mutations of evolving populations. To address this
gap, we developed a novel machine learning framework using generative adversarial networks (GANs)
with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to accurately predict genetic mutations and evolution of
future biological populations. Using a generalized time-reversible phylogenetic model of protein
evolution with bootstrapped maximum likelihood tree estimation, we trained a sequence-to-sequence
generator within an adversarial framework, named MutaGAN, to generate complete protein sequences
augmented with possible mutations of future virus populations. Influenza virus sequences were
identified as an ideal test case for this deep learning framework because it is a significant human
pathogen with new strains emerging annually and global surveillance efforts have generated a large
amount of publicly available data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI)
Influenza Virus Resource (IVR). MutaGAN generated "child" sequences from a given "parent" protein
sequence with a median Levenshtein distance of 2.00 amino acids. Additionally, the generator was
able to augment the majority of parent proteins with at least one mutation identified within the
global influenza virus population. These results demonstrate the power of the MutaGAN framework
to aid in pathogen forecasting with implications for broad utility in evolutionary prediction
for any protein population.
