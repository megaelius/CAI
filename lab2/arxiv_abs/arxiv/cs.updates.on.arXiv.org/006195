We study classic fair-division problems in a partial information setting. This paper respectively
addresses fair division of rent, cake, and indivisible goods among agents with cardinal preferences.
We will show that, for all of these settings and under appropriate valuations, a fair (or an approximately
fair) division among n agents can be efficiently computed using only the valuations of n-1 agents.
The nth (secretive) agent can make an arbitrary selection after the division has been proposed and,
irrespective of her choice, the computed division will admit an overall fair allocation. For the
rent-division setting we prove that the (well-behaved) utilities of n-1 agents suffice to find
a rent division among n rooms such that, for every possible room selection of the secretive agent,
there exists an allocation (of the remaining n-1 rooms among the n-1 agents) which ensures overall
envy freeness (fairness). We complement this existential result by developing a polynomial-time
algorithm that finds such a fair rent division under quasilinear utilities. In this partial information
setting, we also develop efficient algorithms to compute allocations that are envy-free up to one
good (EF1) and epsilon-approximate envy free. These two notions of fairness are applicable in the
context of indivisible goods and divisible goods (cake cutting), respectively. This work also
addresses fairness in terms of proportionality and maximin shares. Our key result here is an efficient
algorithm that, even with a secretive agent, finds a 1/19-approximate maximin fair allocation
(of indivisible goods) under submodular valuations of the non-secretive agents. One of the main
technical contributions of this paper is the development of novel connections between different
fair-division paradigms, e.g., we use our existential results for envy-free rent-division to
develop an efficient EF1 algorithm.
