A team of mobile agents, starting from different nodes of an unknown network, possibly at different
times, have to meet at the same node and declare that they have all met. Agents have different labels
and move in synchronous rounds along links of the network. The above task is known as gathering and
was traditionally considered under the assumption that when some agents are at the same node then
they can talk. In this paper we ask the question of whether this ability of talking is needed for gathering.
The answer turns out to be no. Our main contribution are two deterministic algorithms that always
accomplish gathering in a much weaker model. We only assume that at any time an agent knows how many
agents are at the node that it currently occupies but agents do not see the labels of other co-located
agents and cannot exchange any information with them. They also do not see other nodes than the current
one. Our first algorithm works under the assumption that agents know a priori some upper bound N on
the network size, and it works in time polynomial in N and in the length l of the smallest label. Our
second algorithm does not assume any a priori knowledge about the network but its complexity is exponential
in the network size and in the labels of agents. Its purpose is to show feasibility of gathering under
this harsher scenario. As a by-product of our techniques we obtain, in the same weak model, the solution
of the fundamental problem of leader election among agents. As an application of our result we also
solve, in the same model, the well-known gossiping problem: if each agent has a message at the beginning,
we show how to make all messages known to all agents, even without any a priori knowledge about the
network. If agents know an upper bound N on the network size then our gossiping algorithm works in
time polynomial in N, in l and in the length of the largest message.
