A classical open problem in combinatorial geometry is to obtain tight asymptotic bounds on the maximum
number of k-level vertices in an arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions (vertices with exactly
k of the hyperplanes passing below them). This is a dual version of the k-set problem, which, in a primal
setting, seeks bounds for the maximum number of k-sets determined by n points in d dimensions, where
a k-set is a subset of size k that can be separated from its complement by a hyperplane. The k-set problem
is still wide open even in the plane, with a substantial gap between the best known upper and lower
bounds. The gap gets larger as the dimension grows. In three dimensions, the best known upper bound
is O(nk^(3/2)). In its dual version, the problem can be generalized by replacing hyperplanes by
other families of surfaces (or curves in the planes). Reasonably sharp bounds have been obtained
for curves in the plane, but the known upper bounds are rather weak for more general surfaces, already
in three dimensions, except for the case of triangles. The best known general bound, due to Chan is
O(n^2.997), for families of surfaces that satisfy certain (fairly weak) properties. In this paper
we consider the case of pseudoplanes in 3 dimensions (defined in detail in the introduction), and
establish the upper bound O(nk^(5/3)) for the number of k-level vertices in an arrangement of n pseudoplanes.
The bound is obtained by establishing suitable (and nontrivial) extensions of dual versions of
classical tools that have been used in studying the primal k-set problem, such as the Lova'sz Lemma
and the Crossing Lemma.
