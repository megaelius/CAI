Quantum State Tomography is the task of determining an unknown quantum state by making measurements
on identical copies of the state. Current algorithms are costly both on the experimental front --
requiring vast numbers of measurements -- as well as in terms of the computational time to analyze
those measurements. In this paper, we address the problem of analysis speed and flexibility, introducing
\textit{Neural Adaptive Quantum State Tomography} (NA-QST), a machine learning based algorithm
for quantum state tomography that adapts measurements and provides orders of magnitude faster
processing while retaining state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy. Our algorithm is inspired
by particle swarm optimization and Bayesian particle-filter based adaptive methods, which we
extend and enhance using neural networks. The resampling step, in which a bank of candidate solutions
-- particles -- is refined, is in our case learned directly from data, removing the computational
bottleneck of standard methods. We successfully replace the Bayesian calculation that requires
computational time of $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ with a learned heuristic whose time complexity empirically
scales as $O(\log(n))$ with the number of copies measured $n$, while retaining the same reconstruction
accuracy. This corresponds to a factor of a million speedup for $10^7$ copies measured. We demonstrate
that our algorithm learns to work with basis, symmetric informationally complete (SIC), as well
as other types of POVMs. We discuss the value of measurement adaptivity for each POVM type, demonstrating
that its effect is significant only for basis POVMs. Our algorithm can be retrained within hours
on a single laptop for a two-qubit situation, which suggests a feasible time-cost when extended
to larger systems. It can also adapt to a subset of possible states, a choice of the type of measurement,
and other experimental details.
