Control theoretical techniques have been successfully adopted as methods for self-adaptive systems
design to provide formal guarantees about the effectiveness and robustness of adaptation mechanisms.
However, the computational effort to obtain guarantees poses severe constraints when it comes
to dynamic adaptation. In order to solve these limitations, in this paper, we propose a hybrid approach
combining software engineering, control theory, and AI to design for software self-adaptation.
Our solution proposes a hierarchical and dynamic system manager with performance tuning. Due to
the gap between high-level requirements specification and the internal knob behavior of the managed
system, a hierarchically composed components architecture seek the separation of concerns towards
a dynamic solution. Therefore, a two-layered adaptive manager was designed to satisfy the software
requirements with parameters optimization through regression analysis and evolutionary meta-heuristic.
The optimization relies on the collection and processing of performance, effectiveness, and robustness
metrics w.r.t control theoretical metrics at the offline and online stages. We evaluate our work
with a prototype of the Body Sensor Network (BSN) in the healthcare domain, which is largely used
as a demonstrator by the community. The BSN was implemented under the Robot Operating System (ROS)
architecture, and concerns about the system dependability are taken as adaptation goals. Our results
reinforce the necessity of performing well on such a safety-critical domain and contribute with
substantial evidence on how hybrid approaches that combine control and AI-based techniques for
engineering self-adaptive systems can provide effective adaptation.
