With the emerging big data applications of Machine Learning, Speech Recognition, Artificial Intelligence,
and DNA Sequencing in recent years, computer architecture research communities are facing the
explosive scale of various data explosion. To achieve high efficiency of data-intensive computing,
studies of heterogeneous accelerators which focus on latest applications, have become a hot issue
in computer architecture domain. At present, the implementation of heterogeneous accelerators
mainly relies on heterogeneous computing units such as Application-specific Integrated Circuit
(ASIC), Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Among the typical
heterogeneous architectures above, FPGA-based reconfigurable accelerators have two merits
as follows: First, FPGA architecture contains a large number of reconfigurable circuits, which
satisfy requirements of high performance and low power consumption when specific applications
are running. Second, the reconfigurable architectures of employing FPGA performs prototype systems
rapidly and features excellent customizability and reconfigurability. Nowadays, in top-tier
conferences of computer architecture, emerging a batch of accelerating works based on FPGA or other
reconfigurable architectures. To better review the related work of reconfigurable computing
accelerators recently, this survey reserves latest high-level research products of reconfigurable
accelerator architectures and algorithm applications as the basis. In this survey, we compare
hot research issues and concern domains, furthermore, analyze and illuminate advantages, disadvantages,
and challenges of reconfigurable accelerators. In the end, we prospect the development tendency
of accelerator architectures in the future, hoping to provide a reference for computer architecture
researchers.
