We present an approach for the verification and validation (V&V) of robot assistants in the context
of human-robot interactions (HRI), to demonstrate their trustworthiness through corroborative
evidence of their safety and functional correctness. Key challenges include the complex and unpredictable
nature of the real world in which assistant and service robots operate, the limitations on available
V&V techniques when used individually, and the consequent lack of confidence in the V&V results.
Our approach, called corroborative V&V, addresses these challenges by combining several different
V&V techniques; in this paper we use formal verification (model checking), simulation-based testing,
and user validation in experiments with a real robot. We demonstrate our corroborative V&V approach
through a handover task, the most critical part of a complex cooperative manufacturing scenario,
for which we propose some safety and liveness requirements to verify and validate. We construct
formal models, simulations and an experimental test rig for the HRI. To capture requirements we
use temporal logic properties, assertion checkers and textual descriptions. This combination
of approaches allows V&V of the HRI task at different levels of modelling detail and thoroughness
of exploration, thus overcoming the individual limitations of each technique. Should the resulting
V&V evidence present discrepancies, an iterative process between the different V&V techniques
takes place until corroboration between the V&V techniques is gained from refining and improving
the assets (i.e., system and requirement models) to represent the HRI task in a more truthful manner.
Therefore, corroborative V&V affords a systematic approach to 'meta-V&V,' in which different
V&V techniques can be used to corroborate and check one another, increasing the level of certainty
in the results of V&V.
