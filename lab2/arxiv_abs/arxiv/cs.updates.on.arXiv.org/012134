We study auctions for carbon licenses, a policy tool used to control the social cost of pollution.
Each identical license grants the right to produce a unit of pollution. Each buyer (i.e., firm that
pollutes during the manufacturing process) enjoys a decreasing marginal value for licenses, but
society suffers an increasing marginal cost for each license distributed. The seller (i.e., the
government) can choose a number of licenses to put up for auction, and wishes to maximize the societal
welfare: the total economic value of the buyers minus the social cost. Motivated by emission license
markets deployed in practice, we focus on uniform price auctions with a price floor and/or price
ceiling. The seller has distributional information about the market, and their goal is to tune the
auction parameters to maximize expected welfare. The target benchmark is the maximum expected
welfare achievable by any such auction under truth-telling behavior. Unfortunately, the uniform
price auction is not truthful, and strategic behavior can significantly reduce (even below zero)
the welfare of a given auction configuration. We describe a subclass of "safe-price'" auctions
for which the welfare at any Bayes-Nash equilibrium will approximate the welfare under truth-telling
behavior. We then show that the better of a safe-price auction, or a truthful auction that allocates
licenses to only a single buyer, will approximate the target benchmark. In particular, we show how
to choose a number of licenses and a price floor so that the worst-case welfare, at any equilibrium,
is a constant approximation to the best achievable welfare under truth-telling after excluding
the welfare contribution of a single buyer.
