Modern neuroimaging techniques provide us with unique views on brain structure and function; i.e.,
how the brain is wired, and where and when activity takes place. These large datasets contain increasingly
rich information that can be analyzed in terms of network structure to reveal organizing principles
at the systems level. Graph representations are versatile models where nodes are associated to
brain regions and edges to structural or functional connections. Structural graphs model neural
pathways in white matter that are the anatomical backbone between regions. Functional graphs are
built based on functional connectivity, which is a pairwise measure of statistical interdependency
between activity traces of regions. Therefore, most research to date has focussed on analyzing
these graphs reflecting structure or function. Graph signal processing (GSP) is an emerging research
theme where signals recorded at the nodes of the graph are analyzed taking into account the underlying
graph structure. An increasing number of fundamental operations has been generalized to the graph
setting, allowing to analyze the signals from a new viewpoint. Here, we introduce GSP for functional
brain imaging and demonstrate its potential to integrate brain structure, contained in the graph
itself, with brain function, residing in the graph signals. We show how brain activity can be meaningfully
filtered based on concepts of spectral modes derived from brain structure. We also derive other
operations such as surrogate data generation or decompositions informed by cognitive systems.
In sum, GSP puts up a novel framework for the analysis of brain imaging data.
