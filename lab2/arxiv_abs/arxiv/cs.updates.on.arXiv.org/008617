Modern application domains such as Composite Event Recognition (CER) and real-time Analytics
require the ability to dynamically refresh query results under high update rates. Traditional
approaches to this problem are based either on the materialization of subresults (to avoid their
recomputation) or on the recomputation of subresults (to avoid the space overhead of materialization).
Both techniques have recently been shown suboptimal: instead of materializing results and subresults,
one can maintain a data structure that supports efficient maintenance under updates and can quickly
enumerate the full query output, as well as the changes produced under single updates. Unfortunately,
these data structures have been developed only for aggregate-join queries composed of equi-joins,
limiting their applicability in domains such as CER where temporal joins are commonplace. In this
paper, we present a new approach for dynamically evaluating queries with multi-way theta-joins
under updates that is effective in avoiding both materialization and recomputation of results,
while supporting a wide range of applications. To do this we generalize Dynamic Yannakakis, an algorithm
for dynamically processing acyclic equi-join queries. In tandem, and of independent interest,
we generalize the notions of acyclicity and free-connexity to arbitrary theta-joins and show how
to compute corresponding join trees. We instantiate our framework to the case where theta-joins
are only composed of equalities and inequalities and experimentally compare our algorithm to state
of the art CER systems as well as incremental view maintenance engines. Our approach performs consistently
better than the competitor systems with up to two orders of magnitude improvements in both time and
memory consumption.
