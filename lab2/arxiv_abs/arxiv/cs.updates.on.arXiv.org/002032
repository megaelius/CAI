Background. Evidence suggests that mobile applications are not thoroughly tested as their desktop
counterparts. In particular GUI testing is generally limited. Like web-based applications, mobile
apps suffer from GUI test fragility, i.e. GUI test classes failing due to minor modifications in
the GUI, without the application functionalities being altered. Aims. The objective of our study
is to examine the diffusion of GUI testing on Android, and the amount of changes required to keep test
classes up to date, and in particular the changes due to GUI test fragility. We define metrics to characterize
the modifications and evolution of test classes and test methods, and proxies to estimate fragility-induced
changes. Method. To perform our experiments, we selected six widely used open-source tools for
scripted GUI testing of mobile applications previously described in the literature. We have mined
the repositories on GitHub that used those tools, and computed our set of metrics. Results. We found
that none of the considered GUI testing frameworks achieved a major diffusion among the open-source
Android projects available on GitHub. For projects with GUI tests, we found that test suites have
to be modified often, specifically 5\%-10\% of developers' modified LOCs belong to tests, and that
a relevant portion (60\% on average) of such modifications are induced by fragility. Conclusions.
Fragility of GUI test classes constitute a relevant concern, possibly being an obstacle for developers
to adopt automated scripted GUI tests. This first evaluation and measure of fragility of Android
scripted GUI testing can constitute a benchmark for developers, and the basis for the definition
of a taxonomy of fragility causes, and actionable guidelines to mitigate the issue.
