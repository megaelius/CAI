Automated segmentation of the optic cup and disk on retinal fundus images is fundamental for the
automated detection / analysis of glaucoma. Traditional segmentation approaches depend heavily
upon hand-crafted features and a priori knowledge of the user. As such, these methods are difficult
to be adapt to the clinical environment. Recently, deep learning methods based on fully convolutional
networks (FCNs) have been successful in resolving segmentation problems. However, the reliance
on large annotated training data is problematic when dealing with medical images. If a sufficient
amount of annotated training data to cover all possible variations is not available, FCNs do not
provide accurate segmentation. In addition, FCNs have a large receptive field in the convolutional
layers, and hence produce coarse outputs of boundaries. Hence, we propose a new fully automated
method that we refer to as a dual-stage fully convolutional networks (DSFCN). Our approach leverages
deep residual architectures and FCNs and learns and infers the location of the optic cup and disk
in a step-wise manner with fine-grained details. During training, our approach learns from the
training data and the estimated results derived from the previous iteration. The ability to learn
from the previous iteration optimizes the learning of the optic cup and the disk boundaries. During
testing (prediction), DSFCN uses test (input) images and the estimated probability map derived
from previous iterations to gradually improve the segmentation accuracy. Our method achieved
an average Dice co-efficient of 0.8488 and 0.9441 for optic cup and disk segmentation and an area
under curve (AUC) of 0.9513 for glaucoma detection.
