Due to the fluctuating nature of the wind and the increasing use of wind energy as a power source, wind
power will have an increasing negative influence on the stability of the power grid. In this paper,
a model predictive control strategy is introduced that not only stabilizes the power produced by
wind farms, but also creates the possibility to perform power reference tracking with wind farms.
With power reference tracking, it is possible for grid operators to adapt the power production to
a change in the power demand and to counteract fluctuations that are introduced by other power generators.
In this way, wind farms can actually contribute to the stabilization of the power grid when this is
necessary instead of negatively influencing it. A low-fidelity control-oriented wind farm model
is developed and employed in the developed distributed model predictive controller. In this control
model, the wake dynamics are taken into account and consequently, the model's order is relatively
large. This makes it, from a computational point of view, challenging for a centralized model predictive
control to provide real-time control for large wind farms. Therefore, the controller proposed
in this paper is a distributed model predictive control. Here, the central control problem is divided
into smaller local control problems that are solved in parallel on local controllers, which significantly
reduces the computational complexity and brings the application of model predictive control in
a wind farm a step closer to practical implementation. The proposed control solution is tested in
simulations on a 10 and 64 turbine wind farm.
