The supermarket model typically refers to a system with a large number of queues, where arriving
customers choose $d$ queues at random and join the queue with fewest customers. The supermarket
model demonstrates the power of even small amounts of choice, as compared to simply joining a queue
chosen uniformly at random, for load balancing systems. In this work we perform simulation-based
studies to consider variations where service times for a customer are predicted, as might be done
in modern settings using machine learning techniques or related mechanisms. To begin, we start
by considering the baseline where service times are known. We find that this allows for significant
improvements. In particular, not only can the queue being joined be chosen based on the total work
at the queue instead of the number of jobs, but also the jobs in the queue can be served using strategies
that take advantage of the service times such as shortest job first or shortest remaining processing
time. Such strategies greatly improve performance under high load. We then examine the impact of
using predictions in place of true service times. Our main takeaway is that using even seemingly
weak predictions of service times can yield significant benefits over blind First In First Out queueing
in this context. However, some care must be taken when using predicted service time information
to both choose a queue and order elements for service within a queue; while in many cases using the
information for both choosing and ordering is beneficial, in many of our simulation settings we
find that simply using the number of jobs to choose a queue is better when using predicted service
times to order jobs in a queue. Our study leaves many natural open questions for further work.
