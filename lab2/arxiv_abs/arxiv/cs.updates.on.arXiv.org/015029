In this work, we study constrained submodular maximization problems and design algorithms that
improve the state-of-the-art performance guarantees. We first present the \emph{adaptive decreasing
threshold} algorithm, which achieves an approximation ratio of $(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$ by performing
$O(\max \{\varepsilon^{-1},\log\log n \})$ queries per element. To the best of our knowledge,
this is currently the fastest known \textbf{deterministic} algorithm, and nearly achieves the
optimal approximation ratio. We also study several other well-known constrained monotone submodular
maximization problems. First, for a single knapsack constraint, we propose an $(7/16-\varepsilon)$-approximate
algorithm, which requires $O(\max\{\varepsilon^{-1},\log\log n\})$ queries per element and
two passes in the streaming setting. This provides improvements in approximation ratio, query
complexity and number of passes on the stream. Furthermore, we show that there is a $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-approximate
deterministic algorithm for constant number of binary packing constraints, which only makes $O_{\varepsilon}(\log
\log n)$ queries per element. We next present an improved algorithm for the intersection of $p$-system
and $d$ knapsack constraint, which achieves an approximation ratio of $1/(p+\frac{7}{4}d+1)-\varepsilon$.
Query complexity lower bound of submodular maximization problems is also studied in this paper.
We show that there exists no (randomized) $(1/4+\epsilon)$-approximate algorithm using $o(n/\log
n)$ queries for unconstrained submodular maximization. Combining with existing results, we present
a complete characterization of the query complexity of unconstrained submodular maximization.
To establish the lower bound, we introduce a general relationship between randomized and deterministic
complexity of approximation algorithms.
