Knowledge Base (KB) completion, which aims to determine missing relation between entities, has
raised increasing attention in recent years. Most existing methods either focus on the positional
relationship between entity pair and single relation (1-hop path) in semantic space or concentrate
on the joint probability of Random Walks on multi-hop paths among entities. However, they do not
fully consider the intrinsic relationships of all the links among entities. By observing that the
single relation and multi-hop paths between the same entity pair generally contain shared/similar
semantic information, this paper proposes a novel method to capture the shared features between
them as the basis for inferring missing relations. To capture the shared features jointly, we develop
Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) to automatically encode the inputs into low-dimensional
vectors, and exploit two partial parameter-shared components, one for feature source discrimination
and the other for determining missing relations. By joint Adversarial Training (AT) the entire
model, our method minimizes the classification error of missing relations, and ensures the source
of shared features are difficult to discriminate in the meantime. The AT mechanism encourages our
model to extract features that are both discriminative for missing relation prediction and shareable
between single relation and multi-hop paths. We extensively evaluate our method on several large-scale
KBs for relation completion. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms
the baseline approaches. In addition, the hierarchical attention mechanism and the feature extractor
in our model can be well interpreted and utilized in the related downstream tasks.
