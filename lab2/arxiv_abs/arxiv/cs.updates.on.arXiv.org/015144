Fundamental mathematical constants like $e$ and $\pi$ are ubiquitous in diverse fields of science,
from abstract mathematics to physics, biology and chemistry. For centuries, new formulas relating
fundamental constants have been scarce and usually discovered sporadically. Here we propose a
novel and systematic approach that leverages algorithms for deriving mathematical formulas for
fundamental constants and help reveal their underlying structure. Our algorithms find dozens
of well-known as well as previously unknown continued fraction representations of $\pi$, $e$,
Catalan's constant, and values of the Riemann zeta function. Two example conjectures found by our
algorithm and so far unproven are: \begin{equation*} \frac{24}{\pi^2} = 2 + 7\cdot 0\cdot 1+ \frac{8\cdot1^4}{2
+ 7\cdot 1\cdot 2 + \frac{8\cdot2^4}{2 + 7\cdot 2\cdot 3 + \frac{8\cdot3^4}{2 + 7\cdot 3\cdot 4 +
\frac{8\cdot4^4}{..}}}} \quad\quad,\quad\quad \frac{8}{7 \zeta(3)} = 1\cdot 1 - \frac{1^6}{3\cdot
7 - \frac{2^6}{5\cdot 19 - \frac{3^6}{7\cdot 37 - \frac{4^6}{..}}}} \end{equation*} We present
two algorithms that proved useful in finding conjectures: a Meet-In-The-Middle (MITM) algorithm
and a Gradient Descent (GD) tailored to the recurrent structure of continued fractions. Both algorithms
are based on matching numerical values and thus they conjecture formulas without providing proofs
and without requiring prior knowledge on any underlying mathematical structure. This approach
is especially attractive for constants for which no mathematical structure is known, as it reverses
the conventional approach of sequential logic in formal proofs. Instead, our work supports a different
approach for research: algorithms utilizing numerical data to unveil mathematical structures,
thus trying to play the role of intuition of great mathematicians of the past, providing leads to
new mathematical research.
