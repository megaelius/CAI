Background: Using sentiment analysis to study software developers' behavior comes with challenges
such as the presence of a large amount of technical discussion unlikely to express any positive or
negative sentiment. However, emoticons provide information about developer sentiments that
can easily be extracted from software repositories. Aim: We investigate how software developers
use emoticons differently in issue trackers in order to better understand the differences between
developers and determine to which extent emoticons can be used as in place of sentiment analysis.
Method: We extract emoticons from 1.3M comments from Apache's issue tracker and 4.5M from Mozilla's
issue tracker using regular expressions built from a list of emoticons used by SentiStrength and
Wikipedia. We check for statistical differences using Mann-Whitney U tests and determine the effect
size with Cliff's delta. Results: Overall Mozilla developers rely more on emoticons than Apache
developers. While the overall rate of comments with emoticons is of 1% and 3% for Apache and Mozilla,
some individual developers can have a rate up to 21%. Looking specifically at Mozilla developers,
we find that western developers use significantly more emoticons (with medium size effect) than
eastern developers. While the majority of emoticons are used to express joy, we find that Mozilla
developers use emoticons more frequently to express sadness and surprise than Apache developers.
Finally, we find that Apache developers use overall more emoticons during weekends than during
weekdays, with the share of sad and surprised emoticons increasing during weekends. Conclusions:
While emoticons are primarily used to express joy, the more occasional use of sad and surprised emoticons
can potentially be utilized to detect frustration in place of sentiment analysis among developers
using emoticons frequently enough.
