Social connectivity is the key process that characterizes the structural properties of social
networks and in turn processes such as navigation, influence or information diffusion. Since time,
attention and cognition are inelastic resources, humans should have a predefined strategy to manage
their social interactions over time. However, the limited observational length of existing human
interaction datasets, together with the bursty nature of dyadic communications have hampered
the observation of tie dynamics in social networks. Here we develop a method for the detection of
tie activation/deactivation, and apply it to a large longitudinal, cross-sectional communication
dataset ($\approx$ 19 months, $\approx$ 20 million people). Contrary to the perception of ever-growing
connectivity, we observe that individuals exhibit a finite communication capacity, which limits
the number of ties they can maintain active. In particular we find that men have an overall higher
communication capacity than women and that this capacity decreases gradually for both sexes over
the lifespan of individuals (16-70 years). We are then able to separate communication capacity
from communication activity, revealing a diverse range of tie activation patterns, from stable
to exploratory. We find that, in simulation, individuals exhibiting exploratory strategies display
longer time to receive information spreading in the network those individuals with stable strategies.
Our principled method to determine the communication capacity of an individual allows us to quantify
how strategies for human interaction shape the dynamical evolution of social networks.
