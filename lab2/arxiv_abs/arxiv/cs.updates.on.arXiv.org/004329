For crowded scenes, the accuracy of object-based computer vision methods declines when the images
are low-resolution and objects have severe occlusions. Taking counting methods for example, almost
all the recent state-of-the-art counting methods bypass explicit detection and adopt regression-based
methods to directly count the objects of interest. Among regression-based methods, density map
estimation, where the number of objects inside a subregion is the integral of the density map over
that subregion, is especially promising because it preserves spatial information, which makes
it useful for both counting and localization (detection and tracking). With the power of deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) the counting performance has improved steadily. The goal of this paper is
to evaluate density maps generated by density estimation methods on a variety of crowd analysis
tasks, including counting, detection, and tracking. Most existing CNN methods produce density
maps with resolution that is smaller than the original images, due to the downsample strides in the
convolution/pooling operations. To produce an original-resolution density map, we also evaluate
a classical CNN that uses a sliding window regressor to predict the density for every pixel in the
image. We also consider a fully convolutional (FCNN) adaptation, with skip connections from lower
convolutional layers to compensate for loss in spatial information during upsampling. In our experiments,
we found that the lower-resolution density maps sometimes have better counting performance. In
contrast, the original-resolution density maps improved localization tasks, such as detection
and tracking, compared to bilinear upsampling the lower-resolution density maps. Finally, we
also propose several metrics for measuring the quality of a density map, and relate them to experiment
results on counting and localization.
