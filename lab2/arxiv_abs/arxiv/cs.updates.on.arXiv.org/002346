We propose a quality-of-service (QoS) driven power-and rate-adaptation scheme for wireless cloud
radio access networks (C-RANs), where each radio remote head (RRH) is connected to the baseband
unit (BBU) pool through high-speed optical links. The RRHs jointly support the users by efficiently
exploiting the enhanced spatial degrees of freedom attained by the powerful cloud computing facilitated
by the BBU pool. Our proposed scheme aims for maximizing the effective capacity (EC) of the user subject
to both per-RRH average-and peak-power constraints, where the EC is defined as the tele-traffic
maximum arrival rate that can be supported by the C-RAN under the statistical delay-QoS requirement.
We first transform the EC maximization problem into an equivalent convex optimization problem.
By using the Lagrange dual decomposition method and satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions,
the optimal transmission power of each RRH can be obtained in closed form. Furthermore, an online
tracking method is provided for approximating the average power of each RRH for the sake of updating
the Lagrange dual variables. For the special case of two RRHs, the expression of the average power
to be assigned to each RRH can be calculated in explicit form, which can be numerically evaluated.
Hence, the Lagrange dual variables can be computed in advance in this special case. Furthermore,
we derive the power allocation for two important extreme cases: 1) no delay constraint; 2) extremely
stringent delay-requirements. Additionally, we also extend our work to the other two important
problems: 1) Energy efficiency maximization problem; 2) EC maximization for a multiuser case.
Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the conventional
algorithm without considering the delay requirements.
