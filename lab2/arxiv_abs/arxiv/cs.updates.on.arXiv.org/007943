Visible Light Ad Hoc Networks (LANETs) is being perceived as an emerging technology to complement
Radio Frequency (RF) based ad hoc networks to reduce congestion in the overloaded RF spectrum. LANET
is intended to support scenarios requiring dense deployment and high data rates. In Visible Light
Communication (VLC), most of the attention has been centered around physical layer with emphasis
on point-to-point communication. In this work, we focus on designing a routing protocol specifically
to overcome the unique challenges like blockage and deafness that render routes in LANETs highly
unstable. Therefore, we propose a cross-layer optimized routing protocol (VL-ROUTE) that interacts
closely with the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer to maximize the throughput of the network by taking
into account the reliability of routes. To accomplish this in a distributed manner, we carefully
formulate a Route Reliability Score (RRS) that can be computed by each node in the network using just
the information gathered from its immediate neighbors. Each node computes an RRS for every known
sink in the network. RRS of a given node can be considered as an estimate of the probability of reaching
a given sink via that node. The RSS value is then integrated to the utility based three-way handshake
process used by the MAC protocol (VL-MAC) to mitigate the effects of deafness, blockage, hidden
node, and maximize the probability of establishing full-duplex links. All these factors contribute
towards maximizing the network throughput. Extensive simulation of VL-ROUTE shows 124% improvement
in network throughput over a network that uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance
(CSMA/CA) along with shortest path routing. Additionally, VL-ROUTE also showed up to 21% improvement
in throughput over the network that uses VL-MAC along with a geographic routing.
