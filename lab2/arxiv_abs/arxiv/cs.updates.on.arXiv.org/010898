Behavior-related research areas such as motion prediction/planning, representation/imitation
learning, behavior modeling/generation, and algorithm testing, require support from high-quality
motion datasets containing interactive driving scenarios with different driving cultures. In
this paper, we present an INTERnational, Adversarial and Cooperative moTION dataset (INTERACTION
dataset) in interactive driving scenarios with semantic maps. Five features of the dataset are
highlighted. 1) The interactive driving scenarios are diverse, including urban/highway/ramp
merging and lane changes, roundabouts with yield/stop signs, signalized intersections, intersections
with one/two/all-way stops, etc. 2) Motion data from different countries and different continents
are collected so that driving preferences and styles in different cultures are naturally included.
3) The driving behavior is highly interactive and complex with adversarial and cooperative motions
of various traffic participants. Highly complex behavior such as negotiations, aggressive/irrational
decisions and traffic rule violations are densely contained in the dataset, while regular behavior
can also be found from cautious car-following, stop, left/right/U-turn to rational lane-change
and cycling and pedestrian crossing, etc. 4) The levels of criticality span wide, from regular safe
operations to dangerous, near-collision maneuvers. Real collision, although relatively slight,
is also included. 5) Maps with complete semantic information are provided with physical layers,
reference lines, lanelet connections and traffic rules. The data is recorded from drones and traffic
cameras. Statistics of the dataset in terms of number of entities and interaction density are also
provided, along with some utilization examples in a variety of behavior-related research areas.
