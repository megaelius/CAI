Deep learning techniques for improving fluid flow modelling have gained significant attention
in recent years. Advanced deep learning techniques achieve great progress in rapidly predicting
fluid flows without prior knowledge of the underlying physical relationships. Advanced deep learning
techniques achieve great progress in rapidly predicting fluid flows without prior knowledge of
the underlying physical relationships. However, most of existing researches focused mainly on
either sequence learning or spatial learning, rarely on both spatial and temporal dynamics of fluid
flows (Reichstein et al., 2019). In this work, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) fluid model based
on a general deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) has been developed for
predicting spatio-temporal flow distributions. In deep convolutional networks, the high-dimensional
flows can be converted into the low-dimensional "latent" representations. The complex features
of flow dynamics can be captured by the adversarial networks. The above DCGAN fluid model enables
us to provide reasonable predictive accuracy of flow fields while maintaining a high computational
efficiency. The performance of the DCGAN is illustrated for two test cases of Hokkaido tsunami with
different incoming waves along the coastal line. It is demonstrated that the results from the DCGAN
are comparable with those from the original high fidelity model (Fluidity). The spatio-temporal
flow features have been represented as the flow evolves, especially, the wave phases and flow peaks
can be captured accurately. In addition, the results illustrate that the online CPU cost is reduced
by five orders of magnitude compared to the original high fidelity model simulations. The promising
results show that the DCGAN can provide rapid and reliable spatio-temporal prediction for nonlinear
fluid flows.
