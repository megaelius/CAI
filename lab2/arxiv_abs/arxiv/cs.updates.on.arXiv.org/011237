Importance: Machine learning (ML) approaches to facial landmark localization carry great clinical
potential for quantitative assessment of facial function as they enable high-throughput automated
quantification of relevant facial metrics from photographs. However, translation from research
settings to clinical applications requires important improvements. Objective: To develop an
ML algorithm for accurate facial landmarks localization in photographs of facial palsy patients,
and use it as part of an automated computer-aided diagnosis system. Design, Setting, and Participants:
Facial landmarks were manually localized in portrait photographs of eight expressions obtained
from 200 facial palsy patients and 10 controls. A novel ML model for automated facial landmark localization
was trained using this disease-specific database. Model output was compared to manual annotations
and the output of a model trained using a larger database consisting only of healthy subjects. Model
accuracy was evaluated by the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between algorithms' prediction
and manual annotations. Results: Publicly available algorithms provide poor results when applied
to patients compared to healthy controls (NRMSE, 8.56 +/- 2.16 vs. 7.09 +/- 2.34, p << 0.01). We found
significant improvement in facial landmark localization accuracy for the clinical population
when using a model trained with a relatively small number patients' photographs (1440) compared
to a model trained using several thousand more images of healthy faces (NRMSE, 6.03 +/- 2.43 vs. 8.56
+/- 2.16, p << 0.01). Conclusions: Retraining a landmark detection model with a small number of clinical
images significantly improved landmark detection performance in frontal view photographs of
the clinical population. These results represent the first steps towards an automatic system for
computer-aided assessment in facial palsy.
