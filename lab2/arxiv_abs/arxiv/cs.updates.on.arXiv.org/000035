This paper introduces the Nash Inequality Ratio (NIR) as a natural characterization of the extent
to which inequality is permitted between individual agents in Nash equilibrium outcomes of a given
strategic setting. For any particular strategy, the inequality ratio is defined as the ratio between
the highest and lowest costs incurred to individual agents in the outcome dictated by that strategy.
The NIR of a game is defined as the maximal inequality ratio over all Nash equilibrium strategy profiles.
It indicates quantitatively how intrinsically fair (or unfair) a game can be for the agents involved.
Moreover, the NIR allows us to quantify the relationship between efficiency and (in)equality,
by establishing whether there exist efficient Nash equilibrium outcomes that maximize and/or
minimize the inequality ratio. We analyze the NIR for two distinct network formation games: the
Undirected Connections (UC) game of Fabrikant et al. (PODC '03) and the Undirected Bounded Budget
Connections (UBBC) game of Ehsani et al. (SPAA '11). In the UC model, we establish the NIR parameterized
on \alpha, showing that (i) when \alpha < 1, the NIR is at most 1+\alpha; (ii) when 1 \leq \alpha
< 2, the NIR is at most 2; and (iii) when 2 \leq \alpha, the NIR is at most 2+\alpha. In the UBBC model,
it is shown that the NIR is upper-bounded by 2. The UBBC upper-bound is shown to hold even in the restricted
uniform budget setting, establishing that the NIR of 2 is intrinsic to the game itself and not a consequence
of nonuniform budgets. The relationship between efficiency and (in)equality is analyzed for both
games. These results stand contrast to the conventional wisdom that equality comes at the expense
of efficiency. We show that in some regimes efficiency and inequality are independent features,
while in others, such as when resources are scarce, there are tradeoffs between efficiency and equality.
