Objective: Identifying bio-signals based-sleep stages requires time-consuming and tedious
labor of skilled clinicians. Deep learning approaches have been introduced in order to challenge
the automatic sleep stage classification conundrum. However, disadvantages can be posed in replacing
the clinicians with the automatic system. Thus, we aim to develop a framework, capable of assisting
the clinicians and lessening the workload. Methods: We proposed the transfer learning framework
entitled MetaSleepLearner, using a Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), in order to transfer
the acquired sleep staging knowledge from a large dataset to new individual subject. The capability
of MAML was elicited for this task by allowing clinicians to label for a few samples and let the rest
be handled by the system. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was also applied to understand
the learning course of our approach. Results: In all acquired datasets, in comparison to the conventional
approach, MetaSleepLearner achieved a range of 6.15 % to 12.12 % improvement with statistical difference
in the mean of both approaches. The illustration of the model interpretation after the adaptation
to each subject also confirmed that the performance was directed towards reasonable learning.
Conclusion: MetaSleepLearner outperformed the conventional approach as a result from the fine-tuning
using the recordings of both healthy subjects and patients. Significance: This is the first paper
that investigated a non-conventional pre-training method, MAML, in this task, resulting in a framework
for human-machine collaboration in sleep stage classification, easing the burden of the clinicians
in labelling the sleep stages through only several epochs rather than an entire recording.
