Many science and engineering applications require finding solutions to planning and optimization
problems by satisfying a set of constraints. These constraint problems (CPs) are typically NP-complete
and can be formalized as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) or constraint optimization problems
(COPs). Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are good solvers for optimization problems ubiquitous
in various problem domains, however traditional operators for EAs are 'blind' to constraints or
generally use problem dependent objective functions; as they do not exploit information from the
constraints in search for solutions. A variation of EA, Intelligent constraint handling evolutionary
algorithm (ICHEA), has been demonstrated to be a versatile constraints-guided EA for continuous
constrained problems in our earlier works in (Sharma and Sharma, 2012) where it extracts information
from constraints and exploits it in the evolutionary search to make the search more efficient. In
this paper ICHEA has been demonstrated to solve benchmark exam timetabling problems, a classic
COP. The presented approach demonstrates competitive results with other state-of-the-art approaches
in EAs in terms of quality of solutions. ICHEA first uses its inter-marriage crossover operator
to satisfy all the given constraints incrementally and then uses combination of traditional and
enhanced operators to optimize the solution. Generally CPs solved by EAs are problem dependent
penalty based fitness functions. We also proposed a generic preference based solution model that
does not require a problem dependent fitness function, however currently it only works for mutually
exclusive constraints.
