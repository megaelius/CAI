Topic lifecycle analysis on Twitter, a branch of study that investigates Twitter topics from their
birth through lifecycle to death, has gained immense mainstream research popularity. In the literature,
topics are often treated as one of (a) hashtags (independent from other hashtags), (b) a burst of
keywords in a short time span or (c) a latent concept space captured by advanced text analysis methodologies,
such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The first two approaches are not capable of recognizing
topics where different users use different hashtags to express the same concept (semantically
related), while the third approach misses out the user's explicit intent expressed via hashtags.
In our work, we use a word embedding based approach to cluster different hashtags together, and the
temporal concurrency of the hashtag usages, thus forming topics (a semantically and temporally
related group of hashtags).We present a novel analysis of topic lifecycles with respect to communities.
We characterize the participation of social communities in the topic clusters, and analyze the
lifecycle of topic clusters with respect to such participation. We derive first-of-its-kind novel
insights with respect to the complex evolution of topics over communities and time: temporal morphing
of topics over hashtags within communities, how the hashtags die in some communities but morph into
some other hashtags in some other communities (that, it is a community-level phenomenon), and how
specific communities adopt to specific hashtags. Our work is fundamental in the space of topic lifecycle
modeling and understanding in communities: it redefines our understanding of topic lifecycles
and shows that the social boundaries of topic lifecycles are deeply ingrained with community behavior.
