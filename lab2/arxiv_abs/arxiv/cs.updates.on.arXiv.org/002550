At present, most effective algorithms to find a Hamilton circle in an undirected graph are generally
based on the Rotation-Extension method developed by Posa. However, due to the deficiencies of Posa's
method, such algorithms are mostly useful for very dense graphs. This article creates a method called
"Enlarged Rotation-Extension" that modifies and extends Posa's method, overcoming its deficiencies.
By introducing the concepts: broad cycle, a cut and insert, main goal Hamilton cycle, main segment,
good edge, good main segment, depth-first search tree, good path, good descendant, we develop a
polynomial time algorithm for this problem and give a proof for it. This is the final version. I just
deleted a little bug (deleted the problem 1 of the last version, it is not a problem, so three problems
become two problems, then much easier to understand) from the last version. I am very sure the algorithm
and the proof are ABSOLUTELY true (not only by thinking but also by program (code)). Though this version
may still contains some little bugs (including English expression), the bugs cannot affect the
correctness and can be solved easily. If you are a expert on algorithm in this world, if you are a famous
and a powerful guy on algorithm in this world, if you are a referee or an editor of a famous algorithm
journal, please open your eyes, use your brain, read this paper and think, you will get it and believe
it. The best way to understand other people's thinking is: try it yourself! If you cannot understand
this paper, try it yourself according to the paper's logic, use your brain. Do not close your eyes
and rest your brain. If some one say: this part of your paper is wrong, then I say: it is not wrong, I explain.
And if some one say: this part can not be understood, can you explain? then, I explain.
