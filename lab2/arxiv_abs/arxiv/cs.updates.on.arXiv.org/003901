We design and implement the first private and anonymous decentralized crowdsourcing system ZebraLancer.
It realizes the fair exchange (i.e. security against malicious workers and dishonest requesters)
without using any third-party arbiter. More importantly, it overcomes two fundamental challenges
of decentralization, i.e. data leakage and identity breach. First, our outsource-then-prove
methodology resolves the critical tension between blockchain transparency and data confidentiality
without sacrificing the fairness of exchange. ZebraLancer ensures: a requester will not pay more
than what data deserve, according to a policy announced when her task is published through the blockchain;
each worker indeed gets a payment based on the policy, if submits data to the blockchain; the above
properties are realized not only without a central arbiter, but also without leaking the data to
blockchain network. Furthermore, the blockchain transparency might allow one to infer private
information of workers/requesters through their participation history. ZebraLancer solves
the problem by allowing anonymous participations without surrendering user accountability.
Specifically, workers cannot misuse anonymity to submit multiple times to reap rewards, and an
anonymous requester cannot maliciously submit colluded answers to herself to repudiate payments.
The idea behind is a subtle linkability: if one authenticates twice in a task, everybody can tell,
or else staying anonymous. To realize such delicate linkability, we put forth a novel cryptographic
notion, the common-prefix-linkable anonymous authentication. Finally, we implement our protocol
for a common image annotation task and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results
show the applicability of our protocol and highlight subtleties of tailoring the protocol to be
compatible with the existing real-world open blockchain.
