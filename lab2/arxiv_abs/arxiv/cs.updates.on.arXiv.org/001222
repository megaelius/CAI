Objective: The Learning Health System (LHS) requires integration of research into routine practice.
eSource or embedding clinical trial functionalities into routine electronic health record (EHR)
systems has long been put forward as a solution to the rising costs of research. We aimed to create
and validate an eSource solution that would be readily extensible as part of a LHS. Materials and
Methods: The EU FP7 TRANSFoRm project's approach is based on dual modelling, using the Clinical
Research Information Model (CRIM) and the Clinical Data Integration Model of meaning (CDIM) to
bridge the gap between clinical and research data structures, using the CDISC Operational Data
Model (ODM) standard. Validation against GCP requirements was conducted in a clinical site, and
a cluster randomised evaluation by site nested into a live clinical trial. Results: Using the form
definition element of ODM, we linked precisely modelled data queries to data elements, constrained
against CDIM concepts, to enable automated patient identification for specific protocols and
prepopulation of electronic case report forms (e-CRF). Both control and eSource sites recruited
better than expected with no significant difference. Completeness of clinical forms was significantly
improved by eSource, but Patient Related Outcome Measures (PROMs) were less well completed on smartphones
than paper in this population. Discussion: The TRANSFoRm approach provides an ontologically-based
approach to eSource in a low-resource, heterogeneous, highly distributed environment, that allows
precise prospective mapping of data elements in the EHR. Conclusion: Further studies using this
approach to CDISC should optimise the delivery of PROMS, whilst building a sustainable infrastructure
for eSource with research networks, trials units and EHR vendors.
