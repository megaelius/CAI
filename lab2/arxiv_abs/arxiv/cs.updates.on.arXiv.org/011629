Despite the fact that robotic platforms can provide both consistent practice and objective assessments
of users over the course of their training, there are relatively few instances where physical human
robot interaction has been significantly more effective than unassisted practice or human-mediated
training. This paper describes a hybrid shared control robot, which enhances task learning through
kinesthetic feedback. The assistance assesses user actions using a task-specific evaluation
criterion and selectively accepts or rejects them at each time instant. Through two human subject
studies (total n=68), we show that this hybrid approach of switching between full transparency
and full rejection of user inputs leads to increased skill acquisition and short-term retention
compared to unassisted practice. Moreover, we show that the shared control paradigm exhibits features
previously shown to promote successful training. It avoids user passivity by only rejecting user
actions and allowing failure at the task. It improves performance during assistance, providing
meaningful task-specific feedback. It is sensitive to initial skill of the user and behaves as an
`assist-as-needed' control scheme---adapting its engagement in real time based on the performance
and needs of the user. Unlike other successful algorithms, it does not require explicit modulation
of the level of impedance or error amplification during training and it is permissive to a range of
strategies because of its evaluation criterion. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid shared
control paradigm with a task-based minimal intervention criterion significantly enhances task-specific
training.
