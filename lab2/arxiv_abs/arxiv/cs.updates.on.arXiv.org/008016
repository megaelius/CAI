Consider two robots that start at the origin of the infinite line in search of an exit at an unknown
location on the line. The robots can only communicate if they arrive at the same location at exactly
the same time, i.e. they use the so-called face-to-face communication model. The group search time
is defined as the worst-case time as a function of $d$, the distance of the exit from the origin, when
both robots can reach the exit. It has long been known that for a single robot traveling at unit speed,
the search time is at least $9d-o(d)$. It was shown recently that $k\geq2$ robots traveling at unit
speed also require at least $9d$ group search time. We investigate energy-time trade-offs in group
search by two robots, where the energy loss experienced by a robot traveling a distance $x$ at constant
speed $s$ is given by $s^2 x$. Specifically, we consider the problem of minimizing the total energy
used by the robots, under the constraints that the search time is at most a multiple $c$ of the distance
$d$ and the speed of the robots is bounded by $b$. Motivation for this study is that for the case when
robots must complete the search in $9d$ time with maximum speed one, a single robot requires at least
$9d$ energy, while for two robots, all previously proposed algorithms consume at least $28d/3$
energy. When the robots have bounded memory, we generalize existing algorithms to obtain a family
of optimal (and in some cases nearly optimal) algorithms parametrized by pairs of $b,c$ values that
can solve the problem for the entire spectrum of these pairs for which the problem is solvable. We
also propose a novel search algorithm, with unbounded memory, that simultaneously achieves search
time $9d$ and consumes energy $8.42588d$. Our result shows that two robots can search on the line
in optimal time $9d$ while consuming less total energy than a single robot within the same search
time.
