The next generation wireless networks (i.e. 5G and beyond), which would be extremely dynamic and
complex due to the ultra-dense deployment of heterogeneous networks (HetNets), poses many critical
challenges for network planning, operation, management and troubleshooting. At the same time,
generation and consumption of wireless data are becoming increasingly distributed with ongoing
paradigm shift from people-centric to machine-oriented communications, making the operation
of future wireless networks even more complex. In mitigating the complexity of future network operation,
new approaches of intelligently utilizing distributed computational resources with improved
context-awareness becomes extremely important. In this regard, the emerging fog (edge) computing
architecture aiming to distribute computing, storage, control, communication, and networking
functions closer to end users, have a great potential for enabling efficient operation of future
wireless networks. These promising architectures make the adoption of artificial intelligence
(AI) principles which incorporate learning, reasoning and decision-making mechanism, as natural
choices for designing a tightly integrated network. Towards this end, this article provides a comprehensive
survey on the utilization of AI integrating machine learning, data analytics and natural language
processing (NLP) techniques for enhancing the efficiency of wireless network operation. In particular,
we provide comprehensive discussion on the utilization of these techniques for efficient data
acquisition, knowledge discovery, network planning, operation and management of the next generation
wireless networks. A brief case study utilizing the AI techniques for this network has also been
provided.
