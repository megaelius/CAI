In this paper, we provide a compositional approach for constructing finite abstractions (a.k.a.
finite Markov decision processes (MDPs)) of interconnected discrete-time stochastic switched
systems. The proposed framework is based on a notion of stochastic simulation functions, using
which one can employ an abstract system as a substitution of the original one in the controller design
process with guaranteed error bounds on their output trajectories. To this end, we first provide
probabilistic closeness guarantees between the interconnection of stochastic switched subsystems
and that of their finite abstractions via stochastic simulation functions. We then leverage sufficient
small-gain type conditions to show compositionality results of this work. Afterwards, we show
that under standard assumptions ensuring incremental input-to-state stability of switched systems
(i.e., existence of common incremental Lyapunov functions, or multiple incremental Lyapunov
functions with dwell-time), one can construct finite MDPs for the general setting of nonlinear
stochastic switched systems. We also propose an approach to construct finite MDPs for a particular
class of nonlinear stochastic switched systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
results, we first apply our approaches to a road traffic network in a circular cascade ring composed
of 200 cells, and construct compositionally a finite MDP of the network. We employ the constructed
finite abstractions as substitutes to compositionally synthesize policies keeping the density
of the traffic lower than 20 vehicles per cell. We then apply our proposed techniques to a fully interconnected
network of 500 nonlinear subsystems (totally 1000 dimensions), and construct their finite MDPs
with guaranteed error bounds. We compare our proposed results with those available in the literature.
