Offline Handwritten Signature verification presents a challenging Pattern Recognition problem,
where only knowledge of the positive class is available for training. While classifiers have access
to a few genuine signatures for training, during generalization they also need to discriminate
forgeries. This is particularly challenging for skilled forgeries, where a forger practices imitating
the user's signature, and often is able to create forgeries visually close to the original signatures.
Most work in the literature address this issue by training for a surrogate objective: discriminating
genuine signatures of a user and random forgeries (signatures from other users). In this work, we
propose a solution for this problem based on meta-learning, where there are two levels of learning:
a task-level (where a task is to learn a classifier for a given user) and a meta-level (learning across
tasks). In particular, the meta-learner guides the adaptation (learning) of a classifier for each
user, which is a lightweight operation that only requires genuine signatures. The meta-learning
procedure learns what is common for the classification across different users. In a scenario where
skilled forgeries from a subset of users are available, the meta-learner can guide classifiers
to be discriminative of skilled forgeries even if the classifiers themselves do not use skilled
forgeries for learning. Experiments conducted on the GPDS-960 dataset show improved performance
compared to Writer-Independent systems, and achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art
Writer-Dependent systems in the regime of few samples per user (5 reference signatures).
