Face anti-spoofing is critical to prevent face recognition systems from a security breach. The
biometrics community has %possessed achieved impressive progress recently due the excellent
performance of deep neural networks and the availability of large datasets. Although ethnic bias
has been verified to severely affect the performance of face recognition systems, it still remains
an open research problem in face anti-spoofing. Recently, a multi-ethnic face anti-spoofing dataset,
CASIA-SURF CeFA, has been released with the goal of measuring the ethnic bias. It is the largest up
to date cross-ethnicity face anti-spoofing dataset covering $3$ ethnicities, $3$ modalities,
$1,607$ subjects, 2D plus 3D attack types, and the first dataset including explicit ethnic labels
among the recently released datasets for face anti-spoofing. We organized the Chalearn Face Anti-spoofing
Attack Detection Challenge which consists of single-modal (e.g., RGB) and multi-modal (e.g.,
RGB, Depth, Infrared (IR)) tracks around this novel resource to boost research aiming to alleviate
the ethnic bias. Both tracks have attracted $340$ teams in the development stage, and finally 11
and 8 teams have submitted their codes in the single-modal and multi-modal face anti-spoofing recognition
challenges, respectively. All the results were verified and re-ran by the organizing team, and
the results were used for the final ranking. This paper presents an overview of the challenge, including
its design, evaluation protocol and a summary of results. We analyze the top ranked solutions and
draw conclusions derived from the competition. In addition we outline future work directions.
