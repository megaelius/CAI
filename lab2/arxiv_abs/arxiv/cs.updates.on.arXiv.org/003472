This paper derives novel results on the characterization of the the causal information rate-distortion
function (IRDF) $R_{c}^{it}(D)$ for arbitrarily-distributed one-sided stationary $\kappa$-th
order Markov source x(1),x(2),.... It is first shown that Gorbunov and Pinsker's results on the
stationarity of the realizations to the causal IRDF (stated for two-sided stationary sources)
do not apply to the commonly used family of asymptotic average single-letter (AASL) distortion
criteria. Moreover, we show that, in general, a reconstruction sequence cannot be both jointly
stationary with a one-sided stationary source sequence and causally related to it. This implies
that, in general, the causal IRDF for one-sided stationary sources cannot be realized by a stationary
distribution. However, we prove that for an arbitrarily distributed one-sided stationary source
and a large class of distortion criteria (including AASL), the search for $R_{c}^{it}(D)$ can be
restricted to distributions which yield the output sequence y(1), y(2),... jointly stationary
with the source after $\kappa$ samples. Finally, we improve the definition of the stationary causal
IRDF $\overline{R}_{c}^{it}(D)$ previously introduced by Derpich and {\O}stergaard for two-sided
Markovian stationary sources and show that $\overline{R}_{c}^{it}(D)$ for a two-sided source
...,x(-1),x(0),x(1),... equals $R_{c}^{it}(D)$ for the associated one-sided source x(1), x(2),....
This implies that, for the Gaussian quadratic case, the practical zero-delay encoder-decoder
pairs proposed by Derpich and {\O}stergaard for approaching $R_{c}^{it}(D)$ achieve an operational
data rate which exceeds $R_{c}^{it}(D)$ by less than $1+0.5 \log_2(2 \pi e /12) \simeq 1.254$ bits
per sample.
