In this paper, the convergence time of federated learning (FL), when deployed over a realistic wireless
network, is studied. In particular, a wireless network is considered in which wireless users transmit
their local FL models (trained using their locally collected data) to a base station (BS). The BS,
acting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received local FL models and
broadcasts it back to all users. Due to the limited number of resource blocks (RBs) in a wireless network,
only a subset of users can be selected to transmit their local FL model parameters to the BS at each
learning step. Moreover, since each user has unique training data samples, the BS prefers to include
all local user FL models to generate a converged global FL model. Hence, the FL performance and convergence
time will be significantly affected by the user selection scheme. Therefore, it is necessary to
design an appropriate user selection scheme that enables users of higher importance to be selected
more frequently. This joint learning, wireless resource allocation, and user selection problem
is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the FL convergence time while
optimizing the FL performance. To solve this problem, a probabilistic user selection scheme is
proposed such that the BS is connected to the users whose local FL models have significant effects
on its global FL model with high probabilities. Given the user selection policy, the uplink RB allocation
can be determined. To further reduce the FL convergence time, artificial neural networks (ANNs)
are used to estimate the local FL models of the users that are not allocated any RBs for local FL model
transmission at each given learning step, which enables the BS to enhance its global FL model and
improve the FL convergence speed and performance.
