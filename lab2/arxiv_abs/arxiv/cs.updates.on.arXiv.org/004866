The current system to manage the global pool of IP addresses is centralized in five transnational
organizations, the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). Each of these RIRs manage the address
pool for a large number of countries. Because the RIRs are private organizations, they are subject
to the legal framework of the country where they are based. This configuration results in a jurisdictional
overflow from the legal framework of the countries where the RIR is based to all the countries that
the RIRs are serving (the countries served by the RIRs de facto become subjects of the legal system
of the country where the RIR is hosted). The situation is aggravated by the deployment of new security
techniques such as the RPKI and BGPsec, that enable enforcement of allocations by the RIRs. In this
paper we present InBlock, a blockchain-based distributed governance body aimed to provide de-centralized
management of IP addresses. InBlock also aims to fulfil the same objectives as the current IP address
allocation system, namely, uniqueness, fairness, conservation, aggregation, registration
and minimized overhead. InBlock is implemented as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, i.e.,
as a set of blockchain's smart contracts in Ethereum. Any entity may request an allocation of addresses
to the InBlock registry by solely performing a (crypto)currency transfer to the InBlock. The fee
required, along with the annual renewal fee, serves as a mechanism to deter stockpiling and other
wasteful practices. As with any novel technology, there are many open questions about the usage
of blockchains to build an IP address registry. For this reason, we believe that practical experimentation
is required in order to have hands-on experiences about such a system. We propose to conduct an experiment
on distributed address management using InBlock as a starting point to inform future directions
in this area.
