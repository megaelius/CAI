Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious global epidemic in the past few months
and caused huge loss to human society worldwide. For such a large-scale epidemic, early detection
and isolation of potential virus carriers is essential to curb the spread of the epidemic. Recent
studies have shown that one important feature of COVID-19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused
by viral infections. During the epidemic, many people tend to wear masks to reduce the risk of getting
sick. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a portable non-contact method to screen the health condition
of people wearing masks through analysis of the respiratory characteristics. The device mainly
consists of a FLIR one thermal camera and an Android phone. This may help identify those potential
patients of COVID-19 under practical scenarios such as pre-inspection in schools and hospitals.
In this work, we perform the health screening through the combination of the RGB and thermal videos
obtained from the dual-mode camera and deep learning architecture.We first accomplish a respiratory
data capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition. Then, a bidirectional
GRU neural network with attention mechanism is applied to the respiratory data to obtain the health
screening result. The results of validation experiments show that our model can identify the health
status on respiratory with the accuracy of 83.7\% on the real-world dataset. The abnormal respiratory
data and part of normal respiratory data are collected from Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to The Shanghai
Jiao Tong University Medical School. Other normal respiratory data are obtained from healthy people
around our researchers. This work demonstrates that the proposed portable and intelligent health
screening device can be used as a pre-scan method for respiratory infections, which may help fight
the current COVID-19 epidemic.
