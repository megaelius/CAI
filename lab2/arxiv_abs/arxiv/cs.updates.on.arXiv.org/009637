Traditional machine learning based intelligent systems assist users by learning patterns in data
and making recommendations. However, these systems are limited in that the user has little means
of understanding the rationale behind the systems suggestions, communicating their own understanding
of patterns, or correcting system behavior. In this project, we outline a model for intelligent
software based on a human computer feedback loop. The Machine Learning (ML) systems recommendations
are reviewed by the user, and in turn, this information shapes the systems decision making. Our model
was applied to developing an HTML editor that integrates ML with user interaction to ascertain structural
relationships between HTML document features and apply them for code completion. The editor utilizes
the ID3 algorithm to build decision trees, sequences of rules for predicting code the user will type.
The editor displays the decision trees rules in the Interactive Rules Interface System (IRIS),
which allows developers to prioritize, modify, or delete them. These interactions alter the data
processed by ID3, providing the developer some control over the autocomplete system. Validation
indicates that, absent user interaction, the ML model is able to predict tags with 78.4 percent accuracy,
attributes with 62.9 percent accuracy, and values with 12.8 percent accuracy. Based off of the results
of the user study, user interaction with the rules interface corrects feature relationships missed
or mistaken by the automated process, enhancing autocomplete accuracy and developer productivity.
Additionally, interaction is proven to help developers work with greater awareness of code patterns.
Our research demonstrates the viability of a software integration of machine intelligence with
human feedback.
