Supervised learning (SL) has achieved remarkable success in numerous artificial intelligence
applications. In the current literature, by referring to the properties of the ground-truth labels
prepared for a training data set, SL is roughly categorized as fully supervised learning (FSL) and
weakly supervised learning (WSL). However, solutions for various FSL tasks have shown that the
given ground-truth labels are not always learnable, and the target transformation from the given
ground-truth labels to learnable targets can significantly affect the performance of the final
FSL solutions. Without considering the properties of the target transformation from the given
ground-truth labels to learnable targets, the roughness of the FSL category conceals some details
that can be critical to building the optimal solutions for some specific FSL tasks. Thus, it is desirable
to reveal these details. This article attempts to achieve this goal by expanding the categorization
of FSL and investigating the subtype that plays the central role in FSL. Taking into consideration
the properties of the target transformation from the given ground-truth labels to learnable targets,
we first categorize FSL into three narrower subtypes. Then, we focus on the subtype moderately supervised
learning (MSL). MSL concerns the situation where the given ground-truth labels are ideal, but due
to the simplicity in annotation of the given ground-truth labels, careful designs are required
to transform the given ground-truth labels into learnable targets. From the perspectives of definition
and framework, we comprehensively illustrate MSL to reveal what details are concealed by the roughness
of the FSL category. Finally, discussions on the revealed details suggest that MSL should be given
more attention.
