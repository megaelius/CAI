In the travelling thief problem (TTP), a thief undertakes a cyclic tour through a set of cities, and
according to a picking plan, picks a subset of available items into a rented knapsack with limited
capacity. The overall aim is to maximise profit while minimising renting cost. TTP combines two
interdependent components: the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and the knapsack problem (KP).
Existing TTP approaches typically solve the TSP and KP components in an interleaved fashion: the
solution of one component is fixed while the solution of the other is changed. This indicates poor
coordination between solving the two components, which may lead to poor quality TTP solutions.
The 2-OPT heuristic is often used for solving the TSP component, which reverses a segment in the tour.
Within the TTP context, 2-OPT does not take into account the picking plan, which can result in a lower
objective value. This in turn can result in the tour modification to be rejected by a solver. To address
this, we propose an extended form of 2-OPT in order to change the picking plan in coordination with
modifying the tour. Items deemed as less profitable and picked in cities earlier in the reversed
segment are replaced by items that tend to be equally or more profitable and not picked in cities later
in the reversed segment. The picking plan is further changed through a modified form of the bit-flip
search, where changes in the picking state are only permitted for boundary items, which are defined
as lowest profitable picked items or highest profitable unpicked items. This restriction reduces
the amount of time spent on the KP component, allowing more tours to be evaluated by the TSP component
within a given time budget. The two modified heuristics form the basis of a new cooperative coordination
solver, which is shown to outperform several state-of-the-art TTP solvers on a broad range of benchmark
TTP instances.
