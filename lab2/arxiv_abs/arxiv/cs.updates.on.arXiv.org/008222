One of the open problems in scientific computing is the long-time integration of nonlinear stochastic
partial differential equations (SPDEs). We address this problem by taking advantage of recent
advances in scientific machine learning and the dynamically orthogonal (DO) and bi-orthogonal
(BO) methods for representing stochastic processes. Specifically, we propose two new Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving time-dependent SPDEs, namely the NN-DO/BO methods, which
incorporate the DO/BO constraints into the loss function with an implicit form instead of generating
explicit expressions for the temporal derivatives of the DO/BO modes. Hence, the proposed methods
overcome some of the drawbacks of the original DO/BO methods: we do not need the assumption that the
covariance matrix of the random coefficients is invertible as in the original DO method, and we can
remove the assumption of no eigenvalue crossing as in the original BO method. Moreover, the NN-DO/BO
methods can be used to solve time-dependent stochastic inverse problems with the same formulation
and computational complexity as for forward problems. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed
methods via several numerical examples: (1) A linear stochastic advection equation with deterministic
initial condition where the original DO/BO method would fail; (2) Long-time integration of the
stochastic Burgers' equation with many eigenvalue crossings during the whole time evolution where
the original BO method fails. (3) Nonlinear reaction diffusion equation: we consider both the forward
and the inverse problem, including noisy initial data, to investigate the flexibility of the NN-DO/BO
methods in handling inverse and mixed type problems. Taken together, these simulation results
demonstrate that the NN-DO/BO methods can be employed to effectively quantify uncertainty propagation
in a wide range of physical problems.
