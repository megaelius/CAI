Have we become more tolerant of dating people of different social backgrounds compared to ten years
ago? Has the rise of online dating exacerbated or alleviated gender inequalities in modern courtship?
Are the most attractive people on these platforms necessarily the most successful? In this work,
we examine the mate preferences and communication patterns of male and female users of the online
dating site eHarmony over the past decade to identify how attitudes and behaviors have changed over
this time period. While other studies have investigated disparities in user behavior between male
and female users, this study is unique in its longitudinal approach. Specifically, we analyze how
men and women differ in their preferences for certain traits in potential partners and how those
preferences have changed over time. The second line of inquiry investigates to what extent physical
attractiveness determines the rate of messages a user receives, and how this relationship varies
between men and women. Thirdly, we explore whether online dating practices between males and females
have become more equal over time or if biases and inequalities have remained constant (or increased).
Fourthly, we study the behavioural traits in sending and replying to messages based on one's own
experience of receiving messages and being replied to. Finally, we found that similarity between
profiles is not a predictor for success except for the number of children and smoking habits. This
work could have broader implications for shifting gender norms and social attitudes, reflected
in online courtship rituals. Apart from the data-based research, we connect the results to existing
theories that concern the role of ICTs in societal change. As searching for love online becomes increasingly
common across generations and geographies, these findings may shed light on how people can build
relationships through the Internet.
