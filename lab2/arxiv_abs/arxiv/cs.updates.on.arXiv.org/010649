Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) benefits from detection and classification of interference sources
including in-network users, out-network users, and jammers that may all coexist in a wireless network.
We present a deep learning based signal (modulation) classification solution in a realistic wireless
network setting, where 1) signal types may change over time; 2) some signal types may be unknown for
which there is no training data; 3) signals may be spoofed such as the smart jammers replaying other
signal types; and 4) different signal types may be superimposed due to the interference from concurrent
transmissions. For case 1, we apply continual learning and train a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) using an Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) based loss. For case 2, we detect unknown signals
via outlier detection applied to the outputs of convolutional layers using Minimum Covariance
Determinant (MCD) and k-means clustering methods. For case 3, we extend the CNN structure to capture
phase shifts due to radio hardware effects to identify the spoofing signal sources. For case 4, we
apply blind source separation using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate interfering
signals. We utilize the signal classification results in a distributed scheduling protocol, where
in-network (secondary) users employ signal classification scores to make channel access decisions
and share the spectrum with each other while avoiding interference with out-network (primary)
users and jammers. Compared with benchmark TDMA-based schemes, we show that distributed scheduling
constructed upon signal classification results provides major improvements to in-network user
throughput and out-network user success ratio.
