Over the last three decades more then sixty meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed by the
various authors. Such algorithms are inspired from physical phenomena, animal behavior or evolutionary
concepts. These algorithms have been widely used for solving the various real world optimization
problems. Researchers are continuously working to improve the existing algorithms and also proposing
new algorithms that are giving competitive results as compared to the existing algorithms present
in the literature. In this paper a novel meta heuristic algorithm based on military dogs squad is
introduced. The proposed algorithm mimics the searching capability of the trained military dogs.
Military dogs have strong smell senses by which they are able to search the suspicious objects like
bombs, wildlife scats, currency, or blood as well as they can communicate with each other by their
barking. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on 17 benchmark functions and compared
with five other meta-heuristics namely particle swarm optimization (PSO), multiverse optimizer
(MVO), genetic algorithm (GA), probability based learning (PBIL) and evolutionary strategy (ES).
The results are validated in terms of mean and standard deviation of the fitness value. The convergence
behavior and consistency of the results have been also validated by plotting convergence graphs
and BoxPlots. Further the, proposed algorithm is successfully utilized to solve the real world
fake review detection problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
outperforms the other considered algorithms on the majority of performance parameters.
