Video on Demand system over the wireless mobile network is a system that provides video services
to mobile clients.The main problem with these systems is the high service delay where the mobile
clients have to wait to view their favorite movie.The importance of this paper is based on finding
a solution on how to reduce the delay time in the VOD system.This paper introduces a novel caching
mechanism named Proxy Server Cache mechanism to tackle the issue of service delay.This delay happens
when the broadcasting phase that is related to the first segment is missed by a client from the current
broadcasting channels. This delay happens when the broadcasting phase that is related to the first
segment is missed by a client from the current broadcasting channels. The delayed clients will directly
acquire the first segment from the proxy server instead of waiting for the following broadcasting
channel pertaining to the first segment. The proposed scheme ensures obtaining the first segment
from mobile clients when they arrive. Additionally, the performance of the proposed scheme is validated
by applying the VOD system, which can involve the balancing mechanism to retain particular requests
through to the local proxy server to provide a fair dissemination for these requests. The obtained
result confirms that the proposed scheme reduces the time delay of the system in comparison with
the best existing schemes. The results of the average time delay in the Proxy-Cache scheme is 179.2505
milliseconds when 10 clients arrive each minute (Client/minute), the average time delay is 140
milliseconds when the video lengths are 30, 60 and 90. Meanwhile, the failure probability for obtaining
the first segment of the video remains zero when the number of arrived requests is set to 2, 4, 6, 8 and
10.
