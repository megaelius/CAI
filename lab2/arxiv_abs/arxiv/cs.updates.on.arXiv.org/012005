The Lightning Network is a so-called second-layer technology built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain
to provide "off-chain" fast payment channels between users, which means that not all transactions
are settled and stored on the main blockchain. In this paper, we model the emergence of the Lightning
Network as a (bond) percolation process and we explore how the distributional properties of the
volume and size of transactions per user may impact its feasibility. The agents are all able to reciprocally
transfer Bitcoins using the main blockchain and also - if economically convenient - to open a channel
on the Lightning Network and transact "off chain". We base our approach on fitness-dependent network
models: as in real life, a Lightning channel is opened with a probability that depends on the "fitness"
of the concurring nodes, which in turn depends on wealth and volume of transactions. The emergence
of a connected component is studied numerically and analytically as a function of the parameters,
and the phase transition separating regions in the phase space where the Lightning Network is sustainable
or not is elucidated. We characterize the phase diagram determining the minimal volume of transactions
that would make the Lightning Network sustainable for a given level of fees or, alternatively, the
maximal cost the Lightning ecosystem may impose for a given average volume of transactions. The
model includes parameters that could be in principle estimated from publicly available data once
the evolution of the Lighting Network will have reached a stationary operable state, and is fairly
robust against different choices of the distributions of parameters and fitness kernels.
