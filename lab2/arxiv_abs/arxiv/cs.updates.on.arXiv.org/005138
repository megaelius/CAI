The $\textit{\delta-Coin Problem}$ is the computational problem of distinguishing between coins
that are heads with probability $(1+\delta)/2$ or $(1-\delta)/2,$ where $\delta$ is a parameter
tending to $0$. We study this problem's complexity in the model of constant-depth Boolean circuits
and prove the following results. $\textbf{Upper bounds.}$ For any constant $d\geq 2$, we show that
there are $\textit{explicit}$ monotone AC$^0$ formulas (i.e. made up of AND and OR gates only) solving
the $\delta$-coin problem, having depth $d$, size $\exp(O(d(1/\delta)^{1/(d-1)}))$, and sample
complexity (no. of inputs) poly$(1/\delta).$ This matches previous upper bounds of O'Donnell
and Wimmer (ICALP 2007) and Amano (ICALP 2009) in terms of size (which is optimal) and improves the
sample complexity from $\exp(O(d(1/\delta)^{1/(d-1)}))$ to poly$(1/\delta)$. $\textbf{Lower
bounds.}$ We show that the above upper bounds are nearly tight even for the significantly stronger
model of AC$^0[\oplus]$ formulas (i.e. allowing NOT and Parity gates): formally, we show that any
AC$^0[\oplus]$ formula solving the $\delta$-coin problem must have size $\exp(\Omega(d(1/\delta)^{1/(d-1)})).$
This strengthens a result of Cohen, Ganor and Raz (APPROX-RANDOM 2014), who prove a similar result
for AC$^0$, and a result of Shaltiel and Viola (SICOMP 2010), which implies a superpolynomially
weaker (still exponential) lower bound. The above yields the first class of $\textit{explicit}$
functions where we have nearly (up to a polynomial factor) matching upper and lower bounds for the
class of AC$^0[\oplus]$ formulas. In particular, this yields the first $\textit{Fixed-depth
Size-Hierarchy Theorem}$ for the uniform version of this class: our results imply that for any fixed
$d$, the class $\mathcal{C}_{d,k}$ of functions that have uniform AC$^0[\oplus]$ formulas of
depth $d$ and size $n^k$ form an infinite hierarchy.
