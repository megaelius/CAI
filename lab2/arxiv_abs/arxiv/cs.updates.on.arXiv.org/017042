Feature interactions are essential for achieving high accuracy in recommender systems (RS), so
they have been taken into consideration in many existing RS, where all feature interactions are
modeled. Nevertheless, not all feature interactions have positive effects for RS: modeling the
irrelevant feature interactions may introduce noises and degrade the accuracy. To overcome this
problem, in this work, we propose a graph neural network-based model, L0-SIGN, to detect the relevance
of feature interactions and utilize only the relevant ones for RS, with features as nodes and feature
interactions as edges. Generally, our model consists of two components: an L0 regularization based
edge prediction model to explicitly detect relevant feature interactions; and a graph classification
model, SIGN, to effectively model and aggregate the detected ones for recommendations. These two
components positively influence each other to ensure that the most relevant feature interactions
will be detected and modeled. In addition, we further prove that the effectiveness of our model is
theoretically sound. We first show that our model is a variational approximation of information
bottleneck principle, i.e., the detected feature interactions are guaranteed to be most relevant.
We then show that our model follows the definition of statistical interactions, proving that the
modeling of detected feature interactions in L0-SIGN is effective. Experimental results show
that (i) L0-SIGN outperforms existing baselines in terms of accuracy, and (ii) the detected feature
interactions are beneficial for performance gain and interpretability.
