In the past decade, we have seen many successful applications of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
on electronic medical records (EMRs), which contain histories of patients' diagnoses, medications,
and other various events, in order to predict the current and future states of patients. Despite
the strong performance of RNNs, it is often very challenging for users to understand why the model
makes a particular prediction. Such black box nature of RNNs can impede its wide adoption in clinical
practice. Furthermore, we have no established method to interactively leverage users' domain
expertise and prior knowledge as inputs for steering the model. Therefore, our design study aims
to provide a visual analytics solution to increase interpretability and interactivity of RNNs
via a joint effort of medical experts, artificial intelligence scientists, and visual analytics
researchers. Following the iterative design process between the experts, we design, implement,
and evaluate a visual analytics tool called RetainVis, which couples a recently proposed, interpretable
RNN-based model called RETAIN and visualizations for users' exploration of EMR data in the context
of prediction tasks. Our study shows the effective use of RetainVis for gaining insights into how
RNN models EMR data, using real medical records of patients with heart failure, cataract, or dermatological
symptoms. Our study also demonstrates how we made substantial changes to the state-of-the-art
RNN model called RETAIN in order to make use of temporal information and increase interactivity.
This study will provide a useful guideline for researchers who aim to design more interpretable
and interactive visual analytics tool for RNNs.
