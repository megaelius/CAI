Consumer IoT is characterized by heterogeneous devices with diverse functionality and programming
interfaces. This lack of homogeneity makes the integration and security management of IoT infrastructures
a daunting task for users and administrators. In this paper, we introduce VISCR, a Vendor-Independent
policy Specification and Conflict Resolution engine that enables conflict-free policy specification
and enforcement in IoT environments. VISCR converts the topology of the IoT infrastructure into
a tree-based abstraction and translates existing policies from heterogeneous vendor-specific
programming languages such as Groovy-based SmartThings, OpenHAB, IFTTT-based templates, and
MUD-based profiles into a vendor-independent graph-based specification. Using the two, VISCR
can automatically detect rouge policies, conflicts, and bugs for coherent automation. Upon detection,
VISCR infers new policies and proposes them to users as alternatives to existing policies for fine-tuning
and conflict-free enforcement. We evaluated VISCR using a dataset of 907 IoT apps, programmed using
heterogeneous automation specifications in a simulated smart-building IoT infrastructure.
In our experiments, among 907 IoT apps, VISCR exposed 342 of IoT apps as exhibiting one or more violations.
VISCR detected 100% of violations reported by existing state-of-the-art tool, while detecting
new types of violations in an additional 266 apps. In terms of performance, VISCR can generate 400
abstraction trees (used in specifying policies) with 100K leaf nodes in <1.2sec. In our experiments,
VISCR took 80.7 seconds to analyze our infrastructure of 907 apps; a 14.2X reduction compared to
the state-of-the-art. After the initial analysis, VISCR is capable of adopting new policies in
sub-second latency to handle changes.
