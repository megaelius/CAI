Heterogeneous face recognition is a challenging task due to the large modality discrepancy and
insufficient cross-modal samples. Most existing works focus on discriminative feature transformation,
metric learning and cross-modal face synthesis. However, the fact that cross-modal faces are always
coupled by domain (modality) and identity information has received little attention. Therefore,
how to learn and utilize the domain-private feature and domain-agnostic feature for modality adaptive
face recognition is the focus of this work. Specifically, this paper proposes a Feature Aggregation
Network (FAN), which includes disentangled representation module (DRM), feature fusion module
(FFM) and adaptive penalty metric (APM) learning session. First, in DRM, two subnetworks, i.e.
domain-private network and domain-agnostic network are specially designed for learning modality
features and identity features, respectively. Second, in FFM, the identity features are fused
with domain features to achieve cross-modal bi-directional identity feature transformation,
which, to a large extent, further disentangles the modality information and identity information.
Third, considering that the distribution imbalance between easy and hard pairs exists in cross-modal
datasets, which increases the risk of model bias, the identity preserving guided metric learning
with adaptive hard pairs penalization is proposed in our FAN. The proposed APM also guarantees the
cross-modality intra-class compactness and inter-class separation. Extensive experiments
on benchmark cross-modal face datasets show that our FAN outperforms SOTA methods.
