We study two fundamental problems dealing with curves in the plane, namely, the nearest-neighbor
problem and the center problem. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a set of $n$ polygonal curves, each of size $m$.
In the nearest-neighbor problem, the goal is to construct a compact data structure over $\mathcal{C}$,
such that, given a query curve $Q$, one can efficiently find the curve in $\mathcal{C}$ closest to
$Q$. In the center problem, the goal is to find a curve $Q$, such that the maximum distance between
$Q$ and the curves in $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized. We use the well-known discrete Frechet distance
function, both under~$L_\infty$ and under $L_2$, to measure the distance between two curves. For
the nearest-neighbor problem, despite discouraging previous results, we identify two important
cases for which it is possible to obtain practical bounds, even when $m$ and $n$ are large. In these
cases, either $Q$ is a line segment or $\mathcal{C}$ consists of line segments, and the bounds on
the size of the data structure and query time are nearly linear in the size of the input and query curve,
respectively. The returned answer is either exact under $L_\infty$, or approximated to within
a factor of $1+\varepsilon$ under~$L_2$. We also consider the variants in which the location of
the input curves is only fixed up to translation, and obtain similar bounds, under $L_\infty$. As
for the center problem, we study the case where the center is a line segment, i.e., we seek the line
segment that represents the given set as well as possible. We present near-linear time exact algorithms
under $L_\infty$, even when the location of the input curves is only fixed up to translation. Under
$L_2$, we present a roughly $O(n^2m^3)$-time exact algorithm.
