When trying to maximize the adoption of a behavior in a population connected by a social network,
it is common to strategize about where in the network to seed the behavior, often with an element of
randomness. Selecting seeds uniformly at random is a basic but compelling strategy in that it distributes
seeds broadly throughout the network. A more sophisticated stochastic strategy, one-hop targeting,
is to select random network neighbors of random individuals; this exploits a version of the friendship
paradox, whereby the friend of a random individual is expected to have more friends than a random
individual, with the hope that seeding a behavior at more connected individuals leads to more adoption.
Many seeding strategies have been proposed, but empirical evaluations have demanded large field
experiments designed specifically for this purpose and have yielded relatively imprecise comparisons
of strategies. Here we show how stochastic seeding strategies can be evaluated more efficiently
in such experiments, how they can be evaluated "off-policy" using existing data arising from experiments
designed for other purposes, and how to design more efficient experiments. In particular, we consider
contrasts between stochastic seeding strategies and analyze nonparametric estimators adapted
from policy evaluation and importance sampling. We use simulations on real networks to show that
the proposed estimators and designs can dramatically increase precision while yielding valid
inference. We then apply our proposed estimators to two field experiments, one that assigned households
to an intensive marketing intervention and one that assigned students to an anti-bullying intervention.
