From virtual reality and telepresence, to augmented reality, holoportation, and remotely controlled
robotics, these future network applications promise an unprecedented development for society,
economics and culture by revolutionizing the way we live, learn, work and play. In order to deploy
such futuristic applications and to cater to their performance requirements, recent trends stressed
the need for the Tactile Internet, an Internet that, according to the International Telecommunication
Union, combines ultra low latency with extremely high availability, reliability and security.
Unfortunately, today's Internet falls short when it comes to providing such stringent requirements
due to several fundamental limitations in the design of the current network architecture and communication
protocols. This brings the need to rethink the network architecture and protocols, and efficiently
harness recent technological advances in terms of virtualization and network softwarization
to design the Tactile Internet of the future. In this paper, we start by analyzing the characteristics
and requirements of future networking applications. We then highlight the limitations of the traditional
network architecture and protocols and their inability to cater to these requirements. Afterward,
we put forward a novel network architecture adapted to the Tactile Internet called FlexNGIA, a Flexible
Next-Generation Internet Architecture. We then describe some use-cases where we discuss the potential
mechanisms and control loops that could be offered by FlexNGIA in order to ensure the required performance
and reliability guarantees for future applications. Finally, we identify the key research challenges
to further develop FlexNGIA towards a full-fledged architecture for the future Tactile Internet.
