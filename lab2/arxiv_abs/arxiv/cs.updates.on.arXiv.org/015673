3GPP has recently introduced NB-IoT, a new mobile communication standard offering a robust and
energy efficient connectivity option to the rapidly expanding market of Internet of Things (IoT)
devices. To unleash its full potential, end-devices are expected to work in a plug and play fashion,
with zero or minimal parameters configuration, still exhibiting excellent energy efficiency.
We perform the most comprehensive set of empirical measurements with commercial IoT devices and
different operators to date, quantifying the impact of several parameters to energy consumption.
Our campaign proves that parameters setting does impact energy consumption, so proper configuration
is necessary. We shed light on this aspect by first illustrating how the nominal standard operational
modes map into real current consumption patterns of NB-IoT devices. Further, we investigate which
device reported metadata metrics better reflect performance and implement an algorithm to automatically
identify device state in current time series logs. Then, we provide a measurement-driven analysis
of the energy consumption and network performance of two popular NB-IoT boards under different
parameter configurations and with two major western European operators. We observed that energy
consumption is mostly affected by the paging interval in Connected state, set by the base station.
However, not all operators correctly implement such settings. Furthermore, under the default
configuration, energy consumption in not strongly affected by packet size nor by signal quality,
unless it is extremely bad. Our observations indicate that simple modifications to the default
parameters settings can yield great energy savings.
