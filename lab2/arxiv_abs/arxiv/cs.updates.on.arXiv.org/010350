Deep neural network (DNN) quantization converting floating-point (FP) data in the network to integers
(INT) is an effective way to shrink the model size for memory saving and simplify the operations for
compute acceleration. Recently, researches on DNN quantization develop from inference to training,
laying a foundation for the online training on accelerators. However, existing schemes leaving
batch normalization (BN) untouched during training are mostly incomplete quantization that still
adopts high precision FP in some parts of the data paths. Currently, there is no solution that can
use only low bit-width INT data during the whole training process of large-scale DNNs with acceptable
accuracy. In this work, through decomposing all the computation steps in DNNs and fusing three special
quantization functions to satisfy the different precision requirements, we propose a unified
complete quantization framework termed as "WAGEUBN" to quantize DNNs involving all data paths
including W (Weights), A (Activation), G (Gradient), E (Error), U (Update), and BN. Moreover, the
Momentum optimizer is also quantized to realize a completely quantized framework. Experiments
on ResNet18/34/50 models demonstrate that WAGEUBN can achieve competitive accuracy on ImageNet
dataset. For the first time, the study of quantization in large-scale DNNs is advanced to the full
8-bit INT level. In this way, all the operations in the training and inference can be bit-wise operations,
pushing towards faster processing speed, decreased memory cost, and higher energy efficiency.
Our throughout quantization framework has great potential for future efficient portable devices
with online learning ability.
