Recent work in decentralized, schedule-driven traffic control has demonstrated the ability to
significantly improve traffic flow efficiency in complex urban road networks. However, in situations
where vehicle volumes increase to the point that the physical capacity of a road network reaches
or exceeds saturation, it has been observed that the effectiveness of a schedule-driven approach
begins to degrade, leading to progressively higher network congestion. In essence, the traffic
control problem becomes less of a scheduling problem and more of a queue management problem in this
circumstance. In this paper we propose a composite approach to real-time traffic control that uses
sensed information on queue lengths to influence scheduling decisions and gracefully shift the
signal control strategy to queue management in high volume/high congestion settings. Specifically,
queue-length information is used to establish weights for the sensed vehicle clusters that must
be scheduled through a given intersection at any point, and hence bias the wait time minimization
calculation. To compute these weights, we develop a model in which successive movement phases are
viewed as different states of an Ising model, and parameters quantify strength of interactions.
To ensure scalability, queue information is only exchanged between direct neighbors and the asynchronous
nature of local intersection scheduling is preserved. We demonstrate the potential of the approach
through microscopic traffic simulation of a real-world road network, showing a 60% reduction in
average wait times over the baseline schedule-driven approach in heavy traffic scenarios. We also
report initial field test results, which show the ability to reduce queues during heavy traffic
periods.
