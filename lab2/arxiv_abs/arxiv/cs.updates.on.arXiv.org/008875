Increasingly large trip demands have strained urban transportation capacity, which consequently
leads to traffic congestion. In this work, we focus on mitigating traffic congestion by incentivizing
passengers to switch from private to public transit services. We address the following challenges.
First, the passengers incur inconvenience costs when participating in traffic offload due to delay
and discomfort, and thus need to be reimbursed. The inconvenience cost, however, is unknown to the
government when choosing the incentives. Furthermore, participating in traffic offload raises
privacy concerns from passengers. An adversary could infer personal information, (e.g., daily
routine, region of interest, and wealth), by observing the decisions made by the government, which
are known to the public. We adopt the concept of differential privacy and propose privacy-preserving
incentive designs under two settings, denoted as two-way communication and one-way communication.
Under two-way communication, we focus on how the government should reveal passengers' inconvenience
costs to properly incentivize them while preserving differential privacy. We formulate the problem
as a mixed integer linear program, and propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm. We show
the proposed approach achieves truthfulness, individual rationality, social optimality, and
differential privacy. Under one-way communication, we focus on how the government should design
the incentives without revealing passengers' inconvenience costs while still preserving differential
privacy. We formulate the problem as a convex program, and propose a differentially private and
near-optimal solution algorithm. A numerical case study using Caltrans Performance Measurement
System (PeMS) data source is presented as evaluation.
