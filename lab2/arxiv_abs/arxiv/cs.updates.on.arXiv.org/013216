Quantum Bridge Analytics relates to methods and systems for hybrid classical-quantum computing,
and is devoted to developing tools for bridging classical and quantum computing to gain the benefits
of their alliance in the present and enable enhanced practical application of quantum computing
in the future. This is the second of a two-part tutorial that surveys key elements of Quantum Bridge
Analytics and its applications. Part I focused on the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) model which is presently the most widely applied optimization model in the quantum computing
area, and which unifies a rich variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Part II (the present
paper) examines an application that augments the use of QUBO models, by disclosing a context for
coordinating QUBO solutions through a model we call the Asset Exchange Problem (AEP). Solutions
to the AEP enable individuals or institutions to take fuller advantage of solutions to their QUBO
models by exchanges of assets that benefit all participants. Such exchanges are generated by a combination
of two optimization technologies, one grounded in network optimization and one based on a new metaheuristic
optimization approach called combinatorial chaining. This combination provides a flexibility
to solve AEP variants that open the door to additional links to quantum computing applications and
additional applications via the Quantum Bridge Analytics perspective. We show how this modeling
and solution capability gives rise to an Asset Exchange Technology that embraces a broad range of
financial, industrial, scientific and social settings. Examples are presented that show the nature
of these processes from a tutorial perspective.
