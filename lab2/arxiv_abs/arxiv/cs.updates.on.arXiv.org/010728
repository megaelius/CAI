This study investigates the use of reinforcement learning to guide a general purpose cache manager
decisions. Cache managers directly impact the overall performance of computer systems. They govern
decisions about which objects should be cached, the duration they should be cached for, and decides
on which objects to evict from the cache if it is full. These three decisions impact both the cache
hit rate and size of the storage that is needed to achieve that cache hit rate. An optimal cache manager
will avoid unnecessary operations, maximise the cache hit rate which results in fewer round trips
to a slower backend storage system, and minimise the size of storage needed to achieve a high hit-rate.
This project investigates using reinforcement learning in cache management by designing three
separate agents for each of the cache manager tasks. Furthermore, the project investigates two
advanced reinforcement learning architectures for multi-decision problems: a single multi-task
agent and a multi-agent. We also introduce a framework to simplify the modelling of computer systems
problems as a reinforcement learning task. The framework abstracts delayed experiences observations
and reward assignment in computer systems while providing a flexible way to scale to multiple agents.
Simulation results based on an established database benchmark system show that reinforcement
learning agents can achieve a higher cache hit rate over heuristic driven algorithms while minimising
the needed space. They are also able to adapt to a changing workload and dynamically adjust their
caching strategy accordingly. The proposed cache manager model is generic and applicable to other
types of caches, such as file system caches. This project is the first, to our knowledge, to model
cache manager decisions as a multi-task control problem.
