We present a trichotomy theorem for the quantum query complexity of regular languages. Every regular
language has quantum query complexity Theta(1), ~Theta(sqrt n), or Theta(n). The extreme uniformity
of regular languages prevents them from taking any other asymptotic complexity. This is in contrast
to even the context-free languages, which we show can have query complexity Theta(n^c) for all computable
c in [1/2,1]. Our result implies an equivalent trichotomy for the approximate degree of regular
languages, and a dichotomy--either Theta(1) or Theta(n)--for sensitivity, block sensitivity,
certificate complexity, deterministic query complexity, and randomized query complexity. The
heart of the classification theorem is an explicit quantum algorithm which decides membership
in any star-free language in ~O(sqrt n) time. This well-studied family of the regular languages
admits many interesting characterizations, for instance, as those languages expressible as sentences
in first-order logic over the natural numbers with the less-than relation. Therefore, not only
do the star-free languages capture functions such as OR, they can also express functions such as
"there exist a pair of 2's such that everything between them is a 0." Thus, we view the algorithm for
star-free languages as a nontrivial generalization of Grover's algorithm which extends the quantum
quadratic speedup to a much wider range of string-processing algorithms than was previously known.
We show applications to problems such as evaluating dynamic constant-depth Boolean formulas and
recognizing balanced parentheses nested constantly many levels deep.
