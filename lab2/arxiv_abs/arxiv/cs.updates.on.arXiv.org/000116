We consider time-space tradeoffs for exactly computing frequency moments and order statistics
over sliding windows. Given an input of length 2n-1, the task is to output the function of each window
of length n, giving n outputs in total. Computations over sliding windows are related to direct sum
problems except that inputs to instances almost completely overlap. We show an average case and
randomized time-space tradeoff lower bound of TS in Omega(n^2) for multi-way branching programs,
and hence standard RAM and word-RAM models, to compute the number of distinct elements, F_0, in sliding
windows over alphabet [n]. The same lower bound holds for computing the low-order bit of F_0 and computing
any frequency moment F_k for k not equal to 1. We complement this lower bound with a TS in \tilde O(n^2)
deterministic RAM algorithm for exactly computing F_k in sliding windows. We show time-space separations
between the complexity of sliding-window element distinctness and that of sliding-window $F_0\bmod
2$ computation. In particular for alphabet [n] there is a very simple errorless sliding-window
algorithm for element distinctness that runs in O(n) time on average and uses O(log{n}) space. We
show that any algorithm for a single element distinctness instance can be extended to an algorithm
for the sliding-window version of element distinctness with at most a polylogarithmic increase
in the time-space product. Finally, we show that the sliding-window computation of order statistics
such as the maximum and minimum can be computed with only a logarithmic increase in time, but that
a TS in Omega(n^2) lower bound holds for sliding-window computation of order statistics such as
the median, a nearly linear increase in time when space is small.
