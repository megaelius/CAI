When analyzing complex networks a key target is to uncover their modular structure, which means
searching for a family of modules, namely node subsets spanning each a subnetwork more densely connected
than the average. This work proposes a novel type of objective function for graph clustering, in
the form of a multilinear polynomial whose coefficients are determined by network topology. It
may be thought of as a potential function, to be maximized, taking its values on fuzzy clusterings
or families of fuzzy subsets of nodes over which every node distributes a unit membership. When suitably
parametrized, this potential is shown to attain its maximum when every node concentrates its all
unit membership on some module. The output thus is a partition, while the original discrete optimization
problem is turned into a continuous version allowing to conceive alternative search strategies.
The instance of the problem being a pseudo-Boolean function assigning real-valued cluster scores
to node subsets, modularity maximization is employed to exemplify a so-called quadratic form,
in that the scores of singletons and pairs also fully determine the scores of larger clusters, while
the resulting multilinear polynomial potential function has degree 2. After considering further
quadratic instances, different from modularity and obtained by interpreting network topology
in alternative manners, a greedy local-search strategy for the continuous framework is analytically
compared with an existing greedy agglomerative procedure for the discrete case. Overlapping is
finally discussed in terms of multiple runs, i.e. several local searches with different initializations.
