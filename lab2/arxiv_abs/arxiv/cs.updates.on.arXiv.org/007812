Limited bandwidth resources and higher energy efficiency requirements motivate incorporating
multicast and broadcast transmission into the next-generation cellular network architectures,
particularly for multimedia streaming applications. Layered division multiplexing (LDM), a
form of NOMA, can potentially improve unicast throughput and broadcast coverage with respect to
traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (FDM) or time division multiplexing
(TDM), by simultaneously using the same frequency and time resources for multiple unicast or broadcast
transmissions. In this paper, the performance of LDM-based unicast and broadcast transmission
in a cellular network is studied by assuming a single frequency network (SFN) operation for the broadcast
layer, while allowing arbitrarily clustered cooperation among the base stations (BSs) for the
transmission of unicast data streams. Beamforming and power allocation between unicast and broadcast
layers, the so-called injection level in the LDM literature, are optimized with the aim of minimizing
the sum-power under constraints on the user-specific unicast rates and on the common broadcast
rate. The effects of imperfect channel coding and imperfect CSI are also studied to gain insights
into robust implementation in practical systems. The non-convex optimization problem is tackled
by means of successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Performance upper bounds are also
presented by means of the $\rm{S}$-procedure followed by semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Finally,
a dual decomposition-based solution is proposed to facilitate an efficient distributed implementation
of LDM where the optimal unicast beamforming vectors can be obtained locally by the cooperating
BSs. Numerical results are presented, which show the tightness of the proposed bounds and hence
the near-optimality of the proposed solutions.
