In this letter, we propose a novel technique for obtaining scattering components from Polarimetric
Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data using the geodesic distance on the unit sphere. This geodesic
distance is obtained between an elementary target and the observed Kennaugh matrix, and it is further
utilized to compute a similarity measure between scattering mechanisms. The normalized similarity
measure for each elementary target is then modulated with the total scattering power (Span). This
measure is used to categorize pixels into three categories i.e. odd-bounce, double-bounce and
volume, depending on which of the above scattering mechanisms dominate. Then the maximum likelihood
classifier of [J.-S. Lee, M. R. Grunes, E. Pottier, and L. Ferro-Famil, Unsupervised terrain classification
preserving polarimetric scattering characteristics, IEEE Trans. Geos. Rem. Sens., vol. 42, no.
4, pp. 722731, April 2004.] based on the complex Wishart distribution is iteratively used for each
category. Dominant scattering mechanisms are thus preserved in this classification scheme. We
show results for L-band AIRSAR and ALOS-2 datasets acquired over San Francisco and Mumbai, respectively.
The scattering mechanisms are better preserved using the proposed methodology than the unsupervised
classification results using the Freeman-Durden scattering powers on an orientation angle (OA)
corrected PolSAR image. Furthermore, (1) the scattering similarity is a completely non-negative
quantity unlike the negative powers that might occur in double- bounce and odd-bounce scattering
component under Freeman Durden decomposition (FDD), and (2) the methodology can be extended to
more canonical targets as well as for bistatic scattering.
