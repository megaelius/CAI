Business process simulation is a versatile technique for analyzing business processes from a quantitative
perspective. A well-known limitation of process simulation is that the accuracy of the simulation
results is limited by the faithfulness of the process model and simulation parameters given as input
to the simulator. To tackle this limitation, several authors have proposed to discover simulation
models from process execution logs so that the resulting simulation models more closely match reality.
Existing techniques in this field assume that each resource in the process performs one task at a
time. In reality, however, resources may engage in multitasking behavior. Traditional simulation
approaches do not handle multitasking. Instead, they rely on a resource allocation approach wherein
a task instance is only assigned to a resource when the resource is free. This inability to handle
multitasking leads to an overestimation of execution times. This paper proposes an approach to
discover multitasking in business process execution logs and to generate a simulation model that
takes into account the discovered multitasking behavior. The key idea is to adjust the processing
times of tasks in such a way that executing the multitasked tasks sequentially with the adjusted
times is equivalent to executing them concurrently with the original processing times. The proposed
approach is evaluated using a real-life dataset and synthetic datasets with different levels of
multitasking. The results show that, in the presence of multitasking, the approach improves the
accuracy of simulation models discovered from execution logs.
