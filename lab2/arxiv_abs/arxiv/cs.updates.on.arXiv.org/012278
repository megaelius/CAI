The thesis contributes in several important ways to the research area of 3D object category learning
and recognition. To cope with the mentioned limitations, we look at human cognition, in particular
at the fact that human beings learn to recognize object categories ceaselessly over time. This ability
to refine knowledge from the set of accumulated experiences facilitates the adaptation to new environments.
Inspired by this capability, we seek to create a cognitive object perception and perceptual learning
architecture that can learn 3D object categories in an open-ended fashion. In this context, ``open-ended''
implies that the set of categories to be learned is not known in advance, and the training instances
are extracted from actual experiences of a robot, and thus become gradually available, rather than
being available since the beginning of the learning process. In particular, this architecture
provides perception capabilities that will allow robots to incrementally learn object categories
from the set of accumulated experiences and reason about how to perform complex tasks. This framework
integrates detection, tracking, teaching, learning, and recognition of objects. An extensive
set of systematic experiments, in multiple experimental settings, was carried out to thoroughly
evaluate the described learning approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed system
is able to interact with human users, learn new object categories over time, as well as perform complex
tasks. The contributions presented in this thesis have been fully implemented and evaluated on
different standard object and scene datasets and empirically evaluated on different robotic platforms.
