The demand for global video has been burgeoning across industries. With the expansion and improvement
of video-streaming services, cloud-based video is evolving into a necessary feature of any successful
business for reaching internal and external audiences. This paper considers video streaming over
distributed systems where the video segments are encoded using an erasure code for better reliability
thus being the first work to our best knowledge that considers video streaming over erasure-coded
distributed cloud systems. The download time of each coded chunk of each video segment is characterized
and ordered statistics over the choice of the erasure-coded chunks is used to obtain the playback
time of different video segments. Using the playback times, bounds on the moment generating function
on the stall duration is used to bound the mean stall duration. Moment generating function based
bounds on the ordered statistics are also used to bound the stall duration tail probability which
determines the probability that the stall time is greater than a pre-defined number. These two metrics,
mean stall duration and the stall duration tail probability, are important quality of experience
(QoE) measures for the end users. Based on these metrics, we formulate an optimization problem to
jointly minimize the convex combination of both the QoE metrics averaged over all requests over
the placement and access of the video content. The non-convex problem is solved using an efficient
iterative algorithm. Numerical results show significant improvement in QoE metrics for cloud-based
video as compared to the considered baselines.
