In recent years, the volume of the commercial mobile robot market has been continuously growing
due to the maturity of both hardware and software technology. To build commercial robots, skid-steering
mechanical design is of increased popularity due to its manufacturing simplicity and unique hardware
properties. However, this causes challenges on software and algorithm design, especially for
localization (i.e., determining the robot's rotation and position). While the general localization
algorithms have been extensively studied in research communities, there are still fundamental
problems that need to be resolved for localizing skid-steering robots. To tackle this problem,
we propose a probabilistic sliding-window estimator dedicated to skid-steering robots, using
measurements from a monocular camera, the wheel encoders, and optionally an inertial measurement
unit (IMU). Specifically, we explicitly model the kinematics of skid-steering robots by both track
instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) and correction factors, which are capable of compensating
for the complexity of track-to-terrain interaction, the imperfectness of mechanical design,
terrain conditions and smoothness, and so on. These time and location varying kinematic parameters
are estimated online along with other localization states in a tightly-coupled manner. More importantly,
we conduct in-depth observability analysis for different sensors and design configurations in
this paper, which provides us with theoretical tools in making the correct choice when building
real commercial robots. In our experiments, we validate the proposed method by both simulation
tests and real-world experiments, which demonstrate that our method outperforms competing methods
by wide margins.
