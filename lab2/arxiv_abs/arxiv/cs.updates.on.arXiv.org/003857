We introduce two new "degree of complementarity" measures, which we refer to, respectively, as
supermodular width and superadditive width. Both are formulated based on natural witnesses of
complementarity. We show that both measures are robust by proving that they, respectively, characterize
the gap of monotone set functions from being submodular and subadditive. Thus, they define two new
hierarchies over monotone set functions, which we will refer to as Supermodular Width (SMW) hierarchy
and Superadditive Width (SAW) hierarchy, with level 0 of the hierarchies resting exactly on submodular
and subadditive functions, respectively. We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of
the SMW hierarchy and the Supermodular Degree (SD) hierarchy, defined by Feige and Izsak. We prove
that the SMW hierarchy is strictly more expressive than the SD hierarchy. We show that previous results
regarding approximation guarantees for welfare and constrained maximization as well as regarding
the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of simple auctions can be extended without any loss from the SD hierarchy
to the SMW hierarchy. We also establish almost matching information-theoretical lower bounds.
The combination of these approximation and hardness results illustrate that the SMW hierarchy
provides an accurate characterization of "near submodularity" needed for maximization approximation.
While SD and SMW hierarchies support nontrivial bounds on the PoA of simple auctions, we show that
our SAW hierarchy seems to capture more intrinsic properties needed to realize the efficiency of
simple auctions. So far, the SAW hierarchy provides the best dependency for the PoA of Single-bid
Auction, and is nearly as competitive as the Maximum over Positive Hypergraphs (MPH) hierarchy
for Simultaneous Item First Price Auction (SIA). We provide almost tight lower bounds for the PoA
of both auctions with respect to the SAW hierarchy.
