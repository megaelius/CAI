Effective debugging of ontologies is an important prerequisite for their broad application, especially
in areas that rely on everyday users to create and maintain knowledge bases, such as the Semantic
Web. In such systems ontologies capture formalized vocabularies of terms shared by its users. However
in many cases users have different local views of the domain, i.e. of the context in which a given term
is used. Inappropriate usage of terms together with natural complications when formulating and
understanding logical descriptions may result in faulty ontologies. Recent ontology debugging
approaches use diagnosis methods to identify causes of the faults. In most debugging scenarios
these methods return many alternative diagnoses, thus placing the burden of fault localization
on the user. This paper demonstrates how the target diagnosis can be identified by performing a sequence
of observations, that is, by querying an oracle about entailments of the target ontology. To identify
the best query we propose two query selection strategies: a simple "split-in-half" strategy and
an entropy-based strategy. The latter allows knowledge about typical user errors to be exploited
to minimize the number of queries. Our evaluation showed that the entropy-based method significantly
reduces the number of required queries compared to the "split-in-half" approach. We experimented
with different probability distributions of user errors and different qualities of the a-priori
probabilities. Our measurements demonstrated the superiority of entropy-based query selection
even in cases where all fault probabilities are equal, i.e. where no information about typical user
errors is available.
