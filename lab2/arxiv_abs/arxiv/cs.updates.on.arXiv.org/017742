Face super-resolution has become an indispensable part in security problems such as video surveillance
and identification system, but the distortion in facial components is a main obstacle to overcoming
the problems. To alleviate it, most stateof-the-arts have utilized facial priors by using deep
networks. These methods require extra labels, longer training time, and larger computation memory.
Thus, we propose a novel Edge and Identity Preserving Network for Face Super-Resolution Network,
named as EIPNet, which minimizes the distortion by utilizing a lightweight edge block and identity
information. Specifically, the edge block extracts perceptual edge information and concatenates
it to original feature maps in multiple scales. This structure progressively provides edge information
in reconstruction procedure to aggregate local and global structural information. Moreover,
we define an identity loss function to preserve identification of super-resolved images. The identity
loss function compares feature distributions between super-resolved images and target images
to solve unlabeled classification problem. In addition, we propose a Luminance-Chrominance Error
(LCE) to expand usage of image representation domain. The LCE method not only reduces the dependency
of color information by dividing brightness and color components but also facilitates our network
to reflect differences between Super-Resolution (SR) and High- Resolution (HR) images in multiple
domains (RGB and YUV). The proposed methods facilitate our super-resolution network to elaborately
restore facial components and generate enhanced 8x scaled super-resolution images with a lightweight
network structure.
