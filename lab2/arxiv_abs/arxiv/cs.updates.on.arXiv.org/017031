Motivation: One of the branches of Systems Biology is focused on a deep understanding of underlying
regulatory networks through the analysis of the biomolecules oscillations and their interplay.
Synthetic Biology exploits gene or/and protein regulatory networks towards the design of oscillatory
networks for producing useful compounds. Therefore, at different levels of application and for
different purposes, the study of biomolecular oscillations can lead to different clues about the
mechanisms underlying living cells. It is known that network-level interactions involve more
than one type of biomolecule as well as biological processes operating at multiple omic levels.
Combining network/pathway-level information with genetic information it is possible to describe
well-understood or unknown bacterial mechanisms and organism-specific dynamics. Results: Network
multi-omic integration has led to the discovery of interesting oscillatory signals. Following
the methodologies used in signal processing and communication engineering, a new methodology
is introduced to identify and quantify the extent of the multi-omic oscillations of the signal.
New signal metrics are designed to allow further biotechnological explanations and provide important
clues about the oscillatory nature of the pathways and their regulatory circuits. Our algorithms
designed for the analysis of multi-omic signals are tested and validated on 11 different bacteria
for thousands of multi-omic signals perturbed at the network level by different experimental conditions.
Information on the order of genes, codon usage, gene expression, and protein molecular weight is
integrated at three different functional levels. Oscillations show interesting evidence that
network-level multi-omic signals present a synchronized response to perturbations and evolutionary
relations along with taxa.
