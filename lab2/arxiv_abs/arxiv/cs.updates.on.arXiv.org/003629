Face recognition (FR) is one of the most extensively investigated problems in computer vision.
Significant progress in FR has been made due to the recent introduction of the larger scale FR challenges,
particularly with constrained social media web images, e.g. high-resolution photos of celebrity
faces taken by professional photo-journalists. However, the more challenging FR in unconstrained
and low-resolution surveillance images remains largely under-studied. To facilitate more studies
on developing FR models that are effective and robust for low-resolution surveillance facial images,
we introduce a new Surveillance Face Recognition Challenge, which we call the QMUL-SurvFace benchmark.
This new benchmark is the largest and more importantly the only true surveillance FR benchmark to
our best knowledge, where low-resolution images are not synthesised by artificial under-sampling
of native high-resolution images. This challenge contains 463,507 face images of 15,573 distinct
identities captured in real-world uncooperative surveillance scenes over wide space and time.
As a consequence, it presents an extremely challenging FR benchmark. We benchmark the FR performance
on this challenge using five representative deep learning face recognition models, in comparison
to existing benchmarks. We show that the current state of the arts are still far from being satisfactory
to tackle the under-investigated surveillance FR problem in practical forensic scenarios. Face
recognition is generally more difficult in an open-set setting which is typical for surveillance
scenarios, owing to a large number of non-target people (distractors) appearing open spaced scenes.
This is evidently so that on the new Surveillance FR Challenge, the top-performing CentreFace deep
learning FR model on the MegaFace benchmark can now only achieve 13.2% success rate (at Rank-20)
at a 10% false alarm rate.
