A variety of modeling techniques have been developed in the past decade to reduce the computational
expense and improve the accuracy of modeling. In this study, a new framework of modeling is suggested.
Compared with other popular methods, a distinctive characteristic is "from image based model to
analysis based model (e.g. stress, strain, and deformation)". In such a framework, a reconstruction
neural network (ReConNN) model designed for simulation-based physical field's reconstruction
is proposed. The ReConNN contains two submodels that are convolutional neural network (CNN) and
generative adversarial net-work (GAN). The CNN is employed to construct the mapping between contour
images of physical field and objective function. Subsequently, the GAN is utilized to generate
more images which are similar to the existing contour images. Finally, Lagrange polynomial is applied
to complete the reconstruction. However, the existing CNN models are commonly applied to the classification
tasks, which seem to be difficult to handle with regression tasks of images. Meanwhile, the existing
GAN architectures are insufficient to generate high-accuracy "pseudo contour images". Therefore,
a ReConNN model based on a Convolution in Convolution (CIC) and a Convolutional AutoEncoder based
on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN-CAE) is suggested. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed model representatively, a classical topology optimization procedure is considered.
Then the ReConNN is utilized to the reconstruction of heat transfer process of a pin fin heat sink.
It demonstrates that the proposed ReConNN model is proved to be a potential capability to reconstruct
physical field for multidisciplinary, such as structural optimization.
