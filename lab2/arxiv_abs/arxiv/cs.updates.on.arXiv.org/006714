Integrity constraints such as functional dependences (FD), and multi-valued dependences are
fundamental in database schema design. Likewise, probabilistic conditional independences (CI)
are crucial for reasoning about multivariate probability distributions. The implication problem
studies whether a set of constraints (antecedents) implies another constraint (consequent),
and has been investigated in both the database and the AI literature, under the assumption that all
constraints hold exactly. However, many applications today consider constraints that hold only
approximately. In this paper we define an approximate implication as a linear inequality between
the degree of satisfaction of the antencedents and consequent, and we study the em relaxation problem:
when does an exact implication relax to an approximate implication? We use information theory to
define the degree of satisfaction, and prove several results. First, we show that any implication
between FDs can be relaxed to a simple linear inequality where all coefficients are 1; we call it a
unit relaxation. Second, we prove that there exists an implication between CIs that does not admit
any relaxation; however, we prove that every implication between CI's relaxes "in the limit". Third,
we restrict the information theoretic inequalities to Shannon-inequalities, and show that in
that case the implication problem between CIs has a unit relaxation (under some additional assumptions).
Finally, we relax the information theoretic inequalities to rank-inequalities, and show that
under certain restrictions to the antecedents and consequent, every implication problem between
CI's has a unit relaxation.
