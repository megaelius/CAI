We present a preference learning framework for multiple criteria sorting. We consider sorting
procedures applying an additive value model with diverse types of marginal value functions (including
linear, piecewise-linear, splined, and general monotone ones) under a unified analytical framework.
Differently from the existing sorting methods that infer a preference model from crisp decision
examples, where each reference alternative is assigned to a unique class, our framework allows
to consider valued assignment examples in which a reference alternative can be classified into
multiple classes with respective credibility degrees. We propose an optimization model for constructing
a preference model from such valued examples by maximizing the credible consistency among reference
alternatives. To improve the predictive ability of the constructed model on new instances, we employ
the regularization techniques. Moreover, to enhance the capability of addressing large-scale
datasets, we introduce a state-of-the-art algorithm that is widely used in the machine learning
community to solve the proposed optimization model in a computationally efficient way. Using the
constructed additive value model, we determine both crisp and valued assignments for non-reference
alternatives. Moreover, we allow the Decision Maker to prioritize importance of classes and give
the method a flexibility to adjust classification performance across classes according to the
specified priorities. The practical usefulness of the analytical framework is demonstrated on
a real-world dataset by comparing it to several existing sorting methods.
