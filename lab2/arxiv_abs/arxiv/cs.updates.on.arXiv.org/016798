Calcaneus is the largest tarsal bone to withstand the daily stresses of weight bearing. The calcaneal
fracture is the most common type in the tarsal bone fractures. After a fracture is suspected, plain
radiographs should be taken first. Bohler's Angle (BA) and Critical Angle of Gissane (CAG), measured
by four anatomic landmarks in lateral foot radiograph, can guide fracture diagnosis and facilitate
operative recovery of the fractured calcaneus. The aim of this study is to develop an analysis system
that can automatically locate four anatomic landmarks, measure BA and CAG for fracture assessment,
identify fractured calcaneus and segment fractured regions. For landmark detection, we proposed
a coarse-to-fine Rotation-Invariant Regression-Voting (RIRV) landmark detection method based
on Supported Vector Regression (SVR) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) patch descriptor,
to solve the problem of fickle rotation of calcaneus. By implementing a novel normalization approach,
the RIRV method is explicitly rotation-invariance comparing with traditional regressive method.
For fracture identification and segmentation, a convolution neural network (CNN) based on U-Net
with auxiliary classification head (U-Net-CH) is designed. The input ROIs of the CNN are normalized
by detected landmarks to uniform view, orientation and scale. The advantage of this approach is
the multi-task learning that combines classification and segmentation. Our system can accurately
measure BA and CAG with mean angle error of 3.8 and 6.2 respectively. For fracture identification
and fracture region segmentation, our system presents good performance with F1-score of 98.37%,
recall of 98.77% and segmentation IoU-score of 0.568.
