In this paper, we propose a path following replicator dynamic, and investigate its potentials in
uncovering the underlying cluster structure of a graph. The proposed dynamic is a generalization
of the discrete replicator dynamic. The replicator dynamic has been successfully used to extract
dense clusters of graphs; however, it is often sensitive to the degree distribution of a graph, and
usually biased by vertices with large degrees, thus may fail to detect the densest cluster. To overcome
this problem, we introduce a dynamic parameter, called path parameter, into the evolution process.
The path parameter can be interpreted as the maximal possible probability of a current cluster containing
a vertex, and it monotonically increases as evolution process proceeds. By limiting the maximal
probability, the phenomenon of some vertices dominating the early stage of evolution process is
suppressed, thus making evolution process more robust. To solve the optimization problem with
a fixed path parameter, we propose an efficient fixed point algorithm. The time complexity of the
path following replicator dynamic is only linear in the number of edges of a graph, thus it can analyze
graphs with millions of vertices and tens of millions of edges on a common PC in a few minutes. Besides,
it can be naturally generalized to hypergraph and graph with edges of different orders. We apply
it to four important problems: maximum clique problem, densest k-subgraph problem, structure
fitting, and discovery of high-density regions. The extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate
its advantages, in terms of robustness, scalability and flexility.
