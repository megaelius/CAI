Emerging technology demands reliable authentication mechanisms, particularly in interconnected
systems. Current systems rely on a single moment of authentication, however continuous authentication
systems assess a users identity utilizing a constant biometric analysis. Spy Hunter, a continuous
authentication mechanism uses keystroke dynamics to validate users over blocks of data. This easily-incorporated
periodic biometric authentication system validates genuine users and detects intruders quickly.
Because it verifies users in the background, Spy Hunter is not constrained to a password box. Instead,
it is flexible and can be layered with other mechanisms to provide high-level security. Where other
continuous authentication techniques rely on scripted typing, Spy Hunter validates over free
text in authentic environments. This is accomplished in two phases, one where the user is provided
a prompt and another where the user is allowed free access to their computer. Additionally, Spy Hunter
focuses on the timing of different keystrokes rather than the specific key being pressed. This allows
for anonymous data to authenticate users and avoids holding personal data. Utilizing a couple K-fold
cross-validation techniques, Spy Hunter is assessed based on how often the system falsely accepts
an intruder, how often the system falsely rejects a genuine user, and the time it takes to validate
a users identity. Spy Hunter maintains error rates below 6% and identifies users in minimal numbers
of keystrokes. Continuous authentication provides higher level security than one-time verification
processes and Spy Hunter expands on the possibilities for behavioral analysis based on keystroke
dynamics.
