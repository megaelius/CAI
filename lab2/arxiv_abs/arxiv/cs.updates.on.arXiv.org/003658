Motivation: Ontologies are widely used in biology for data annotation, integration, and analysis.
In addition to formally structured axioms, ontologies contain meta-data in the form of annotation
axioms which provide valuable pieces of information that characterize ontology classes. Annotations
commonly used in ontologies include class labels, descriptions, or synonyms. Despite being a rich
source of semantic information, the ontology meta-data are generally unexploited by ontology-based
analysis methods such as semantic similarity measures. Results: We propose a novel method, OPA2Vec,
to generate vector representations of biological entities in ontologies by combining formal ontology
axioms and annotation axioms from the ontology meta-data. We apply a Word2Vec model that has been
pre-trained on PubMed abstracts to produce feature vectors from our collected data. We validate
our method in two different ways: first, we use the obtained vector representations of proteins
as a similarity measure to predict protein-protein interaction (PPI) on two different datasets.
Second, we evaluate our method on predicting gene-disease associations based on phenotype similarity
by generating vector representations of genes and diseases using a phenotype ontology, and applying
the obtained vectors to predict gene-disease associations. These two experiments are just an illustration
of the possible applications of our method. OPA2Vec can be used to produce vector representations
of any biomedical entity given any type of biomedical ontology. Availability: https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/opa2vec
