The Nottingham group at 2 is the group of (formal) power series $t+a_2 t^2+ a_3 t^3+ \cdots$ in the
variable $t$ with coefficients $a_i$ from the field with two elements, where the group operation
is given by composition of power series. The depth of such a series is the largest $d\geq 1$ for which
$a_2=\dots=a_d=0$. Only a handful of power series of finite order are explicitly known through
a formula for their coefficients. We argue in this paper that it is advantageous to describe such
series in closed computational form through automata, based on effective versions of proofs of
Christol's theorem identifying algebraic and automatic series. Up to conjugation, there are only
finitely many series $\sigma$ of order $2^n$ with fixed break sequence (i.e. the sequence of depths
of $\sigma^{\circ 2^i}$). Starting from Witt vector or Carlitz module constructions, we give an
explicit automaton-theoretic description of: (a) representatives up to conjugation for all series
of order 4 with break sequence (1,m) for m<10; (b) representatives up to conjugation for all series
of order 8 with minimal break sequence (1,3,11); and (c) an embedding of the Klein four-group into
the Nottingham group at 2. We study the complexity of the new examples from the algebro-geometric
properties of the equations they satisfy. For this, we generalise the theory of sparseness of power
series to a four-step hierarchy of complexity, for which we give both Galois-theoretic and combinatorial
descriptions. We identify where our different series fit into this hierarchy. We construct sparse
representatives for the conjugacy class of elements of order two and depth $2^\mu \pm 1$ $(\mu \geq
1)$. Series with small state complexity can end up high in the hierarchy. This is true, for example,
for a new automaton we found, representing a series of order 4 with 5 states, the minimal possible
number for such a series.
