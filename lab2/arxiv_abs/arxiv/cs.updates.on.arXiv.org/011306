The continuous motorization of traffic has led to a sustained increase in the global number of road
related fatalities and injuries. To counter this, governments are focusing on enforcing safe and
law-abiding behavior in traffic. However, especially in developing countries where the motorcycle
is the main form of transportation, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the safety-critical
behavioral metric of motorcycle helmet use. This lack of data prohibits targeted enforcement and
education campaigns which are crucial for injury prevention. Hence, we have developed an algorithm
for the automated registration of motorcycle helmet usage from video data, using a deep learning
approach. Based on 91,000 annotated frames of video data, collected at multiple observation sites
in 7 cities across the country of Myanmar, we trained our algorithm to detect active motorcycles,
the number and position of riders on the motorcycle, as well as their helmet use. An analysis of the
algorithm's accuracy on an annotated test data set, and a comparison to available human-registered
helmet use data reveals a high accuracy of our approach. Our algorithm registers motorcycle helmet
use rates with an accuracy of -4.4% and +2.1% in comparison to a human observer, with minimal training
for individual observation sites. Without observation site specific training, the accuracy of
helmet use detection decreases slightly, depending on a number of factors. Our approach can be implemented
in existing roadside traffic surveillance infrastructure and can facilitate targeted data-driven
injury prevention campaigns with real-time speed. Implications of the proposed method, as well
as measures that can further improve detection accuracy are discussed.
