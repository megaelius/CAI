Endowing a dialogue system with particular personality traits is essential to deliver more human-like
conversations. However, due to the challenge of embodying personality via language expression
and the lack of large-scale persona-labeled dialogue data, this research problem is still far from
well-studied. In this paper, we investigate the problem of incorporating explicit personality
traits in dialogue generation to deliver personalized dialogues. To this end, firstly, we construct
PersonalDialog, a large-scale multi-turn dialogue dataset containing various traits from a large
number of speakers. The dataset consists of 20.83M sessions and 56.25M utterances from 8.47M speakers.
Each utterance is associated with a speaker who is marked with traits like Age, Gender, Location,
Interest Tags, etc. Several anonymization schemes are designed to protect the privacy of each speaker.
This large-scale dataset will facilitate not only the study of personalized dialogue generation,
but also other researches on sociolinguistics or social science. Secondly, to study how personality
traits can be captured and addressed in dialogue generation, we propose persona-aware dialogue
generation models within the sequence to sequence learning framework. Explicit personality traits
(structured by key-value pairs) are embedded using a trait fusion module. During the decoding process,
two techniques, namely persona-aware attention and persona-aware bias, are devised to capture
and address trait-related information. Experiments demonstrate that our model is able to address
proper traits in different contexts. Case studies also show interesting results for this challenging
research problem.
