Of the 2652 articles considered, 106 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the included papers resulted
in identification of 43 chronic diseases, which were then further classified into 10 disease categories
using ICD-10. The majority of studies focused on diseases of the circulatory system (n=38) while
endocrine and metabolic diseases were fewest (n=14). This was due to the structure of clinical records
related to metabolic diseases, which typically contain much more structured data, compared with
medical records for diseases of the circulatory system, which focus more on unstructured data and
consequently have seen a stronger focus of NLP. The review has shown that there is a significant increase
in the use of machine learning methods compared to rule-based approaches; however, deep learning
methods remain emergent (n=3). Consequently, the majority of works focus on classification of
disease phenotype with only a handful of papers addressing extraction of comorbidities from the
free text or integration of clinical notes with structured data. There is a notable use of relatively
simple methods, such as shallow classifiers (or combination with rule-based methods), due to the
interpretability of predictions, which still represents a significant issue for more complex
methods. Finally, scarcity of publicly available data may also have contributed to insufficient
development of more advanced methods, such as extraction of word embeddings from clinical notes.
Further efforts are still required to improve (1) progression of clinical NLP methods from extraction
toward understanding; (2) recognition of relations among entities rather than entities in isolation;
(3) temporal extraction to understand past, current, and future clinical events; (4) exploitation
of alternative sources of clinical knowledge; and (5) availability of large-scale, de-identified
clinical corpora.
