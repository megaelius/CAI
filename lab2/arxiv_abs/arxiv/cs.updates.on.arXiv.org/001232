Capacity is the eternal pursuit for communication systems due to the overwhelming demand of bandwidth
hungry applications. As the backbone infrastructure of modern communication networks, the optical
fiber transmission system undergoes a significant capacity growth over decades by exploiting
available physical dimensions (time, frequency, quadrature, polarization and space) of the optical
carrier for multiplexing. For each dimension, stringent orthogonality must be guaranteed for
perfect separation of independent multiplexed signals. To catch up with the ever-increasing capacity
requirement, it is therefore interesting and important to develop new multiplexing methodologies
relaxing the orthogonal constraint thus achieving better spectral efficiency and more flexibility
of frequency reuse. Inspired by the idea of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, here
we propose a digital domain power division multiplexed (PDM) transmission technology which is
fully compatible with current dual polarization (DP) coherent optical communication system.
The coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) modulation has been
employed owing to its great superiority on high spectral efficiency, flexible coding, ease of channel
estimation and robustness against fiber dispersion. And a PDM-DP-CO-OFDM has been theoretically
and experimentally demonstrated with 100Gb/s wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transmission
over 1440km standard single mode fibers (SSMFs). Two baseband quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)
OFDM signals are overlaid together with different power levels. After IQ modulation, polarization
multiplexing and long distance fiber transmission, the PDM-DP-CO-OFDM signal has been successfully
recovered in the typical polarization diversity coherent receiver by successive interference
cancellation (SIC) algorithm.
