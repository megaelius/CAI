The endowment effect, coined by Nobel Laureate Richard Thaler, posits that people tend to inflate
the value of items they own. We study endowment equilibria --- Walrasian equilibria in combinatorial
markets with valuations that are subject to the endowment effect. While standard Walrasian equilibria
are guaranteed to exist only for the restricted class of gross substitutes valuations, a recent
work of Babaioff et al. [EC'18] showed that for a particular formulation of the endowment effect,
every market with submodular valuations admits an endowment equilibrium. Moreover, this equilibrium
gives at least half of the optimal social welfare. Unfortunately, their existence guarantee provably
fails to extend to the broader class of XOS valuations. We devise a general framework capturing a
class of endowment effects that satisfy fundamental principles drawn from the literature, and
provide existence and welfare guarantees for endowment equilibria corresponding to endowment
effects in this class. Our main results are the following: (1) For markets with XOS valuations, we
introduce an endowment effect that is stronger than that of Babaioff et al. for which an endowment
equilibrium is guaranteed to exist. Moreover, it gives at least half of the optimal welfare, and
can be reached via a variant of the flexible ascent auction proposed by Fu et al. [EC'12]. (2) For markets
with arbitrary valuations, we obtain a sweeping positive result by turning to markets in which it
is allowed to bundle items into new indivisible items. In such settings, we show that there always
exists an endowment equilibrium with optimal welfare. Moreover, we provide a polynomial algorithm
that given an arbitrary allocation $S$, computes an endowment equilibrium with the same welfare
guarantee as in $S$.
