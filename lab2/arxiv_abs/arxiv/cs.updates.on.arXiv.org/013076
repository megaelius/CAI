Lightning Network (LN) is designed to amend the scalability and privacy issues of Bitcoin. It's
a payment channel network where Bitcoin transactions are issued off chain, onion routed through
a private payment path with the aim to settle transactions in a faster, cheaper, and private manner,
as they're not recorded in a costly-to-maintain, slow, and public ledger. In this work, we design
a traffic simulator to empirically study LN's transaction fees and privacy provisions. The simulator
relies on publicly available data of the network structure and generates transactions under assumptions
we attempt to validate based on information spread by certain blog posts of LN node owners. Our findings
on the estimated revenue from transaction fees are in line with widespread opinion that participation
is economically irrational for the majority of large routing nodes who currently hold the network
together. Either traffic or transaction fees must increase by orders of magnitude to make payment
routing economically viable. We give worst-case estimates for the potential fee increase by assuming
strong price competition among the routers. We estimate how current channel structures and pricing
policies respond to a potential increase in traffic, how reduction in locked funds on channels would
affect the network, and show examples of nodes who are estimated to operate with economically feasible
revenue. Even if transactions are onion routed, strong statistical evidence on payment source
and destination can be inferred, as many transaction paths only consist of a single intermediary
by the side effect of LN's small-world nature. Based on our simulation experiments, we quantitatively
characterize the privacy shortcomings of current LN operation, and propose a method to inject additional
hops in routing paths to demonstrate how privacy can be strengthened with very little additional
transactional cost.
