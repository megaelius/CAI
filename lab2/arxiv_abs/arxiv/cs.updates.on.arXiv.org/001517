There is an extensive body of research on Social Network Analysis (SNA) based on the email archive.
The network used in the analysis is generally extracted either by capturing the email communication
in From, To, Cc and Bcc email header fields or by the entities contained in the email message. In the
latter case, the entities could be, for instance, the bag of words, url's, names, phones, etc. It
could also include the textual content of attachments, for instance Microsoft Word documents,
excel spreadsheets, or Adobe pdfs. The nodes in this network represent users and entities. The edges
represent communication between users and relations to the entities. We suggest taking a different
approach to the network extraction and use attachments shared between users as the edges. The motivation
for this is two-fold. First, attachments represent the "intimacy" manifestation of the relation's
strength. Second, the statistical analysis of private email archives that we collected and Enron
email corpus shows that the attachments contribute in average around 80-90% to the archive's disk-space
usage, which means that most of the data is presently ignored in the SNA of email archives. Consequently,
we hypothesize that this approach might provide more insight into the social structure of the email
archive. We extract the communication and shared attachments networks from Enron email corpus.
We further analyze degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality measures in both
networks and review the differences and what can be learned from them. We use nearest neighbor algorithm
to generate similarity groups for five Enron employees. The groups are consistent with Enron's
organizational chart, which validates our approach.
