Map labeling is a classical problem in cartography and geographic information systems that asks
to place labels for area, line, and point features, with the goal to select and place the maximum number
of independent, i.e., overlap-free, labels. A practically interesting case is point labeling
with axis-parallel rectangular labels of common size. In a fully dynamic setting, at each time step,
either a new label appears or an existing label disappears. Then, the challenge is to maintain a maximum
cardinality subset of pairwise independent labels with sub-linear update time. We study the maximal
independent set (MIS) and maximum independent set (Max-IS) problems on fully dynamic (insertion/deletion
model) sets of axis-parallel rectangles of two types---(i) uniform height and width and (ii) uniform
height and arbitrary width; both settings can be modeled as rectangle intersection graphs. We present
the first deterministic algorithm for maintaining a MIS (and thus a 4-approximate Max-IS) of a dynamic
set of uniform rectangles with amortized sub-logarithmic update time. This breaks the natural
barrier of $\Omega(\Delta)$ update time (where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree in the graph) for
vertex updates presented by Assadi et al. (STOC 2018). We continue by investigating Max-IS and provide
a series of deterministic dynamic approximation schemes with approximation factors between 2
and 4 and corresponding running-time trade-offs. We have implemented our algorithms and report
the results of an experimental comparison exploring the trade-off between solution quality and
update time for synthetic and real-world map labeling instances.
