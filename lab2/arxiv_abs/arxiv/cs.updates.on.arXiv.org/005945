This research aims to identify how Bitcoin-related news publications and online discourse are
expressed in Bitcoin exchange movements of price and volume. Being inherently digital, all Bitcoin-related
fundamental data (from exchanges, as well as transactional data directly from the blockchain)
is available online, something that is not true for traditional businesses or currencies traded
on exchanges. This makes Bitcoin an interesting subject for such research, as it enables the mapping
of sentiment to fundamental events that might otherwise be inaccessible. Furthermore, Bitcoin
discussion largely takes place on online forums and chat channels. In stock trading, the value of
sentiment data in trading decisions has been demonstrated numerous times [1] [2] [3], and this research
aims to determine whether there is value in such data for Bitcoin trading models. To achieve this,
data over the year 2015 has been collected from Bitcointalk.org, (the biggest Bitcoin forum in post
volume), established news sources such as Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, the complete /r/btc
and /r/Bitcoin subreddits, and the bitcoin-otc and bitcoin-dev IRC channels. By analyzing this
data on sentiment and volume, we find weak to moderate correlations between forum, news, and Reddit
sentiment and movements in price and volume from 1 to 5 days after the sentiment was expressed. A Granger
causality test confirms the predictive causality of the sentiment on the daily percentage price
and volume movements, and at the same time underscores the predictive causality of market movements
on sentiment expressions in online communities
