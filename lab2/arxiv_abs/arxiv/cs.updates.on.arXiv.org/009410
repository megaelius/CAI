The paper [S{\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] considers how human players compare to algorithms for
solving the Quantum Moves game BringHomeWater and design new algorithms based on the intuition
extracted from players. The claim by [S{\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] is that players outperform
widely used algorithms, in particular the KASS algorithm, based on the Krotov algorithm, and that
player intuition is crucial to develop improved methods. However, as initially discussed by D.
Sels [D. Sels, Phys. Rev. A 97], a standard Coordinate Ascent algorithm outperforms all players
by a large margin. Albeit D. Sels only compare to player solutions, the simple algorithm outperforms
all algorithms based on player solutions and Krotov, and it does so using much less time and iterations.
In this paper we elaborate on the methods discussed by D. Sels and verify that the presented algorithm,
solves the problem better than all players and algorithms derived from player solutions in [S{\o}rensen
et al., Nature 532]. We also verify the theoretical analysis presented by D. Sels, that gives a theoretically
derived protocol that outperforms all players. We add a comparison with gradient ascent or GRAPE.
Starting from uniform random values, GRAPE outperforms all players by a large margin. GRAPE works
at least as well as the methods from [S{\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] initialized with player solutions.
A standard analysis of the results from GRAPE provides a starting point for GRAPE, that outperform
all algorithms from [S{\o}rensen et al., Nature 532]. We compare with a basic Krotov algorithm,
and get results similar to GRAPE, clearly outperforming players and the KASS algorithm. These experiments
verify and underline the result in [D. Sels, Phys. Rev. A 97] that the conclusions from [S{\o}rensen
et al., Nature 532] regarding algorithms are untenable. In fact the opposite conclusions are true.
