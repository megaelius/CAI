LightFDG is an integrated approach to flow detection (FD) and flow grooming (FG) in optical wireless
data center networks (DCNs), which is interconnected via wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)
based free-space optical (FSO) links. Since forwarding bandwidth-hungry elephant flows (EFs)
and delay-sensitive mice flows (MFs) on the same path can cause severe performance degradation,
the LightFDG optically grooms flows of each class into rack-to-rack (R2R) flows. Then, R2R-MF and
R2R-EF flows are separately forwarded over lightpaths of separate MF and EF virtual topologies,
respectively. Lightpaths are provisioned by jointly determining the capacity and route based
on flows' arrival rate, size, and completion time request. To prevent EFs from congesting the MF
lightpaths, high speed and accurate flow-detection mechanisms are also necessary for classifying
EFs as soon as possible. Therefore, a fast-lightweight-and-accurate flow detection framework
is developed by leveraging the transmission control protocol (TCP) behaviors. The proposed FD
scheme has the flexibility of being implemented as in-network or centralized to classify flows
of modifiable and unmodifiable hosts, respectively. Since the centralized scheme incurs considerable
overhead, the processing and communication overhead is also mitigated by proposed techniques.
Numerical results show that LightFDG outperforms traditional load balancers by about 3x for EFs
and 10x for MFs. Along with the developed overhead mitigation methods, the centralized scheme is
shown to provide up to 62x lower overhead with 100% accuracy and with about 224x higher detection
speeds than the existing centralized solutions.
