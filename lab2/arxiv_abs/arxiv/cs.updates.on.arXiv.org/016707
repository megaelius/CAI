Face detection from low-light images is challenging due to limited photos and inevitable noise,
which, to make the task even harder, are often spatially unevenly distributed. A natural solution
is to borrow the idea from multi-exposure, which captures multiple shots to obtain well-exposed
images under challenging conditions. High-quality implementation/approximation of multi-exposure
from a single image is however nontrivial. Fortunately, as shown in this paper, neither is such high-quality
necessary since our task is face detection rather than image enhancement. Specifically, we propose
a novel Recurrent Exposure Generation (REG) module and couple it seamlessly with a Multi-Exposure
Detection (MED) module, and thus significantly improve face detection performance by effectively
inhibiting non-uniform illumination and noise issues. REG produces progressively and efficiently
intermediate images corresponding to various exposure settings, and such pseudo-exposures are
then fused by MED to detect faces across different lighting conditions. The proposed method, named
REGDet, is the first `detection-with-enhancement' framework for low-light face detection. It
not only encourages rich interaction and feature fusion across different illumination levels,
but also enables effective end-to-end learning of the REG component to be better tailored for face
detection. Moreover, as clearly shown in our experiments, REG can be flexibly coupled with different
face detectors without extra low/normal-light image pairs for training. We tested REGDet on the
DARK FACE low-light face benchmark with thorough ablation study, where REGDet outperforms previous
state-of-the-arts by a significant margin, with only negligible extra parameters.
