In this paper we contribute a novel algorithm family, which generalizes many unsupervised techniques
including unnormalized and energy models, and allows us to infer different statistical modalities
(e.g. data likelihood and ratio between densities) from data samples. The proposed unsupervised
technique, named Probabilistic Surface Optimization (PSO), views a model as a flexible surface
which can be pushed according to loss-specific virtual stochastic forces, where a dynamical equilibrium
is achieved when the pointwise forces on the surface become equal. Concretely, the surface is pushed
up and down at points sampled from two different distributions. The averaged up and down forces become
functions of these two distribution densities and of force magnitudes defined by the loss of a particular
PSO instance. Upon convergence, the force equilibrium imposes an optimized model to be equal to
various statistical functions depending on the used magnitude functions. Furthermore, this dynamical-statistical
equilibrium is extremely intuitive and useful, providing many implications and possible usages
in probabilistic inference. We connect PSO to numerous existing statistical works which are also
PSO instances, and derive new PSO-based inference methods as demonstration of PSO exceptional
usability. Likewise, based on the insights coming from the virtual-force perspective we analyze
PSO stability and propose new ways to improve it. Finally, we present new instances of PSO, termed
PSO-LDE, for data log-density estimation and also provide a new NN block-diagonal architecture
for increased surface flexibility, which significantly improves estimation accuracy. Both PSO-LDE
and the new architecture are combined together as a new density estimation technique. In our experiments
we demonstrate this technique to be superior over state-of-the-art baselines in density estimation
task for multimodal 20D data.
