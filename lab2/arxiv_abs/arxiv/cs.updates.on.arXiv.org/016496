Device Fingerprinting (DFP) is the identification of a device without using its network or other
assigned identities including IP address, Medium Access Control (MAC) address, or International
Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. DFP identifies a device using information from the packets
which the device uses to communicate over the network. Packets are received at a router and processed
to extract the information. In this paper, we worked on the DFP using Inter Arrival Time (IAT). IAT
is the time interval between the two consecutive packets received. This has been observed that the
IAT is unique for a device because of different hardware and the software used for the device. The
existing work on the DFP uses the statistical techniques to analyze the IAT and to further generate
the information using which a device can be identified uniquely. This work presents a novel idea
of DFP by plotting graphs of IAT for packets with each graph plotting 100 IATs and subsequently processing
the resulting graphs for the identification of the device. This approach improves the efficiency
to identify a device DFP due to achieved benchmark of the deep learning libraries in the image processing.
We configured Raspberry Pi to work as a router and installed our packet sniffer application on the
Raspberry Pi . The packet sniffer application captured the packet information from the connected
devices in a log file. We connected two Apple devices iPad4 and iPhone 7 Plus to the router and created
IAT graphs for these two devices. We used Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to identify the devices
and observed the accuracy of 86.7%.
