Freight train services in a railway network system are generally divided into two categories: one
is the unscheduled train, whose operating frequency fluctuates with origin-destination (OD)
demands; the other is the scheduled train, which is running based on regular timetable just like
the passenger trains. The timetable will be released to the public if determined and it would not
be influenced by OD demands. Typically, the total capacity of scheduled trains can usually satisfy
the predicted demands of express cargos in average. However, the demands are changing in practice.
Therefore, how to distribute the shipments between different stations to unscheduled and scheduled
train services has become an important research field in railway transportation. This paper focuses
on the coordinated optimization of the rail express cargos distribution in two service networks.
On the premise of fully utilizing the capacity of scheduled service network first, we established
a Car-to-Train (CTT) assignment model to assign rail express cargos to scheduled and unscheduled
trains scientifically. The objective function is to maximize the net income of transporting the
rail express cargos. The constraints include the capacity restriction on the service arcs, flow
balance constraints, logical relationship constraint between two groups of decision variables
and the due date constraint. The last constraint is to ensure that the total transportation time
of a shipment would not be longer than its predefined due date. Finally, we discuss the linearization
techniques to simplify the model proposed in this paper, which make it possible for obtaining global
optimal solution by using the commercial software.
