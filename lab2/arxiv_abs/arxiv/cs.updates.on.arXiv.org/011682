X-ray imagery security screening is essential to maintaining transport security against a varying
profile of threat or prohibited items. Particular interest lies in the automatic detection and
classification of weapons such as firearms and knives within complex and cluttered X-ray security
imagery. Here, we address this problem by exploring various end-to-end object detection Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architectures. We evaluate several leading variants spanning the Faster
R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and RetinaNet architectures to explore the transferability of such models between
varying X-ray scanners with differing imaging geometries, image resolutions and material colour
profiles. Whilst the limited availability of X-ray threat imagery can pose a challenge, we employ
a transfer learning approach to evaluate whether such inter-scanner generalisation may exist
over a multiple class detection problem. Overall, we achieve maximal detection performance using
a Faster R-CNN architecture with a ResNet$_{101}$ classification network, obtaining 0.88 and
0.86 of mean Average Precision (mAP) for a three-class and two class item from varying X-ray imaging
sources. Our results exhibit a remarkable degree of generalisability in terms of cross-scanner
performance (mAP: 0.87, firearm detection: 0.94 AP). In addition, we examine the inherent adversarial
discriminative capability of such networks using a specifically generated adversarial dataset
for firearms detection - with a variable low false positive, as low as 5%, this shows both the challenge
and promise of such threat detection within X-ray security imagery.
