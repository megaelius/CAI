With the increasing network densification, it has become exceedingly difficult to provide traditional
fiber backhaul access to each cell site, which is especially true for small cell base stations (SBSs).
The increasing maturity of millimeter wave (mm-wave) communication has opened up the possibility
of providing high-speed wireless backhaul to such cell sites. Since mm-wave is also suitable for
access links, the third generation partnership project (3GPP) is envisioning an integrated access
and backhaul (IAB) architecture for the fifth generation (5G) cellular networks in which the same
infrastructure and spectral resources will be used for both access and backhaul. In this paper,
we develop an analytical framework for IAB-enabled cellular network using which its downlink rate
coverage probability is accurately characterized. Using this framework, we study the performance
of three backhaul bandwidth (BW) partition strategies: 1) equal partition: when all SBSs obtain
equal share of the backhaul BW; 2) instantaneous load-based partition: when the backhaul BW share
of an SBS is proportional to its instantaneous load; and 3) average load-based partition: when the
backhaul BW share of an SBS is proportional to its average load. Our analysis shows that depending
on the choice of the partition strategy, there exists an optimal split of access and backhaul BW for
which the rate coverage is maximized. Further, there exists a critical volume of cell-load (total
number of users) beyond which the gains provided by the IAB-enabled network disappear and its performance
converges to that of the traditional macro-only network with no SBSs.
