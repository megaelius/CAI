The kNN query interface is a popular search interface for many real-world web databases. Given a
user-specified query, the top-k nearest neighboring tuples (ranked by a predetermined ranking
function) are returned. For example, many websites now provide social network features that recommend
to a user others who share similar properties, interests, etc. Our studies of real-world websites
unveil a novel yet serious privacy leakage caused by the design of such interfaces and ranking functions.
Specifically, we find that many of such websites feature private attributes that are only visible
to a user him/herself, but not to other users (and therefore will not be visible in the query answer).
Nonetheless, these websites also take into account such private attributes in the design of the
ranking function. While the conventional belief might be that tuple ranks alone are not enough to
reveal the private attribute values, our investigation shows that this is not the case in reality.
Specifically, we define a novel problem of rank based inference, and introduce a taxonomy of the
problem space according to two dimensions, (1) the type of query interfaces widely used in practice
and (2) the capability of adversaries. For each subspace of the prolem, we develop a novel technique
which either guarantees the successful inference of private attributes, or (when such an inference
is provably infeasible in the worst-case scenario) accomplishes such an inference attack for a
significant portion of real-world tuples. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
our techniques through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments over real-world datasets,
including successful online attacks over popular services such as Amazon Goodreads and Catch22dating.
