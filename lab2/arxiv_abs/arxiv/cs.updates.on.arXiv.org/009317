Characterization of a non-Gaussian channelized conductivity field in subsurface flow and transport
modeling through inverse modeling usually leads to a high-dimensional inverse problem and requires
repeated evaluations of the forward model. In this study, we develop a convolutional adversarial
autoencoder (CAAE) network to parameterize the high-dimensional non-Gaussian conductivity
fields using a low-dimensional latent representation and a deep residual dense convolutional
network (DRDCN) to efficiently construct a surrogate model for the forward model. The two networks
are both based on a multilevel residual learning architecture called residual-in-residual dense
block. The multilevel residual learning strategy and the dense connection structure in the dense
block ease the training of deep networks, enabling us to efficiently build deeper networks that
have an essentially increased capacity for approximating mappings of very high-complexity. The
CCAE and DRDCN networks are incorporated into an iterative local updating ensemble smoother to
formulate an inversion framework. The integrated method is demonstrated using a synthetic solute
transport model. Results indicate that CAAE is a robust parameterization method for the channelized
conductivity fields with Gaussian conductivities within each facies. The DRDCN network is able
to obtain an accurate surrogate model of the forward model with high-dimensional and highly-complex
concentration fields using relatively limited training data. The CAAE paramterization approach
and the DRDCN surrogate method together significantly reduce the number of forward model runs required
to achieve accurate inversion results.
