Scheduling fast uplink grant transmissions for machine type communications (MTCs) is one of the
main challenges of future wireless systems. In this paper, a novel fast uplink grant scheduling
method based on the theory of multi-armed bandits (MABs) is proposed. First, a single quality-of-service
metric is defined as a combination of the value of data packets, maximum tolerable access delay,
and data rate. Since full knowledge of these metrics for all machine type devices (MTDs) cannot be
known in advance at the base station (BS) and the set of active MTDs changes over time, the problem
is modeled as a sleeping MAB with stochastic availability and a stochastic reward function. In particular,
given that, at each time step, the knowledge on the set of active MTDs is probabilistic, a novel probabilistic
sleeping MAB algorithm is proposed to maximize the defined metric. Analysis of the regret is presented
and the effect of the prediction error of the source traffic prediction algorithm on the performance
of the proposed sleeping MAB algorithm is investigated. Moreover, to enable fast uplink allocation
for multiple MTDs at each time, a novel method is proposed based on the concept of best arms ordering
in the MAB setting. Simulation results show that the proposed framework yields a three-fold reduction
in latency compared to a random scheduling policy since it prioritises the scheduling of MTDs that
have stricter latency requirements. Moreover, by properly balancing the exploration versus exploitation
tradeoff, the proposed algorithm can provide system fairness by allowing the most important MTDs
to be scheduled more often while also allowing the less important MTDs to be selected enough times
to ensure the accuracy of estimation of their importance.
