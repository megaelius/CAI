Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been widely adopted recently due to its advantages compared
with the traditional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). However, an NMT system still often
produces translation failures due to the complexity of natural language and sophistication in
designing neural networks. While in-house black-box system testing based on reference translations
(i.e., examples of valid translations) has been a common practice for NMT quality assurance, an
increasingly critical industrial practice, named in-vivo testing, exposes unseen types or instances
of translation failures when real users are using a deployed industrial NMT system. To fill the gap
of lacking test oracle for in-vivo testing of an NMT system, in this paper, we propose a new approach
for automatically identifying translation failures, without requiring reference translations
for a translation task; our approach can directly serve as a test oracle for in-vivo testing. Our
approach focuses on properties of natural language translation that can be checked systematically
and uses information from both the test inputs (i.e., the texts to be translated) and the test outputs
(i.e., the translations under inspection) of the NMT system. Our evaluation conducted on real-world
datasets shows that our approach can effectively detect targeted property violations as translation
failures. Our experiences on deploying our approach in both production and development environments
of WeChat (a messenger app with over one billion monthly active users) demonstrate high effectiveness
of our approach along with high industry impact.
