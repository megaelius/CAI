The ongoing functional annotation of proteins relies upon the work of curators to capture experimental
findings from scientific literature and apply them to protein sequence and structure data. However,
with the increasing use of high-throughput experimental assays, a small number of experimental
studies dominate the functional protein annotations collected in databases. Here we investigate
just how prevalent is the "few articles -- many proteins" phenomenon. We examine the experimentally
validated annotation of proteins provided by several groups in the GO Consortium, and show that
the distribution of proteins per published study is exponential, with 0.14% of articles providing
the source of annotations for 25% of the proteins in the UniProt-GOA compilation. Since each of the
dominant articles describes the use of an assay that can find only one function or a small group of
functions, this leads to substantial biases in what we know about the function of many proteins.
Mass-spectrometry, microscopy and RNAi experiments dominate high throughput experiments. Consequently,
the functional information derived from these experiments is mostly of the subcellular location
of proteins, and of the participation of proteins in embryonic developmental pathways. For some
organisms, the information provided by different studies overlap by a large amount. We also show
that the information provided by high throughput experiments is less specific than those provided
by low throughput experiments. Given the experimental techniques available, certain biases in
protein function annotation due to high-throughput experiments are unavoidable. Knowing that
these biases exist and understanding their characteristics and extent is important for database
curators, developers of function annotation programs, and anyone who uses protein function annotation
data to plan experiments.
