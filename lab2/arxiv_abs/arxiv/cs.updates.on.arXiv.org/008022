In this paper, we consider a secondary wireless powered communication network (WPCN) underlaid
to a primary point-to-point communication link. The WPCN consists of a multi-antenna hybrid access
point (HAP) that transfers wireless energy to a cluster of low-power wireless devices (WDs) and
receives sensing data from them. To tackle the inherent severe user unfairness problem in WPCN,
we consider a cluster-based cooperation where a WD acts as the cluster head that relays the information
of the other WDs. Besides, we apply energy beamforming technique to balance the dissimilar energy
consumptions of the WDs to further improve the fairness. However, the use of energy beamforming
and cluster-based cooperation may introduce more severe interference to the primary system than
the WDs transmit independently. To guarantee the performance of primary system, we consider an
interference-temperature constraint to the primary system and derive the throughput performance
of each WD under the peak interference-temperature constraint. To achieve maximum throughput
fairness, we jointly optimize the energy beamforming design, the transmit time allocation among
the HAP and the WDs, and the transmit power allocation of each WD to maximize the minimum data rate
achievable among the WDs (the max-min throughput). We show that the non-convex joint optimization
problem can be transformed to a convex one and then be efficiently solved using off-the-shelf convex
algorithms. Moreover, we simulate under practical network setups and show that the proposed method
can effectively improve the throughput fairness of the secondary WPCN, meanwhile guaranteeing
the communication quality of the primary network.
