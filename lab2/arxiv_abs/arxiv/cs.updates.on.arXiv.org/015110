Data obtained from Flow Cytometry present pronounced variability due to biological and technical
reasons. Biological variability is a well-known phenomenon produced by measurements on different
individuals, with different characteristics such as illness, age, sex, etc. The use of different
settings for measurement, the variation of the conditions during experiments and the different
types of flow cytometers are some of the technical causes of variability. This mixture of sources
of variability makes the use of supervised machine learning for identification of cell populations
difficult. The present work is conceived as a combination of strategies to facilitate the task of
supervised gating. We propose $optimalFlowTemplates$, based on a similarity distance and $\text{Wasserstein
barycenters}$, which clusters cytometries and produces prototype cytometries for the different
groups. We show that supervised learning, restricted to the new groups, performs better than the
same techniques applied to the whole collection. We also present $optimalFlowClassification$,
which uses a database of gated cytometries and optimalFlowTemplates to assign cell types to a new
cytometry. We show that this procedure can outperform state of the art techniques in the proposed
datasets. Our code is freely available as $optimalFlow$ a Bioconductor R package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/optimalFlow.
optimalFlowTemplates+optimalFlowClassification addresses the problem of using supervised
learning while accounting for biological and technical variability. Our methodology provides
a robust automated gating workflow that handles the intrinsic variability of flow cytometry data
well. Our main innovation is the methodology itself and the optimal-transport techniques that
we apply to flow cytometry analysis.
