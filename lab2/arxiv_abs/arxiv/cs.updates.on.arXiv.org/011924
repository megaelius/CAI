The recent success of deep learning together with the availability of large medical imaging datasets
have enabled researchers to improve our understanding of complex chronic medical conditions such
as neurodegenerative diseases. The possibility of predicting realistic and accurate images would
be a breakthrough for many clinical healthcare applications. However, current image simulators
designed to model neurodegenerative disease progression present limitations that preclude their
utility in clinical practice. These limitations include personalization of disease progression
and the ability to synthesize spatiotemporal images in high resolution. In particular, memory
limitations prohibit full 3D image models, necessitating various techniques to discard spatiotemporal
information, such as patch-based approaches. In this work, we introduce a novel technique to address
this challenge, called Profile Weight Functions (PWF). We demonstrate its effectiveness integrated
within our new deep learning framework, showing that it enables the extension to 3D of a recent state-of-the-art
2D approach. To our knowledge, we are the first to implement a personalized disease progression
simulator able to predict accurate, personalised, high-resolution, 3D MRI. In particular, we
trained a model of ageing and Alzheimer's disease progression using 9652 T1-weighted (longitudinal)
MRI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and validated on a separate
test set of 1283 MRI (also from ADNI, random partition). We validated our model by analyzing its capability
to synthesize MRI that produce accurate volumes of specific brain regions associated with neurodegeneration.
Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution to provide a 3D simulation that produces
accurate and convincing synthetic MRI that emulate ageing and disease progression.
