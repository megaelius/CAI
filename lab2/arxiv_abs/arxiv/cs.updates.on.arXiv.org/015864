Future SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak COVID-XX might possibly occur during the next years. However
the pathology in humans is so recent that many clinical aspects, like early detection of complications,
side effects after recovery or early screening, are currently unknown. In spite of the number of
cases of COVID-19, its rapid spread putting many sanitary systems in the edge of collapse has hindered
proper collection and analysis of the data related to COVID-19 clinical aspects. We describe an
interdisciplinary initiative that integrates clinical research, with image diagnostics and
the use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and radiomics with the aim of clarifying
some of SARS-CoV-2 open questions. The whole initiative addresses 3 main points: 1) collection
of standardize data including images, clinical data and analytics; 2) COVID-19 screening for its
early diagnosis at primary care centers; 3) define radiomic signatures of COVID-19 evolution and
associated pathologies for the early treatment of complications. In particular, in this paper
we present a general overview of the project, the experimental design and first results of X-ray
COVID-19 detection using a classic approach based on HoG and feature selection. Our experiments
include a comparison to some recent methods for COVID-19 screening in X-Ray and an exploratory analysis
of the feasibility of X-Ray COVID-19 screening. Results show that classic approaches can outperform
deep-learning methods in this experimental setting, indicate the feasibility of early COVID-19
screening and that non-COVID infiltration is the group of patients most similar to COVID-19 in terms
of radiological description of X-ray. Therefore, an efficient COVID-19 screening should be complemented
with other clinical data to better discriminate these cases.
