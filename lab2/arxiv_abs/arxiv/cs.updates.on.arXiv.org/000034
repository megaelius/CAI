The study of social networks is a burgeoning research area. However, most existing work deals with
networks that simply encode whether relationships exist or not. In contrast, relationships in
signed networks can be positive ("like", "trust") or negative ("dislike", "distrust"). The theory
of social balance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that, in turn,
induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both local as well as global aspects
of social balance theory for two fundamental problems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction
and clustering. Motivated by local patterns of social balance, we first propose two families of
sign prediction methods: measures of social imbalance (MOIs), and supervised learning using high
order cycles (HOCs). These methods predict signs of edges based on triangles and \ell-cycles for
relatively small values of \ell. Interestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we
show that the classic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction, actually has
a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed networks. Furthermore, motivated by
the global structure of balanced networks, we propose an effective low rank modeling approach for
both sign prediction and clustering. For the low rank modeling approach, we provide theoretical
performance guarantees via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem sizes using a matrix
factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive experimental validation including comparisons
with local approaches. Our experimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint
of balance structure, we get significant performance and computational gains in prediction and
clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore highlights the usefulness of the global
aspect of balance theory for the analysis of signed networks.
