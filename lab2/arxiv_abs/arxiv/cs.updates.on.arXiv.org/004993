Glucose control serves as the primary method of diabetes management. Current digital therapeutic
approaches for subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) such as the artificial pancreas and
bolus calculators leverage machine learning techniques for predicting subcutaneous glucose
for improved control. Deep learning has recently been applied in healthcare and medical research
to achieve state-of-the-art results in a range of tasks including disease diagnosis, and patient
state prediction among others. In this work, we present a deep learning model that is capable of predicting
glucose levels over a 30-minute horizon with leading accuracy for simulated patient cases (RMSE
= 10.02$\pm$1.28 [mg/dl] and MARD = 5.95$\pm$0.64\%) and real patient cases (RMSE = 21.23$\pm$1.15
[mg/dl] and MARD = 10.53$\pm$1.28\%). In addition, the model also provides competitive performance
in forecasting adverse glycaemic events with minimal time lag both in a simulated patient dataset
(MCC$_{hyperglycaemia}$ = 0.82$\pm$0.06 and MCC$_{hypoglycaemia}$ = 0.76$\pm$0.13) and in
a real patient dataset (MCC$_{hyperglycaemia}$ = 0.79$\pm$0.04 and MCC$_{hypoglycaemia}$ =
0.28$\pm$0.11). This approach is evaluated on a dataset of 10 simulated cases generated from the
UVa/Padova simulator and a clinical dataset of 5 real cases each containing glucose readings, insulin
bolus, and meal (carbohydrate) data. Performance of the recurrent convolutional neural network
is benchmarked against four state-of-the-art algorithms: support vector regression (SVR), latent
variable (LVX) model, autoregressive model (ARX), and neural network for predicting glucose algorithm
(NNPG).
