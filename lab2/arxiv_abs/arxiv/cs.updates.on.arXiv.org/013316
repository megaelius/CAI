During the last years, a well studied biological substrate, namely Physarum polycephalum, has
been proven efficient on finding appropriate and efficient solutions in hard to solve complex mathematical
problems. The plasmodium of P. polycephalum is a single-cell that serves as a prosperous bio-computational
example. Consequently, it has been successfully utilized in the past to solve a variety of path problems
in graphs and combinatorial problems. In this work, this interesting behaviour is mimicked by a
robust unconventional computational model, drawing inspiration from the notion of Cellular and
Learning Automata. Namely, we employ principles of Cellular Automata (CAs) enriched with learning
capabilities to develop a robust computational model, able of modelling appropriately the aforementioned
biological substrate and, thus, capturing its computational capabilities. CAs are very efficient
in modelling biological systems and solving scientific problems, owing to their ability of incarnating
essential properties of a system where global behaviour arises as an effect of simple components,
interacting locally. The resulting computational tool, after combining CAs with learning capabilities,
should be appropriate for modelling the behaviour of living organisms. Thus, the inherent abilities
and computational characteristics of the proposed bio-inspired model are stressed towards the
experimental verification of Physarum's ability to model Logic Gates, while trying to find minimal
paths in properly configured mazes with food sources. The presented simulation results for various
Logic Gates are found in good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the corresponding
experimental results, proving the efficacy of this unconventional bio-inspired model and providing
useful insights for its enhanced usage in various computing applications.
