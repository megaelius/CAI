We consider the tradeoff between the rate and the block-length for a fixed error probability when
we use polar codes and the successive cancellation decoder. The "scaling" between these two parameters
gives interesting engineering insights, and in particular tells us how fast one can approach capacity
if our goal is to achieve a fixed block-error probability. Noticing the fact that for polar codes
the exact scaling behavior is greatly dependent on the choice of the channel, our objective is to
provide scaling laws that hold universally for all the BMS channels. Our approach is based on analyzing
the dynamics of the un-polarized channels. More precisely, we provide bounds on (the exponent of)
the number of sub-channels whose Bhattacharyya constant falls in a fixed interval $[a,b]$. We then
use these bounds to derive trade-offs between the rate and the block-length. The main results of
this paper can be summarized as follows. Let $W$ be a BMS channel with capacity $I(W)$. Consider the
sum of Bhattacharyya parameters of sub-channels chosen (by the polar coding scheme) to transmit
information. If we require this sum to be smaller than a given value $P_{\rm e}>0$, then the required
block-length $N$ scales in terms of the rate $R < I(W)$ as $N \geq \frac{\alpha}{(I(W)-R)^{\underline{\mu}}}$,
where $\alpha$ is a positive constant that depends on $P_{\rm e}$ and $I(W)$. We show that $\underline{\mu}
= 3.579$ is a valid choice, and we conjecture that indeed the value of $\underline{\mu}$ can be improved
to $\underline{\mu}=3.627$, the parameter for the binary erasure channel. Also, we show that with
the same requirement on the sum of Bhattacharyya parameters, the block-length scales in terms of
the rate like $N \leq \frac{\beta}{(I(W)-R)^{\bar{\mu}}}$, where $\beta$ is a constant that depends
on $P_{\rm e}$ and $I(W)$, and $\bar{\mu}=6$.
