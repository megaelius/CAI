In this paper we study the problem of testing graph isomorphism (GI) in the CONGEST distributed model.
In this setting we test whether the distributive network, $G_U$, is isomorphic to $G_K$ which is
given as an input to all the nodes in the network, or alternatively, only to a single node. We first
consider the decision variant of the problem in which the algorithm distinguishes $G_U$ and $G_K$
which are isomorphic from $G_U$ and $G_K$ which are not isomorphic. We provide a randomized algorithm
with $O(n)$ rounds for the setting in which $G_K$ is given only to a single node. We prove that for this
setting the number of rounds of any deterministic algorithm is $\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ rounds,
where $n$ denotes the number of nodes, which implies a separation between the randomized and the
deterministic complexities of deciding GI. We then consider the \emph{property testing} variant
of the problem, where the algorithm is only required to distinguish the case that $G_U$ and $G_K$
are isomorphic from the case that $G_U$ and $G_K$ are \emph{far} from being isomorphic (according
to some predetermined distance measure). We show that every algorithm requires $\Omega(D)$ rounds,
where $D$ denotes the diameter of the network. This lower bound holds even if all the nodes are given
$G_K$ as an input, and even if the message size is unbounded. We provide a randomized algorithm with
an almost matching round complexity of $O(D+(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)^2)$ rounds that is suitable
for dense graphs. We also show that with the same number of rounds it is possible that each node outputs
its mapping according to a bijection which is an \emph{approximated} isomorphism. We conclude
with simple simulation arguments that allow us to obtain essentially tight algorithms with round
complexity $\tilde{O}(D)$ for special families of sparse graphs.
