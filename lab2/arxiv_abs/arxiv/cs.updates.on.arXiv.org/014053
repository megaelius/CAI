The best way to calculate statistics from medical data is to use the data of individual patients.
In some settings, this data is difficult to obtain due to privacy restrictions. In Germany, for example,
it is not possible to pool routine data from different hospitals for research purposes without the
consent of the patients. The DataSHIELD software provides an infrastructure and a set of statistical
methods for joint analyses of distributed data. The contained algorithms are reformulated to work
with aggregated data from the participating sites instead of the individual data. If a desired algorithm
is not implemented in DataSHIELD or cannot be reformulated in such a way, using artificial data is
an alternative. We present a methodology together with a software implementation that builds on
DataSHIELD to create artificial data that preserve complex patterns from distributed individual
patient data. Such data sets of artificial patients, which are not linked to real patients, can then
be used for joint analyses. We use deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) as generative models for capturing
the distribution of data. For the implementation, we employ the package "BoltzmannMachines" from
the Julia programming language and wrap it for use with DataSHIELD, which is based on R. As an exemplary
application, we conduct a distributed analysis with DBMs on a synthetic data set, which simulates
genetic variant data. Patterns from the original data can be recovered in the artificial data using
hierarchical clustering of the virtual patients, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach.
Our implementation adds to DataSHIELD the ability to generate artificial data that can be used for
various analyses, e. g. for pattern recognition with deep learning. This also demonstrates more
generally how DataSHIELD can be flexibly extended with advanced algorithms from languages other
than R.
