Background: A smartphone is a promising tool for daily cardiovascular measurement and mental stress
monitoring. A smartphone camera-based PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and a low-cost thermal camera
can be used to create cheap, convenient and mobile monitoring systems. However, to ensure reliable
monitoring results, a person has to remain still for several minutes while a measurement is being
taken. This is very cumbersome and makes its use in real-life mobile situations quite impractical.
Objective: We propose a system which combines PPG and thermography with the aim of improving cardiovascular
signal quality and capturing stress responses quickly. Methods: Using a smartphone camera with
a low cost thermal camera added on, we built a novel system which continuously and reliably measures
two different types of cardiovascular events: i) blood volume pulse and ii) vasoconstriction/dilation-induced
temperature changes of the nose tip. 17 healthy participants, involved in a series of stress-inducing
mental workload tasks, measured their physiological responses to stressors over a short window
of time (20 seconds) immediately after each task. Participants reported their level of perceived
mental stress using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). We used normalized K-means clustering
to reduce interpersonal differences in the self-reported ratings. For the instant stress inference
task, we built novel low-level feature sets representing variability of cardiovascular patterns.
We then used the automatic feature learning capability of artificial Neural Networks (NN) to improve
the mapping between the extracted set of features and the self-reported ratings. We compared our
proposed method with existing hand-engineered features-based machine learning methods. Results,
