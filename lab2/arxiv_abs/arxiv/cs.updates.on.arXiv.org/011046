Resolution parameters in graph clustering represent a size and quality trade-off. We address the
task of efficiently solving a parameterized graph clustering objective for all values of a resolution
parameter. Specifically, we consider an objective we call LambdaPrime, involving a parameter
$\lambda \in (0,1)$. This objective is related to other parameterized clustering problems, such
as parametric generalizations of modularity, and captures a number of specific clustering problems
as special cases, including sparsest cut and cluster deletion. While previous work provides approximation
results for a single resolution parameter, we seek a set of approximately optimal clusterings for
all values of $\lambda$ in polynomial time. In particular, we ask the question, how small a family
of clusterings suffices to optimize -- or to approximately optimize -- the LambdaPrime objective
over the full possible spectrum of $\lambda$? We obtain a family of logarithmically many clusterings
by solving the parametric linear programming relaxation of LambdaPrime at a logarithmic number
of parameter values, and round their solutions using existing approximation algorithms. We prove
that this number is tight up to a constant factor. Specifically, for a certain class of ring graphs,
a logarithmic number of feasible solutions is required to provide a constant-factor approximation
for the LambdaPrime LP relaxation in all parameter regimes. We additionally show that for any graph
with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, there exists a set of $m$ or fewer clusterings such that for every $\lambda
\in (0,1)$, the family contains an exact solution to the LambdaPrime objective. There also exists
a set of $O(\log n)$ clusterings that provide a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution in all
parameter regimes; we demonstrate simple graph classes for which these bounds are tight.
