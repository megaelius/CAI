The capability for environmental sound recognition (ESR) can determine the fitness of individuals
in a way to avoid dangers or pursue opportunities when critical sound events occur. It still remains
mysterious about the fundamental principles of biological systems that result in such a remarkable
ability. Additionally, the practical importance of ESR has attracted an increasing amount of research
attention, but the chaotic and non-stationary difficulties continue to make it a challenging task.
In this study, we propose a spike-based framework from a more brain-like perspective for the ESR
task. Our framework is a unifying system with a consistent integration of three major functional
parts which are sparse encoding, efficient learning and robust readout. We first introduce a simple
sparse encoding where key-points are used for feature representation, and demonstrate its generalization
to both spike and non-spike based systems. Then, we evaluate the learning properties of different
learning rules in details with our contributions being added for improvements. Our results highlight
the advantages of the multi-spike learning, providing a selection reference for various spike-based
developments. Finally, we combine the multi-spike readout with the other parts to form a system
for ESR. Experimental results show that our framework performs the best as compared to other baseline
approaches. In addition, we show that our spike-based framework has several advantageous characteristics
including early decision making, small dataset acquiring and ongoing dynamic processing. Our
framework is the first attempt to apply the multi-spike characteristic of nervous neurons to ESR.
The outstanding performance of our approach would potentially contribute to draw more research
efforts to push the boundaries of spike-based paradigm to a new horizon.
