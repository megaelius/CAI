This paper investigates the use of clustering in the context of designing the energy system of Zero
Emission Neighborhoods (ZEN). ZENs are neighborhoods who aim to have net zero emissions during
their lifetime. While previous work has used and studied clustering for designing the energy system
of neighborhoods, no article dealt with neighborhoods such as ZEN, which have high requirements
for the solar irradiance time series, include a CO2 factor time series and have a zero emission balance
limiting the possibilities. To this end several methods are used and their results compared. The
results are on the one hand the performances of the clustering itself and on the other hand, the performances
of each method in the optimization model where the data is used. Various aspects related to the clustering
methods are tested. The different aspects studied are: the goal (clustering to obtain days or hours),
the algorithm (k-means or k-medoids), the normalization method (based on the standard deviation
or range of values) and the use of heuristic. The results highlight that k-means offers better results
than k-medoids and that k-means was systematically underestimating the objective value while
k-medoids was constantly overestimating it. When the choice between clustering days and hours
is possible, it appears that clustering days offers the best precision and solving time. The choice
depends on the formulation used for the optimization model and the need to model seasonal storage.
The choice of the normalization method has the least impact, but the range of values method show some
advantages in terms of solving time. When a good representation of the solar irradiance time series
is needed, a higher number of days or using hours is necessary. The choice depends on what solving
time is acceptable.
