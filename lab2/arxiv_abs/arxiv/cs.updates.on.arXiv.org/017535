Operating Earth observing satellites requires efficient planning methods that coordinate activities
of multiple spacecraft. The satellite task planning problem entails selecting actions that best
satisfy mission objectives for autonomous execution. Task scheduling is often performed by human
operators assisted by heuristic or rule-based planning tools. This approach does not efficiently
scale to multiple assets as heuristics frequently fail to properly coordinate actions of multiple
vehicles over long horizons. Additionally, the problem becomes more difficult to solve for large
constellations as the complexity of the problem scales exponentially in the number of requested
observations and linearly in the number of spacecraft. It is expected that new commercial optical
and radar imaging constellations will require automated planning methods to meet stated responsiveness
and throughput objectives. This paper introduces a new approach for solving the satellite scheduling
problem by generating an infeasibility-based graph representation of the problem and finding
a maximal independent set of vertices for the graph. The approach is tested on a scenarios of up to
10,000 requested imaging locations for the Skysat constellation of optical satellites as well
as simulated constellations of up to 24 satellites. Performance is compared with contemporary
graph-traversal and mixed-integer linear programming approaches. Empirical results demonstrate
improvements in both the solution time along with the number of scheduled collections beyond baseline
methods. For large problems, the maximum independent set approach is able find a feasible schedule
with 8% more collections in 75% less time.
