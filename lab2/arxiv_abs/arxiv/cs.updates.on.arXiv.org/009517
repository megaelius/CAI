Full-text search engines are important tools for information retrieval. In a proximity full-text
search, a document is relevant if it contains query terms near each other, especially if the query
terms are frequently occurring words. For each word in a text, we use additional indexes to store
information about nearby words that are at distances from the given word of less than or equal to the
MaxDistance parameter. We showed that additional indexes with three-component keys can be used
to improve the average query execution time by up to 94.7 times if the queries consist of high-frequency
occurring words. In this paper, we present a new search algorithm with even more performance gains.
We consider several strategies for selecting multi-component key indexes for a specific query
and compare these strategies with the optimal strategy. We also present the results of search experiments,
which show that three-component key indexes enable much faster searches in comparison with two-component
key indexes. This is a pre-print of a contribution "Veretennikov A.B. (2019) Proximity Full-Text
Search by Means of Additional Indexes with Multi-component Keys: In Pursuit of Optimal Performance."
