Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides non-invasive measures of
neuronal activity using an endogenous Blood Oxygenation-Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast. This
article introduces a nonlinear dimensionality reduction (Locally Linear Embedding) to extract
informative measures of the underlying neuronal activity from BOLD time-series. The method is
validated using the Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) accuracy of classifying psychiatric
diagnoses using resting-state and task-related fMRI. Methods: Locally Linear Embedding of BOLD
time-series (into each voxel's respective tensor) was used to optimise feature selection. This
uses Gau\ss' Principle of Least Constraint to conserve quantities over both space and time. This
conservation was assessed using LOOCV to greedily select time points in an incremental fashion
on training data that was categorised in terms of psychiatric diagnoses. Findings: The embedded
fMRI gave highly diagnostic performances (> 80%) on eleven publicly-available datasets containing
healthy controls and patients with either Schizophrenia, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD), or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Furthermore, unlike the original fMRI data before or
after using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for artefact reduction, the embedded fMRI furnished
significantly better than chance classification (defined as the majority class proportion) on
ten of eleven datasets. Interpretation: Locally Linear Embedding appears to be a useful feature
extraction procedure that retains important information about patterns of brain activity distinguishing
among psychiatric cohorts.
