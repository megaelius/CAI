We present an epistemic logic equipped with time-stamps in the atoms and epistemic operators, which
allows to reason not only about information available to the different agents, but also about the
moments at which events happens and new knowledge is acquired or deduced. Our logic includes both
an epistemic operator and a belief operator, which allows to model the disclosure of information
that may not be accurate. Our main motivation is to model rich privacy policies in online social networks.
Online Social Networks (OSNs) are increasingly used for social interactions in the modern digital
era, which bring new challenges and concerns in terms of privacy. Most social networks today offer
very limited mechanisms to express the desires of users in terms of how information that affects
their privacy is shared. In particular, most current privacy policy formalisms allow only static
policies, which are not rich enough to express timed properties like "my location after work should
not be disclosed to my boss". The logic we present in this paper enables to express rich properties
and policies in terms of the knowledge available to the different users and the precise time of actions
and deductions. Our framework can be instantiated for different OSNs, by specifying the effect
of the actions in the evolution of the social network and in the knowledge disclosed to each agent.
We present an algorithm for deducing knowledge, which can also be instantiated with different variants
of how the epistemic information is preserved through time. Our algorithm allows to model not only
social networks with eternal information but also networks with ephemeral disclosures. Policies
are modelled as formulae in the logic, which are interpreted over timed traces representing the
evolution of the social network.
