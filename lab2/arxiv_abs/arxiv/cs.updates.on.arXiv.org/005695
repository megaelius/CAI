Existing guarantees in terms of rigorous upper bounds on the generalization error for the original
random forest algorithm, one of the most frequently used machine learning methods, are unsatisfying.
We discuss and evaluate various PAC-Bayesian approaches to derive such bounds. The bounds do not
require additional hold-out data, because the out-of-bag samples from the bagging in the training
process can be exploited. A random forest predicts by taking a majority vote of an ensemble of decision
trees. The first approach is to bound the error of the vote by twice the error of the corresponding
Gibbs classifier (classifying with a single member of the ensemble selected at random). However,
this approach does not take into account the effect of averaging out of errors of individual classifiers
when taking the majority vote. This effect provides a significant boost in performance when the
errors are independent or negatively correlated, but when the correlations are strong the advantage
from taking the majority vote is small. The second approach based on PAC-Bayesian C-bounds takes
dependencies between ensemble members into account, but it requires estimating correlations
between the errors of the individual classifiers. When the correlations are high or the estimation
is poor, the bounds degrade. In our experiments, we compute generalization bounds for random forests
on various benchmark data sets. Because the individual decision trees already perform well, their
predictions are highly correlated and the C-bounds do not lead to satisfactory results. For the
same reason, the bounds based on the analysis of Gibbs classifiers are typically superior and often
reasonably tight. Bounds based on a validation set coming at the cost of a smaller training set gave
better performance guarantees, but worse performance in most experiments.
