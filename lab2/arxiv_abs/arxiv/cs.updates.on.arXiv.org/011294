Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has become a hot topic in the field of remote sensing.
In general, the complex characteristics of hyperspectral data make the accurate classification
of such data challenging for traditional machine learning methods. In addition, hyperspectral
imaging often deals with an inherently nonlinear relation between the captured spectral information
and the corresponding materials. In recent years, deep learning has been recognized as a powerful
feature-extraction tool to effectively address nonlinear problems and widely used in a number
of image processing tasks. Motivated by those successful applications, deep learning has also
been introduced to classify HSIs and demonstrated good performance. This survey paper presents
a systematic review of deep learning-based HSI classification literatures and compares several
strategies for this topic. Specifically, we first summarize the main challenges of HSI classification
which cannot be effectively overcome by traditional machine learning methods, and also introduce
the advantages of deep learning to handle these problems. Then, we build a framework which divides
the corresponding works into spectral-feature networks, spatial-feature networks, and spectral-spatial-feature
networks to systematically review the recent achievements in deep learning-based HSI classification.
In addition, considering the fact that available training samples in the remote sensing field are
usually very limited and training deep networks require a large number of samples, we include some
strategies to improve classification performance, which can provide some guidelines for future
studies on this topic. Finally, several representative deep learning-based classification methods
are conducted on real HSIs in our experiments.
