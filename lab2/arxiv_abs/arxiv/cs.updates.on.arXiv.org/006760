In recent years with the rise of Cloud Computing, many companies providing services in the cloud,
are empowering a new series of services to their catalogue, such as data mining and data processing,
taking advantage of the vast computing resources available to them. Different service definition
proposals have been put forward to address the problem of describing services in Cloud Computing
in a comprehensive way. Bearing in mind that each provider has its own definition of the logic of its
services, and specifically of data mining services, it should be pointed out that the possibility
of describing services in a flexible way between providers is fundamental in order to maintain the
usability and portability of this type of Cloud Computing services. The use of semantic technologies
based on the proposal offered by Linked Data for the definition of services, allows the design and
modelling of data mining services, achieving a high degree of interoperability. In this article
a schema for the definition of data mining services on cloud computing is presented considering
all key aspects of service, such as prices, interfaces, Software Level Agreement, instances or
data mining workflow, among others. The new schema is based on Linked Data, and it reuses other schemata
obtaining a better and more complete definition of the services. In order to validate the completeness
of the scheme, a series of data mining services have been created where a set of algorithms such as
Random Forest or K-Means are modeled as services. In addition, a dataset has been generated including
the definition of the services of several actual Cloud Computing data mining providers, confirming
the effectiveness of the schema.
