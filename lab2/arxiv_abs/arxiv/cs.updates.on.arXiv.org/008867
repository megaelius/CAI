Deep Learning has attracted considerable attention across multiple application domains, including
computer vision, signal processing and natural language processing. Although quite a few single
node deep learning frameworks exist, such as tensorflow, pytorch and keras, we still lack a complete
processing structure that can accommodate large scale data processing, version control, and deployment,
all while staying agnostic of any specific single node framework. To bridge this gap, this paper
proposes a new, higher level framework, i.e. Nemesyst, which uses databases along with model sequentialisation
to allow processes to be fed unique and transformed data at the point of need. This facilitates near
real-time application and makes models available for further training or use at any node that has
access to the database simultaneously. Nemesyst is well suited as an application framework for
internet of things aggregated control systems, deploying deep learning techniques to optimise
individual machines in massive networks. To demonstrate this framework, we adopted a case study
in a novel domain; deploying deep learning to optimise the high speed control of electrical power
consumed by a massive internet of things network of retail refrigeration systems in proportion
to load available on the UK National Grid (a demand side response). The case study demonstrated for
the first time in such a setting how deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (vanilla
and Long-Short-Term Memory) and Generative Adversarial Networks paired with Nemesyst, achieve
compelling performance, whilst still being malleable to future adjustments as both the data and
requirements inevitably change over time.
