Most of the existing tracking methods based on CNN(convolutional neural networks) are too slow
for real-time application despite the excellent tracking precision compared with the traditional
ones. Moreover, neural networks are memory intensive which will take up lots of hardware resources.
In this paper, a feature selection visual tracking algorithm combining CNN based MDNet(Multi-Domain
Network) and RoIAlign was developed. We find that there is a lot of redundancy in feature maps from
convolutional layers. So valid feature maps are selected by mutual information and others are abandoned
which can reduce the complexity and computation of the network and do not affect the precision. The
major problem of MDNet also lies in the time efficiency. Considering the computational complexity
of MDNet is mainly caused by the large amount of convolution operations and fine-tuning of the network
during tracking, a RoIAlign layer which could conduct the convolution over the whole image instead
of each RoI is added to accelerate the convolution and a new strategy of fine-tuning the fully-connected
layers is used to accelerate the update. With RoIAlign employed, the computation speed has been
increased and it shows greater precision than RoIPool. Because RoIAlign can process float number
coordinates by bilinear interpolation. These strategies can accelerate the processing, reduce
the complexity with very low impact on precision and it can run at around 10 fps(while the speed of
MDNet is about 1 fps). The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on a benchmark: OTB100, on which
high precision and speed have been obtained.
