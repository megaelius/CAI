Despite its paramount importance for manifold use cases, sufficiently valid and reliable gait
parameter measurement is still limited to high-tech gait laboratories in large clinics. This is
largely because the majority of gold-standard assessment tools are very costly and highly complex
in their setup and daily operations. Here, we demonstrate the excellent validity and test-retest
repeatability of a novel gait assessment system which is built upon modern convolutional neuronal
networks to extract three-dimensional skeleton joints from monocular frontal-view videos of
walking humans. The present validity study is achieved in comparison to a previously validated
pressure-sensitive walkway system (GAITRite, GS). All measured gait parameters showed excellent
level of concurrent validity. This is proven by Inter-Class-Correlations possessing values between
0.958 and 0.987 for multiple walk trials, at normal and fast gait speeds. Furthermore, the average
measure of difference between the two systems is below 3.5% of corresponding gait parameter mean
value across all measured parameters (0.04% - 3.25%). The percentage error values of the assessed
system in relation to GS are between 5% and 13.5% of corresponding gait parameter mean values, hence
being significantly below the threshold of clinical acceptability (30%). The test-retest-repeatability
yields ICC values between 0.915 and 0.950, being on the same level with the GS system. In conclusion,
we are convinced that our results can pave the way for cost, space and operation effective gait analysis
in the broad mainstream. Most sensor-based systems are costly, have to be operated by extensively
trained personnel or possess considerable complexity (e.g. wearable sensors). In contrast, a
sufficient video for the assessment method presented here can be acquired by anyone, without much
training, via a smartphone camera.
