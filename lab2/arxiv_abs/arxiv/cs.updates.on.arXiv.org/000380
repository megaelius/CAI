Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is a technology component for LTE-A. The existing researches
allow D2D as an underlay to the cellular network to increase the spectral efficiency. In this book,
D2D communication underlaying cellular networks is studied. Some physical-layer techniques
and cross-layer optimization methods on resource management and interference avoidance are proposed
and discussed. WINNER II channel models is applied to be the signal and interference model and simulation
results show that the performance of D2D link is closely related to the distance between D2D transmitter
and receiver and that between interference source and the receiver. Besides, by power control,
D2D SINR degrades, which will naturally contribute to low interference to cellular communication.
A simple mode selection method of D2D communication is introduced. Based on path-loss (PL) mode
selection criterion, D2D gives better performance than traditional cellular system. When D2D
pair is farther away from the BS, a better results can be obtained. Game theory, which offers a wide
variety of analytical tools to study the complex interactions of players and predict their choices,
can be used for power and radio resource management in D2D communication. A reverse iterative combinatorial
auction is formulated as a mechanism to allocate the spectrum resources for D2D communications
with multiple user pairs sharing the same channel. In addition, a game theoretic approach is developed
to implement joint scheduling, power control and channel allocation for D2D communication. Finally,
joint power and spectrum resource allocation method is studied under consideration of battery
lifetime, which is an important application of D2D communication on increasing user's energy efficiency.
The simulation results show that all these methods have beneficial effects on improving the system
performance.
