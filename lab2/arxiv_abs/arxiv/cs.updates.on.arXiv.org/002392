Despite the increasing popularity and successful examples of crowdsourcing, its openness overshadows
important episodes when elaborate sabotage derailed or severely hindered collective efforts.
A service exchange dilemma arises when non-cooperation among self-interested users, and zero
social welfare is obtained at myopic equilibrium. Traditional rating protocols are not effective
to overcome the inefficiency of the socially undesirable equilibrium due to specific features
of crowdsourcing: a large number of anonymous users having asymmetric service requirements, different
service capabilities, and dynamically joining/leaving a crowdsourcing platform with imperfect
monitoring. In this paper, we develop the first game-theoretic design of the two-sided rating protocol
to stimulate cooperation among self-interested users, which consists of a recommended strategy
and a rating update rule. The recommended strategy recommends a desirable behavior from three predefined
plans according to intrinsic parameters, while the rating update rule involves the update of ratings
of both users, and uses differential punishments that punish users with different ratings differently.
By quantifying necessary and sufficient conditions for a sustainable social norm, we formulate
the problem of designing an optimal two-sided rating protocol that maximizes the social welfare
among all sustainable protocols, provide design guidelines for optimal two-sided rating protocols
and a low-complexity algorithm to select optimal design parameters in an alternate manner. Finally,
illustrative results show the validity and effectiveness of our proposed protocol designed for
service exchange dilemma in crowdsourcing.
