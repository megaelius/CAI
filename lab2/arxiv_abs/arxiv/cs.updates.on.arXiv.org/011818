Nektar++ is an open-source framework that provides a flexible, high-performance and scalable
platform for the development of solvers for partial differential equations using the high-order
spectral/$hp$ element method. In particular, Nektar++ aims to overcome the complex implementation
challenges that are often associated with high-order methods, thereby allowing them to be more
readily used in a wide range of application areas. In this paper, we present the algorithmic, implementation
and application developments associated with our Nektar++ version 5.0 release. We describe some
of the key software and performance developments, including our strategies on parallel I/O, on
in situ processing, the use of collective operations for exploiting current and emerging hardware,
and interfaces to enable multi-solver coupling. Furthermore, we provide details on a newly developed
Python interface that enables a more rapid introduction for new users unfamiliar with spectral/$hp$
element methods, C++ and/or Nektar++. This release also incorporates a number of numerical method
developments - in particular: the method of moving frames, which provides an additional approach
for the simulation of equations on embedded curvilinear manifolds and domains; a means of handling
spatially variable polynomial order; and a novel technique for quasi-3D simulations to permit
spatially-varying perturbations to the geometry in the homogeneous direction. Finally, we demonstrate
the new application-level features provided in this release, namely: a facility for generating
high-order curvilinear meshes called NekMesh; a novel new AcousticSolver for aeroacoustic problems;
our development of a 'thick' strip model for the modelling of fluid-structure interaction problems
in the context of vortex-induced vibrations. We conclude by commenting some directions for future
code development and expansion.
