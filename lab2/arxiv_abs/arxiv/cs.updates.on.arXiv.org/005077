Objective: The objectives of this paper are to determine the optimal location for ultrasound transducer
placement on the anterior forearm for imaging maximum muscle deformations during different hand
motions and to investigate the effect of using a sparse set of ultrasound scanlines for motion classification
for ultrasound-based muscle computer interfaces (MCIs). Methods: The optimal placement of the
ultrasound transducer along the forearm is identified using freehand 3D reconstructions of the
muscle thickness during rest and motion completion. From the ultrasound images acquired from the
optimally placed transducer, we determine classification accuracy with equally spaced scanlines
across the cross-sectional field-of-view (FOV). Furthermore, we investigated the unique contribution
of each scanline to class discrimination using Fisher criteria (FC) and mutual information (MI)
with respect to motion discriminability. Results: Experiments with 5 able-bodied subjects show
that the maximum muscle deformation occurred between 30-50% of the forearm length for multiple
degrees-of-freedom. The average classification accuracy was 94.6% with the entire 128 scanline
image and 94.5% with 4 equally-spaced scanlines. However, no significant improvement in classification
accuracy was observed with optimal scanline selection using FC and MI. Conclusion: For an optimally
placed transducer, a small subset of ultrasound scanlines can be used instead of a full imaging array
without sacrificing performance in terms of classification accuracy for multiple degrees-of-freedom.
Significance: The selection of a small subset of transducer elements can enable the reduction of
computation, and simplification of the instrumentation and power consumption of wearable sonomyographic
MCIs particularly for rehabilitation and gesture recognition applications.
