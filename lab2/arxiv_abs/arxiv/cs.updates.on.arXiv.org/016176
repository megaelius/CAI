Many animals live in societies where individuals frequently interact socially with each other.
The social structures of these systems can be studied in depth by means of network analysis. A large
number of studies on animal social networks in many species have in recent years been carried out
within the biological research field of animal behaviour and have provided new insights into behaviour,
ecology, and social evolution. This line of research is currently not well connected to the field
of complex systems. Here we provide an introduction to animal social networks for complex systems
scientists. We believe that an increased integration of animal social networks with the interdisciplinary
field of complex systems & networks would be beneficial for various reasons. Increased collaboration
between researchers in this field and biologists studying animal social systems could be valuable
in solving challenges of particular importance to animal social network research. Furthermore,
high-resolution datasets of social networks from different animal species can be useful for investigating
general hypotheses about complex systems. In this paper, we describe what animal social networks
are and how they are scientifically important; we give an overview of the methods commonly used to
study animal social networks; and finally we highlight challenges in the study of animal social
networks where input from researchers with expertise in complex systems could be particularly
valuable. We hope that this will help to facilitate further interdisciplinary collaborations
involving animal social networks, and lead to better integration of these networks into the field
of complex systems.
