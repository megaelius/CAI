Ethereum Research team has proposed a family of Casper blockchain consensus protocols for Ethereum
2.0. It has been shown in the literature that Casper Friendly Finality Gadget (Casper FFG) for Ethereum
2.0's beacon network cannot achieve liveness property in partially synchronous networks such
as the Internet environment. The ``Correct-by-Construction'' family of Casper blockchain consensus
protocols (CBC Casper) has been proposed as a finality gadget for the future release of Ethereum
2.0 blockchain. Unfortunately, neither constructive finality rule nor satisfactory liveness
property has been obtained for CBC Casper, and it is commonly believed that CBC Casper could not achieve
liveness property in asynchronous networks. This paper provides the first probabilistic CBC Casper
protocol that achieves liveness property against $t=\lfloor \frac{n-1}{3}\rfloor$ Byzantine
participants in complete asynchronous networks. The seminal work by Fisher, Lynch, and Paterson
(FLP) shows that there does not exist a deterministic BFT protocol in complete asynchronous networks
against a single failure. Existing BFT protocols for complete asynchronous networks are all probabilistic
which are based either on individual coin-flipping or on common coin-flipping. This paper proposes
the first secure and deterministic leaderless blockchain BFT protocol XP against $t=\lfloor \frac{n-1}{3}\rfloor$
Byzantine participants in complete asynchronous networks. This result does not contradict with
FLP's impossibility results since XP leverages the total order properties of candidate blocks
in blockchains (similar properties may not hold for general BFT application scenarios).
