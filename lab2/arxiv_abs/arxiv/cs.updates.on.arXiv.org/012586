In this paper, we propose a novel, effective and simpler end-to-end image clustering auto-encoder
algorithm: ICAE. The algorithm uses PEDCC (Predefined Evenly-Distributed Class Centroids) as
the clustering centers, which ensures the inter-class distance of latent features is maximal,
and adds data distribution constraint, data augmentation constraint, auto-encoder reconstruction
constraint and Sobel smooth constraint to improve the clustering performance. Specifically,
we perform one-to-one data augmentation to learn the more effective features. The data and the augmented
data are simultaneously input into the autoencoder to obtain latent features and the augmented
latent features whose similarity are constrained by an augmentation loss. Then, making use of the
maximum mean discrepancy distance (MMD), we combine the latent features and augmented latent features
to make their distribution close to the PEDCC distribution (uniform distribution between classes,
Dirac distribution within the class) to further learn clustering-oriented features. At the same
time, the MSE of the original input image and reconstructed image is used as reconstruction constraint,
and the Sobel smooth loss to build generalization constraint to improve the generalization ability.
Finally, extensive experiments on three common datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, COIL20 are conducted.
The experimental results show that the algorithm has achieved the best clustering results so far.
In addition, we can use the predefined PEDCC class centers, and the decoder to clearly generate the
samples of each class. The code can be downloaded at https://github.com/zyWang-Power/Clustering!
