The problem of data security in IEEE 802.15.4 systems on Pololu Wixel devices is solved, examples
of hardware and software implementation of encryption and decryption of different devices on the
same platform are given. The proposed approaches can be used in the development, implementation
and operation of wireless enterprise, industrial, and personal systems. Possible areas of development
for this work are related to research on improving encryption algorithms (increasing key length,
using asymmetric ciphers, etc.), comparing their performance, and implementing a complete data
exchange protocol. During the work there were problems in the implementation of encryption algorithms
on low-power processors. During the work, a number of issues were resolved regarding type reduction,
addressing, memory space, buffer overflow, and more. Issues resolved with reconciliation of receiver
and transmitter operation. Examples of hardware and software implementation of encryption and
decryption of different devices based on Pololu Wixel are given in the paper. The basic task of building
a secure communication channel by encrypting data in the channel was solved and firmware and application
software were obtained to fully validate the devices. In addition, this work has great application
potential, since the implementation of encryption in existing systems will have a small impact
on implementation and will not affect the project budget, but will dramatically improve the security
of data transmission in these networks. The proposed approaches can be used in the development,
implementation and operation of wireless enterprise, industrial, and personal systems. Continuing
this work may be to test the performance of other protocols on this and similar hardware for systems
that may be embedded in short-range wireless communication projects of short-range standards.
