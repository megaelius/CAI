As tremendous amount of data being generated everyday from human activity and from devices equipped
with sensing capabilities, cloud computing emerges as a scalable and cost-effective platform
to store and manage the data. While benefits of cloud computing are numerous, security concerns
arising when data and computation are outsourced to a third party still hinder the complete movement
to the cloud. In this paper, we focus on the problem of data privacy on the cloud, particularly on access
controls over stream data. The nature of stream data and the complexity of sharing data make access
control a more challenging issue than in traditional archival databases. We present Streamforce
- a system allowing data owners to securely outsource their data to the cloud. The owner specifies
fine-grained policies which are enforced by the cloud. The latter performs most of the heavy computations,
while learning nothing about the data. To this end, we employ a number of encryption schemes, including
deterministic encryption, proxy-based attribute based encryption and sliding-window encryption.
In Streamforce, access control policies are modeled as secure continuous queries, which entails
minimal changes to existing stream processing engines, and allows for easy expression of a wide-range
of policies. In particular, Streamforce comes with a number of secure query operators including
Map, Filter, Join and Aggregate. Finally, we implement Streamforce over an open source stream processing
engine (Esper) and evaluate its performance on a cloud platform. The results demonstrate practical
performance for many real-world applications, and although the security overhead is visible,
Streamforce is highly scalable.
