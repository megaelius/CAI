We present a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that is based on radio signals
and the association of specular multipath components (MPCs) with geometric features. Especially
in indoor scenarios, robust localization from radio signals is challenging due to diffuse multipath
propagation, unknown MPC-feature association, and limited visibility of features. In our approach,
specular reflections at flat surfaces are described in terms of virtual anchors (VAs) that are mirror
images of the physical anchors (PAs). The positions of these VAs and possibly also of the PAs are unknown.
We develop a Bayesian model of the SLAM problem including the unknown MPC-VA/PA association. We
represent this model by a factor graph, which enables the use of the belief propagation (BP) scheme
for efficient marginalization of the joint posterior distribution. The resulting BP-based SLAM
algorithm detects the VAs associated with the PAs and estimates jointly the time-varying position
of the mobile agent and the positions of the VAs and possibly also of the PAs, thereby leveraging the
MPCs in the radio signal for improved accuracy and robustness of agent localization. A core aspect
of the algorithm is BP-based probabilistic MPC-VA/PA association. Moreover, for improved initialization
of new VA positions, the states of unobserved potential VAs are modeled as a random finite set and
propagated in time by means of a "zero-measurement" probability hypothesis density filter. The
proposed BP-based SLAM algorithm has a low computational complexity and scales well in all relevant
system parameters. Experimental results using both synthetically generated measurements and
real ultra-wideband radio signals demonstrate the excellent performance of the algorithm in challenging
indoor environments.
