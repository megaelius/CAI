In the 34 developed and 156 developing countries, there are about 132 million disabled people who
need a wheelchair constituting 1.86% of the world population. Moreover, there are millions of people
suffering from diseases related to motor disabilities, which cause inability to produce controlled
movement in any of the limbs or even head.The paper proposes a system to aid people with motor disabilities
by restoring their ability to move effectively and effortlessly without having to rely on others
utilizing an eye-controlled electric wheelchair. The system input was images of the users eye that
were processed to estimate the gaze direction and the wheelchair was moved accordingly. To accomplish
such a feat, four user-specific methods were developed, implemented and tested; all of which were
based on a benchmark database created by the authors.The first three techniques were automatic,
employ correlation and were variants of template matching, while the last one uses convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Different metrics to quantitatively evaluate the performance of each
algorithm in terms of accuracy and latency were computed and overall comparison is presented. CNN
exhibited the best performance (i.e. 99.3% classification accuracy), and thus it was the model
of choice for the gaze estimator, which commands the wheelchair motion. The system was evaluated
carefully on 8 subjects achieving 99% accuracy in changing illumination conditions outdoor and
indoor. This required modifying a motorized wheelchair to adapt it to the predictions output by
the gaze estimation algorithm. The wheelchair control can bypass any decision made by the gaze estimator
and immediately halt its motion with the help of an array of proximity sensors, if the measured distance
goes below a well-defined safety margin.
