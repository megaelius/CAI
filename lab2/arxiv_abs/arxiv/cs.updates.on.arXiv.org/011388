In this thesis, a detailed study shows that closed itemsets and minimal generators play a key role
for concisely representing both frequent itemsets and association rules. These itemsets structure
the search space into equivalence classes such that each class gathers the itemsets appearing in
the same subset aka objects or transactions of the given data. In this respect, we proposed lossless
reductions of the minimal generator set thanks to a new substitution-based process. Our theoretical
results are extended to the association rule framework in order to reduce as much as possible the
number of retained rules without information loss. We then give a thorough formal study of the related
inference mechanism allowing to derive all redundant association rules, starting from the retained
ones. We also lead a thorough exploration of the disjunctive search space, where itemsets are characterized
by their respective disjunctive supports, instead of the conjunctive ones. This exploration is
motivated by the fact that, in some applications, such information brings richer knowledge to the
end-users. To obtain a redundancy free representation of the disjunctive search space, an interesting
solution consists in selecting a unique element to represent itemsets covering the same set of data.
Two itemsets are equivalent if their respective items cover the same set of data. In this regard,
we introduced a new operator dedicated to this task. In each induced equivalence class, minimal
elements are called essential itemsets, while the largest one is called disjunctive closed itemset.
The introduced operator is then at the roots of new concise representations of frequent itemsets.
We also exploit the disjunctive search space to derive generalized association rules. These latter
rules generalize classic ones to also offer disjunction and negation connectors between items,
in addition to the conjunctive one.
