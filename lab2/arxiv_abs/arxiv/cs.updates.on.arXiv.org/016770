The FOCS'19 paper of Le and Solomon, culminating a long line of research on Euclidean spanners, proves
that the lightness (normalized weight) of the greedy $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner in $\mathbb{R}^d$
is $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-d})$ for any $d = O(1)$ and any $\epsilon = \Omega(n^{-\frac{1}{d-1}})$
(where $\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors of $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$), and also shows the
existence of point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for which any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner must have lightness
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-d})$. Given this tight bound on the lightness, a natural arising question
is whether a better lightness bound can be achieved using Steiner points. Our first result is a construction
of Steiner spanners in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with lightness $O(\epsilon^{-1} \log \Delta)$, where $\Delta$
is the spread of the point set. In the regime of $\Delta \ll 2^{1/\epsilon}$, this provides an improvement
over the lightness bound of Le and Solomon [FOCS 2019]; this regime of parameters is of practical
interest, as point sets arising in real-life applications (e.g., for various random distributions)
have polynomially bounded spread, while in spanner applications $\epsilon$ often controls the
precision, and it sometimes needs to be much smaller than $O(1/\log n)$. Moreover, for spread polynomially
bounded in $1/\epsilon$, this upper bound provides a quadratic improvement over the non-Steiner
bound of Le and Solomon [FOCS 2019], We then demonstrate that such a light spanner can be constructed
in $O_{\epsilon}(n)$ time for polynomially bounded spread, where $O_{\epsilon}$ hides a factor
of $\mathrm{poly}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$. Finally, we extend the construction to higher dimensions,
proving a lightness upper bound of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-(d+1)/2} + \epsilon^{-2}\log \Delta)$
for any $3\leq d = O(1)$ and any $\epsilon = \Omega(n^{-\frac{1}{d-1}})$.
