Mindfulness is the state of paying attention to the present moment on purpose and meditation is the
technique to obtain this state. This study aims to develop a robot assistant that facilitates mindfulness
training by means of a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system. To achieve this goal, we collected
EEG signals from two groups of subjects engaging in a meditative vs. nonmeditative human robot interaction
(HRI) and evaluated cerebral hemispheric asymmetry, which is recognized as a well defined indicator
of emotional states. Moreover, using self reported affective states, we strived to explain asymmetry
changes based on pre and post experiment mood alterations. We found that unlike earlier meditation
studies, the frontocentral activations in alpha and theta frequency bands were not influenced
by robot guided mindfulness practice, however there was a significantly greater right sided activity
in the occipital gamma band of Meditation group, which is attributed to increased sensory awareness
and open monitoring. In addition, there was a significant main effect of Time on participants self
reported affect, indicating an improved mood after interaction with the robot regardless of the
interaction type. Our results suggest that EEG responses during robot-guided meditation hold
promise in realtime detection and neurofeedback of mindful state to the user, however the experienced
neurophysiological changes may differ based on the meditation practice and recruited tools. This
study is the first to report EEG changes during mindfulness practice with a robot. We believe that
our findings driven from an ecologically valid setting, can be used in development of future BCI
systems that are integrated with social robots for health applications.
