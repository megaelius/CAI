Topology optimization is one of the most-used method to inversely determine the geometrical configurations
of structures. In the current density method-based topology optimization, the design variable
used to represent the structure was usually defined on three-dimensional domains or reduced two-dimensional
planes, with the deficiency of the general two-dimensional manifolds. Therefore, this article
focuses on developing the density method-based topology optimization on two-dimensional manifolds.
In this developed method, material interpolation is implemented on a material parameter in the
partial differential equation used to describe a physical field, when this physical field is defined
on a two-dimensional manifold; the density variable is used to formulate a mixed boundary condition
of a physical field and implement the penalization between two different types of boundary conditions,
when this physical field is defined on a three-dimensional domain with its boundary conditions
defined on the two-dimensional manifold corresponding the surface or interface of this three-dimensional
domain. Based on the homeomorphic property of two-dimensional manifolds, several typical two-dimensional
manifolds, e.g., sphere, torus, M\"{o}bius strip and Klein bottle, are included in the numerical
tests. This method has been tested and demonstrated by the problems in the areas of soft matter, heat
transfer and electromagnetics. The two-dimensional manifold and derived structural pattern
composes a fiber bundle, and they are the base manifold and fiber of this fiber bundle, respectively;
hence, this developed method is a topology optimization method of fiber bundles.
