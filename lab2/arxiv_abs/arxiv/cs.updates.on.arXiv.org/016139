Speckle reduction is a longstanding topic in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Many different
schemes have been proposed for the restoration of intensity SAR images. Among the different possible
approaches, methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently shown to reach
state-of-the-art performance for SAR image restoration. CNN training requires good training
data: many pairs of speckle-free / speckle-corrupted images. This is an issue in SAR applications,
given the inherent scarcity of speckle-free images. To handle this problem, this paper analyzes
different strategies one can adopt, depending on the speckle removal task one wishes to perform
and the availability of multitemporal stacks of SAR data. The first strategy applies a CNN model,
trained to remove additive white Gaussian noise from natural images, to a recently proposed SAR
speckle removal framework: MuLoG (MUlti-channel LOgarithm with Gaussian denoising). No training
on SAR images is performed, the network is readily applied to speckle reduction tasks. The second
strategy considers a novel approach to construct a reliable dataset of speckle-free SAR images
necessary to train a CNN model. Finally, a hybrid approach is also analyzed: the CNN used to remove
additive white Gaussian noise is trained on speckle-free SAR images. The proposed methods are compared
to other state-of-the-art speckle removal filters, to evaluate the quality of denoising and to
discuss the pros and cons of the different strategies. Along with the paper, we make available the
weights of the trained network to allow its usage by other researchers.
