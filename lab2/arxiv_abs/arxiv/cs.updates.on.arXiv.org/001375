In this paper, we study inter-operator spectrum sharing and intra-operator resource allocation
in shared spectrum access communication systems and propose efficient dynamic solutions to address
both inter-operator and intra-operator resource allocation optimization problems. For inter-operator
spectrum sharing, we present two competent approaches, namely the subcarrier gain based sharing
and fragmentation based sharing, which carry out fair and flexible allocation of the available
shareable spectrum among the operators subject to certain well-defined sharing rules, traffic
demands and channel propagation characteristics. Subcarrier gain based spectrum sharing scheme
has been found to be more efficient in terms of achieved throughput. However, fragmentation based
sharing is more attractive in terms of computational complexity. For intra-operator resource
allocation, we consider resource allocation problem with users' dissimilar service requirements,
where the operator supports users with delay-constraint and non-delay constraint service requirements,
simultaneously. This optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem and
nonconvex, which is computationally very expensive, and the complexity grows exponentially with
the number of integer variables. We propose less-complex and efficient suboptimal solution based
on formulating exact linearization, linear approximation and convexification techniques for
the nonlinear and/or non-convex objective functions and constraints. Extensive simulation performance
analysis has been carried out that validates the efficiency of the proposed solution.
