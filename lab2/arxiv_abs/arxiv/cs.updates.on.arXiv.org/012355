The hippocampal system contains neural populations that encode an animal's position and velocity
as it navigates through space. Here, we show that such populations can embed two codes within their
spike trains: a firing rate code (R) conveyed by within-cell spike intervals, and a co-firing rate
code (R') conveyed by between-cell spike intervals. These two codes behave as conjugates of one
another, obeying an analog of the uncertainty principle from physics: information conveyed in
R comes at the expense of information in R', and vice versa. An exception to this trade-off occurs
when spike trains encode a pair of conjugate variables, such as position and velocity, which do not
compete for capacity across R and R'. To illustrate this, we describe two biologically inspired
methods for decoding R and R', referred to as sigma and sigma-chi decoding, respectively. Simulations
of head direction (HD) and grid cells show that if firing rates are tuned for position (but not velocity),
then position is recovered by sigma decoding, whereas velocity is recovered by sigma-chi decoding.
Conversely, simulations of oscillatory interference among theta-modulated "speed cells" show
that if co-firing rates are tuned for position (but not velocity), then position is recovered by
sigma-chi decoding, whereas velocity is recovered by sigma decoding. Between these two extremes,
information about both variables can be distributed across both channels, and partially recovered
by both decoders. These results suggest that neurons with different spatial and temporal tuning
properties-such as speed versus grid cells-might not encode different information, but rather,
distribute similar information about position and velocity in different ways across R and R'.
