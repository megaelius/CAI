In a recent work, Chierichetti et al. studied the following "fair" variants of classical clustering
problems such as $k$-means and $k$-median: given a set of $n$ data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a
binary type associated to each data point, the goal is to cluster the points while ensuring that the
proportion of each type in each cluster is roughly the same as its underlying proportion. Subsequent
work has focused on either extending this setting to when each data point has multiple, non-disjoint
sensitive types such as race and gender, or to address the problem that the clustering algorithms
in the above work do not scale well. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to clustering
with fairness constraints that involve multiple, non-disjoint types, that is {\em also scalable}.
Our approach is based on novel constructions of coresets: for the $k$-median objective, we construct
an $\varepsilon$-coreset of size $O(\Gamma k^2 \varepsilon^{-d})$ where $\Gamma$ is the number
of distinct collections of groups that a point may belong to, and for the $k$-means objective, we
show how to construct an $\varepsilon$-coreset of size $O(\Gamma k^3\varepsilon^{-d-1})$. The
former result is the first known coreset construction for the fair clustering problem with the $k$-median
objective, and the latter result removes the dependence on the size of the full dataset as in Schmidt
et al. and generalizes it to multiple, non-disjoint types. Plugging our coresets into existing
algorithms for fair clustering such as Backurs et al. results in the fastest algorithms for several
cases. Empirically, we assess our approach over the Adult and Bank dataset, and show that the coreset
sizes are much smaller than the full dataset; applying coresets indeed accelerates the running
time of computing the fair clustering objective while ensuring that the resulting objective difference
is small.
