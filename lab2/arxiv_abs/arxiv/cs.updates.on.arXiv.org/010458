Communication range in passive Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) front-end devices is a
critical barrier in the real-world implementation of this low-cost technology. Purely passive
RFID tags power up by harvesting the limited RF energy transmitted by the interrogator, and communicate
by backscattering the incident signal. This mode of communication keeps manufacturing costs below
a few cents per tag, but the limited power available at the tag undermines long-range deployment.
In this paper, we present an approach to use Photovoltaics (PV) to augment the available energy at
the tag to improve read range and sensing capabilities. We provide this extra-energy to the RFID
integrated circuit (IC) using minimum additional electronics yet enabling persistent sensor-data
acquisition. Current and emerging thin-film PV technologies have significant potential for being
very low-cost, hence eliminating the barrier for implementation and making of PV-RFID wireless
sensors. We reduce the long-range PV-RFID idea to practice by creating functional prototypes of
i) a wireless building environment sensor to monitor temperature, and ii) an embedded tracker to
find lost golf balls. The read range of PV-RFID is enhanced 8 times compared to conventional passive
devices. In addition, the PV-RFID tags persistently transmit large volumes of sensor data (>0.14
million measurements per day) without using batteries. For communication range and energy persistence,
we observe good agreement between calculated estimates and experimental results. We have also
identified avenues for future research to develop low-cost PV-RFID devices for wireless sensing
in the midst of the other competitive wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, Long Range
(LoRa) backscatter etc.
