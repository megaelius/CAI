In this paper, we propose a semi-formal verification framework for single-flux quantum (SFQ) circuits
called VeriSFQ, using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) standard. The considered
SFQ technology is superconducting digital electronic devices that operate at cryogenic temperatures
with active circuit elements called the Josephson junction, which operate at high switching speeds
and low switching energy - allowing SFQ circuits to operate at frequencies over 300 gigahertz. Due
to key differences between SFQ and CMOS logic, verification techniques for the former are not as
advanced as the latter. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient verification techniques as the
complexity of SFQ circuits scales. The VeriSFQ framework focuses on verifying the key circuit and
gate-level properties of SFQ logic: fanout, gate-level pipeline, path balancing, and input-to-output
latency. The combinational circuits considered in analyzing the performance of VeriSFQ are: Kogge-Stone
adders (KSA), array multipliers, integer dividers, and select ISCAS'85 combinational benchmark
circuits. Methods of introducing bugs into SFQ circuit designs for verification detection were
experimented with - including stuck-at faults, fanout errors, unbalanced paths, and functional
bugs like incorrect logic gates. In addition, we propose an SFQ verification benchmark consisting
of combinational SFQ circuits that exemplify SFQ logic properties and present the performance
of the VeriSFQ framework on these benchmark circuits. The portability and reusability of the UVM
standard allows the VeriSFQ framework to serve as a foundation for future SFQ semi-formal verification
techniques.
