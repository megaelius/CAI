Existing e-commerce search engines typically support search only over objective attributes,
such as price and locations, leaving the more desirable subjective attributes, such as romantic
vibe and worklife balance unsearchable. We found that this is also the case for Recruit Group, which
operates a wide range of online booking and search services, including jobs, travel, housing, bridal,
dining, beauty, and where each service is among the biggest in Japan, if not internationally. We
present our progress towards productionizing a recent subjective search prototype (OpineDB)
developed by Megagon Labs for Recruit Group. Several components within OpineDB are enhanced to
satisfy production demands, including adding a BERT language model pre-trained on massive hospitality
domain review corpora. We also found that the challenges of productionizing the system are beyond
enhancing the components. In particular, an important requirement in production-quality systems
is to instrument a proper way of measuring the search quality, which is extremely tricky when the
search results are subjective. This led to the creation of a high-quality benchmark dataset from
scratch, involving over 600 queries by user interviews and a collection of more than 120,000 query-entity
relevancy labels. Also, we found that the existing search algorithms do not meet the search quality
standard required by production systems. Consequently, we enhanced the ranking model by fine-tuning
several search algorithms and combining them under a learning-to-rank framework. The model achieves
5%-10% overall precision improvement and 90+% precision on more than half of the benchmark testing
queries making these queries ready for AB-testing. While some enhancements can be immediately
applied to other verticals, our experience reveals that benchmarking and fine-tuning ranking
algorithms are specific to each domain and cannot be avoided.
