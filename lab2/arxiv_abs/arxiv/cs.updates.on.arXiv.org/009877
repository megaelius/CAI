A hitting-set generator (HSG) is a polynomial map $G:\mathbb{F}^k \to \mathbb{F}^n$ such that
for all $n$-variate polynomials $C$ of small enough circuit size and degree, if $C$ is nonzero, then
$C\circ G$ is nonzero. In this paper, we give a new construction of such an HSG assuming that we have
an explicit polynomial of sufficient hardness. Formally, we prove the following result over any
field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic zero: Suppose $P(z_1,\ldots, z_k)$ is an explicit $k$-variate
degree $d$ polynomial that is not computable by circuits of size $s$. Then, there is an explicit HSG
$G_P:\mathbb{F}^{2k} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}^n$ such that every nonzero $n$-variate degree
$D$ polynomial $C(\mathbf{x})$ computable by circuits of size $s'$ circuits satisfies $C \neq
0 \Rightarrow C \circ G_P \neq 0$, if $O(n^{10k}d^3 D s')< s$. This is the first HSG in the algebraic
setting that yields a complete derandomization of polynomial identity testing (PIT) for general
circuits from a suitable algebraic hardness assumption. Unlike the prior constructions of such
maps, our construction is purely algebraic and does not rely on the notion of combinatorial designs.
As a direct consequence, we show that even saving a single point from the "trivial" explicit, exponential
sized hitting sets for constant-variate polynomials of low individual-degree which are computable
by small circuits, implies a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for PIT. More precisely,
we show the following: Let $k$ be a large enough constant. Suppose for every $s$ large enough, there
is an explicit hitting set of size at most $((s+1)^k - 1)$ for the class of $k$-variate polynomials
of individual degree $s$ that are computable by size $s$ circuits. Then there is an explicit hitting
set of size $s^{O(k^2)}$ for the class of $s$-variate polynomials, of degree $s$, that are computable
by size $s$ circuits.
