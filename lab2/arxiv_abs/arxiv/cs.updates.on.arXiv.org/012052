For linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, the design of an optimal controller is a commonly encountered
problem in many applications. Among all the optimization approaches available, the linear quadratic
regulator (LQR) methodology certainly garners much attention and interest. As is well-known,
standard numerical tools in linear algebra are readily available which enable the determination
of the optimal static LQR feedback gain matrix when all the system state variables are measurable.
However, in various certain scenarios where some of the system state variables are not measurable,
and consequent prescribed structural constraints on the controller structure arise, the optimization
problem can become intractable due to the non-convexity characteristics that can then be present.
In such cases, there have been some first-order methods proposed to cater to these problems, but
all of these first-order optimization methods, if at all successful, are limited to only linear
convergence. To speed up the convergence, a second-order approach in the matrix space is essential,
with appropriate methodology to solve the linear equality constrained static output feedback
(SOF) problem with a suitably defined linear quadratic cost function. Thus along this line, in this
work, an efficient method is proposed in the matrix space to calculate the Hessian matrix by solving
several Lyapunov equations. Then a new optimization technique is applied to deal with the indefiniteness
of the Hessian matrix. Subsequently, through Newton's method with linear equality constraints,
a second-order optimization algorithm is developed to effectively solve the constrained SOF LQR
problem. Finally, two numerical examples are described which demonstrate the applicability and
effectiveness of the proposed method.
