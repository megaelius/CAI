Mobile edge cloud is emerging as a promising technology to the internet of things and cyber-physical
system applications such as smart home and intelligent video surveillance. In a smart home, various
sensors are deployed to monitor the home environment and physiological health of individuals.
The data collected by sensors are sent to an application, where numerous algorithms for emotion
and sentiment detection, activity recognition and situation management are applied to provide
healthcare- and emergency-related services and to manage resources at the home. The executions
of these algorithms require a vast amount of computing and storage resources. To address the issue,
the conventional approach is to send the collected data to an application on an internet cloud. This
approach has several problems such as high communication latency, communication energy consumption
and unnecessary data traffic to the core network. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional
cloud-based approach, a new system called mobile edge cloud is proposed. In mobile edge cloud, multiple
mobiles and stationary devices interconnected through wireless local area networks are combined
to create a small cloud infrastructure at a local physical area such as a home. Compared to traditional
mobile distributed computing systems, mobile edge cloud introduces several complex challenges
due to the heterogeneous computing environment, heterogeneous and dynamic network environment,
node mobility, and limited battery power. The real-time requirements associated with the internet
of things and cyber-physical system applications make the problem even more challenging. In this
paper, we describe the applications and challenges associated with the design and development
of mobile edge cloud system and propose an architecture based on a cross layer design approach for
effective decision making.
