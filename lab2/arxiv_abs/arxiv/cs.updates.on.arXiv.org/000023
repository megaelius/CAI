We present measurements and analysis of censorship on Weibo, a popular microblogging site in China.
Since we were limited in the rate at which we could download posts, we identified users likely to participate
in sensitive topics and recursively followed their social contacts, biasing our search toward
a subset of Weibo where we hoped to be more likely to observe censorship. Our architecture enables
us to detect post deletions within one minute of the deletion event, giving us a high-fidelity view
of what is being deleted by the censors and when. We found that deletions happen most heavily in the
first hour after a post has been submitted. Focusing on original posts, not reposts/retweets, we
observed that nearly 30% of the total deletion events occur within 5-30 minutes. Nearly 90% of the
deletions happen within the first 24 hours. Leveraging our data, we also consider a variety of hypotheses
about the mechanisms used by Weibo for censorship, such as the extent to which they use retrospective
keyword-based censorship, and how repost/retweet popularity interacts with censorship. By leveraging
natural language processing techniques we also perform a topical analysis of the deleted posts,
overcoming the usage of neologisms, named entities, and informal language that typifies Chinese
social media. Using Independent Component Analysis, we find that the topics where mass removal
happens the fastest are those that combine events that are hot topics in Weibo as a whole (e.g., the
Beijing rainstorms or a sex scandal) with themes common to sensitive posts (e.g., Beijing, government,
China, and policeman).
