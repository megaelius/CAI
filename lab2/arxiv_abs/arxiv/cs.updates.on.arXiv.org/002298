Vehicular networks are one of the cornerstone of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). They
are expected to provide ubiquitous network connectivity to moving vehicles while supporting various
ITS services, some with very stringent requirements in terms of latency and reliability. Two vehicular
networking technologies are envisioned to jointly support the full range of ITS services : DSRC
(Dedicated Short Range Communication) for direct vehicle to vehicle/Road Side Units (RSU) communications
and cellular technologies. To the best of our knowledge, approaches from the literature usually
divide ITS services on each of these networks according to their requirements and one single network
is in charge of supporting the each service. Those that consider both network technologies to offer
multi-path routing, load balancing or path splitting for a better quality of experience of ITS services
assume obviously separately controlled networks. Under the umbrella of SDN (Software Defined
Networking), we propose in this paper a hybrid network architecture that enables the joint control
of the networks providing connectivity to multi-homed vehicles and, also, explore the opportunities
brought by such an architecture. We show through some use cases, that in addition to the flexibility
and fine-grained programmability brought by SDN, it opens the way towards the development of effective
network control algorithms that are the key towards the successful support of ITS services and especially
those with stringent QoS. We also show how these algorithms could also benefit from information
related to the environment or context in which vehicles evolve (traffic density, planned trajectory,
..), which could be easily collected by data providers and made available via the cloud.
