Imagine an array with a massive (possibly uncountably infinite) number of antennas in a compact
space. We refer to a system of this sort as Holographic MIMO. Given the impressive properties of Massive
MIMO, one might expect a holographic array to realize extreme spatial resolution, incredible energy
efficiency, and unprecedented spectral efficiency. At present, however, its fundamental limits
have not been conclusively established. A major challenge for the analysis and understanding of
such a paradigm shift is the lack of mathematically tractable and numerically reproducible channel
models that retain some semblance to the physical reality. Detailed physical models are, in general,
too complex for tractable analysis. This paper aims to take a closer look at this interdisciplinary
challenge. Particularly, we consider the small-scale fading in the far-field, and we model it as
a zero-mean, spatially-stationary, and correlated Gaussian scalar random field. Physically-meaningful
correlation is obtained by requiring that the random field be consistent with the scalar Helmholtz
equation. This formulation leads directly to a rather simple and exact description of the three-dimensional
small-scale fading as a Fourier plane-wave spectral representation. Suitably discretized, this
leads to a discrete representation for the field as a Fourier plane-wave series expansion, from
which a computationally efficient way to generate samples of the small-scale fading over spatially-constrained
compact spaces is developed. The connections with the conventional tools of linear systems theory
and Fourier transform are thoroughly discussed.
