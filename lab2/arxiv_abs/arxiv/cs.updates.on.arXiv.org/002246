This thesis presents the design, analysis, and validation of a hierarchical transactive control
system that engages demand response resources to enhance the integration of renewable electricity
generation resources. This control system joins energy, capacity and regulation markets together
in a unified homeostatic and economically efficient electricity operation that increases total
surplus while improving reliability and decreasing carbon emissions from fossil-based generation
resources. The work encompasses: (1) the derivation of a short-term demand response model suitable
for transactive control systems and its validation with field demonstration data; (2) an aggregate
load model that enables effective control of large populations of thermal loads using a new type
of thermostat (discrete time with zero deadband); (3) a methodology for optimally controlling
response to frequency deviations while tracking schedule area exports in areas that have high penetration
of both intermittent renewable resources and fast-acting demand response; and (4) the development
of a system-wide (continental interconnection) scale strategy for optimal power trajectory and
resource dispatch based on a shift from primarily energy cost-based approach to a primarily ramping
cost-based one. The results show that multi-layer transactive control systems can be constructed,
will enhance renewable resource utilization, and will operate in a coordinated manner with bulk
power systems that include both regions with and without organized power markets. Estimates of
Western Electric Coordionating Council (WECC) system cost savings under target renewable energy
generation levels resulting from the proposed system exceed US$150B annually by the year 2024,
when compared to the existing control system.
