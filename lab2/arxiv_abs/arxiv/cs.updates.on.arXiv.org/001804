Assigning a satisfactory truly concurrent semantics to Petri nets with confusion and distributed
decisions is a long standing problem, especially if one wants to fully replace nondeterminism with
probability distributions and no stochastic structure is desired/allowed. Here we propose a general
solution based on a recursive, static decomposition of (finite, occurrence) nets in loci of decision,
called structural branching cells (s-cells). Each s-cell exposes a set of alternatives, called
transactions, that can be equipped with a general probabilistic distribution. The solution is
formalised as a transformation from a given Petri net to another net whose transitions are the transactions
of the s-cells and whose places are the places of the original net, with some auxiliary structure
for bookkeeping. The resulting net is confusion-free, namely if a transition is enabled, then all
its conflicting alternatives are also enabled. Thus sets of conflicting alternatives can be equipped
with probability distributions, while nonintersecting alternatives are purely concurrent and
do not introduce any nondeterminism: they are Church-Rosser and their probability distributions
are independent. The validity of the construction is witnessed by a tight correspondence result
with the recent approach by Abbes and Benveniste (AB) based on recursively stopped configurations
in event structures. Some advantages of our approach over AB's are that: i) s-cells are defined statically
and locally in a compositional way, whereas AB's branching cells are defined dynamically and globally;
ii) their recursively stopped configurations correspond to possible executions, but the existing
concurrency is not made explicit. Instead, our resulting nets are equipped with an original concurrency
structure exhibiting a so-called complete concurrency property.
