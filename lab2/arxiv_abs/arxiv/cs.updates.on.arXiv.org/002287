In this paper, we propose a trajectory optimization for computing smooth collision free trajectories
for nonholonomic curvature bounded vehicles among static and dynamic obstacles. One of the key
novelties of our formulation is a hierarchal optimization routine which alternately operates
in the space of angular accelerations and linear velocities. That is, the optimization has a two
layer structure wherein angular accelerations are optimized keeping the linear velocities fixed
and vice versa. If the vehicle/obstacles are modeled as circles than the velocity optimization
layer can be shown to have the computationally efficient difference of convex structure commonly
observed for linear systems. This leads to a less conservative approximation as compared to that
obtained by approximating each polygon individually through its circumscribing circle. On the
other hand, it leads to optimization problem with less number of constraints as compared to that
obtained when approximating polygons as multiple overlapping circles. We use the proposed trajectory
optimization as the basis for constructing a Model Predictive Control framework for navigating
an autonomous car in complex scenarios like overtaking, lane changing and merging. Moreover, we
also highlight the advantages provided by the alternating optimization routine. Specifically,
we show it produces trajectories which have comparable arc lengths and smoothness as compared to
those produced with joint simultaneous optimization in the space of angular accelerations and
linear velocities. However, importantly, the alternating optimization provides some gain in
computational time.
