The scope of a lucrative career promoted by Google through its video distribution platform YouTube
has attracted a large number of users to become content creators. An important aspect of this line
of work is the feedback received in the form of comments which show how well the content is being received
by the audience. However, volume of comments coupled with spam and limited tools for comment classification
makes it virtually impossible for a creator to go through each and every comment and gather constructive
feedback. Automatic classification of comments is a challenge even for established classification
models, since comments are often of variable lengths riddled with slang, symbols and abbreviations.
This is a greater challenge where comments are multilingual as the messages are often rife with the
respective vernacular. In this work, we have evaluated top-performing classification models
and four different vectorizers, for classifying comments which are a mix of different combinations
of English and Malayalam (only English, only Malayalam and Mix of English and Malayalam). The statistical
analysis of results indicates that Multinomial Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Decision Trees offer similar level of accuracy in comment
classification. Further, we have also evaluated 3 multilingual sub-types of the novel NLP language
model, BERT and compared its performance to the conventional machine learning classification
techniques. XLM was the top-performing BERT model with an accuracy of 67.31. Random Forest with
Term Frequency Vectorizer was the best the top-performing model out of all the traditional classification
models with an accuracy of 63.59.
