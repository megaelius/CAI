This work proposes a space-time least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (ST-LSPG) projection method for
model reduction of nonlinear dynamical systems. In contrast to typical nonlinear model-reduction
methods that first apply (Petrov-)Galerkin projection in the spatial dimension and subsequently
apply time integration to numerically resolve the resulting low-dimensional dynamical system,
the proposed method applies projection in space and time simultaneously. To accomplish this, the
method first introduces a low-dimensional space-time trial subspace, which can be obtained by
computing tensor decompositions of state-snapshot data. The method then computes discrete-optimal
approximations in this space-time trial subspace by minimizing the residual arising after time
discretization over all space and time in a weighted $\ell^2$-norm. This norm can be defined to enable
complexity reduction (i.e., hyper-reduction) in time, which leads to space-time collocation
and space-time GNAT variants of the ST-LSPG method. Advantages of the approach relative to typical
spatial-projection-based nonlinear model reduction methods such as Galerkin projection and
least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection include: (1) a reduction of both the spatial and temporal
dimensions of the dynamical system, (2) the removal of spurious temporal modes (e.g., unstable
growth) from the state space, and (3) error bounds that exhibit slower growth in time. Numerical
examples performed on model problems in fluid dynamics demonstrate the ability of the method to
generate orders-of-magnitude computational savings relative to spatial-projection-based
reduced-order models without sacrificing accuracy.
