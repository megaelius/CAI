We introduce a new measure of the discrepancy in strategic games between the social welfare in a Nash
equilibrium and in a social optimum, that we call \bfe{selfishness level}. It is the smallest fraction
of the social welfare that needs to be offered to each player to achieve that a social optimum is realized
in a pure Nash equilibrium. The selfishness level is unrelated to the price of stability and the price
of anarchy and in contrast to these notions is invariant under positive linear transformations
of the payoff functions. Also, it naturally applies to other solution concepts and other forms of
games. We study the selfishness level of several well-known strategic games. This allows us to quantify
the implicit tension within a game between players' individual interests and the impact of their
decisions on the society as a whole. Our analysis reveals that the selfishness level often provides
more refined insights into the game than other measures of inefficiency, such as the price of stability
or the price of anarchy. In particular, the selfishness level of finite ordinal potential games
is finite, while that of weakly acyclic games can be infinite. We derive explicit bounds on the selfishness
level of fair cost sharing games and linear congestion games, which depend on specific parameters
of the underlying game but are independent of the number of players. Further, we show that the selfishness
level of the $n$-players Prisoner's Dilemma is $1/(2n-3)$, that of the $n$-players public goods
game is $(1-\frac{c}{n})(c-1)$, where $c$ is the public good multiplier, and that of the Traveler's
Dilemma game is $\frac12$. Finally, the selfishness level of Cournot competition (an example of
an infinite ordinal potential game), Tragedy of the Commons, and Bertrand competition is infinite.
