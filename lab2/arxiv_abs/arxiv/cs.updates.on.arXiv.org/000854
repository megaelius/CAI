Regression mixture models are widely studied in statistics, machine learning and data analysis.
Fitting regression mixtures is challenging and is usually performed by maximum likelihood by using
the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. However, it is well-known that the initialization
is crucial for EM. If the initialization is inappropriately performed, the EM algorithm may lead
to unsatisfactory results. The EM algorithm also requires the number of clusters to be given a priori;
the problem of selecting the number of mixture components requires using model selection criteria
to choose one from a set of pre-estimated candidate models. We propose a new fully unsupervised algorithm
to learn regression mixture models with unknown number of components. The developed unsupervised
learning approach consists in a penalized maximum likelihood estimation carried out by a robust
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for fitting polynomial, spline and B-spline regressions
mixtures. The proposed learning approach is fully unsupervised: 1) it simultaneously infers the
model parameters and the optimal number of the regression mixture components from the data as the
learning proceeds, rather than in a two-fold scheme as in standard model-based clustering using
afterward model selection criteria, and 2) it does not require accurate initialization unlike
the standard EM for regression mixtures. The developed approach is applied to curve clustering
problems. Numerical experiments on simulated data show that the proposed robust EM algorithm performs
well and provides accurate results in terms of robustness with regard initialization and retrieving
the optimal partition with the actual number of clusters. An application to real data in the framework
of functional data clustering, confirms the benefit of the proposed approach for practical applications.
