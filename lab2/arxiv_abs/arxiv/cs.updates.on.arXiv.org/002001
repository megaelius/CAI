This article presents the design of a new asynchronous early output full adder which when cascaded
leads to a relative-timed ripple carry adder (RCA). The relative-timed RCA requires imposing a
very small relative-timing assumption to overcome the problem of gate orphans associated with
internal carry propagation. The relative-timing assumption is however independent of the RCA
size. The primary benefits of the relative-timed RCA are processing of valid data incurs data-dependent
forward latency, while the processing of spacer involves a very fast constant time reverse latency
of just 1 full adder delay which represents the ultimate in the design of an asynchronous RCA with
the fastest reset. The secondary benefits of the relative-timed RCA are it achieves good optimization
of power and area metrics simultaneously. A 32-bit relative-timed RCA constructed using the proposed
early output full adder achieves respective reductions in forward latency by 67%, 10% and 3.5% compared
to the optimized strong-indication, weak-indication, and early output 32-bit asynchronous RCAs
existing in the literature. Based on a similar comparison, the proposed 32-bit relative-timed
RCA achieves corresponding reductions in cycle time by 83%, 12.7% and 6.4%. In terms of area, the
proposed 32-bit relative-timed RCA occupies 27% less Silicon than its optimized strong-indication
counterpart and 17% less Silicon than its optimized weak-indication counterpart, and features
increased area occupancy by a meager 1% compared to the optimized early output 32-bit asynchronous
RCA. The average power dissipation of all the asynchronous 32-bit RCAs are found to be comparable
since they all satisfy the monotonic cover constraint. The simulation results obtained correspond
to a 32/28nm CMOS process.
