We consider quantitative extensions of the alternating-time temporal logics ATL/ATLs called
quantitative alternating-time temporal logics (QATL/QATLs) in which the value of a counter can
be compared to constants using equality, inequality and modulo constraints. We interpret these
logics in one-counter game models which are infinite duration games played on finite control graphs
where each transition can increase or decrease the value of an unbounded counter. That is, the state-space
of these games are, generally, infinite. We consider the model-checking problem of the logics QATL
and QATLs on one-counter game models with VASS semantics for which we develop algorithms and provide
matching lower bounds. Our algorithms are based on reductions of the model-checking problems to
model-checking games. This approach makes it quite simple for us to deal with extensions of the logical
languages as well as the infinite state spaces. The framework generalizes on one hand qualitative
problems such as ATL/ATLs model-checking of finite-state systems, model-checking of the branching-time
temporal logics CTL and CTLs on one-counter processes and the realizability problem of LTL specifications.
On the other hand the model-checking problem for QATL/QATLs generalizes quantitative problems
such as the fixed-initial credit problem for energy games (in the case of QATL) and energy parity
games (in the case of QATLs). Our results are positive as we show that the generalizations are not
too costly with respect to complexity. As a byproduct we obtain new results on the complexity of model-checking
CTLs in one-counter processes and show that deciding the winner in one-counter games with LTL objectives
is 2ExpSpace-complete.
