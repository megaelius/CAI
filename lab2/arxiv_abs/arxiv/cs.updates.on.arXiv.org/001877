In this project, we build a modular, scalable system that can collect, store, and process millions
of satellite images. We test the relative importance of both of the key limitations constraining
the prevailing literature by applying this system to a data-rich environment. To overcome classic
data availability concerns, and to quantify their implications in an economically meaningful
context, we operate in a data rich environment and work with an outcome variable directly correlated
with key indicators of socioeconomic well-being. We collect public records of sale prices of homes
within the United States, and then gradually degrade our rich sample in a range of different ways
which mimic the sampling strategies employed in actual survey-based datasets. Pairing each house
with a corresponding set of satellite images, we use image-based features to predict housing prices
within each of these degraded samples. To generalize beyond any given featurization methodology,
our system contains an independent featurization module, which can be interchanged with any preferred
image classification tool. Our initial findings demonstrate that while satellite imagery can
be used to predict housing prices with considerable accuracy, the size and nature of the ground truth
sample is a fundamental determinant of the usefulness of imagery for this category of socioeconomic
prediction. We quantify the returns to improving the distribution and size of observed data, and
show that the image classification method is a second-order concern. Our results provide clear
guidance for the development of adaptive sampling strategies in data-sparse locations where satellite-based
metrics may be integrated with standard survey data, while also suggesting that advances from image
classification techniques for satellite imagery could be further augmented by more robust sampling
strategies.
