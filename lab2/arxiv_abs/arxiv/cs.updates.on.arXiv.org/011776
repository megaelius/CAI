Packing problems are an important class of optimization problems. The probably most well-known
problem if this type is knapsack and many generalizations of it have been studied in the literature
like Two-dimensional Geometric Knapsack (2DKP) and Unsplittable Flow on a Path (UFP). For the latter
two problems, recently the first polynomial time approximation algorithms with better approximation
ratios than 2 were presented [G\'alvez et al., FOCS 2017][Grandoni et al., STOC 2018]. In this paper
we break the barrier of 2 for the Storage Allocation Problem (SAP) which is a natural intermediate
problem between 2DKP and UFP. We are given a path with capacitated edges and a set of tasks where each
task has a start vertex, an end vertex, a size, and a profit. We seek to select the most profitable set
of tasks that we can draw as non-overlapping rectangles underneath the capacity profile of the edges
where the height of each rectangle equals the size of the corresponding task. This problem is motivated
by settings of allocation resources like memory, bandwidths, etc. where each request needs a contiguous
portion of the resource. The best known polynomial time approximation algorithm for SAP has an approximation
ratio of 2+epsilon$ [M\"omke and Wiese, ICALP 2015] and no better quasi-polynomial time algorithm
is known. We present a polynomial time (63/32) < 1.969-approximation algorithm for the case of uniform
edge capacities and a quasi-polynomial time (1.997)-approximation algorithm for non-uniform
quasi-polynomially bounded edge capacities. Finally, we show that under slight resource augmentation
we can obtain approximation ratios of 3/2 + epsilon in polynomial time and 1 + epsilon in quasi-polynomial
time, both for arbitrary edge capacities.
