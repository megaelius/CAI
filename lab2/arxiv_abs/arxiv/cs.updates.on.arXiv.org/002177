Purpose: To determine whether deep learning models can distinguish between breast cancer molecular
subtypes based on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Materials
and methods: In this institutional review board-approved single-center study, we analyzed DCE-MR
images of 270 patients at our institution. Lesions of interest were identified by radiologists.
The task was to automatically determine whether the tumor is of the Luminal A subtype or of another
subtype based on the MR image patches representing the tumor. Three different deep learning approaches
were used to classify the tumor according to their molecular subtypes: learning from scratch where
only tumor patches were used for training, transfer learning where networks pre-trained on natural
images were fine-tuned using tumor patches, and off-the-shelf deep features where the features
extracted by neural networks trained on natural images were used for classification with a support
vector machine. Network architectures utilized in our experiments were GoogleNet, VGG, and CIFAR.
We used 10-fold crossvalidation method for validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic
(AUC) as the measure of performance. Results: The best AUC performance for distinguishing molecular
subtypes was 0.65 (95% CI:[0.57,0.71]) and was achieved by the off-the-shelf deep features approach.
The highest AUC performance for training from scratch was 0.58 (95% CI:[0.51,0.64]) and the best
AUC performance for transfer learning was 0.60 (95% CI:[0.52,0.65]) respectively. For the off-the-shelf
approach, the features extracted from the fully connected layer performed the best. Conclusion:
Deep learning may play a role in discovering radiogenomic associations in breast cancer.
