The neighbourhood matrix, $\mathcal{NM}(G)$, a novel representation of graphs proposed in \cite
{ALPaper} is defined using the neighbourhood sets of the vertices. The matrix also exhibits a bijection
between the product of two well-known graph matrices, namely the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian
matrix. In this article, we extend this work and introduce the sequence of powers of $\mathcal{NM}(G)$
and denote it by $ \mathcal{NM}^{\{l\}}, 1\leq l \leq k(G) $ where $ k(G) $ is called the \textbf{iteration
number}, $ k(G)=\lceil{\log_{2} diameter(G)}\rceil$. The sequence of matrices captures the
distance between the vertices in a profound fashion and is found to be useful in various applications.
One of the interesting results of this article is that whenever $ \eta_{ij}^{\{l\}}=-1$, for $ 1\leq
l \leq k(G) $, then $d_{G}(i,j)=2^{l}$ , where $d_{G}(i,j)$ is the shortest path distance between
$ i $ and $ j $. Further, we characterize the entries of the matrices $ \mathcal{NM}^{\{l\}}$, for
every $l, 1\leq l \leq k(G)$. Using this concept of the sequence of powers of neighbourhood matrix
and with the aid of some of its properties, we propose an algorithm to find the shortest path between
any pair of vertices in a given undirected unweighted simple graph. The proposed algorithm and the
claims therein are formally validated through simulations on synthetic data and the real network
data from Facebook where sampling-based computations are performed for large collection of graphs
containing large-sized graph. The empirical results are quite promising with our algorithm having
the best running time among all the existing well known shortest path algorithms.
