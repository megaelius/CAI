Advanced microgrids consisting of distributed energy resources interfaced with multi-inverter
systems are becoming more common. Consequently, the effectiveness of voltage and frequency regulation
in microgrids using conventional droop-based methodologies is challenged by uncertainty in the
sizeand schedule of loads. This article proposes an isochronous architecture of parallel inverters
with only voltage-active power droop (VP-D) control for improving active power sharing as well
as plug-and-play of multi-inverter based distributed energyresources (DERs). In spite of not
employing explicit control for frequency regulation, this architecture allows even sharing of
reactive power while maintaining reduced circulating currents between inverters. The performance
is achieved even when there are mismatches between commanded reference and power demanded from
the actual load in the network. The isochronous architecture is implemented by employing a global
positioning system (GPS) to disseminate timing signals that enable the microgrid to maintain nominal
system frequency in the entire network. This enables direct control of active power through voltage
source inverter (VSI) output voltage regulation, even in the presence of system disturbances.
A small signal eigenvalue analysis of a multi-inverter system near the steady-state operating
point is presented to evaluate the stability of the multi-inverter system with the proposed VP-D
control. Simulation studies and hardware experiments on an 1.2 kVA prototype are conducted. The
effectiveness of the proposed architecture towards active and reactive power sharing between
inverters with load scenarios are demonstrated. Results of the hardware experiments corroborate
the viability of the proposed VP-D control architecture.
