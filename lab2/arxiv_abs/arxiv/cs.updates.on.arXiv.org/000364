This work proposes a novel approach to infer and characterize Internet-scale DNS amplification
DDoS attacks by leveraging the darknet space. Contrary to the pioneer work on inferring DDoS using
darknet, this work proves that we can extract DDoS activities without relying on backscattered
analysis. The aim of this work is to extract cyber security intelligence related to DNS Amplification
DDoS activities such as detection period, attack duration, intensity, packet size, rate and geo-location
in addition to various network-layer and flow-based insights. To achieve this task, the proposed
approach exploits certain DDoS parameters to detect the attacks and the expectation maximization
and k- means clustering techniques in an attempt to identify botnets of DNS Amplification DDoS.
We empirically evaluate the proposed approach using 720 GB of real darknet data collected from a
/13 address space during a recent three months period. Our analysis reveals that the approach was
successful in inferring a significant DNS amplification DDoS activities including the recent
prominent attack that targeted one of the largest anti-spam organizations. Moreover, the analysis
disclosed the mechanism of such DNS amplification DDoS attacks that was obscured in recent years.
Further, the results uncover high-speed and stealthy attempts that were never previously documented.
The extracted insights from various validated DNS amplification DDoS case studies lead to a better
understanding of the nature and scale of this threat and can generate inferences that could contribute
in detecting, preventing, assessing, mitigating and even attributing of DNS amplification DDoS
activities.
