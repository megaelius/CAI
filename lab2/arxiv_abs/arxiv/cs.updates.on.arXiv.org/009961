In this article, we introduce a reference model for interaction semantics among communicating
discrete systems to guide the discourse on interoperability. The necessary set of unifying concepts
is small and comprises essentially the notion of discrete systems interacting by exchanging information.
It is based on a simple, but nevertheless complete classification of system interactions with respect
to information transport and processing. Information transport can only be uni- or bidirectional
and information processing is subclassified along the binary dimensions of state, determinism
and synchronicity. For interactions with bidirectional information flow we are able to define
a criterion for a layered structure of systems: we name a bidirectional interaction "horizontal"
if all interacting systems behave the same with respect to state, determinism and synchronicity
and we name it "vertical" --- providing a semantic direction --- if there is a behavioral asymmetry
between the interacting systems with respect to these properties. It is shown that horizontal interactions
are essentially stateful, asynchronous and nondeterministic and are described by protocols.
Vertical interactions are essentially top-down-usage, described by object models or operations,
and bottom-up-observation, described by anonymous events. The reference model thereby helps
us to understand the significant relationships that are created between interacting discrete
systems by their interactions and guides us on how to talk about discrete system interoperability.
To show its conceptual power, we apply the reference model to assess several other architectural
models, communication technologies and so called software design or architectural styles like
SOA and REST.
