Caller ID parodying produces the valid Caller character, in this manner deciding seem to start from
another client. This apparently basic assault strategy has been utilized in the developing communication
fake and trick calls, bringing about significant financial trouble. Unfortunately, callerID
spoofing is easy to implement but yet it is difficult to have protection against it. In addition,
there are not effective and defense solutions available right now. In this research it is suggested
the CIVE (Callee Inference & VErification), a compelling and viable guard against Caller ID spoofing.
This way it is described how it's possible to lunch call spoofing and between line describe how CIVE
approach method can help to prevent somehow this kind of attacks. Caller ID Spoofing could cause
huge financial and political issues special nowadays, when many things even sometimes authentication
and verification are available by phone call, like banks approving transactions or two factor authentications
and many other things. We believe critical industries specially banks and payment service providers
should be protected against such vulnerabilities with their system and make an approach to prevent
it, also it is very important to learn people specially who has special social place like politicians
or celebrities to know such kind of attack are already exist. For this paper we implemented a call
from white house to show there is no limitation and no matter whom you try to spoof, but destination
which is the victim receive the call and that make this attack vector dangerous. And even modern communication
and even devices like 4G and smart phones are not able to prevent or even detect this kind of attack.
This study is a demonstration of the vulnerabilities available. All experiments were conducted
on isolated mock-ups.
