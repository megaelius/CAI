This paper presents fast procedures for thermal infrared remote sensing in dark, GPS-denied environments,
such as those found in industrial plants such as in High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) converter
stations. These procedures are based on the combination of the depth estimation obtained from either
a 1-Dimensional LIDAR laser or a 2-Dimensional Hokuyo laser or a 3D MultiSense SLB laser sensor and
the visible and thermal cameras from a FLIR Duo R dual-sensor thermal camera. The combination of
these sensors/cameras is suitable to be mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and/or robots
in order to provide reliable information about the potential malfunctions, which can be found within
the hazardous environment. For example, the capabilities of the developed software and hardware
system corresponding to the combination of the 1-D LIDAR sensor and the FLIR Duo R dual-sensor thermal
camera is assessed from the point of the accuracy of results and the required computational times:
the obtained computational times are under 10 ms, with a maximum localization error of 8 mm and an
average standard deviation for the measured temperatures of 1.11 degree Celsius, which results
are obtained for a number of test cases. The paper is structured as follows: the description of the
system used for identification and localization of hotspots in industrial plants is presented
in section II. In section III, the method for faults identification and localization in plants by
using a 1-Dimensional LIDAR laser sensor and thermal images is described together with results.
In section IV the real time thermal image processing is presented. Fusion of the 2-Dimensional depth
laser Hokuyo and the thermal images is described in section V. In section VI the combination of the
3D MultiSense SLB laser and thermal images is described. In section VII a discussion and several
conclusions are drawn.
