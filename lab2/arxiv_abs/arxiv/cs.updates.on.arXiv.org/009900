The shear volumes of data generated from earth observation and remote sensing technologies continue
to make major impact; leaping key geospatial applications into the dual data and compute intensive
era. As a consequence, this rapid advancement poses new computational and data processing challenges.
We implement a novel remote sensing data flow (RESFlow) for advanced machine learning and computing
with massive amounts of remotely sensed imagery. The core contribution is partitioning massive
amount of data based on the spectral and semantic characteristics for distributed imagery analysis.
RESFlow takes advantage of both a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing and
the availability of modern computing hardware to harness the acceleration of deep learning inference
on expansive remote sensing imagery. The framework incorporates a strategy to optimize resource
utilization across multiple executors assigned to a single worker. We showcase its deployment
across computationally and data-intensive on pixel-level labeling workloads. The pipeline invokes
deep learning inference at three stages; during deep feature extraction, deep metric mapping,
and deep semantic segmentation. The tasks impose compute intensive and GPU resource sharing challenges
motivating for a parallelized pipeline for all execution steps. By taking advantage of Apache Spark,
Nvidia DGX1, and DGX2 computing platforms, we demonstrate unprecedented compute speed-ups for
deep learning inference on pixel labeling workloads; processing 21,028~Terrabytes of imagery
data and delivering an output maps at area rate of 5.245sq.km/sec, amounting to 453,168 sq.km/day
- reducing a 28 day workload to 21~hours.
