Cancer is one of the leading cause of death, worldwide. Many believe that genomic data will enable
us to better predict the survival time of these patients, which will lead to better, more personalized
treatment options and patient care. As standard survival prediction models have a hard time coping
with the high-dimensionality of such gene expression (GE) data, many projects use some dimensionality
reduction techniques to overcome this hurdle. We introduce a novel methodology, inspired by topic
modeling from the natural language domain, to derive expressive features from the high-dimensional
GE data. There, a document is represented as a mixture over a relatively small number of topics, where
each topic corresponds to a distribution over the words; here, to accommodate the heterogeneity
of a patient's cancer, we represent each patient (~document) as a mixture over cancer-topics, where
each cancer-topic is a mixture over GE values (~words). This required some extensions to the standard
LDA model eg: to accommodate the "real-valued" expression values - leading to our novel "discretized"
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (dLDA) procedure. We initially focus on the METABRIC dataset, which
describes breast cancer patients using the r=49,576 GE values, from microarrays. Our results show
that our approach provides survival estimates that are more accurate than standard models, in terms
of the standard Concordance measure. We then validate this approach by running it on the Pan-kidney
(KIPAN) dataset, over r=15,529 GE values - here using the mRNAseq modality - and find that it again
achieves excellent results. In both cases, we also show that the resulting model is calibrated,
using the recent "D-calibrated" measure. These successes, in two different cancer types and expression
modalities, demonstrates the generality, and the effectiveness, of this approach.
