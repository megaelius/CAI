Using FPGAs to accelerate ConvNets has attracted significant attention in recent years. However,
FPGA accelerator design has not leveraged the latest progress of ConvNets. As a result, the key application
characteristics such as frames-per-second (FPS) are ignored in favor of simply counting GOPs,
and results on accuracy, which is critical to application success, are often not even reported.
In this work, we adopt an algorithm-hardware co-design approach to develop a ConvNet accelerator
called Synetgy and a novel ConvNet model called DiracDeltaNet$^{\dagger}$. Both the accelerator
and ConvNet are tailored to FPGA requirements. DiracDeltaNet, as the name suggests, is a ConvNet
with only $1\times 1$ convolutions while spatial convolutions are replaced by more efficient shift
operations. DiracDeltaNet achieves competitive accuracy on ImageNet (88.7\% top-5), but with
42$\times$ fewer parameters and 48$\times$ fewer OPs than VGG16. We further quantize DiracDeltaNet's
weights to 4-bit and activations to 4-bits, with less than 1\% accuracy loss. These quantizations
exploit well the nature of FPGA hardware. In short, DiracDeltaNet's small model size, low computational
OP count, low precision and simplified operators allow us to co-design a highly customized computing
unit for an FPGA. We implement the computing units for DiracDeltaNet on an Ultra96 SoC system through
high-level synthesis. Our accelerator's final top-5 accuracy of 88.1\% on ImageNet, is higher
than all the previously reported embedded FPGA accelerators. In addition, the accelerator reaches
an inference speed of 66.3 FPS on the ImageNet classification task, surpassing prior works with
similar accuracy by at least 11.6$\times$.
