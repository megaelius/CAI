The article reveals the experience of organizing blended learning for geography students using
Google Classroom, and discloses its potential uses in the study of geography. For the last three

"Population Geography", "Information Systems and Technologies in Tourism Industry","Regional
Economic and Social World Geography (Europe and the CIS)", "Regional Economic and Social World
Geography (Africa, Latin America, Asia,Anglo-America, Australia and Oceania)", "Socio-Economic
Cartography". The advantages of using the specified interactive tool during the study of geographical
disciplines are highlighted out in the article. As it has been established, the organization of
the learning process using Google Classroom ensures the unity of in-class and out-of-class learning;
it is designed to realize effective interaction of the subjects learning in real time; to monitor
the quality of training and control the students' learning achievements in class as well as out of
it, etc. The article outlines the disadvantages that should be taken into account when organizing
blended learning using Google Classroom, including the occasional predominance of students'
external motivation in education and their low level of readiness for work in the classroom; insufficient
level of material and technical support in some classrooms; need for out-of-class pedagogical
support; lack of guidance on the content aspect of Google Classroom pages, etc. Through the test
series conducted during 2016-2017, an increase in the number of geography students with a sufficient
level of academic achievements and a decrease of those with a low level of it was revealed.
