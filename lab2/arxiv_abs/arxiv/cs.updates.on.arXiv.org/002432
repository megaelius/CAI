An important task in image processing and neuroimaging is to extract quantitative information
from the acquired images in order to make observations about the presence of disease or markers of
development in populations. Having a lowdimensional manifold of an image allows for easier statistical
comparisons between groups and the synthesis of group representatives. Previous studies have
sought to identify the best mapping of brain MRI to a low-dimensional manifold, but have been limited
by assumptions of explicit similarity measures. In this work, we use deep learning techniques to
investigate implicit manifolds of normal brains and generate new, high-quality images. We explore
implicit manifolds by addressing the problems of image synthesis and image denoising as important
tools in manifold learning. First, we propose the unsupervised synthesis of T1-weighted brain
MRI using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by learning from 528 examples of 2D axial slices
of brain MRI. Synthesized images were first shown to be unique by performing a crosscorrelation
with the training set. Real and synthesized images were then assessed in a blinded manner by two imaging
experts providing an image quality score of 1-5. The quality score of the synthetic image showed
substantial overlap with that of the real images. Moreover, we use an autoencoder with skip connections
for image denoising, showing that the proposed method results in higher PSNR than FSL SUSAN after
denoising. This work shows the power of artificial networks to synthesize realistic imaging data,
which can be used to improve image processing techniques and provide a quantitative framework to
structural changes in the brain.
