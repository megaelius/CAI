In post-event reconnaissance missions, engineers and researchers collect perishable information
about damaged buildings in the affected geographical region to learn from the consequences of the
event. A typical post-event reconnaissance mission is conducted by first doing a preliminary survey,
followed by a detailed survey. The preliminary survey is typically conducted by driving slowly
along a pre-determined route, observing the damage, and noting where further detailed data should
be collected. This involves several manual, time-consuming steps that can be accelerated by exploiting
recent advances in computer vision and artificial intelligence. The objective of this work is to
develop and validate an automated technique to support post-event reconnaissance teams in the
rapid collection of reliable and sufficiently comprehensive data, for planning the detailed survey.
The technique incorporates several methods designed to automate the process of categorizing buildings
based on their key physical attributes, and rapidly assessing their post-event structural condition.
It is divided into pre-event and post-event streams, each intending to first extract all possible
information about the target buildings using both pre-event and post-event images. Algorithms
based on convolutional neural network (CNNs) are implemented for scene (image) classification.
A probabilistic approach is developed to fuse the results obtained from analyzing several images
to yield a robust decision regarding the attributes and condition of a target building. We validate
the technique using post-event images captured during reconnaissance missions that took place
after hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The validation data were collected by a structural wind and coastal
engineering reconnaissance team, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Structural Extreme
Events Reconnaissance (StEER) Network.
