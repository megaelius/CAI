Robot animation is a new form of character animation that extends the traditional process by allowing
the animated motion to become more interactive and adaptable during interaction with users in real-world
settings. This paper reviews how this new type of character animation has evolved and been shaped
from character animation principles and practices. We outline some new paradigms that aim at allowing
character animators to become robot animators, and to properly take part in the development of social
robots. One such paradigm consists of the 12 principles of robot animation, which describes general
concepts that both animators and robot developers should consider in order to properly understand
each other. We also introduce the concept of Kinematronics, for specifying the controllable and
programmable expressive abilities of robots, and the Nutty Workflow and Pipeline. The Nutty Pipeline
introduces the concept of the Programmable Robot Animation Engine, which allows to generate, compose
and blend various types of animation sources into a final, interaction-enabled motion that can
be rendered on robots in real-time during real-world interactions. The Nutty Motion Filter is described
and exemplified as a technique that allows an open-loop motion controller to apply physical limits
to the motion while still allowing to tweak the shape and expressivity of the resulting motion. Additionally,
we describe some types of tools that can be developed and integrated into Nutty-based workflows
and pipelines, which allow animation artists to perform an integral part of the expressive behaviour
development within social robots, and thus to evolve from standard (3D) character animators, towards
a full-stack type of robot animators.
