Consider $k$ robots initially located at a point inside a region $T$. Each robot can move anywhere
in $T$ independently of other robots with maximum speed one. The goal of the robots is to \emph{evacuate}
$T$ through an exit at an unknown location on the boundary of $T$. The objective is to minimize the
\emph{evacuation time}, which is defined as the time the \emph{last} robot reaches the exit. We
consider the \emph{face-to-face} communication model for the robots: a robot can communicate
with another robot only when they meet in $T$. In this paper, we give upper and lower bounds for the
face-to-face evacuation time by $k$ robots that are initially located at the centroid of a unit-sided
equilateral triangle or square. For the case of a triangle with $k=2$ robots, we give a lower bound
of $1+2/\sqrt{3} \approx 2.154$, and an algorithm with upper bound of 2.3367 on the worst-case evacuation
time. We show that for any $k$, any algorithm for evacuating $k\geq 2$ robots requires at least $\sqrt{3}$
time. This bound is asymptotically optimal, as we show that even a straightforward strategy of evacuation
by $k$ robots gives an upper bound of $\sqrt{3} + 3/k$. For $k=3$ and $4$, we give better algorithms
with evacuation times of 2.0887 and 1.9816, respectively. For the case of the square and $k=2$, we
give an algorithm with evacuation time of $3.4645$ and show that any algorithm requires time at least
$3.118$ to evacuate in the worst-case. Moreover, for $k=3$, and $4$, we give algorithms with evacuation
times 3.1786 and 2.6646, respectively. The algorithms given for $k=3$ and $4$ for evacuation in
the triangle or the square can be easily generalized for larger values of $k$.
