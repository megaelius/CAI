Consider a point-to-point message-passing network. We are interested in the asynchronous crash-tolerant
consensus problem in incomplete networks. We study the feasibility and efficiency of approximate
consensus under different restrictions on topology knowledge and the relay depth, i.e., the maximum
number of hops any message can be relayed. These two constraints are common in large-scale networks,
and are used to avoid memory overload and network congestion respectively. Specifically, for different
values of integers k, k , we consider that each node knows all its neighbors of at most k-hop distance
(k-hop topology knowledge), and the relay depth is k . We consider both directed and undirected graphs.
More concretely, we answer the following main question in asynchronous systems: What is a tight
condition on the underlying communication graphs for achieving approximate consensus if each
node has only a k-hop topology knowledge and relay depth k? To prove that the necessary conditions
presented in the paper are also sufficient, we have developed algorithms that achieve consensus
in graphs satisfying those conditions: -The first class of algorithms requires k-hop topology
knowledge and relay depth k. Unlike prior algorithms, these algorithms do not flood the network,
and each node does not need the full topology knowledge. We show how the convergence time and the message
complexity of those algorithms is affected by k, providing the respective upper bounds. -The second
set of algorithms requires only one-hop neighborhood knowledge, i.e., immediate incoming and
outgoing neighbors, but needs to flood the network (i.e., relay depth is n, where n is the number of
nodes). One result that may be of independent interest is a topology discovery mechanism to learn
and "estimate" the topology in asynchronous directed networks with crash faults.
