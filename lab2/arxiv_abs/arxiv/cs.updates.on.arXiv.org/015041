Generating forecasts for time series with multiple seasonal cycles is an important use-case for
many industries nowadays. Accounting for the multi-seasonal patterns becomes necessary to generate
more accurate and meaningful forecasts in these contexts. In this paper, we propose Long Short-Term
Memory Multi-Seasonal Net (LSTM-MSNet), a decomposition based, unified prediction framework
to forecast time series with multiple seasonal patterns. The current state of the art in this space
are typically univariate methods, in which the model parameters of each time series are estimated
independently. Consequently, these models are unable to include key patterns and structures that
may be shared by a collection of time series. In contrast, LSTM-MSNet is a globally trained Long Short-Term
Memory network (LSTM), where a single prediction model is built across all the available time series
to exploit the cross series knowledge in a group of related time series. Furthermore, our methodology
combines a series of state-of-the-art multiseasonal decomposition techniques to supplement
the LSTM learning procedure. In our experiments, we are able to show that on datasets from disparate
data sources, like e.g. the popular M4 forecasting competition, a decomposition step is beneficial,
whereas in the common real-world situation of homogeneous series from a single application, exogenous
seasonal variables or no seasonal preprocessing at all are better choices. All options are readily
included in the framework and allow us to achieve competitive results for both cases, outperforming
many state-of-the-art multi-seasonal forecasting methods.
