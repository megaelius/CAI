Big data powered Deep Learning (DL) and its applications have blossomed in recent years, fueled
by three technological trends: a large amount of digitized data openly accessible, a growing number
of DL software frameworks in open source and commercial markets, and a selection of affordable parallel
computing hardware devices. However, no single DL framework, to date, dominates in terms of performance
and accuracy even for baseline classification tasks on standard datasets, making the selection
of a DL framework an overwhelming task. This paper takes a holistic approach to conduct empirical
comparison and analysis of four representative DL frameworks with three unique contributions.
First, given a selection of CPU-GPU configurations, we show that for a specific DL framework, different
configurations of its hyper-parameters may have a significant impact on both performance and accuracy
of DL applications. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the opportunities
for improving the training time performance and the accuracy of DL frameworks by configuring parallel
computing libraries and tuning individual and multiple hyper-parameters. Third, we also conduct
a comparative measurement study on the resource consumption patterns of four DL frameworks and
their performance and accuracy implications, including CPU and memory usage, and their correlations
to varying settings of hyper-parameters under different configuration combinations of hardware,
parallel computing libraries. We argue that this measurement study provides in-depth empirical
comparison and analysis of four representative DL frameworks, and offers practical guidance for
service providers to deploying and delivering DL as a Service (DLaaS) and for application developers
and DLaaS consumers to select the right DL frameworks for the right DL workloads.
