Spectral computed tomography (CT) reconstructs material-dependent attenuation images with
the projections of multiple narrow energy windows, it is meaningful for material identification
and decomposition. Unfortunately, the multi-energy projection dataset always contains strong
complicated noise and result in the projections has a lower signal-noise-ratio (SNR). Very recently,
the spatial-spectral cube matching frame (SSCMF) was proposed to explore the non-local spatial-spectrum
similarities for spectral CT. The method constructs such a group by clustering up a series of non-local
spatial-spectrum cubes. The small size of spatial patch for such a group make SSCMF fails to encode
the sparsity and low-rank properties. In addition, the hard-thresholding and collaboration filtering
operation in the SSCMF are also rough to recover the image features and spatial edges. While for all
steps are operated on 4-D group, we may not afford such huge computational and memory load in practical.
To avoid the above limitation and further improve image quality, we first formulate a non-local
cube-based tensor instead of the group to encode the sparsity and low-rank properties. Then, as
a new regularizer, Kronecker-Basis-Representation (KBR) tensor factorization is employed into
a basic spectral CT reconstruction model to enhance the ability of extracting image features and
protecting spatial edges, generating the non-local low-rank cube-based tensor factorization
(NLCTF) method. Finally, the split-Bregman strategy is adopted to solve the NLCTF model. Both numerical
simulations and realistic preclinical mouse studies are performed to validate and assess the NLCTF
algorithm. The results show that the NLCTF method outperforms the other competitors.
