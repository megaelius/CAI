This paper reports on a new method of encapsulating BZ solution droplets in a powder coating of either
polyethylene (PE) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), to produce BZ liquid marbles (LMs). The
BZ LMs have solid--liquid interfaces in contrast to the previously reported BZ encapsulation systems
used to study pattern formations and wave transfers, such as BZ emulsions and BZ vesicles. All these
systems are important to study as they can be seen as analogues for information transfer in excitable
systems in nature. Due to the powder coating of the LMs, LMs do not wet the underlying substrate, making
the LMs mobile, enabling them to be easily arranged in arrays. The preparation of complex LMs, containing
an acidic oscillating solution, proves the resilience of LMs and their application in transporting
a wide range of chemical cargoes and in playing a mediating role in chemical reactions. PTFE-coated
LMs were harder to prepare and not as robust as PE-coated LMs, therefore oscillation studies of BZ
LMs positioned in arrays only focused on PE-coated LMs. Sporadic transfer of excitation waves was
observed between LMs placed in close proximity to each other in ordered and disordered arrays, suggesting
the transfer of liquid species possibly arises from contact between imperfectly coated areas at
the LM--LM interface or capillary action, where solution is actively transported to the marble
surface through the coating. Propagation pathways of the excitation waves in both the disordered
and ordered arrays of BZ LMs are reported. These results lay the foundations for future studies on
information transmission and processing arrays of BZ LMs, in addition to observing BZ wave propagation
in a LM and the effect of other physical stimuli such as heat, light and chemical environments on the
dynamics of excitation in arrays of BZ Lms.
