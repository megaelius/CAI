Cell movement in the early phase of C. elegans development is regulated by a highly complex process
in which a set of rules and connections are formulated at distinct scales. Previous efforts have
demonstrated that agent-based, multi-scale modeling systems can integrate physical and biological
rules and provide new avenues to study developmental systems. However, the application of these
systems to model cell movement is still challenging and requires a comprehensive understanding
of regulation networks at the right scales. Recent developments in deep learning and reinforcement
learning provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore cell movement using 3D time-lapse microscopy
images. We presented a deep reinforcement learning approach within an agent-based modeling system
to characterize cell movement in the embryonic development of C. elegans. We tested our model through
two scenarios within real developmental processes: the anterior movement of the Cpaaa cell via
intercalation and the restoration of the superficial left-right symmetry. Our modeling system
overcame the local optimization problems encountered by traditional rule-based, agent-based
modeling by using greedy algorithms. It also overcame the computational challenges in the action
selection which has been plagued by the traditional tabular-based reinforcement learning approach.
Our system can automatically explore the cell movement path by using live microscopy images and
it can provide a unique capability to model cell movement scenarios where regulatory mechanisms
are not well studied. In addition, our system can be used to explore potential paths of a cell under
different regulatory mechanisms or to facilitate new hypotheses for explaining certain cell movement
behaviors.
