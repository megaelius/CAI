Segmentation of abdominal organs has been a comprehensive, yet unresolved, research field for
many years. In the last decade, intensive developments in deep learning (DL) have introduced new
state-of-the-art segmentation systems. In order to expand the knowledge on these topics, the CHAOS
- Combined (CT-MR) Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation challenge has been organized in conjunction
with IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2019, in Venice, Italy. CHAOS
provides both abdominal CT and MR data from healthy subjects for single and multiple abdominal organ
segmentation. Five different but complementary tasks have been designed to analyze the capabilities
of current approaches from multiple perspectives. The results are investigated thoroughly, compared
with manual annotations and interactive methods. The analysis shows that the performance of DL
models for single modality (CT / MR) can show reliable volumetric analysis performance (DICE: 0.98
$\pm$ 0.00 / 0.95 $\pm$ 0.01) but the best MSSD performance remain limited (21.89 $\pm$ 13.94 / 20.85
$\pm$ 10.63 mm). The performances of participating models decrease significantly for cross-modality
tasks for the liver (DICE: 0.88 $\pm$ 0.15 MSSD: 36.33 $\pm$ 21.97 mm) and all organs (DICE: 0.85 $\pm$
0.21 MSSD: 33.17 $\pm$ 38.93 mm). Despite contrary examples on different applications, multi-tasking
DL models designed to segment all organs seem to perform worse compared to organ-specific ones (performance
drop around 5\%). Besides, such directions of further research for cross-modality segmentation
would significantly support real-world clinical applications. Moreover, having more than 1500
participants, another important contribution of the paper is the analysis on shortcomings of challenge
organizations such as the effects of multiple submissions and peeking phenomena.
