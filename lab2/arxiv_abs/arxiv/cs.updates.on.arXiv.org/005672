Various forms of dependent rounding are useful when handling a mixture of "hard" knapsack constraints
and "soft" (packing) constraints. In many such problem classes, it is difficult or intractable
to satisfy the knapsack constraints exactly, and so pseudo-solutions (i.e., solutions which slightly
violate the constraints) are often employed instead. We describe a new type of approximation algorithm
which gives \emph{additive} violations of the packing constraints, in contrast to previous algorithms
which give $(1+\epsilon)$--multiplicative violations of these constraints. This additive pseudo-approximation
has a number of technical advantages, including leading to more-efficient multiplicative approximation
algorithms. We achieve this by showing that independent rounding leads naturally to additive pseudo-solutions
for knapsack constraints, which does not hold for multiplicative approximation, as well as by developing
a type of dependent rounding which gives substantial "near-independence" properties among the
variables being rounded. While the classical works in discrepancy theory (Beck-Fiala (1981) and
Karp et al. (1987)) as well as more-modern works such as those of Bansal-Nagarajan (2016) -- which
have many further properties -- yield such small additive violations, they do not yield the forms
of near-independence that we require. We use this to develop approximation and pseudo-approximation
algorithms for the knapsack median and knapsack center problems. Another technical contribution
of this work is a new tail bound analogous to Feige (2006) for sums of random variables with unbounded
variances.
