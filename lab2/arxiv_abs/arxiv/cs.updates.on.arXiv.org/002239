Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a means of generating keys between a pair of computing hosts that
is theoretically secure against cryptanalysis, even by a quantum computer. Although there is much
active research into improving the QKD technology itself, there is still significant work to be
done to apply engineering methodology and determine how it can be practically built to scale within
an enterprise IT environment. Significant challenges exist in building a practical key management
service for use in a metropolitan network. QKD is generally a point-to-point technique only and
is subject to steep performance constraints. The integration of QKD into enterprise-level computing
has been researched, to enable quantum-safe communication. A novel method for constructing a key
management service is presented that allows arbitrary computing hosts on one site to establish
multiple secure communication sessions with the hosts of another site. A key exchange protocol
is proposed where symmetric private keys are granted to hosts while satisfying the scalability
needs of an enterprise population of users. The key management service operates within a layered
architectural style that is able to interoperate with various underlying QKD implementations.
Variable levels of security for the host population are enforced through a policy engine. A network
layer provides key generation across a network of nodes connected by quantum links. Scheduling
and routing functionality allows quantum key material to be relayed across trusted nodes. Optimizations
are performed to match the real-time host demand for key material with the capacity afforded by the
infrastructure. The result is a flexible and scalable architecture that is suitable for enterprise
use and independent of any specific QKD technology.
