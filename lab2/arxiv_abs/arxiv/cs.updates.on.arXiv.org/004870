Sparse learning has been shown to be effective in solving many real-world problems. Finding sparse
representations is a fundamentally important topic in many fields of science including signal
processing, computer vision, genome study and medical imaging. One important issue in applying
sparse representation is to find the basis to represent the data,especially in computer vision
and medical imaging where the data is not necessary incoherent. In medical imaging, clinicians
often grade the severity or measure the risk score of a disease based on images. This process is referred
to as medical image grading. Manual grading of the disease severity or risk score is often used. However,
it is tedious, subjective and expensive. Sparse learning has been used for automatic grading of
medical images for different diseases. In the grading, we usually begin with one step to find a sparse
representation of the testing image using a set of reference images or atoms from the dictionary.
Then in the second step, the selected atoms are used as references to compute the grades of the testing
images. Since the two steps are conducted sequentially, the objective function in the first step
is not necessarily optimized for the second step. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse range-constrained
learning(SRCL)algorithm for medical image grading.Different from most of existing sparse learning
algorithms, SRCL integrates the objective of finding a sparse representation and that of grading
the image into one function. It aims to find a sparse representation of the testing image based on
atoms that are most similar in both the data or feature representation and the medical grading scores.
We apply the new proposed SRCL to CDR computation and cataract grading. Experimental results show
that the proposed method is able to improve the accuracy in cup-to-disc ratio computation and cataract
grading.
