Swarms of small spacecraft offer whole new capabilities in Earth observation, global positioning
and communications compared to a large monolithic spacecraft. These small spacecrafts can provide
bigger apertures that increase gain in communication antennas, increase area coverage or effective
resolution of distributed cameras and enable persistent observation of ground or space targets.
However, there remain important challenges in operating large number of spacecrafts at once. Current
methods would require a large number of ground operators monitor and actively control these spacecrafts
which poses challenges in terms of coordination and control which prevents the technology from
scaled up in cost-effective manner. Technologies are required to enable one ground operator to
manage tens if not hundreds of spacecrafts. We propose to utilize laser beams directed from the ground
or from a command and control spacecraft to organize and manage a large swarm. Each satellite in the
swarm will have a customized "smart skin" con-taining solar panels, power and control circuitry
and an embedded secondary propulsion unit. A secondary propulsion unit may include electrospray
pro-pulsion, solar radiation pressure-based system, photonic laser thrusters and Lorentz force
thrusters. Solar panels typically occupy the largest surface area on an earth orbiting satellite.
A laser beam from another spacecraft or from the ground would interact with solar panels of the spacecraft
swarm. The laser beam would be used to select a 'leader' amongst a group of spacecrafts, set parameters
for formation-flight, including separation distance, local if-then rules and coordinated changes
in attitude and position.
