We study three capacity problems in the mobile telephone model, a network abstraction that models
the peer-to-peer communication capabilities implemented in most commodity smartphone operating
systems. The capacity of a network expresses how much sustained throughput can be maintained for
a set of communication demands, and is therefore a fundamental bound on the usefulness of a network.
Because of this importance, wireless network capacity has been active area of research for the last
two decades. The three capacity problems that we study differ in the structure of the communication
demands. The first problem is pairwise capacity, where the demands are (source, destination) pairs.
Pairwise capacity is one of the most classical definitions, as it was analyzed in the seminal paper
of Gupta and Kumar on wireless network capacity. The second problem we study is broadcast capacity,
in which a single source must deliver packets to all other nodes in the network. Finally, we turn our
attention to all-to-all capacity, in which all nodes must deliver packets to all other nodes. In
all three of these problems we characterize the optimal achievable throughput for any given network,
and design algorithms which asymptotically match this performance. We also study these problems
in networks generated randomly by a process introduced by Gupta and Kumar, and fully characterize
their achievable throughput. Interestingly, the techniques that we develop for all-to-all capacity
also allow us to design a one-shot gossip algorithm that runs within a polylogarithmic factor of
optimal in every graph. This largely resolves an open question from previous work on the one-shot
gossip problem in this model.
