Various types of atherosclerotic plaque and varying grades of stenosis could lead to different
management of patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, it is crucial to detect and classify
the type of coronary artery plaque, as well as to detect and determine the degree of coronary artery
stenosis. This study includes retrospectively collected clinically obtained coronary CT angiography
(CCTA) scans of 163 patients. To perform automatic analysis for coronary artery plaque and stenosis
classification, a multi-task recurrent convolutional neural network is applied on multi-planar
reformatted (MPR) images of the coronary arteries. First, a 3D convolutional neural network is
utilized to extract features along the coronary artery. Subsequently, the extracted features
are aggregated by a recurrent neural network that performs two simultaneous multi-class classification
tasks. In the first task, the network detects and characterizes the type of the coronary artery plaque
(no plaque, non-calcified, mixed, calcified). In the second task, the network detects and determines
the anatomical significance of the coronary artery stenosis (no stenosis, non-significant i.e.
<50% luminal narrowing, significant i.e. >50% luminal narrowing). For detection and classification
of coronary plaque, the method achieved an accuracy of 0.77. For detection and classification of
stenosis, the method achieved an accuracy of 0.80. The results demonstrate that automatic detection
and classification of coronary artery plaque and stenosis are feasible. This may enable automated
triage of patients to those without coronary plaque and those with coronary plaque and stenosis
in need for further cardiovascular workup.
