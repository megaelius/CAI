Pseudonymisation provides the means to reduce the privacy impact of monitoring, auditing, intrusion
detection, and data collection in general on individual subjects. Its application on data records,
especially in an environment with additional constraints, like re-identification in the course
of incident response, implies assumptions and privacy issues, which contradict the achievement
of the desirable privacy level. Proceeding from two real-world scenarios, where personal and identifying
data needs to be processed, we identify requirements as well as a system model for pseudonymisation
and explicitly state the sustained privacy threats, even when pseudonymisation is applied. With
this system and threat model, we derive privacy protection goals together with possible technical
realisations, which are implemented and integrated into our event pseudonymisation framework
PEEPLL for the context of event processing, like monitoring and auditing of user, process, and network
activities. Our framework provides privacy-friendly linkability in order to maintain the possibility
for automatic event correlation and evaluation, while at the same time reduces the privacy impact
on individuals. Additionally, the pseudonymisation framework is evaluated in order to provide
some restrained insights on the impact of assigned paradigms and all necessary new mechanisms on
the performance of monitoring and auditing. With this framework, privacy provided by event pseudonymisation
can be enhanced by a more rigorous commitment to the concept of personal data minimisation, especially
in the context of regulatory requirements like the European General Data Protection Regulation.
