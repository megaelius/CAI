This paper presents the design, control, and applications of a multi-segment soft robotic arm.
In order to design a soft arm with large load capacity, several design principles are proposed by
analyzing two kinds of buckling issues, under which we present a novel structure named Honeycomb
Pneumatic Networks (HPN). Parameter optimization method, based on finite element method (FEM),
is proposed to optimize HPN Arm design parameters. Through a quick fabrication process, several
prototypes with different performance are made, one of which can achieve the transverse load capacity
of 3 kg under 3 bar pressure. Next, considering different internal and external conditions, we develop
three controllers according to different model precision. Specifically, based on accurate model,
an open-loop controller is realized by combining piece-wise constant curvature (PCC) modeling
method and machine learning method. Based on inaccurate model, a feedback controller, using estimated
Jacobian, is realized in 3D space. A model-free controller, using reinforcement learning to learn
a control policy rather than a model, is realized in 2D plane, with minimal training data. Then, these
three control methods are compared on a same experiment platform to explore the applicability of
different methods under different conditions. Lastly, we figure out that soft arm can greatly simplify
the perception, planning, and control of interaction tasks through its compliance, which is its
main advantage over the rigid arm. Through plentiful experiments in three interaction application
scenarios, human-robot interaction, free space interaction task, and confined space interaction
task, we demonstrate the potential application prospect of the soft arm.
