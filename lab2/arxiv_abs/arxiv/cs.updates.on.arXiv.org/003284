Government policies aim to address public issues and problems and therefore play a pivotal role
in peoples lives. The creation of public policies, however, is complex given the perspective of
large and diverse stakeholders involvement, considerable human participation, lengthy processes,
complex task specification and the non-deterministic nature of the process. The inherent complexities
of the policy process impart challenges for designing a computing system that assists in supporting
and automating the business process pertaining to policy setup, which also raises concerns for
setting up a tracking service in the policy-making environment. A tracking service informs how
decisions have been taken during policy creation and can provide useful and intrinsic information
regarding the policy process. At present, there exists no computing system that assists in tracking
the complete process that has been employed for policy creation. To design such a system, it is important
to consider the policy environment challenges; for this a novel network and goal based approach
has been framed and is covered in detail in this paper. Furthermore, smart governance objectives
that include stakeholders participation and citizens involvement have been considered. Thus,
the proposed approach has been devised by considering smart governance principles and the knowledge
environment of policy making where tasks are largely dependent on policy makers decisions and on
individual policy objectives. Our approach reckons the human dimension for deciding and defining
autonomous process activities at run time. Furthermore, with the network-based approach, so-called
provenance data tracking is employed which enables the capture of policy process.
