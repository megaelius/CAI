The stable and accurate approximation of discontinuities such as shocks on a finite computational
mesh is a challenging task. Detection of shocks or strong discontinuities in the flow solution is
typically achieved through a priori troubled cell indicators, which guide the subsequent action
of an appropriate shock capturing mechanism. Arriving at a stable and accurate solution often requires
empirically based parameter tuning and adjustments of the indicator settings to the discretization
and solution at hand. In this work, we propose to separate the task of shock detection and shock capturing
more strongly and aim to develop a shock indicator that is robust, accurate, requires minimal user
input and is suitable for high order element-based methods like discontinuous Galerkin and flux
reconstruction methods. The novel indicator is learned from analytical data through a supervised
learning strategy; its input is given by the high order solution field, its output is an element-local
map of the shock position. We use state of the art methods from edge detection in image analysis based
on deep convolutional multiscale networks and deep supervision to train the indicators. The resulting
networks are then used as black box indicators, showing their robustness and accuracy on well established
canonical testcases. All simulations are run ab initio using the developed indicators, showing
that they provide also stability during the strongly transient phases. In particular for high order
schemes with large cells and considerable inner-cell resolution capabilities, we demonstrate
how the additional accurate prediction of the position of the shock front can be exploited to guide
inner-element shock capturing strategies.
