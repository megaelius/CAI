Medicine is moving from a curative discipline to a preventative discipline relying on personalised
and precise treatment plans. The complex and multi level pathophysiological patterns of most diseases
require a systemic medicine approach and are challenging current medical therapies. On the other
hand, computational medicine is a vibrant interdisciplinary field that could help move from an
organ-centered approach to a process-oriented approach. The ideal computational patient would
require an international interdisciplinary effort, of larger scientific and technological interdisciplinarity
than the Human Genome Project. When deployed, such a patient would have a profound impact on how healthcare
is delivered to patients. Here we present a computational patient model that integrates, refines
and extends recent mechanistic or phenomenological models of cardiovascular, RAS and diabetic
processes. Our aim is twofold: analyse the modularity and composability of the model-building
blocks of the computational patient and to study the dynamical properties of well-being and disease
states in a broader functional context. We present results from a number of experiments among which
we characterise the dynamic impact of COVID-19 and type-2 diabetes (T2D) on cardiovascular and
inflammation conditions. We tested these experiments under different exercise, meal and drug
regimens. We report results showing the striking importance of transient dynamical responses
to acute state conditions and we provide guidelines for system design principles for the inter-relationship
between modules and components in systemic medicine. Finally this initial computational Patient
can be used as a toolbox for further modifications and extensions.
