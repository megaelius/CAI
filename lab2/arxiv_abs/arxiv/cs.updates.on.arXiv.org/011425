This paper presents a study conducted to allow urban farmers to remotely monitor their farm through
the design and development of an Internet of Things-based (IoT) microfarm prototype which utilized
wick system as planting method. The system involves the detection of three environmental parameters
namely, light intensity, soil moisture and temperature through the use of respective sensors which
were connected to the Arduino microcontroller, the sensor node of the system. Irregularities in
the aforementioned parameters were neutralized through the use of parameter regulators such as
LED growlight strips, water pump and air cooler. The data collected by these sensors were gathered
by the Arduino microcontroller and were sent to the Web database through the IoT gateway which was
the Raspberry Pi computer chip. These data were also sent to an Android unit installed with the Microfarm
Companion application which was capable of monitoring and controlling the environmental parameters
observed in the microfarm. The application allows the user to view the current value of the parameter
involved and to choose whether to control the parameter regulators automatically or manually.
The microfarm system runs autonomously which reduces the labor required to produce healthy plants
and crops. Mustard greens samples were used in testing the system. After a month of monitoring the
height of the samples, it was observed that the average height of the samples is about 0.23 cm taller
than the standard height. The proponents has also tested the system functionality by evaluating
the sensor data log that provides the values gathered by the sensors and the turn-on times of the parameter
regulators. From these data, it can be observed that whenever the values obtained by the sensors
fall outside the threshold range, the parameter regulators turns on, indicating that the system
is working properly.
