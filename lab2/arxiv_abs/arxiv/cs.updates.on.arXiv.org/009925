Community structure is one of the most relevant features encountered in numerous real-world applications
of networked systems. Despite the tremendous effort of a large interdisciplinary community of
scientists working on this subject over the past few decades, more investigations are needed in
order to better understand the impact of their structure and dynamics on networked systems. Here,
in the first section, we review the work on generative models of communities and their role in developing
strong foundation for community detection algorithms. We discuss modularity and algorithms based
on modularity maximization. Then, we follow with an overview of the Stochastic Block Model and its
different variants as well as inference of communities structures from the model. The following
section focuses on time evolving networks, where existing nodes and links can disappear, and in
parallel new nodes and links may be introduced. The extraction of communities under such circumstances
poses an interesting and non-trivial problem that has gained considerable interest over the last
decade. We briefly discuss considerable advances made in this field recently. In the last section,
we discuss immunization strategies essential for targeting the influential spreaders of epidemics
in modular networks. Their main goal is to select and immunize a small proportion of individuals
from the whole network to control the discussion process. Various strategies have emerged over
the years suggesting different ways to immunize nodes in networks with overlapping and non-overlapping
community structure. We first discuss stochastic strategies that require little or no information
about the network topology at the expense of their performance. Then, we introduce deterministic
strategies that have proven to be very efficient in controlling the epidemic outbreaks, but require
complete knowledge of the network.
