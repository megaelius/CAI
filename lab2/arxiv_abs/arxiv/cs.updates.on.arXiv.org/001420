This paper presents a new algorithm, termed \emph{truncated amplitude flow} (TAF), to recover
an unknown vector $\bm{x}$ from a system of quadratic equations of the form $y_i=|\langle\bm{a}_i,\bm{x}\rangle|^2$,
where $\bm{a}_i$'s are given random measurement vectors. This problem is known to be \emph{NP-hard}
in general. We prove that as soon as the number of equations is on the order of the number of unknowns,
TAF recovers the solution exactly (up to a global unimodular constant) with high probability and
complexity growing linearly with both the number of unknowns and the number of equations. Our TAF
approach adopts the \emph{amplitude-based} empirical loss function, and proceeds in two stages.
In the first stage, we introduce an \emph{orthogonality-promoting} initialization that can be
obtained with a few power iterations. Stage two refines the initial estimate by successive updates
of scalable \emph{truncated generalized gradient iterations}, which are able to handle the rather
challenging nonconvex and nonsmooth amplitude-based objective function. In particular, when
vectors $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{a}_i$'s are real-valued, our gradient truncation rule provably eliminates
erroneously estimated signs with high probability to markedly improve upon its untruncated version.
Numerical tests using synthetic data and real images demonstrate that our initialization returns
more accurate and robust estimates relative to spectral initializations. Furthermore, even under
the same initialization, the proposed amplitude-based refinement outperforms existing Wirtinger
flow variants, corroborating the superior performance of TAF over state-of-the-art algorithms.
