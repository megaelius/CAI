Domain science applications and workflow processes are currently forced to view the network as
an opaque infrastructure into which they inject data and hope that it emerges at the destination
with an acceptable Quality of Experience. There is little ability for applications to interact
with the network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover expected
performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. The work presented
here is motivated by a vision for a new smart network and smart application ecosystem that will provide
a more deterministic and interactive environment for domain science workflows. The Software-Defined
Network for End-to-end Networked Science at Exascale (SENSE) system includes a model-based architecture,
implementation, and deployment which enables automated end-to-end network service instantiation
across administrative domains. An intent based interface allows applications to express their
high-level service requirements, an intelligent orchestrator and resource control systems allow
for custom tailoring of scalability and real-time responsiveness based on individual application
and infrastructure operator requirements. This allows the science applications to manage the
network as a first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments, compute,
and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks and testbeds have validated
SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based testing verified the scalability needed to support
research and education infrastructures. Key contributions of this work include an architecture
definition, reference implementation, and deployment. This provides the basis for further innovation
of smart network services to accelerate scientific discovery in the era of big data, cloud computing,
machine learning and artificial intelligence.
