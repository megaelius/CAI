Social media datasets make it possible to rapidly quantify collective attention to emerging topics
and breaking news, such as crisis events. Collective attention is typically measured by aggregate
counts, such as the number of posts that mention a name or hashtag. But according to rationalist models
of natural language communication, the collective salience of each entity will be expressed not
only in how often it is mentioned, but in the form that those mentions take. This is because natural
language communication is premised on (and customized to) the expectations that speakers and writers
have about how their messages will be interpreted by the intended audience. We test this idea by conducting
a large-scale analysis of public online discussions of breaking news events on Facebook and Twitter,
focusing on five recent crisis events. We examine how people refer to locations, focusing specifically
on contextual descriptors, such as "San Juan" versus "San Juan, Puerto Rico." Rationalist accounts
of natural language communication predict that such descriptors will be unnecessary (and therefore
omitted) when the named entity is expected to have high prior salience to the reader. We find that
the use of contextual descriptors is indeed associated with proxies for social and informational
expectations, including macro-level factors like the location's global salience and micro-level
factors like audience engagement. We also find a consistent decrease in descriptor context use
over the lifespan of each crisis event. These findings provide evidence about how social media users
communicate with their audiences, and point towards more fine-grained models of collective attention
that may help researchers and crisis response organizations to better understand public perception
of unfolding crisis events.
