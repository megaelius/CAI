In this paper we present a generalized Deep Learning-based approach to solve ill-posed large-scale
inverse problems occurring in medical imaging. Recently, Deep Learning methods using iterative
neural networks and cascaded neural networks have been reported to achieve excellent image quality
for the task of image reconstruction in different imaging modalities. However, the fact that these
approaches employ the forward and adjoint operators repeatedly in the network architecture requires
the network to process the whole images or volumes at once, which for some applications is computationally
infeasible. In this work, we follow a different reconstruction strategy by decoupling the regularization
of the solution from ensuring consistency with the measured data. The regularization is given in
the form of an image prior obtained by the output of a previously trained neural network which is used
in a Tikhonov regularization framework. By doing so, more complex and sophisticated network architectures
can be used for the removal of the artefacts or noise than it is usually the case in iterative networks.
Due to the large scale of the considered problems and the resulting computational complexity of
the employed networks, the priors are obtained by processing the images or volumes as patches or
slices. We evaluated the method for the cases of 3D cone-beam low dose CT and undersampled 2D radial
cine MRI and compared it to a total variation-minimization-based reconstruction algorithm as
well as to a method with regularization based on learned overcomplete dictionaries. The proposed
method outperformed all the reported methods with respect to all chosen quantitative measures
and further accelerates the regularization step in the reconstruction by several orders of magnitude.
