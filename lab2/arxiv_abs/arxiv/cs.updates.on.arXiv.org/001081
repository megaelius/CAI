Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in practice employ potentially hundreds of layers
and $10$,$000$s of nodes. Such network sizes entail significant computational complexity due
to the large number of convolutions that need to be carried out; in addition, a large number of parameters
needs to be learned and stored. Very deep and wide CNNs may therefore not be well suited to applications
operating under severe resource constraints as is the case, e.g., in low-power embedded and mobile
platforms. This paper aims at understanding the impact of CNN topology, specifically depth and
width, on the network's feature extraction capabilities. We address this question for the class
of scattering networks that employ either Weyl-Heisenberg filters or wavelets, the modulus non-linearity,
and no pooling. The exponential feature map energy decay results in Wiatowski et al., 2017, are generalized
to $\mathcal{O}(a^{-N})$, where an arbitrary decay factor $a>1$ can be realized through suitable
choice of the Weyl-Heisenberg prototype function or the mother wavelet. We then show how networks
of fixed (possibly small) depth $N$ can be designed to guarantee that $((1-\varepsilon)\cdot 100)\%$
of the input signal's energy are contained in the feature vector. Based on the notion of operationally
significant nodes, we characterize, partly rigorously and partly heuristically, the topology-reducing
effects of (effectively) band-limited input signals, band-limited filters, and feature map symmetries.
Finally, for networks based on Weyl-Heisenberg filters, we determine the prototype function bandwidth
that minimizes---for fixed network depth $N$---the average number of operationally significant
nodes per layer.
