Quantitative characterization of disease progression using longitudinal data can provide long-term
predictions for the pathological stages of individuals. This work studies robust modeling of Alzheimer's
disease progression using parametric methods. The proposed method linearly maps the individual's
chronological age to a disease progression score (DPS) and robustly fits a constrained generalized
logistic function to the longitudinal dynamics of a biomarker as a function of the DPS using M-estimation.
Robustness of the estimates is quantified using bootstrapping via Monte Carlo resampling, and
the inflection points are used to temporally order the modeled biomarkers in the disease course.
Moreover, kernel density estimation is applied to the obtained DPSs for clinical status prediction
using a Bayesian classifier. Different M-estimators and logistic functions, including a new generalized
type proposed in this study, called modified Stannard, are evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for robust modeling of volumetric MRI and PET biomarkers,
as well as cognitive tests. The results show that the modified Stannard function fitted using the
modified Huber loss achieves the best modeling performance with an MAE of 0.071 across all biomarkers
and bootstraps. In addition, applied to the ADNI test set, this model achieves a multi-class AUC
of 0.87 in clinical status prediction, and it significantly outperforms an analogous state-of-the-art
method with a biomarker modeling MAE of 0.071 vs. 0.073 (p < 0.001). Finally, the experiments show
that the proposed model, trained using abundant ADNI data, generalizes well to data from the independent
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database, where modeling performance is significantly
improved (p < 0.001) compared with using a model trained on relatively scarce NACC data.
