Mixture modelling using elliptical distributions promises enhanced robustness, flexibility
and stability over the widely employed Gaussian mixture model (GMM). However, existing studies
based on the elliptical mixture model (EMM) are restricted to several specific types of elliptical
probability density functions, which are not supported by general solutions or systematic analysis
frameworks; this significantly limits the rigour and the power of EMMs in applications. To this
end, we propose a novel general framework for estimating and analysing the EMMs, achieved through
Riemannian manifold optimisation. First, we investigate the relationships between Riemannian
manifolds and elliptical distributions, and the so established connection between the original
manifold and a reformulated one indicates a mismatch between those manifolds, the major cause of
failure of the existing optimisation for solving general EMMs. We next propose a universal solver
which is based on the optimisation of a re-designed cost and prove the existence of the same optimum
as in the original problem; this is achieved in a simple, fast and stable way. We further calculate
the influence functions of the EMM as theoretical bounds to quantify robustness to outliers. Comprehensive
numerical results demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to accommodate EMMs with different
properties of individual functions in a stable way and with fast convergence speed. Finally, the
enhanced robustness and flexibility of the proposed framework over the standard GMM are demonstrated
both analytically and through comprehensive simulations.
