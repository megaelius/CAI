At present, the majority of the proposed Deep Learning (DL) methods provide point predictions without
quantifying the models uncertainty. However, a quantification of the reliability of automated
image analysis is essential, in particular in medicine when physicians rely on the results for making
critical treatment decisions. In this work, we provide an entire framework to diagnose ischemic
stroke patients incorporating Bayesian uncertainty into the analysis procedure. We present a
Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) yielding a probability for a stroke lesion on 2D Magnetic
Resonance (MR) images with corresponding uncertainty information about the reliability of the
prediction. For patient-level diagnoses, different aggregation methods are proposed and evaluated,
which combine the single image-level predictions. Those methods take advantage of the uncertainty
in image predictions and report model uncertainty at the patient-level. In a cohort of 511 patients,
our Bayesian CNN achieved an accuracy of 95.33% at the image-level representing a significant improvement
of 2% over a non-Bayesian counterpart. The best patient aggregation method yielded 95.89% of accuracy.
Integrating uncertainty information about image predictions in aggregation models resulted
in higher uncertainty measures to false patient classifications, which enabled to filter critical
patient diagnoses that are supposed to be closer examined by a medical doctor. We therefore recommend
using Bayesian approaches not only for improved image-level prediction and uncertainty estimation
but also for the detection of uncertain aggregations at the patient-level.
