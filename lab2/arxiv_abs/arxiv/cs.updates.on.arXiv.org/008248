Aiming to help researchers capture early-stage Product Development (PD) activity, this article
presents a new method for digitally capturing prototypes. The motivation for this work is to understand
prototyping in the early stages of PD projects, and this article investigates if and how digital
capture of physical prototypes can be used for this purpose. In PD case studies, such early-stage
prototypes are usually rough and of low-fidelity and are thus often discarded or substantially
modified through the projects. Hence, retrospective access to prototypes is a challenge when trying
to gather accurate empirical data. To capture the prototypes developed through the early stages
of a project, a new method has been developed for digitally capturing physical prototypes through
multi-view images, along with metadata describing by who, when and where the prototypes were captured.
In this article, one project is shown in detail to demonstrate how this capturing system can gather
empirical data for enriching PD case studies on early-stage projects that focus on prototyping
for concept generation. The first approach is to use the multi-view images for a qualitative assessment
of the projects, which can provide new insights and understanding on various aspects like design
decisions, trade-offs and specifications. The second approach is to analyse the metadata provided
by the system to give understanding into prototyping patterns in the projects. The analysis of metadata
provides insight into prototyping progression, including the frequency of prototyping, which
days the project participants are most active, and how the prototyping changes over time.
