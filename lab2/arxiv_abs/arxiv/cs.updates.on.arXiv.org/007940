This thesis introduces a novel quadrotor manipulation system that consists of 2-link manipulator
attached to the bottom of a quadrotor. This new system presents a solution for the drawbacks found
in the current quadrotor manipulation system which uses a gripper fixed to a quadrotor. Unlike the
current system, the proposed system has a 6-DOF, and it provides enough distance between the quadrotor
and the object. System kinematics and dynamics are derived. To study the feasibility of the proposed
system, a quadrotor with high enough payload to add the 2-link manipulator is constructed. Its parameters
are identified to be used in the simulation and controller design. A CAD model is developed to calculate
the mass and moments of inertia in an accurate way. Direct relationships between Pulse Width Modulation
and each of the angular speeds, thrust forces, and drag moments of the rotors are identified. A Direction
Cosine Matrix complementary filter is used to estimate the attitude of the quadrotor using the IMU
measurements. Attitude stabilization controller is designed based on feedback linearization
technique to test the identified parameters and the attitude estimation. The results of the experiments
show satisfactory accuracy of the identified structure parameters, the identified rotor assembly
parameters, and the attitude estimation algorithm. A controller for the proposed system is designed
based on three control techniques: feedback linearization based PID control, direct fuzzy logic
control, and fuzzy model reference learning control. These controllers are tested to provide system
stability and trajectory tracking under the effect of picking and placing a payload and the effect
of changing the operating region. Simulation results show that the fuzzy model reference learning
control technique has superior performance. The results indicate the feasibility of the proposed
system.
