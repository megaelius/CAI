Composition conventions are guidelines used by human composers in composing chess problems. They
are particularly significant in composition tournaments. Examples include, not having any check
in the first move of the solution and not dressing up the board with unnecessary pieces. Conventions
are often associated or even directly conflated with the overall aesthetics or beauty of a composition.
Using an existing experimentally-validated computational aesthetics model for three-move mate
problems, we analyzed sets of computer-generated compositions adhering to at least 2, 3 and 4 comparable
conventions to test if simply conforming to more conventions had a positive effect on their aesthetics,
as is generally believed by human composers. We found slight but statistically significant evidence
that it does, but only to a point. We also analyzed human judge scores of 145 three-move mate problems
composed by humans to see if they had any positive correlation with the computational aesthetic
scores of those problems. We found that they did not. These seemingly conflicting findings suggest
two main things. First, the right amount of adherence to composition conventions in a composition
has a positive effect on its perceived aesthetics. Second, human judges either do not look at the
same conventions related to aesthetics in the model used or emphasize others that have less to do
with beauty as perceived by the majority of players, even though they may mistakenly consider their
judgements beautiful in the traditional, non-esoteric sense. Human judges may also be relying
significantly on personal tastes as we found no correlation between their individual scores either.
