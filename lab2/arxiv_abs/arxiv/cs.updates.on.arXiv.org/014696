Network method of moments arXiv:1202.5101 is an important tool for nonparametric network inferences.
However, there has been little investigation on accurate descriptions of the sampling distributions
of network moment statistics. In this paper, we present the first higher-order accurate approximation
to the sampling CDF of a studentized network moment by Edgeworth expansion. In sharp contrast to
classical literature on noiseless U-statistics, we showed that the Edgeworth expansion of a network
moment statistic as a noisy U-statistic can achieve higher-order accuracy without non-lattice
or smoothness assumptions but just requiring weak regularity conditions. Behind this result is
our surprising discovery that the two typically-hated factors in network analysis, namely, sparsity
and edge-wise observational errors, jointly play a blessing role, contributing a crucial self-smoothing
effect in the network moment statistic and making it analytically tractable. Our assumptions match
the minimum requirements in related literature. For practitioners, our empirical Edgeworth expansion
is highly accurate and computationally efficient. It is also easy to implement. These were demonstrated
by comprehensive simulation studies. We showcase three applications of our results in network
inference. We proved, to our knowledge, for the first time that some network bootstraps enjoy higher-order
accuracy, and provided theoretical guidance for tuning network sub-sampling. We also derived
a one-sample test and Cornish-Fisher confidence interval for any given moment, both with analytical
formulation and explicit error rates.
