Accurate and reliable travel time predictions in public transport networks are essential for delivering
an attractive service that is able to compete with other modes of transport in urban areas. The traditional
application of this information, where arrival and departure predictions are displayed on digital
boards, is highly visible in the city landscape of most modern metropolises. More recently, the
same information has become critical as input for smart-phone trip planners in order to alert passengers
about unreachable connections, alternative route choices and prolonged travel times. More sophisticated
Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) include the predictions of connection assurance, i.e. to
hold back services in case a connecting service is delayed. In order to operate such systems, and
to ensure the confidence of passengers in the systems, the information provided must be accurate
and reliable. Traditional methods have trouble with this as congestion, and thus travel time variability,
increases in cities, consequently making travel time predictions in urban areas a non-trivial
task. This paper presents a system for bus travel time prediction that leverages the non-static
spatio-temporal correlations present in urban bus networks, allowing the discovery of complex
patterns not captured by traditional methods. The underlying model is a multi-output, multi-time-step,
deep neural network that uses a combination of convolutional and long short-term memory (LSTM)
layers. The method is empirically evaluated and compared to other popular approaches for link travel
time prediction and currently available services, including the currently deployed model in Copenhagen,
Denmark. We find that the proposed model significantly outperforms all the other methods we compare
with, and is able to detect small irregular peaks in bus travel times very quickly.
