Modern online social platforms enable their members to be involved in a broad range of activities
like getting friends, joining groups, posting/commenting resources and so on. In this paper we
investigate whether a correlation emerges across the different activities a user can take part
in. To perform our analysis we focused on aNobii, a social platform with a world-wide user base of
book readers, who like to post their readings, give ratings, review books and discuss them with friends
and fellow readers. aNobii presents a heterogeneous structure: i) part social network, with user-to-user
interactions, ii) part interest network, with the management of book collections, and iii) part
folksonomy, with books that are tagged by the users. We analyzed a complete and anonymized snapshot
of aNobii and we focused on three specific activities a user can perform, namely her tagging behavior,
her tendency to join groups and her aptitude to compile a wishlist reporting the books she is planning
to read. In this way each user is associated with a tag-based, a group-based and a wishlist-based
profile. Experimental analysis carried out by means of Information Theory tools like entropy and
mutual information suggests that tag-based and group-based profiles are in general more informative
than wishlist-based ones. Furthermore, we discover that the degree of correlation between the
three profiles associated with the same user tend to be small. Hence, user profiling cannot be reduced
to considering just any one type of user activity (although important) but it is crucial to incorporate
multiple dimensions to effectively describe users preferences and behavior.
