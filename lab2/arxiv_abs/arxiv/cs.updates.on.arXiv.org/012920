The humans are affective and cognitive beings relying on memories for their individual and social
identities. Also, human dyadic bonds require some common beliefs such as empathetic behaviour
for better interaction. In this sense, research studies involving human-agent interaction should
resource on affect, cognition, and memory integration. The developed artificial agent system
(SensAI+Expanse) includes machine learning algorithms, heuristics, and memory as cognition
aids towards emotional valence prediction on the interacting human. Further, an adaptive empathy
score is always present in order to engage the human in a recognisable interaction outcome. [...]
The agent is resilient on collecting data, adapts its cognitive processes to each human individual
in a learning best effort for proper contextualised prediction. The current study make use of an
achieved adaptive process. Also, the use of individual prediction models with specific options
of the learning algorithm and evaluation metric from a previous research study. The accomplished
solution includes a highly performant prediction ability, an efficient energy use, and feature
importance explanation for predicted probabilities. Results of the present study show evidence
of significant emotional valence behaviour differences between some age ranges and gender combinations.
Therefore, this work contributes with an artificial intelligent agent able to assist on cognitive
science studies. This ability is about affective disturbances by means of predicting human emotional
valence contextualised in space and time. Moreover, contributes with learning processes and heuristics
fit to the task including economy of cognition and memory to cope with the environment. Finally,
these contributions include an achieved age and gender neutrality on predicting emotional valence
states in context and with very good performance for each individual.
