A rollercoaster is a sequence of real numbers for which every maximal contiguous subsequence, that
is increasing or decreasing, has length at least three. By translating this sequence to a set of points
in the plane, a rollercoaster can be defined as a polygonal path for which every maximal sub-path,
with positive- or negative-slope edges, has at least three points. Given a sequence of distinct
real numbers, the rollercoaster problem asks for a maximum-length subsequence that is a rollercoaster.
It was conjectured that every sequence of $n$ distinct real numbers contains a rollercoaster of
length at least $\lceil n/2\rceil$ for $n>7$, while the best known lower bound is $\Omega(n/\log
n)$. In this paper we prove this conjecture. Our proof is constructive and implies a linear-time
algorithm for computing a rollercoaster of this length. Extending the $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm
for computing a longest increasing subsequence, we show how to compute a maximum-length rollercoaster
within the same time bound. A maximum-length rollercoaster in a permutation of $\{1,\dots,n\}$
can be computed in $O(n \log \log n)$ time. The search for rollercoasters was motivated by orthogeodesic
point-set embedding of caterpillars. A caterpillar is a tree such that deleting the leaves gives
a path, called the spine. A top-view caterpillar is one of degree 4 such that the two leaves adjacent
to each vertex lie on opposite sides of the spine. As an application of our result on rollercoasters,
we are able to find a planar drawing of every $n$-node top-view caterpillar on every set of $\frac{25}{3}n$
points in the plane, such that each edge is an orthogonal path with one bend. This improves the previous
best known upper bound on the number of required points, which is $O(n \log n)$. We also show that such
a drawing can be obtained in linear time, provided that the points are given in sorted order.
