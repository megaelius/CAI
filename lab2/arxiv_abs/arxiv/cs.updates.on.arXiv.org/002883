For the first time, some hypersingular nonlinear boundary-value problems with a small parameter~$\varepsilon$
at the highest derivative are described. These problems essentially (qualitatively and quantitatively)
differ from the usual linear and quasilinear singularly perturbed boundary-value problems and
have the following unusual properties: (i) in hypersingular boundary-value problems, super thin
boundary layers arise, and the derivative at the boundary layer can have very large values of the
order of $e^{1/\varepsilon}$ and more (in standard problems with boundary layers, the derivative
at the boundary has the order of $\varepsilon^{-1}$ or less); (ii) in hypersingular boundary-value
problems, the position of the boundary layer is determined by the values of the unknown function
at the boundaries (in standard problems with boundary layers, the position of the boundary layer
is determined by coefficients of the given equation, and the values of the unknown function at the
boundaries do not play a role here); (iii) hypersingular boundary-value problems do not admit a
direct application of the method of matched asymptotic expansions (without a preliminary nonlinear
point transformation of the equation under consideration). Examples of hypersingular nonlinear
boundary-value problems with ODEs and PDEs are given and their exact solutions are obtained. It
is important to note that the exact solutions presented in this paper can be used to compare the effectiveness
of various methods of numerical integration of singularly perturbed problems with boundary layers,
and also to develop new numerical and approximate analytical methods.
