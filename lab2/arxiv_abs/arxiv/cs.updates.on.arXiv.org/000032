In recent years, the embedding approach for switched optimal control problems has been developed
in a series of papers. However, the embedding approach, which advantageously converts the hybrid
optimal control problem to a classical nonlinear optimization, has not been extensively compared
to alternative approaches. The goal of this paper is thus to compare the embedding approach to multi-parametric
programming, mixed-integer programming, gradient-descent based methods, and CPLEX in the context
of five recently published examples. A sixth example, an autonomous switched 11-region linear
system, is used to compare a hybrid minimum principle method and traditional numerical programming.
For a given performance index for each case, cost and solution times are presented. It is shown that
there are numerical advantages of the embedding approach: lower performance index cost (except
in some instances when autonomous switches are present), generally faster solution time, and convergence
to a solution when other methods may fail. In addition, the embedding method requires no ad hoc assumptions
(e.g., predetermined mode sequences) or specialized control models. Theoretical advantages
of the embedding approach over the other methods are also described: guaranteed existence of a solution
under mild conditions, convexity of the embedded hybrid optimization problem (under the customary
conditions on the performance index), solvability with traditional techniques (e.g., sequential
quadratic programming) avoiding the combinatorial complexity in the number of modes/discrete
variables of mixed-integer programming, applicability to affine nonlinear systems, and no need
to explicitly assign discrete/mode variables to autonomous switches.
