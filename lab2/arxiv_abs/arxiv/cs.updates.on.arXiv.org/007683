We present the concept of a disjunctive basis as a generic framework for normal forms in modal logic
based on coalgebra. Disjunctive bases were defined in previous work on completeness for modal fixpoint
logics, where they played a central role in the proof of a generic completeness theorem for coalgebraic
mu-calculi. Believing the concept has a much wider significance, here we investigate it more thoroughly
in its own right. We show that the presence of a disjunctive basis at the "one-step" level entails
a number of good properties for a coalgebraic mu-calculus, in particular, a simulation theorem
showing that every alternating automaton can be transformed into an equivalent nondeterministic
one. Based on this, we prove a Lyndon theorem for the full fixpoint logic, its fixpoint-free fragment
and its one-step fragment, a Uniform Interpolation result, for both the full mu-calculus and its
fixpoint-free fragment, and a Janin-Walukiewicz-style characterization theorem for the mu-calculus
under slightly stronger assumptions. We also raise the questions, when a disjunctive basis exists,
and how disjunctive bases are related to Moss' coalgebraic "nabla" modalities. Nabla formulas
provide disjunctive bases for many coalgebraic modal logics, but there are cases where disjunctive
bases give useful normal forms even when nabla formulas fail to do so, our prime example being graded
modal logic. We also show that disjunctive bases are preserved by forming sums, products and compositions
of coalgebraic modal logics, providing tools for modular construction of modal logics admitting
disjunctive bases. Finally, we consider the problem of giving a category-theoretic formulation
of disjunctive bases, and provide a partial solution.
