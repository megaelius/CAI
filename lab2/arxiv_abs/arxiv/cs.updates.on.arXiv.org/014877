As the use of MultiLayer Networks (or MLNs) for modeling and analysis is gaining popularity, it is
becoming increasingly important to propose a community definition that encompasses the multiple
features represented by MLNs and develop algorithms for efficiently computing communities on
MLNs. Currently, communities for MLNs, are based on aggregating the networks into single graphs
using different techniques (type independent, projection-based, etc.) and applying single graph
community detection algorithms, such as Louvain and Infomap on these graphs. This process results
in different types of information loss (semantics and structure). To the best of our knowledge,
in this paper we propose, for the first time, a definition of community for heterogeneous MLNs (or
HeMLNs) which preserves semantics as well as the structure. Additionally, our basic definition
can be extended to appropriately match the analysis objectives as needed. In this paper, we present
a structure and semantics preserving community definition for HeMLNs that is compatible with and
is an extension of the traditional definition for single graphs. We also present a framework for
its efficient computation using a newly proposed decoupling approach. First, we define a k-community
for connected k layers of a HeMLN. Then we propose a family of algorithms for its computation using
the concept of bipartite graph pairings. Further, for a broader analysis, we introduce several
pairing algorithms and weight metrics for composing binary HeMLN communities using participating
community characteristics. Essentially, this results in an extensible family of community computations.
We provide extensive experimental results for showcasing the efficiency and analysis flexibility
of the proposed computation using popular IMDb and DBLP data sets.
