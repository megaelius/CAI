Context: Big Data Cybersecurity Analytics is aimed at protecting networks, computers, and data
from unauthorized access by analysing security event data using big data tools and technologies.
Whilst a plethora of Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems have been reported in the literature,
there is a lack of a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature from an architectural
perspective. Objective: This paper reports a systematic review aimed at identifying the most frequently
reported quality attributes and architectural tactics for Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems.
Method: We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for reviewing 74 primary studies selected
using well-defined criteria. Results: Our findings are twofold: (i) identification of 12 most
frequently reported quality attributes and the justification for their significance for Big Data
Cybersecurity Analytic Systems; and (ii) identification and codification of 17 architectural
tactics for addressing the quality attributes that are commonly associated with Big Data Cybersecurity
Analytic systems. The identified tactics include six performance tactics, four accuracy tactics,
two scalability tactics, three reliability tactics, and one security and usability tactic each.
Conclusion: Our findings have revealed that (a) despite the significance of interoperability,
modifiability, adaptability, generality, stealthiness, and privacy assurance, these quality
attributes lack explicit architectural support in the literature (b) empirical investigation
is required to evaluate the impact of codified architectural tactics (c) a good deal of research
effort should be invested to explore the trade-offs and dependencies among the identified tactics
and (d) there is a general lack of effective collaboration between academia and industry for supporting
the field of Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems.
