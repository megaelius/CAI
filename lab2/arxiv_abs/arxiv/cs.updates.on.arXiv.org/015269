Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as one of the major causes of dementia and is characterized by slow
progression over several years, with no treatments or available medicines. In this regard, there
have been efforts to identify the risk of developing AD in its earliest time. While many of the previous
works considered cross-sectional analysis, more recent studies have focused on the diagnosis
and prognosis of AD with longitudinal or time-series data in a way of disease progression modeling
(DPM). Under the same problem settings, in this work, we propose a novel computational framework
that forecasts the phenotypic measurements of MRI biomarkers and predicts the clinical statuses
at multiple future time points. However, in handling time series data, it generally faces with many
unexpected missing observations. In regard to such an unfavorable situation, we define a secondary
problem of estimating those missing values and tackle it in a systematic way by taking account of
temporal and multivariate relations inherent in time series data. Concretely, we propose a deep
recurrent network that jointly tackles the three problems of (i) missing value imputation, (ii)
phenotypic measurements forecasting, and (iii) clinical status prediction of a subject based
on his/her longitudinal imaging biomarkers. Notably, the learnable model parameters of our network
are trained in an end to end manner with our circumspectly defined loss function. In our experiments
over TADPOLE challenge cohort, we measured performance for various metrics and compared our method
to competing methods in the literature. Exhaustive analyses and ablation studies were also conducted
to better confirm the effectiveness of our method.
