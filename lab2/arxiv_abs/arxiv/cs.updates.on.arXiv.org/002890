It is safe to assume that, for the foreseeable future, machine learning, especially deep learning
will remain both data- and computation-hungry. In this paper, we ask: Can we build a global exchange
where everyone can contribute computation and data to train the next generation of machine learning
applications? We present an early, but running prototype of DataBright, a system that turns the
creation of training examples and the sharing of computation into an investment mechanism. Unlike
most crowdsourcing platforms, where the contributor gets paid when they submit their data, DataBright
pays dividends whenever a contributor's data or hardware is used by someone to train a machine learning
model. The contributor becomes a shareholder in the dataset they created. To enable the measurement
of usage, a computation platform that contributors can trust is also necessary. DataBright thus
merges both a data market and a trusted computation market. We illustrate that trusted computation
can enable the creation of an AI market, where each data point has an exact value that should be paid
to its creator. DataBright allows data creators to retain ownership of their contribution and attaches
to it a measurable value. The value of the data is given by its utility in subsequent distributed computation
done on the DataBright computation market. The computation market allocates tasks and subsequent
payments to pooled hardware. This leads to the creation of a decentralized AI cloud. Our experiments
show that trusted hardware such as Intel SGX can be added to the usual ML pipeline with no additional
costs. We use this setting to orchestrate distributed computation that enables the creation of
a computation market. DataBright is available for download at https://github.com/ds3lab/databright.
