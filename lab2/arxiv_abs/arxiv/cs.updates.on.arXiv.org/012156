The combination of orthogonal frequency modulation (OFDM) and multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems plays an important role in modern communication systems. In order to meet the growing
throughput demands, future MIMO-OFDM receivers are expected to utilize a massive number of antennas,
operate in dynamic environments, and explore high frequency bands, while satisfying strict constraints
in terms of cost, power, and size. An emerging technology to realize massive MIMO receivers of reduced
cost and power consumption is based on dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), which inherently implement
controllable compression in acquisition. In this work we study the application of DMAs for MIMO-OFDM
receivers operating with bit-constrained analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We present a
model for DMAs which accounts for the configurable frequency selective profile of its metamaterial
elements, resulting in a spectrally flexible hybrid structure. We then exploit previous results
in task-based quantization to show how DMAs can be configured to improve recovery in the presence
of constrained ADCs, and propose methods for adjusting the DMA parameters based on channel state
information. Our numerical results demonstrate that the DMA-based receiver is capable of accurately
recovering OFDM signals. In particular, we show that by properly exploiting the spectral diversity
of DMAs, notable performance gains are obtained over existing designs of conventional hybrid architectures,
demonstrating the potential of DMAs for MIMO-OFDM setups in realizing high performance massive
antenna arrays of reduced cost and power consumption.
