Deep learning-based whole-heart segmentation in coronary CT angiography (CCTA) allows the extraction
of quantitative imaging measures for cardiovascular risk prediction. Automatic extraction of
these measures in patients undergoing only non-contrast-enhanced CT (NCCT) scanning would be
valuable. In this work, we leverage information provided by a dual-layer detector CT scanner to
obtain a reference standard in virtual non-contrast (VNC) CT images mimicking NCCT images, and
train a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for the segmentation of VNC as well as NCCT images.
Contrast-enhanced acquisitions on a dual-layer detector CT scanner were reconstructed into a
CCTA and a perfectly aligned VNC image. In each CCTA image, manual reference segmentations of the
left ventricular (LV) myocardium, LV cavity, right ventricle, left atrium, right atrium, ascending
aorta, and pulmonary artery trunk were obtained and propagated to the corresponding VNC image.
These VNC images and reference segmentations were used to train 3D CNNs for automatic segmentation
in either VNC images or NCCT images. Automatic segmentations in VNC images showed good agreement
with reference segmentations, with an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.897 \pm 0.034 and
an average symmetric surface distance of 1.42 \pm 0.45 mm. Volume differences [95% confidence interval]
between automatic NCCT and reference CCTA segmentations were -19 [-67; 30] mL for LV myocardium,
-25 [-78; 29] mL for LV cavity, -29 [-73; 14] mL for right ventricle, -20 [-62; 21] mL for left atrium,
and -19 [-73; 34] mL for right atrium, respectively. In 214 (74%) NCCT images from an independent
multi-vendor multi-center set, two observers agreed that the automatic segmentation was mostly
accurate or better. This method might enable quantification of additional cardiac measures from
NCCT images for improved cardiovascular risk prediction.
