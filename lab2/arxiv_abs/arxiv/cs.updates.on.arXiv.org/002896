Passwords are ubiquitous and most commonly used to authenticate users when logging into online
services. Using high entropy passwords is critical to prevent unauthorized access and password
policies emerged to enforce this requirement on passwords. However, with current methods of password
storage, poor practices and server breaches have leaked many passwords to the public. To protect
one's sensitive information in case of such events, passwords should be hidden from servers. Verifier-based
password authenticated key exchange, proposed by Bellovin and Merrit (IEEE S\&P, 1992), allows
authenticated secure channels to be established with a hash of a password (verifier). Unfortunately,
this restricts password policies as passwords cannot be checked from their verifier. To address
this issue, Kiefer and Manulis (ESORICS 2014) proposed zero-knowledge password policy check (ZKPPC).
A ZKPPC protocol allows users to prove in zero knowledge that a hash of the user's password satisfies
the password policy required by the server. Unfortunately, their proposal is not quantum resistant
with the use of discrete logarithm-based cryptographic tools and there are currently no other viable
alternatives. In this work, we construct the first post-quantum ZKPPC using lattice-based tools.
To this end, we introduce a new randomised password hashing scheme for ASCII-based passwords and
design an accompanying zero-knowledge protocol for policy compliance. Interestingly, our proposal
does not follow the framework established by Kiefer and Manulis and offers an alternate construction
without homomorphic commitments. Although our protocol is not ready to be used in practice, we think
it is an important first step towards a quantum-resistant privacy-preserving password-based
authentication and key exchange system.
