Recently, the leading performance of human pose estimation is dominated by heatmap based methods.
While being a fundamental component of heatmap processing, heatmap decoding (i.e. transforming
heatmaps to coordinates) receives only limited investigations, to our best knowledge. This work
fills the gap by studying the heatmap decoding processing with a particular focus on the errors introduced
throughout the prediction process. We found that the errors of heatmap based methods are surprisingly
significant, which nevertheless was universally ignored before. In view of the discovered importance,
we further reveal the intrinsic limitations of the previous widely used heatmap decoding methods
and thereout propose a Distribution-Aware and Error-Compensation Coordinate Decoding (DAEC).
Serving as a model-agnostic plug-in, DAEC learns its decoding strategy from training data and remarkably
improves the performance of a variety of state-of-the-art human pose estimation models with negligible
extra computation. Specifically, equipped with DAEC, the SimpleBaseline-ResNet152-256x192
and HRNet-W48-256x192 are significantly improved by 2.6 AP and 2.9 AP achieving 72.6 AP and 75.7
AP on COCO, respectively. Moreover, the HR-W32-256x256 and ResNet-152-256x256 frameworks enjoy
even more dramatic promotions of 8.4% and 7.8% on MPII with PCKh0.1 metric. Extensive experiments
performed on these two common benchmarks, demonstrates that DAEC exceeds its competitors by considerable
margins, backing up the rationality and generality of our novel heatmap decoding idea. The project
