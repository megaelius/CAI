This paper presents a sensitivity-based approach for the placement of distributed energy resources
(DERs) in power systems. The approach is based on the fact that most planning studies utilize some
form of optimization, and solutions to these optimization problems provide insights into the sensitivity
of many system variables to operating conditions and constraints. However, most of the existing
sensitivity-based planning criteria do not capture ranges of effectiveness of these solutions
(i.e., ranges of the effectiveness of Lagrange multipliers). The proposed method detects the ranges
of the effectiveness of Lagrange multipliers and uses them to determine optimal solution alternatives.
Profiles for existing generation and loads, and transmission constraints are taken into consideration.
The proposed method is used to determine the impacts of DERs at different locations, in the presence
of a stochastic element (load variability). This method consists of sequentially calculating
Lagrange multipliers of the dual solution of the optimization problem for various load buses for
all load scenarios. Optimal sizes and sites of resources are jointly determined in a sequential
manner based on the validity of active constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated through several case studies on various test systems including the IEEE reliability
test system (IEEE RTS), the IEEE 14, and 30 bus systems. In comparison with conventional sensitivity-based
approaches (i.e., without considering ranges of validity of Lagrange multipliers), the proposed
approach provides more accurate results for active constraints.
