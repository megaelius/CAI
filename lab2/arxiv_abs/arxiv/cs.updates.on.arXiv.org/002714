This paper presents a model based experimental investigation to demonstrate the usefulness of
an active damping strategy to manage fluid sloshing motion in spacecraft tanks. The active damping
strategy is designed to reduce the degrading impact on maneuvering and pointing performance via
a force feedback strategy. Many problems have been encountered until now, such as instability of
the closed loop system, excessive consumption in the attitude propellant or problems for engine
re-ignition in upper stages. Mostly, they have been addressed in a passive way via the design of baffles
and membranes, which on their own have mass and constructive impacts. Active management of propellant
motion in launchers and satellites has the potential to increase performance on various levels.
This paper demonstrates active slosh management using force feedback for the compensation of the
slosh resonances. Force sensors between tank and the carrying structure provide information of
the fluid motion via the reaction force. The control system is designed to generate an appropriate
acceleration profile that leads to desired attenuation profiles in amplitude, frequency and time.
Two robust control design methods, one based on $\mu$ design and the other on parametric structured
design based on non-smooth optimization of the worst-case $H_{\infty}$ norm, are applied. The
controller is first tested with a computational fluid dynamics simulation in the loop. Finally
a water tank mounted on a Hexapod with up to $1100$ liter is used to evaluate the control performance.
The paper illustrates that is possible to actively influence sloshing via closed loop.
