Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that severely affects eyes. It can be graded
into five levels of severity according to international protocol. However, optimizing a grading
model to have strong generalizability requires a large amount of balanced training data, which
is difficult to collect particularly for the high severity levels. Typical data augmentation methods,
including random flipping and rotation, cannot generate data with high diversity. In this paper,
we propose a diabetic retinopathy generative adversarial network (DR-GAN) to synthesize high-resolution
fundus images which can be manipulated with arbitrary grading and lesion information. Thus, large-scale
generated data can be used for more meaningful augmentation to train a DR grading and lesion segmentation
model. The proposed retina generator is conditioned on the structural and lesion masks, as well
as adaptive grading vectors sampled from the latent grading space, which can be adopted to control
the synthesized grading severity. Moreover, a multi-scale spatial and channel attention module
is devised to improve the generation ability to synthesize details. Multi-scale discriminators
are designed to operate from large to small receptive fields, and joint adversarial losses are adopted
to optimize the whole network in an end-to-end manner. With extensive experiments evaluated on
the EyePACS dataset connected to Kaggle, as well as our private dataset (SKA - will be released once
get official permission), we validate the effectiveness of our method, which can both synthesize
highly realistic (1280 x 1280) controllable fundus images and contribute to the DR grading task.
