We introduce a conceptual framework and an interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, reconstruct
the dynamics and generating mechanisms of dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations
based on the contribution of each of the system's by exploiting first principles from the theory
of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus consists in finding and applying
controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content
is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection
to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches to infer causal relationships
and to provide theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic
information landscape of a system's runs in parallel to its dynamic landscape providing a path to
move systems on one plane to have controlled effects on the other plane. Based on these methods, we
advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the system's
actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new dimension provides a suite
of powerful parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability ranging from causal discovery, dimension
reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle
and a system's (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription
Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating na\"ive to Th17
cell, and the CellNet database). We show the capabilities to pinpoint key elements (genes) related
to cell function and cell development conforming with the biological knowledge from experimentally
validated data and the literature demonstrating how the method can reshape a system's dynamics
in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.
