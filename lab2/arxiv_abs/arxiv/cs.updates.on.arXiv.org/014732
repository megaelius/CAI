Purpose: To develop a strategy for training a physics-guided MRI reconstruction neural network
without a database of fully-sampled datasets. Theory and Methods: Self-supervised learning via
data under-sampling (SSDU) for physics-guided deep learning (DL) reconstruction partitions
available measurements into two disjoint sets, one of which is used in the data consistency units
in the unrolled network and the other is used to define the loss for training. The proposed training
without fully-sampled data is compared to fully-supervised training with ground-truth data,
as well as conventional compressed sensing and parallel imaging methods using the publicly available
fastMRI knee database. The same physics-guided neural network is used for both proposed SSDU and
supervised training. The SSDU training is also applied to prospectively 2-fold accelerated high-resolution
brain datasets at different acceleration rates, and compared to parallel imaging. Results: Results
on five different knee sequences at acceleration rate of 4 shows that proposed self-supervised
approach performs closely with supervised learning, while significantly outperforming conventional
compressed sensing and parallel imaging, as characterized by quantitative metrics and a clinical
reader study. The results on prospectively sub-sampled brain datasets, where supervised learning
cannot be employed due to lack of ground-truth reference, show that the proposed self-supervised
approach successfully perform reconstruction at high acceleration rates (4, 6 and 8). Image readings
indicate improved visual reconstruction quality with the proposed approach compared to parallel
imaging at acquisition acceleration. Conclusion: The proposed SSDU approach allows training
of physics-guided DL-MRI reconstruction without fully-sampled data, while achieving comparable
results with supervised DL-MRI trained on fully-sampled data.
