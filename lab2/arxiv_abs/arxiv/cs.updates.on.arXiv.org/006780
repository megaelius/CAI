Accurate vehicular sensing is a basic and important operation in autonomous driving. Unfortunately,
the existing techniques have their own limitations. For instance, the GPS-based approach (e.g.,
transmission of GPS information) has high latency and low reliability while the reflection-based
approach (e.g., RADAR) is incapable of detecting hidden vehicles (HVs) without line-of-sight.
This is arguably the reason behind some recent fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles.
To address this issue, this paper presents a novel HV-sensing technology that exploits multi-path
transmission from a HV to a sensing vehicle (SV). The powerful technology enables the SV to detect
multiple HV-state parameters including position, orientation of driving direction, and size.
Its implementation does not even require transmitter-receiver synchronization like the conventional
microwave positioning techniques. Our design approach leverages estimated information on multi-path
(namely their AoA, AoD, and ToA) and their geometric relations. As a result, a complex system of equations
or optimization problems, where the desired HV-state parameters are variables, can be formulated
for different channel-noise conditions. The development of intelligent solution methods ranging
from least-square estimator to disk/box minimization yields a set of practical HV-sensing techniques.
We study their feasibility conditions in terms of the required number of paths. Furthermore, practical
solutions, including sequential path combining and random directional beamforming, are proposed
to enable HV-sensing given insufficient paths. Last, realistic simulation of driving in both highway
and rural scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. In summary, the
proposed technique will enhance the capabilities of existing vehicular sensing technologies
(e.g., RADAR and LIDAR) by enabling HV sensing.
