A number of recent works [Goldberg 2006; O'Donnell and Servedio 2011; De, Diakonikolas, and Servedio
2017; De, Diakonikolas, Feldman, and Servedio 2014] have considered the problem of approximately
reconstructing an unknown weighted voting scheme given information about various sorts of ``power
indices'' that characterize the level of control that individual voters have over the final outcome.
In the language of theoretical computer science, this is the problem of approximating an unknown
linear threshold function (LTF) over $\{-1, 1\}^n$ given some numerical measure (such as the function's
$n$ ``Chow parameters,'' a.k.a. its degree-1 Fourier coefficients, or the vector of its $n$ Shapley
indices) of how much each of the $n$ individual input variables affects the outcome of the function.
In this paper we consider the problem of reconstructing an LTF given only partial information about
its Chow parameters or Shapley indices; i.e. we are given only the Chow parameters or the Shapley
indices corresponding to a subset $S \subseteq [n]$ of the $n$ input variables. A natural goal in
this partial information setting is to find an LTF whose Chow parameters or Shapley indices corresponding
to indices in $S$ accurately match the given Chow parameters or Shapley indices of the unknown LTF.
We refer to this as the Partial Inverse Power Index Problem. Our main results are a polynomial time
algorithm for the ($\varepsilon$-approximate) Chow Parameters Partial Inverse Power Index Problem
and a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for the ($\varepsilon$-approximate) Shapley Indices Partial
Inverse Power Index Problem.
