The integral control of positive systems using nonnegative control input is an important problem
arising, among others, in biochemistry, epidemiology and ecology. An immediate solution is to
use an ON-OFF nonlinearity between the controller and the system. However, this solution is only
available when controllers are implemented in computer systems. When this is not the case, like
in biology, alternative approaches need to be explored. Based on recent research in the control
of biological systems, we propose to develop a theory for the integral control of positive systems
using nonnegative controls based on the so-called \emph{antithetic integral controller} and
two \emph{positively regularized integral controllers}, the so-called \emph{exponential integral
controller} and \emph{logistic integral controller}. For all these controllers, we establish
several qualitative results, which we connect to standard results on integral control. We also
obtain additional results which are specific to the type of controllers. For instance, we show an
interesting result stipulating that if the gain of the antithetic integral controller is suitably
chosen, then the local stability of the equilibrium point of the closed-loop system does not depend
on the choice for the coupling parameter, an additional parameter specific to this controller.
Conversely, we also show that if the coupling parameter is suitably chosen, then the equilibrium
point of the closed-loop system is locally stable regardless the value of the gain. For the exponential
integral controller, we can show that the local stability of the equilibrium point of the closed-loop
system is independent of the gain of the controller and the gain of the system. The stability only
depends on the exponential rate of the controller, again a parameter that is specific to this type
of controllers. Several examples are given for illustration.
