In this study, an application that can run on Android and Windows-based mobile devices was developed
to allow students attending such classes as Numerical/Digital Electronics, Logic Circuits, Basic
Electronics Measurement and Electronic Systems in Turkey's Vocation and Technical Education
Schools to easily carry out the simulation of logic gates, as well as logic circuit tests performed
using logic gates. A 2D-mobile application that runs on both platforms was developed using the C#
language on the Unity3D editor. To assess the usability of the mobile application, a one-hour training
session was administered in March of the 2017-2018 academic year to two groups of students from a
single class in the sixth grade of an Imam Hatip Secondary School affiliated to the Ministry of National
Education. Each of the two groups contained 12 students who were assumed to be equivalent, and who
had no prior knowledge of the subject. The training of the first group began with a lecture on basic
logic gates using a blackboard, and involved no simulations, while the second group, in addition
to being given the same the lecture, received additional training involving demonstrations of
the developed mobile application and its simulations. Following the lectures, a written exam was
applied to both groups. An evaluation of the exam results revealed that 83 percent of the students
who had been given demonstrations of the mobile application were able to perform the circuit task
completely, whereas only 50 percent of the other were able to complete the task. It was concluded
that the application was both useful and facilitating for to the students, and it was also noted that
students who were supported by the mobile application had gained a better grasp of the topic by being
able to see and practice the simulations first hand.
