Fingerprints are the most widely deployed form of biometric identification. No two individuals
share the same fingerprint because they have unique biometric identifiers. This paper presents
an efficient fingerprint verification algorithm which improves matching accuracy. Fingerprint
images get degraded and corrupted due to variations in skin and impression conditions. Thus, image
enhancement techniques are employed prior to singular point detection and minutiae extraction.
Singular point is the point of maximum curvature. It is determined by the normal of each fingerprint
ridge, and then following them inward towards the centre. The local ridge features known as minutiae
is extracted using cross-number method to find ridge endings and ridge bifurcations. The proposed
algorithm chooses a radius and draws a circle with core point as centre, making fingerprint images
rotationally invariant and uniform. The radius can be varied according to the accuracy depending
on the particular application. Morphological techniques such as clean, spur and H-break is employed
to remove noise, followed by removing spurious minutiae. Templates are created based on feature
vector extraction and databases are made for verification and identification for the fingerprint
images taken from Fingerprint Verification Competition (FVC2002). Minimum Euclidean distance
is calculated between saved template and the test fingerprint image template and compared with
the set threshold for matching decision. For the performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm
various measures, equal error rate (EER), Dmin at EER, accuracy and threshold are evaluated and
plotted. The measures demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective and robust.
