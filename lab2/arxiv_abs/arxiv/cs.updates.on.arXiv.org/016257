Monitoring athlete internal workload exposure, including prevention of catastrophic non-contact
knee injuries, relies on the existence of a custom early-warning detection system. This system
must be able to estimate accurate, reliable, and valid musculoskeletal joint loads, for sporting
maneuvers in near real-time and during match play. However, current methods are constrained to
laboratory instrumentation, are labor and cost intensive, and require highly trained specialist
knowledge, thereby limiting their ecological validity and wider deployment. An informative next
step towards this goal would be a new method to obtain ground kinetics in the field. Here we show that
kinematic data obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force platforms,
can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near real-time multidimensional
ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M). Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep
learning models were trained using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor
accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a million legacy
motion trials. Then, predictions were made from each model driven by five sensor accelerations
recorded during independent inter-laboratory data capture sessions. The proposed deep learning
workbench achieved correlations to ground truth, by maximum discrete GRF component, of vertical
Fz 0.97, anterior Fy 0.96 (both running), and lateral Fx 0.87 (sidestepping), with the strongest
mean recorded across GRF components 0.89, and for GRM 0.65 (both sidestepping). These best-case
correlations indicate the plausibility of the approach although the range of results was disappointing.
The goal to accurately estimate near real-time on-field GRF/M will be improved by the lessons learned
in this study [truncated].
