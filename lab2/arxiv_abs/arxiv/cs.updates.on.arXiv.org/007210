In this paper, we study the design of secure communication for time division duplex multi-cell multi-user
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with active eavesdropping. We assume
that the eavesdropper actively attacks the uplink pilot transmission and the uplink data transmission
before eavesdropping the downlink data transmission of the users. We exploit both the received
pilots and the received data signals for uplink channel estimation. We show analytically that when
the number of transmit antennas and the length of the data vector both tend to infinity, the signals
of the desired user and the eavesdropper lie in different eigenspaces of the received signal matrix
at the base station provided that their signal powers are different. This finding reveals that decreasing
(instead of increasing) the desired user's signal power might be an effective approach to combat
a strong active attack from an eavesdropper. Inspired by this observation, we propose a data-aided
secure downlink transmission scheme and derive an asymptotic achievable secrecy sum-rate expression
for the proposed design. For the special case of a single-cell single-user system with independent
and identically distributed fading, the obtained expression reveals that the secrecy rate scales
logarithmically with the number of transmit antennas. This is the same scaling law as for the achievable
rate of a single-user massive MIMO system in the absence of eavesdroppers. Numerical results indicate
that the proposed scheme achieves significant secrecy rate gains compared to alternative approaches
based on matched filter precoding with artificial noise generation and null space transmission.
