Constrained sequence (CS) codes, including fixed-length CS codes and variable-length CS codes,
have been widely used in modern wireless communication and data storage systems. Sequences encoded
with constrained sequence codes satisfy constraints imposed by the physical channel to enable
efficient and reliable transmission of coded symbols. In this paper, we propose using deep learning
approaches to decode fixed-length and variable-length CS codes. Traditional encoding and decoding
of fixed-length CS codes rely on look-up tables (LUTs), which is prone to errors that occur during
transmission. We introduce fixed-length constrained sequence decoding based on multiple layer
perception (MLP) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and demonstrate that we are
able to achieve low bit error rates that are close to maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding
as well as improve the system throughput. Further, implementation of capacity-achieving fixed-length
codes, where the complexity is prohibitively high with LUT decoding, becomes practical with deep
learning-based decoding. We then consider CNN-aided decoding of variable-length CS codes. Different
from conventional decoding where the received sequence is processed bit-by-bit, we propose using
CNNs to perform one-shot batch-processing of variable-length CS codes such that an entire batch
is decoded at once, which improves the system throughput. Moreover, since the CNNs can exploit global
information with batch-processing instead of only making use of local information as in conventional
bit-by-bit processing, the error rates can be reduced. We present simulation results that show
excellent performance with both fixed-length and variable-length CS codes that are used in the
frontiers of wireless communication systems.
