Searching for a person's name is a common online activity. However, web search engines suffer from
low numbers of accurate results to a query containing names. Underlying these poor results are the
multiple legitimate spelling variations for a given name, as opposed to regular text that typically
possesses a single way to be spelled correctly. Today, most of the techniques suggesting related
names based on pattern matching and phonetic encoding approaches. However, they frequently lead
to poor performance. Here, we propose a novel approach to tackle the problem of similar name suggestions.
Our novel algorithm utilizes historical data collected from genealogy websites along with graph
algorithms. In contrast to previous approaches that suggest similar names based on encoded representations
or patterns, we propose a general approach that suggests similar names based on the construction
and analysis of family trees. Using this valuable and historical information and combining it with
network algorithms provides a large name-based graph that offers a great number of suggestions
based on historical ancestors. Similar names are extracted from the graph based on generic ordering
functions that outperform other algorithms suggesting names based on a single dimension, which
limits their performance. Utilizing a large-scale online genealogy dataset with over 17M profiles
and more than 200K unique first names, we constructed a large name-based graph. Using this graph
along with 7,399 labeled given names with their true synonyms, we evaluated our proposed approach
and showed that comparing our algorithm to other algorithms, including phonetic and string similarity
algorithms, provides superior performance in terms of accuracy, F1, and precision. We suggest
our algorithm as a useful tool for suggesting similar names based on constructing a name-based graph
using family trees.
