With the rapid development of mobile devices, smartphones have gradually become an indispensable
part of people's lives. Meanwhile, biometric authentication has been corroborated to be an effective
method for establishing a person's identity with high confidence. Hence, recently, biometric
technologies for smartphones have also become increasingly sophisticated and popular. But it
is noteworthy that the application potential of palmprints for smartphones is seriously underestimated.
Studies in the past two decades have shown that palmprints have outstanding merits in uniqueness
and permanence, and have high user acceptance. However, currently, studies specializing in palmprint
verification for smartphones are still quite sporadic, especially when compared to face- or fingerprint-oriented
ones. In this paper, aiming to fill the aforementioned research gap, we conducted a thorough study
of palmprint verification on smartphones and our contributions are twofold. First, to facilitate
the study of palmprint verification on smartphones, we established an annotated palmprint dataset
named MPD, which was collected by multi-brand smartphones in two separate sessions with various
backgrounds and illumination conditions. As the largest dataset in this field, MPD contains 16,000
palm images collected from 200 subjects. Second, we built a DCNN-based palmprint verification
system named DeepMPV+ for smartphones. In DeepMPV+, two key steps, ROI extraction and ROI matching,
are both formulated as learning problems and then solved naturally by modern DCNN models. The efficiency
and efficacy of DeepMPV+ have been corroborated by extensive experiments. To make our results fully
reproducible, the labeled dataset and the relevant source codes have been made publicly available
