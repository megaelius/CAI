Creating fake images and videos such as "Deepfake" has become much easier these days due to the advancement
in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Moreover, recent research such as the few-shot learning
can create highly realistic personalized fake images with only a few images. Therefore, the threat
of Deepfake to be used for a variety of malicious intents such as propagating fake images and videos
becomes prevalent. And detecting these machine-generated fake images has been quite challenging
than ever. In this work, we propose a light-weight robust fine-tuning neural network-based classifier
architecture called Fake Detection Fine-tuning Network (FDFtNet), which is capable of detecting
many of the new fake face image generation models, and can be easily combined with existing image
classification networks and finetuned on a few datasets. In contrast to many existing methods,
our approach aims to reuse popular pre-trained models with only a few images for fine-tuning to effectively
detect fake images. The core of our approach is to introduce an image-based self-attention module
called Fine-Tune Transformer that uses only the attention module and the down-sampling layer.
This module is added to the pre-trained model and fine-tuned on a few data to search for new sets of
feature space to detect fake images. We experiment with our FDFtNet on the GANsbased dataset (Progressive
Growing GAN) and Deepfake-based dataset (Deepfake and Face2Face) with a small input image resolution
of 64x64 that complicates detection. Our FDFtNet achieves an overall accuracy of 90.29% in detecting
fake images generated from the GANs-based dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art.
