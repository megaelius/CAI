Recently hybrid evolutionary computation (EC) techniques are successfully implemented for solving
large sets of linear equations. All the recently developed hybrid evolutionary algorithms, for
solving linear equations, contain both the recombination and the mutation operations. In this
paper, two modified hybrid evolutionary algorithms contained time-variant adaptive evolutionary
technique are proposed for solving linear equations in which recombination operation is absent.
The effectiveness of the recombination operator has been studied for the time-variant adaptive
hybrid algorithms for solving large set of linear equations. Several experiments have been carried
out using both the proposed modified hybrid evolutionary algorithms (in which the recombination
operation is absent) and corresponding existing hybrid algorithms (in which the recombination
operation is present) to solve large set of linear equations. It is found that the number of generations
required by the existing hybrid algorithms (i.e. the Gauss-Seidel-SR based time variant adaptive
(GSBTVA) hybrid algorithm and the Jacobi-SR based time variant adaptive (JBTVA) hybrid algorithm)
and modified hybrid algorithms (i.e. the modified Gauss-Seidel-SR based time variant adaptive
(MGSBTVA) hybrid algorithm and the modified Jacobi-SR based time variant adaptive (MJBTVA) hybrid
algorithm) are comparable. Also the proposed modified algorithms require less amount of computational
time in comparison to the corresponding existing hybrid algorithms. As the proposed modified hybrid
algorithms do not contain recombination operation, so they require less computational effort,
and also they are more efficient, effective and easy to implement.
