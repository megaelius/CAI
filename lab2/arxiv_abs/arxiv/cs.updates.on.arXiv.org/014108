Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of Breast Cancer (BRCA) images has been an active area of research
in recent years. The main goals of this research is to develop reliable automatic methods for detecting
and diagnosing different types of BRCA from diagnostic images. In this paper, we present a review
of the state of the art CAD methods applied to magnetic resonance (MRI) and mammography images of
BRCA patients. The review aims to provide an extensive introduction to different features extracted
from BRCA images through texture and statistical analysis and to categorize deep learning frameworks
and data structures capable of using metadata to aggregate relevant information to assist oncologists
and radiologists. We divide the existing literature according to the imaging modality and into
radiomics, machine learning, or combination of both. We also emphasize the difference between
each modality and methods strengths and weaknesses and analyze their performance in detecting
BRCA through a quantitative comparison. We compare the results of various approaches for implementing
CAD systems for the detection of BRCA. Each approachs standard workflow components are reviewed
and summary tables provided. We present an extensive literature review of radiomics feature extraction
techniques and machine learning methods applied in BRCA diagnosis and detection, focusing on data
preparation, data structures, pre processing and post processing strategies available in the
literature. There is a growing interest on radiomic feature extraction and machine learning methods
for BRCA detection through histopathological images, MRI and mammography images. However, there
isnt a CAD method able to combine distinct data types to provide the best diagnostic results. Employing
data fusion techniques to medical images and patient data could lead to improved detection and classification
results.
