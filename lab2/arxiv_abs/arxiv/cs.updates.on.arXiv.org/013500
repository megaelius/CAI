In recent years, a great variety of nature- and bio-inspired algorithms has been reported in the
literature. This algorithmic family simulates different biological processes observed in Nature
in order to efficiently address complex optimization problems. In the last years the number of bio-inspired
optimization approaches in literature has grown considerably, reaching unprecedented levels
that dark the future prospects of this field of research. This paper addresses this problem by proposing
two comprehensive, principle-based taxonomies that allow researchers to organize existing and
future algorithmic developments into well-defined categories, considering two different criteria:
the source of inspiration and the behavior of each algorithm. Using these taxonomies we review more
than three hundred publications dealing with nature-inspired and bio-inspired algorithms, and
proposals falling within each of these categories are examined, leading to a critical summary of
design trends and similarities between them, and the identification of the most similar classical
algorithm for each reviewed paper. From our analysis we conclude that a poor relationship is often
found between the natural inspiration of an algorithm and its behavior. Furthermore, similarities
in terms of behavior between different algorithms are greater than what is claimed in their public
disclosure: specifically, we show that more than one-third of the reviewed bio-inspired solvers
are versions of classical algorithms. Grounded on the conclusions of our critical analysis, we
give several recommendations and points of improvement for better methodological practices in
this active and growing research field.
