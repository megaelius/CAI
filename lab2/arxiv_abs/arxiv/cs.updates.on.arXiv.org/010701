We propose a CNN based technique that aggregates feature maps from its multiple layers that can localize
abnormalities with greater details as well as predict pathology under consideration. Existing
class activation mapping (CAM) techniques extract feature maps from either the final layer or a
single intermediate layer to create the discriminative maps and then interpolate to upsample to
the original image resolution. In this case, the subject specific localization is coarse and is
unable to capture subtle abnormalities. To mitigate this, our method builds a novel CNN based discriminative
localization model that we call high resolution CAM (HR-CAM), which accounts for layers from each
resolution, therefore facilitating a comprehensive map that can delineate the pathology for each
subject by combining low-level, intermediate as well as high-level features from the CNN. Moreover,
our model directly provides the discriminative map in the resolution of the original image facilitating
finer delineation of abnormalities. We demonstrate the working of our model on a simulated abnormalities
data where we illustrate how the model captures finer details in the final discriminative maps as
compared to current techniques. We then apply this technique: (1) to classify ependymomas from
grade IV glioblastoma on T1-weighted contrast enhanced (T1-CE) MRI and (2) to predict Parkinson's
disease from neuromelanin sensitive MRI. In all these cases we demonstrate that our model not only
predicts pathologies with high accuracies, but also creates clinically interpretable subject
specific high resolution discriminative localizations. Overall, the technique can be generalized
to any CNN and carries high relevance in a clinical setting.
