Mathematical software and graph-theoretical algorithmic packages to efficiently model, analyze
and query graphs are crucial in an era where large-scale spatial, societal and economic network
data are abundantly available. One such package is JGraphT, a programming library which contains
very efficient and generic graph data-structures along with a large collection of state-of-the-art
algorithms. The library is written in Java with stability, interoperability and performance in
mind. A distinctive feature of this library is the ability to model vertices and edges as arbitrary
objects, thereby permitting natural representations of many common networks including transportation,
social and biological networks. Besides classic graph algorithms such as shortest-paths and spanning-tree
algorithms, the library contains numerous advanced algorithms: graph and subgraph isomorphism;
matching and flow problems; approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems such as independent
set and TSP; and several more exotic algorithms such as Berge graph detection. Due to its versatility
and generic design, JGraphT is currently used in large-scale commercial, non-commercial and academic
research projects. In this work we describe in detail the design and underlying structure of the
library, and discuss its most important features and algorithms. A computational study is conducted
to evaluate the performance of JGraphT versus a number of similar libraries. Experiments on a large
number of graphs over a variety of popular algorithms show that JGraphT is highly competitive with
other established libraries such as NetworkX or the BGL.
