Whole-body control (WBC) is a generic task-oriented control method for feedback control of loco-manipulation
behaviors in humanoid robots. The combination of WBC and model-based walking controllers has been
widely utilized in various humanoid robots. However, to date, the WBC method has not been employed
for unsupported passive-ankle dynamic locomotion. As such, in this paper, we devise a new WBC, dubbed
whole-body locomotion controller (WBLC), that can achieve experimental dynamic walking on unsupported
passive-ankle biped robots. A key aspect of WBLC is the relaxation of contact constraints such that
the control commands produce reduced jerk when switching foot contacts. To achieve robust dynamic
locomotion, we conduct an in-depth analysis of uncertainty for our dynamic walking algorithm called
time-to-velocity-reversal (TVR) planner. The uncertainty study is fundamental as it allows us
to improve the control algorithms and mechanical structure of our robot to fulfill the tolerated
uncertainty. In addition, we conduct extensive experimentation for: 1) unsupported dynamic balancing
(i.e. in-place stepping) with a six degree-of-freedom (DoF) biped, Mercury; 2) unsupported directional
walking with Mercury; 3) walking over an irregular and slippery terrain with Mercury; and 4) in-place
walking with our newly designed ten-DoF viscoelastic liquid-cooled biped, DRACO. Overall, the
main contributions of this work are on: a) achieving various modalities of unsupported dynamic
locomotion of passive-ankle bipeds using a WBLC controller and a TVR planner, b) conducting an uncertainty
analysis to improve the mechanical structure and the controllers of Mercury, and c) devising a whole-body
control strategy that reduces movement jerk during walking.
