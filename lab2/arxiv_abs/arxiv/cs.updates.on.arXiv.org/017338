When agents interact socially with different intentions, conflicts are difficult to avoid. Although
how agents can resolve such problems autonomously has not been determined, dynamic characteristics
of agency may shed light on underlying mechanisms. The current study focused on the sense of agency
(SoA), a specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's intention in acting
and the outcome. Employing predictive coding and active inference as theoretical frameworks of
perception and action generation, we hypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence
lower bound of an agent's model should affect the strength of the agent's SoA and should have a critical
impact on social interactions. We built a computational model of imitative interaction between
a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive sensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural
network, and simulated the model in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human
body movement data. A key feature of the model is that each modality's complexity can be regulated
differently with a hyperparameter assigned to each module. We first searched for an optimal setting
that endows the model with appropriate coordination of multimodal sensation. This revealed that
the vision module's complexity should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception
module. Using the optimally trained model, we examined how changing the tightness of complexity
regulation after training affects the strength of the SoA during interactions. The results showed
that with looser regulation, an agent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the
other. In contrast, with tighter regulation, the agent tends to follow the other by adjusting its
intention. We conclude that the tightness of complexity regulation crucially affects the strength
of the SoA and the dynamics of interactions between agents.
