We define a ring R of geometric objects G generated by finite abstract simplicial complexes. To every
G belongs Hodge Laplacian H as the square of the Dirac operator determining its cohomology and a unimodular
connection matrix L). The sum of the matrix entries of the inverse of L is the Euler characteristic.
The spectra of H as well as inductive dimension add under multiplication while the spectra of L multiply.
The nullity of the Hodge of H are the Betti numbers which can now be signed. The map assigning to G its
Poincare polynomial is a ring homomorphism from R the polynomials. Especially the Euler characteristic
is a ring homomorphism. Also Wu characteristic produces a ring homomorphism. The Kuenneth correspondence
between cohomology groups is explicit as a basis for the product can be obtained from a basis of the
factors. The product in R produces the strong product for the connection graphs and leads to tensor
products of connection Laplacians. The strong ring R is also a subring of the full Stanley-Reisner
ring S Every element G can be visualized by its Barycentric refinement graph G1 and its connection
graph G'. Gauss-Bonnet, Poincare-Hopf or the Brouwer-Lefschetz extend to the strong ring. The
isomorphism of R with a subring of the strong Sabidussi ring shows that the multiplicative primes
in R are the simplicial complexes and that every connected element in the strong ring has a unique
prime factorization. The Sabidussi ring is dual to the Zykov ring, in which the Zykov join is the addition.
The connection Laplacian of the d-dimensional lattice remains invertible in the infinite volume
limit: there is a mass gap in any dimension.
