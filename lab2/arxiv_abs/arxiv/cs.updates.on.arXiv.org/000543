In the Interval Completion problem we are given a graph G and an integer k, and the task is to turn G using
at most k edge additions into an interval graph, i.e., a graph admitting an intersection model of
intervals on a line. Motivated by applications in sparse matrix multiplication and molecular biology,
Kaplan, Shamir and Tarjan [FOCS 1994; SIAM J. Comput. 1999] asked for a fixed-parameter algorithm
solving this problem. This question was answer affirmatively more than a decade later by Villanger
at el. [STOC 2007; SIAM J. Comput. 2009], who presented an algorithm with running time $O(k^{2k}n^3m)$.
In our work we show that Interval Completion is solvable in $k^{O(\sqrt{k})} n^{O(1)}$ time, that
is, in subexponential parameterized time. Contrary to the previous algorithms that focused mostly
on forbidden structures in interval graphs, our algorithm follows the approach developed recently
by Fomin and Villanger [SODA 2012; SIAM J. Comput. 2013] for Chordal Completion and builds a model
of the desired interval graph with dynamic programming. However, comparing to the case of Chordal
Completion, we need to cope with two major difficulties. First, the knowledge of all candidates
for maximal cliques or clique separators in the output interval graph is far from sufficient to perform
a natural `left-to-right' dynamic programming, and we need to develop a completely different and
much more involved way to build the desired interval model. Second, no efficient preprocessing
routine (the so-called polynomial kernel) is known for Interval Completion, and circumventing
this obstacle requires significantly new ideas and deeper insight into the structure of the input
instance.
