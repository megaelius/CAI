The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in a pandemic crippling the a breadth of services
critical to daily life. Segmentation of lung infections in computerized tomography (CT) slices
could be be used to improve diagnosis and understanding of COVID-19 in patients. Deep learning systems
lack interpretability because of their black box nature. Inspired by human communication of complex
ideas through language, we propose a symbolic framework based on emergent languages for the segmentation
of COVID-19 infections in CT scans of lungs. We model the cooperation between two artificial agents
- a Sender and a Receiver. These agents synergistically cooperate using emergent symbolic language
to solve the task of semantic segmentation. Our game theoretic approach is to model the cooperation
between agents unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The Sender retrieves information
from one of the higher layers of the deep network and generates a symbolic sentence sampled from a
categorical distribution of vocabularies. The Receiver ingests the stream of symbols and cogenerates
the segmentation mask. A private emergent language is developed that forms the communication channel
used to describe the task of segmentation of COVID infections. We augment existing state of the art
semantic segmentation architectures with our symbolic generator to form symbolic segmentation
models. Our symbolic segmentation framework achieves state of the art performance for segmentation
of lung infections caused by COVID-19. Our results show direct interpretation of symbolic sentences
to discriminate between normal and infected regions, infection morphology and image characteristics.
We show state of the art results for segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections in CT.
