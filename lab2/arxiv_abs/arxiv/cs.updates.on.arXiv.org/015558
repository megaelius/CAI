Low-latency telerobotics can enable more intricate surface tasks on extraterrestrial planetary
bodies than has ever been attempted. For humanity to create a sustainable lunar presence, well-developed
collaboration between humans and robots is necessary to perform complex tasks. This paper presents
a methodology to assess the human factors, situational awareness (SA) and cognitive load (CL),
associated with teleoperated assembly tasks. Currently, telerobotic assembly on an extraterrestrial
body has never been attempted, and a valid methodology to assess the associated human factors has
not been developed. The Telerobotics Laboratory at the University of Colorado-Boulder created
the Telerobotic Simulation System (TSS) which enables remote operation of a rover and a robotic
arm. The TSS was used in a laboratory experiment designed as an analog to a lunar mission. The operator's
task was to assemble a radio interferometer. Each participant completed this task under two conditions,
remote teleoperation (limited SA) and local operation (optimal SA). The goal of the experiment
was to establish a methodology to accurately measure the operator's SA and CL while performing teleoperated
assembly tasks. A successful methodology would yield results showing greater SA and lower CL while
operating locally. Performance metrics showed greater SA and lower CL in the local environment,
supported by a 27% increase in the mean time to completion of the assembly task when operating remotely.
Subjective measurements of SA and CL did not align with the performance metrics. Results from this
experiment will guide future work attempting to accurately quantify the human factors associated
with telerobotic assembly. Once an accurate methodology has been developed, we will be able to measure
how new variables affect an operator's SA and CL to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of
telerobotic assembly tasks.
