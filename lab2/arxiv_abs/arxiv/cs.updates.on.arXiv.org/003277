In recent years, microgrids, i.e., disconnected distribution systems, have received increasing
interest from power system utilities to support the economic and resiliency posture of their systems.
The economics of long distance transmission lines prevent many remote communities from connecting
to bulk transmission systems and these communities rely on off-grid microgrid technology. Furthermore,
communities that are connected to the bulk transmission system are investigating microgrid technologies
that will support their ability to disconnect and operate independently during extreme events.
In each of these cases, it is important to develop methodologies that support the capability to design
and operate microgrids in the absence of transmission over long periods of time. Unfortunately,
such planning problems tend to be computationally difficult to solve and those that are straightforward
to solve often lack the modeling fidelity that inspires confidence in the results. To address these
issues, we first develop a high fidelity model for design and operations of a microgrid that include
component efficiencies, component operating limits, battery modeling, unit commitment, capacity
expansion, and power flow physics; the resulting model is a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained
quadratic program (MIQCQP). We then develop an iterative algorithm, referred to as the Model Predictive
Control (MPC) algorithm, that allows us to solve the resulting MIQCQP. We show, through extensive
computational experiments, that the MPC-based method can scale to problems that have a very long
planning horizon and provide high quality solutions that lie within 5\% of optimal.
