The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as
provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for researchers to use freely available multi-spectral
optical images, with decametric spatial resolution and more frequent revisits for remote sensing
applications such as land cover and crop classification (LC&CC), agricultural monitoring and
management, environment monitoring. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping can be
categorized based on per-pixel based and object-based. However, it is still challenging when more
classes of agricultural crops are considered at a massive scale. In this paper, a novel and optimal
deep learning model for pixel-based LC&CC is developed and implemented based on Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN) in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using multi-temporal
sentinel-2 imagery of central north part of Italy, which has diverse agricultural system dominated
by economic crop types. The proposed methodology is capable of automated feature extraction by
learning time correlation of multiple images, which reduces manual feature engineering and modeling
crop phenological stages. Fifteen classes, including major agricultural crops, were considered
in this study. We also tested other widely used traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison
such as support vector machine SVM, random forest (RF), Kernal SVM, and gradient boosting machine,
also called XGBoost. The overall accuracy achieved by our proposed Pixel R-CNN was 96.5%, which
showed considerable improvements in comparison with existing mainstream methods. This study
showed that Pixel R-CNN based model offers a highly accurate way to assess and employ time-series
data for multi-temporal classification tasks.
