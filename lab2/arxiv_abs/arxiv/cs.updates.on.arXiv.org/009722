Optical wireless communication (OWC) is a promising technology that can provide high data rates
while supporting multiple users. The Optical Wireless (OW) physical layer has been researched
extensively, however less work was devoted to multiple access and how the OW front end is connected
to the network. In this paper, an OWC system which employs a wavelength division multiple access
(WDMA) scheme is studied, for the purpose of supporting multiple users. In addition, a cloud/fog
architecture is proposed for the first time for OWC to provide processing capabilities. The cloud/fog-integrated
architecture uses visible indoor light to create high data rate connections with potential mobile
nodes. These optical wireless nodes are further clustered and used as fog mini servers to provide
processing services through the optical wireless channel for other users. Additional fog processing
units are located in the room, the building, the campus and at the metro level. Further processing
capabilities are provided by remote cloud sites. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model
was developed and utilised to optimise resource allocation in the indoor OWC system. A second MILP
model was developed to optimise the placement of processing tasks in the different fog and cloud
nodes available. The optimisation of tasks placement in the cloud-/fog-integrated architecture
was analysed using the MILP models. Multiple scenarios were considered where the mobile node locations
were varied in the room and the amount of processing and data rate requested by each optical wireless
node is varied. The results help identify the optimum colour and access point to use for communication
for a given mobile node location and OWC system configuration, the optimum location to place processing
and the impact of the network architecture. Areas for future work are identified.
