The CEO problem has received much attention since first introduced by Berger et al., but there are
limited results on non-Gaussian models with non-quadratic distortion measures. In this work,
we extend the quadratic Gaussian CEO problem to two continuous alphabet settings with general $r$th
power of difference distortion, and study asymptotics of distortion decay as the number of agents
and sum rate, $R_{\textsf{sum}}$, grow without bound, while individual rates vanish. The first
setting is a regular source-observation model, such as jointly Gaussian, with difference distortion
and we establish that the distortion decays at $\mathcal{O}(R_{\textsf{sum}}^{-r/2})$ when
$r \ge 2$. We use sample median estimation after the Berger-Tung scheme for achievability. The other
setting is a non-regular source-observation model, such as copula or uniform additive noise models,
with difference distortion for which estimation-theoretic regularity conditions do not hold.
The decay $\mathcal{O}(R_{\textsf{sum}}^{-r})$ when $r \ge 1$ is obtained for the non-regular
model by midrange estimator following the Berger-Tung scheme. We also provide converses based
on the Shannon lower bound for the regular model, and the Chazan-Zakai-Ziv bound for the non-regular
model. Interestingly, the regular model converse when $r=2$ recovers the Viswanathan-Berger
converse and is thus tight. Lastly, we provide a sufficient condition for the regular model, under
which quadratic and logarithmic distortions are asymptotically equivalent by an entropy power
relationship as the number of agents grows. This proof relies on the Bernstein-von Mises theorem.
