Gradient porous structured materials possess significant potential of being applied in many engineering
fields. To help accelerate the design of infill graded microstructures, a novel asymptotic homogenisation
topology optimisation method has been proposed by Zhu et al.(2019), aiming for 1) significantly
enriching the pool of representable graded microstructures; 2) deriving an homogenised formulation
underpinning its stress analysis in consistency with fine-scale results. But the work is severely
confined from being widely applied mainly due to the following two reasons. Firstly, to circumvent
the extremely time-consuming computation of the microscopic cell problems at every macroscopic
point, its linearised form has to be used in numerical implementation, and this significantly reduces
the design freedom. Secondly, lacking of an associated formulation of sensitive analysis, genetic
algorithm was chosen for optimisation, which inevitably decreases the computational efficiency.
To address these bottleneck challenging issues, a high-efficiency approach for the analysis and
design of structures filled with quasi-periodic graded microstructures is proposed. A zoning
scheme in favour of parallel computation is introduced, so as to make the best use of the new asymptotic
homogenisation results. The proposed algorithm is validated through a comparison with existing
two-dimensional benchmark cases and fine-scale brute force simulation results. The present approach
is also applied for the topology optimisation of three-dimensional graded microstructures, which
have barely been examined in literature, possibly because of the high computational cost, and the
significantly high computational efficiency of the proposed scheme is clearly demonstrated by
the provided examples.
