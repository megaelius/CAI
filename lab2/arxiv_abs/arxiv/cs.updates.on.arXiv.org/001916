We study the problem of response selection for multi-turn conversation in retrieval-based chatbots.
The task requires matching a response candidate with a conversation context, whose challenges
include how to recognize important parts of the context, and how to model the relationships among
utterances in the context. Existing matching methods may lose important information in contexts
as we can interpret them with a unified framework in which contexts are transformed to fixed-length
vectors without any interaction with responses before matching. The analysis motivates us to propose
a new matching framework that can sufficiently carry the important information in contexts to matching
and model the relationships among utterances at the same time. The new framework, which we call a
sequential matching framework (SMF), lets each utterance in a context interacts with a response
candidate at the first step and transforms the pair to a matching vector. The matching vectors are
then accumulated following the order of the utterances in the context with a recurrent neural network
(RNN) which models the relationships among the utterances. The context-response matching is finally
calculated with the hidden states of the RNN. Under SMF, we propose a sequential convolutional network
and sequential attention network and conduct experiments on two public data sets to test their performance.
Experimental results show that both models can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
matching methods. We also show that the models are interpretable with visualizations that provide
us insights on how they capture and leverage the important information in contexts for matching.
