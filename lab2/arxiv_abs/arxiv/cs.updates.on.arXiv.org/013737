When it comes to addressing the safety/security related needs at different production/construction
sites, accurate detection of the presence of workers, vehicles, equipment important and formed
an integral part of computer vision-based surveillance systems (CVSS). Traditional CVSS systems
focus on the use of different computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms overly reliant
on manual extraction of features and small datasets, limiting their usage because of low accuracy,
need for expert knowledge and high computational costs. The main objective of this paper is to provide
decision makers at sites with a practical yet comprehensive deep learning and IoT based solution
to tackle various computer vision related problems such as scene classification, object detection
in scenes, semantic segmentation, scene captioning etc. Our overarching goal is to address the
central question of What is happening at this site and where is it happening in an automated fashion
minimizing the need for human resources dedicated to surveillance. We developed Deep ExxonMobil
Eye for Video Analysis (DEEVA) package to handle scene classification, object detection, semantic
segmentation and captioning of scenes in a hierarchical approach. The results reveal that transfer
learning with the RetinaNet object detector is able to detect the presence of workers, different
types of vehicles/construction equipment, safety related objects at a high level of accuracy (above
90%). With the help of deep learning to automatically extract features and IoT technology to automatic
capture, transfer and process vast amount of realtime images, this framework is an important step
towards the development of intelligent surveillance systems aimed at addressing myriads of open
ended problems in the realm of security/safety monitoring, productivity assessments and future
decision making.
