Proving super-polynomial size lower bounds for syntactic multilinear Algebraic Branching Programs(smABPs)
computing an explicit polynomial is a challenging problem in Algebraic Complexity Theory. The
order in which variables in $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ appear along source to sink paths in any smABP
can be viewed as a permutation in $S_n$. In this article, we consider the following special classes
of smABPs where the order of occurrence of variables along a source to sink path is restricted: Strict
circular-interval ABPs: For every subprogram the index set of variables occurring in it is contained
in some circular interval of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. L-ordered ABPs: There is a set of L permutations
of variables such that every source to sink path in the ABP reads variables in one of the L orders. We
prove exponential lower bound for the size of a strict circular-interval ABP computing an explicit
n-variate multilinear polynomial in VP. For the same polynomial, we show that any sum of L-ordered
ABPs of small size will require exponential ($2^{n^{\Omega(1)}}$) many summands, when $L \leq
2^{n^{1/2-\epsilon}}, \epsilon>0$. At the heart of above lower bound arguments is a new decomposition
theorem for smABPs: We show that any polynomial computable by an smABP of size S can be written as a
sum of O(S) many multilinear polynomials where each summand is a product of two polynomials in at
most 2n/3 variables computable by smABPs. As a corollary, we obtain a low bottom fan-in version of
the depth reduction by Tavenas [MFCS 2013] in the case of smABPs. In particular, we show that a polynomial
having size S smABPs can be expressed as a sum of products of multilinear polynomials on $O(\sqrt{n})$
variables, where the total number of summands is bounded by $2^{O(\sqrt{n}\log n \log S)}$. Additionally,
we show that L-ordered ABPs can be transformed into L-pass smABPs with a polynomial blowup in size.
