We are motivated by the need, in some applications, for impromptu or as-you-go deployment of wireless
sensor networks. A person walks along a line, starting from a sink node (e.g., a base-station), and
proceeds towards a source node (e.g., a sensor) which is at an a priori unknown location. At equally
spaced locations, he makes link quality measurements to the previous relay, and deploys relays
at some of these locations, with the aim to connect the source to the sink by a multihop wireless path.
In this paper, we consider two approaches for impromptu deployment: (i) the deployment agent can
only move forward (which we call a pure as-you-go approach), and (ii) the deployment agent can make
measurements over several consecutive steps before selecting a placement location among them
(which we call an explore-forward approach). We consider a light traffic regime, and formulate
the problem as a Markov decision process, where the trade-off is among the power used by the nodes,
the outage probabilities in the links, and the number of relays placed per unit distance. We obtain
the structures of the optimal policies for the pure as-you-go approach as well as for the explore-forward
approach. We also consider natural heuristic algorithms, for comparison. Numerical examples
show that the explore-forward approach significantly outperforms the pure as-you-go approach.
Next, we propose two learning algorithms for the explore-forward approach, based on Stochastic
Approximation, which asymptotically converge to the set of optimal policies, without using any
knowledge of the radio propagation model. We demonstrate numerically that the learning algorithms
can converge (as deployment progresses) to the set of optimal policies reasonably fast and, hence,
can be practical, model-free algorithms for deployment over large regions.
