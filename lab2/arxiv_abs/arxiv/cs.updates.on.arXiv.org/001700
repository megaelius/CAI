This paper focuses on an examination of an applicability of Recurrent Neural Network models for
detecting anomalous behavior of the CERN superconducting magnets. In order to conduct the experiments,
the authors designed and implemented an adaptive signal quantization algorithm and a custom GRU-based
detector and developed a method for the detector parameters selection. Three different datasets
were used for testing the detector. Two artificially generated datasets were used to assess the
raw performance of the system whereas the 231 MB dataset composed of the signals acquired from HiLumi
magnets was intended for real-life experiments and model training. Several different setups of
the developed anomaly detection system were evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art OC-SVM
reference model operating on the same data. The OC-SVM model was equipped with a rich set of feature
extractors accounting for a range of the input signal properties. It was determined in the course
of the experiments that the detector, along with its supporting design methodology, reaches F1
equal or very close to 1 for almost all test sets. Due to the profile of the data, the best_length setup
of the detector turned out to perform the best among all five tested configuration schemes of the
detection system. The quantization parameters have the biggest impact on the overall performance
of the detector with the best values of input/output grid equal to 16 and 8, respectively. The proposed
solution of the detection significantly outperformed OC-SVM-based detector in most of the cases,
with much more stable performance across all the datasets.
