Since 2016, all of four major U.S. operators have rolled out nationwide Wi-Fi calling services.
They are projected to surpass VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and other VoIP services in terms of mobile IP
voice usage minutes in 2018. They enable mobile users to place cellular calls over Wi-Fi networks
based on the 3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) technology. Compared with conventional cellular
voice solutions, the major difference lies in that their traffic traverses untrustful Wi-Fi networks
and the Internet. This exposure to insecure networks may cause the Wi-Fi calling users to suffer
from security threats. Its security mechanisms are similar to the VoLTE, because both of them are
supported by the IMS. They include SIM-based security, 3GPP AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement),
IPSec (Internet Protocol Security), etc. However, are they sufficient to secure Wi-Fi calling
services? Unfortunately, our study yields a negative answer. We conduct the first study of exploring
security issues of the operational Wi-Fi calling services in three major U.S. operators' networks
using commodity devices. We disclose that current Wi-Fi calling security is not bullet-proof and
uncover four vulnerabilities which stem from improper standard designs, device implementation
issues and network operation slips. By exploiting the vulnerabilities, together with several
state-of-the-art computer visual recognition technologies, we devise two proof-of-concept
attacks: user privacy leakage and telephony harassment or denial of voice service (THDoS); both
of them can bypass the security defenses deployed on mobile devices and the network infrastructure.
We have confirmed their feasibility and simplicity using real-world experiments, as well as assessed
their potential damages and proposed recommended solutions.
