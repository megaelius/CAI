About 1Bn people around the globe are born and live without identity documents. In addition, displaced
people, projected at 1Bn within a generation, often find themselves without worthy identity documentation
even if they had any in their country of origin. Given that centralized, top-down identity-granting
solutions are failing a large portion of the world population, a bottom-up, grassroots, decentralized
solution that allows every human being to create and own a trustworthy \emph{genuine global identity}
is an urgent necessity. Such a bottom-up solution is worthy only if it is resilient to malicious antagonists
that create fake and duplicate identities (so called \emph{sybils}). Furthermore, for a solution
to be truly grassroots, the people that rely on it for their global identity should also be its sovereign.
Hence its governance has to be sybil-resilient as well. Here, we present a foundation for a decentralized,
grassroots, bottom-up, self-sovereign process in which every human being may easily create and
own a genuine global identity, realized as a public key. The solution relies on the formation of a
"Web of Trust" among global identities, but does not rely on biometrics, nor does it require to store
any personal information on public or even third-party storage, except for the public key itself.
The approach is designed for natural realization using distributed ledger/blockchain technology.
For the solution to be complete, additional components are needed, including a mechanism that encourages
honest behavior and an egalitarian cryptocurrency to fuel the mechanism. These are a subject for
future research.
