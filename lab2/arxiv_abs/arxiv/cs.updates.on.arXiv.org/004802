Mobile crowdsensing has shown a great potential to address large-scale data sensing problems by
allocating sensing tasks to pervasive mobile users. The mobile users will participate in a crowdsensing
platform if they can receive satisfactory reward. In this paper, to effectively and efficiently
recruit sufficient number of mobile users, i.e., participants, we investigate an optimal incentive
mechanism of a crowdsensing service provider. We apply a two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze
the participation level of the mobile users and the optimal incentive mechanism of the crowdsensing
service provider using backward induction. In order to motivate the participants, the incentive
is designed by taking into account the social network effects from the underlying mobile social
domain. For example, in a crowdsensing-based road traffic information sharing application, a
user can get a better and accurate traffic report if more users join and share their road information.
We derive the analytical expressions for the discriminatory incentive as well as the uniform incentive
mechanisms. To fit into practical scenarios, we further formulate a Bayesian Stackelberg game
with incomplete information to analyze the interaction between the crowdsensing service provider
and mobile users, where the social structure information (the social network effects) is uncertain.
The existence and uniqueness of the Bayesian Stackelberg equilibrium are validated by identifying
the best response strategies of the mobile users. Numerical results corroborate the fact that the
network effects tremendously stimulate higher mobile participation level and greater revenue
of the crowdsensing service provider. In addition, the social structure information helps the
crowdsensing service provider to achieve greater revenue gain.
