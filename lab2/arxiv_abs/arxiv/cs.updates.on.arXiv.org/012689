The fate of scientific hypotheses often relies on the ability of a computational model to explain
the data, quantified in modern statistical approaches by the likelihood function. The log-likelihood
is the key element for parameter estimation and model evaluation. However, the log-likelihood
of complex models in fields such as computational biology and neuroscience is often intractable
to compute analytically or numerically. In those cases, researchers can often only estimate the
log-likelihood by comparing observed data with synthetic observations generated by model simulations.
Standard techniques to approximate the likelihood via simulation either use summary statistics
of the data or are at risk of producing severe biases in the estimate. Here, we explore another method,
inverse binomial sampling (IBS), which can estimate the log-likelihood of an entire data set efficiently
and without bias. For each observation, IBS draws samples from the simulator model until one matches
the observation. The log-likelihood estimate is then a function of the number of samples drawn.
The variance of this estimator is uniformly bounded, achieves the minimum variance for an unbiased
estimator, and we can compute calibrated estimates of the variance. We provide theoretical arguments
in favor of IBS and an empirical assessment of the method for maximum-likelihood estimation with
simulation-based models. As case studies, we take three model-fitting problems of increasing
complexity from computational and cognitive neuroscience. In all problems, IBS generally produces
lower error in the estimated parameters and maximum log-likelihood values than alternative sampling
methods with the same average number of samples. Our results demonstrate the potential of IBS as
a practical, robust, and easy to implement method for log-likelihood evaluation when exact techniques
are not available.
