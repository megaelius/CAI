This paper presents the design and integration of 3 Survivor, a rough terrain negotiable teleoperated
mobile rescue and service robot. 3 Survivor is an improved version of two previously studied surveillance
robots named Sigma 3 and Alpha N. In 3 Survivor, a modified double tracked with caterpillar mechanism
is incorporated in the body design. A passive adjustment established in the body balance enables
the front and rear body to operate in excellent synchronization. Instead of using an actuator, a
re configurable dynamic method is constructed with a 6 DOF arm. This dynamic method is configured
with the planer, spatial mechanism, rotation matrix, motion control of rotation using inverse
kinematics and controlling power consumption of the manipulator using angular momentum. The robot
is remotely controlled using a handheld Radio Frequency RF transmitter. 3 Survivor is equipped
with a Raspberry Pi 12 MP camera which is used for livestreaming of robot operations. Object detection
algorithms are run on the live video stream. The object detection method is built using a Faster RCNN
with VGGNet16 architecture of CNN. The entire operations of the robot are monitored through a web
control window. Therefore, the control portal provides a brief scenario of the environment to run,
control and steer the robot for more precise operation. A very impressive 88.25 percent accuracy
is acquired from this module in a rescue operation. Along with the ODM, the sensor system of the robot
provides information on the hazardous terrain. The feasibility of the 3 Survivor is tested and presented
by different experiments throughout the paper.
