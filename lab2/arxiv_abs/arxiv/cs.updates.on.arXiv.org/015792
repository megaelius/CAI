The spread of COVID-19 has sparked racism, hate, and xenophobia in social media targeted at Chinese
and broader Asian communities. However, little is known about how racial hate spreads during a pandemic
and the role of counterhate speech in mitigating the spread. Here we study the evolution and spread
of anti-Asian hate speech through the lens of Twitter. We create COVID-HATE, the largest dataset
of anti-Asian hate and counterhate spanning three months, containing over 30 million tweets, and
a social network with over 87 million nodes. By creating a novel hand-labeled dataset of 2,400 tweets,
we train a text classifier to identify hate and counterhate tweets that achieves an average AUROC
of 0.852. We identify 891,204 hate and 200,198 counterhate tweets in COVID-HATE. Using this data
to conduct longitudinal analysis, we find that while hateful users are less engaged in the COVID-19
discussions prior to their first anti-Asian tweet, they become more vocal and engaged afterwards
compared to counterhate users. We find that bots comprise 10.4% of hateful users and are more vocal
and hateful compared to non-bot users. Comparing bot accounts, we show that hateful bots are more
successful in attracting followers compared to counterhate bots. Analysis of the social network
reveals that hateful and counterhate users interact and engage extensively with one another, instead
of living in isolated polarized communities. Furthermore, we find that hate is contagious and nodes
are highly likely to become hateful after being exposed to hateful content. Importantly, our analysis
reveals that counterhate messages can discourage users from turning hateful in the first place.
Overall, this work presents a comprehensive overview of anti-Asian hate and counterhate content
during a pandemic. The COVID-HATE dataset is available at this http URL
