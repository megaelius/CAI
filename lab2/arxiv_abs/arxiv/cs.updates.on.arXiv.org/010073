We analyze convergence of distributed cooperative online estimation algorithms by a network of
multiple nodes via information exchanging in an uncertain environment. Each node has a linear observation
of an unknown parameter with randomly time-varying observation matrices. The underlying communication
network is modeled by a sequence of random digraphs and is subjected to nonuniform random time-varying
delays in channels. Each node runs an online estimation algorithm consisting of a consensus term
taking a weighted sum of its own estimate and delayed estimates of neighbors, and an innovation term
processing its own new measurement at each time step. By stochastic time-varying system, martingale
convergence theories and the binomial expansion of random matrix products, we transform the convergence
analysis of the algorithm into that of the mathematical expectation of random matrix products.
Firstly, for the delay-free case, we show that the algorithm gains can be designed properly such
that all nodes' estimates converge to the real parameter in mean square and almost surely if the observation
matrices and communication graphs satisfy the stochastic spatial-temporal persistence of excitation
condition. Especially, this condition holds for Markovian switching communication graphs and
observation matrices, if the stationary graph is balanced with a spanning tree and the measurement
model is spatially-temporally jointly observable. Secondly, for the case with time-delays, we
introduce delay matrices to model the random time-varying communication delays between nodes,
and propose a mean square convergence condition, which quantitatively shows the intensity of spatial-temporal
persistence of excitation to overcome time-delays.
