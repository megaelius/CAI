The decision problem version of estimating the Shannon entropy is the Entropy Difference problem
(ED): given descriptions of two circuits, determine which circuit produces more entropy in its
output when acting on a uniformly random input. The analogous problem with quantum circuits (QED)
is to determine which circuit produces the state with greater von Neumann entropy, when acting on
a fixed input state and after tracing out part of the output. Based on plausible complexity-theoretic
assumptions, both of these problems are believed to be intractable for polynomial-time quantum
computation. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of these problems in the case where the input
circuits have logarithmic and constant depth, respectively. We show that, relative to an oracle,
these problems cannot be as hard as their counterparts with polynomial-size circuits. Furthermore,
we show that if a certain type of reduction from QED to the log-depth version exists, it implies that
any polynomial-time quantum computation can be performed in log depth. While this suggests that
having shallow circuits makes entropy estimation easier, we give indication that the problem remains
intractable for polynomial-time quantum computation by proving a reduction from Learning-With-Errors
(LWE) to constant-depth ED. We then consider a potential application of our results to quantum gravity
research. First, we introduce a Hamiltonian version of QED where one is given two local Hamiltonians
and asked to estimate the entanglement entropy difference in their ground states. We show that this
problem is at least as hard as the circuit version and then discuss a potential experiment that would
make use of the AdS/CFT correspondence to solve LWE efficiently. We conjecture that unless the AdS/CFT
bulk to boundary map is exponentially complex, this experiment would violate the intractability
assumption of LWE.
