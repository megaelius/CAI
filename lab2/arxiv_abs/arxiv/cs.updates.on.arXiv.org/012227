Local graph clustering methods aim to find small clusters in very large graphs. These methods take
as input a graph and a seed node, and they return as output a good cluster in a running time that depends
on the size of the output cluster but that is independent of the size of the input graph. In this paper,
we adopt a statistical perspective on local graph clustering, and we analyze the performance of
the l1-regularized PageRank method~(Fountoulakis et. al.) for the recovery of a single target
cluster, given a seed node inside the cluster. Assuming the target cluster has been generated by
a random model, we present two results. In the first, we show that the optimal support of l1-regularized
PageRank recovers the full target cluster, with bounded false positives. In the second, we show
that if the seed node is connected solely to the target cluster then the optimal support of l1-regularized
PageRank recovers exactly the target cluster. We also show empirically that l1-regularized PageRank
has a state-of-the-art performance on many real graphs, demonstrating the superiority of the method.
From a computational perspective, we show that the solution path of l1-regularized PageRank is
monotonic. This allows for the application of the forward stagewise algorithm, which approximates
the solution path in running time that does not depend on the size of the whole graph. Finally, we show
that l1-regularized PageRank and approximate personalized PageRank (APPR), another very popular
method for local graph clustering, are equivalent in the sense that we can lower and upper bound the
output of one with the output of the other. Based on this relation, we establish for APPR similar results
to those we establish for l1-regularized PageRank.
