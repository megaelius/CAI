Hyperspectral imaging holds enormous potential to improve the state-of-the-art in aerial vehicle
tracking with low spatial and temporal resolutions. Recently, adaptive multi-modal hyperspectral
sensors have attracted growing interest due to their ability to record extended data quickly from
aerial platforms. In this study, we apply popular concepts from traditional object tracking, namely
(1) Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF) and (2) Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features
to aerial tracking in hyperspectral domain. We propose the Deep Hyperspectral Kernelized Correlation
Filter based tracker (DeepHKCF) to efficiently track aerial vehicles using an adaptive multi-modal
hyperspectral sensor. We address low temporal resolution by designing a single KCF-in-multiple
Regions-of-Interest (ROIs) approach to cover a reasonably large area. To increase the speed of
deep convolutional features extraction from multiple ROIs, we design an effective ROI mapping
strategy. The proposed tracker also provides flexibility to couple with the more advanced correlation
filter trackers. The DeepHKCF tracker performs exceptionally well with deep features set up in
a synthetic hyperspectral video generated by the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation
(DIRSIG) software. Additionally, we generate a large, synthetic, single-channel dataset using
DIRSIG to perform vehicle classification in the Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) platform. This
way, the high-fidelity of the DIRSIG software is proved and a large scale aerial vehicle classification
dataset is released to support studies on vehicle detection and tracking in the WAMI platform.
