Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation is the problem of determining the value of a given Boolean
function f on an unknown input x, when each bit of x_i of x can only be determined by paying an associated
cost c_i. The assumption is that x is drawn from a given product distribution, and the goal is to minimize
the expected cost. This problem has been studied in Operations Research, where it is known as "sequential
testing" of Boolean functions. It has also been studied in learning theory in the context of learning
with attribute costs. We consider the general problem of developing approximation algorithms
for Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation. We give a 3-approximation algorithm for evaluating
Boolean linear threshold formulas. We also present an approximation algorithm for evaluating
CDNF formulas (and decision trees) achieving a factor of O(log kd), where k is the number of terms
in the DNF formula, and d is the number of clauses in the CNF formula. In addition, we present approximation
algorithms for simultaneous evaluation of linear threshold functions, and for ranking of linear
functions. Our function evaluation algorithms are based on reductions to the Stochastic Submodular
Set Cover (SSSC) problem. This problem was introduced by Golovin and Krause. They presented an approximation
algorithm for the problem, called Adaptive Greedy. Our main technical contribution is a new approximation
algorithm for the SSSC problem, which we call Adaptive Dual Greedy. It is an extension of the Dual
Greedy algorithm for Submodular Set Cover due to Fujito, which is a generalization of Hochbaum's
algorithm for the classical Set Cover Problem. We also give a new bound on the approximation achieved
by the Adaptive Greedy algorithm of Golovin and Krause.
