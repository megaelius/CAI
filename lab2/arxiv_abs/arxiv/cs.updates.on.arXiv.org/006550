The K-user discrete memoryless (DM) broadcast channel (BC) with two nested multicast messages
is studied in which one common message is to be multicast to all receivers and the second private message
to a subset of receivers. The receivers that must decode both messages are referred to as private
receivers and the others that must decode only the common message as common receivers. For two nested
multicast messages, we establish the capacity region for several classes of DM BCs characterized
by the respective associated sets of pair-wise relationships between and among the common and private
receivers, each described by the well-known more capable or less noisy conditions. For three classes
of DM BCs, the capacity region is simply achieved by superposition coding and the proofs of the converses
rely on a recently found information inequality. The achievable rate region is then enhanced through
the addition of a splitting of the private message into as many parts as there are common receivers
and indirect decoding. A closed-form two-dimensional polyhedral description is obtained for
it for a given coding distribution. Through a converse result that relies on the well-known Csiszar
sum lemma and the information inequality, a specialization of this region that involves splitting
the private message into just two sub-messages is proved to be the capacity region for several classes
of DM BCs, beyond those for which superposition coding alone is capacity optimal, thereby underscoring
the benefit of rate-splitting. All previously known capacity results for DM BCs with two nested
multicast messages for the two and three-receiver DM BCs as well as DM BCs with one private or one common
receiver are included in the general framework presented in this work.
