While Microservices promise several beneficial characteristics for sustainable long-term software
evolution, little empirical research covers what concrete activities industry applies for the
evolvability assurance of Microservices and how technical debt is handled in such systems. Since
insights into the current state of practice are very important for researchers, we performed a qualitative
interview study to explore applied evolvability assurance processes, the usage of tools, metrics,
and patterns, as well as participants' reflections on the topic. In 17 semi-structured interviews,
we discussed 14 different Microservice-based systems with software professionals from 10 companies
and how the sustainable evolution of these systems was ensured. Interview transcripts were analyzed
with a detailed coding system and the constant comparison method. We found that especially systems
for external customers relied on central governance for the assurance. Participants saw guidelines
like architectural principles as important to ensure a base consistency for evolvability. Interviewees
also valued manual activities like code review or boy scouting, even though automation and tool
support was described as very important. Source code quality was the primary target for the usage
of tools and metrics. Despite most reported issues being related to Architectural Technical Debt
(ATD), our participants did not apply any architectural or service-oriented tools and metrics.
While participants generally saw their Microservices as evolvable, service cutting and finding
an appropriate service granularity with low coupling and high cohesion were reported as challenging.
Future Microservices research in the areas of evolution and technical debt should take these findings
and industry sentiments into account.
