This paper presents a new approach for relatively accurate brain region of interest (ROI) detection
from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) images of a human
head with abnormal brain anatomy. Such images produce problems for automatic brain segmentation
algorithms, and as a result, poor perfusion ROI detection affects both quantitative measurements
and visual assessment of perfusion data. In the proposed approach image segmentation is based on
CUSUM filter usage that was adapted to be applicable to process DSC perfusion MR images. The result
of segmentation is a binary mask of brain ROI that is generated via usage of brain boundary location.
Each point of the boundary between the brain and surrounding tissues is detected as a change-point
by CUSUM filter. Proposed adopted CUSUM filter operates by accumulating the deviations between
the observed and expected intensities of image points at the time of moving on a trajectory. Motion
trajectory is created by the iterative change of movement direction inside the background region
in order to reach brain region, and vice versa after boundary crossing. Proposed segmentation approach
was evaluated with Dice index comparing obtained results to the reference standard. Manually marked
brain region pixels (reference standard), as well as visual inspection of detected with CUSUM filter
usage brain ROI, were provided by experienced radiologists. The results showed that proposed approach
is suitable to be used for brain ROI detection from DSC perfusion MR images of a human head with abnormal
brain anatomy and can, therefore, be applied in the DSC perfusion data analysis.
