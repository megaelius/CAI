A linear or multi-linear valuation on a finite abstract simplicial complex can be expressed as an
analytic index dim(ker(D)) -dim(ker(D^*)) of a differential complex D:E -> F. In the discrete,
a complex D can be called elliptic if a McKean-Singer spectral symmetry applies as this implies str(exp(-t
D^2)) is t-independent. In that case, the analytic index of D is the sum of (-1)^k b_k(D), where b_k(D)
is the k'th Betti number, which by Hodge is the nullity of the (k+1)'th block of the Hodge operator
L=D^2. It can also be written as a topological index summing K(v) over the set of zero-dimensional
simplices in G and where K is an Euler type curvature defined by G and D. This can be interpreted as a
Atiyah-Singer type correspondence between analytic and topological index. Examples are the de
Rham differential complex for the Euler characteristic X(G) or the connection differential complex
for Wu characteristic w_k(G). Given an endomorphism T of an elliptic complex, the Lefschetz number
X(T,G,D) is defined as the super trace of T acting on cohomology defined by E. It is equal to the sum
i(v) over V which are contained in fixed simplices of T, and i is a Brouwer type index. This Atiyah-Bott
result generalizes the Brouwer-Lefschetz fixed point theorem for an endomorphism of the simplicial
complex G. In both the static and dynamic setting, the proof is done by heat deforming the Koopman
operator U(T) to get the cohomological picture str(exp(-t D^2) U(T)) in the limit t to infinity and
then use Hodge, and then by applying a discrete gradient flow to the simplex data defining the valuation
to push str(U(T)) to V, getting curvature K(v) or the Brouwer type index i(v).
