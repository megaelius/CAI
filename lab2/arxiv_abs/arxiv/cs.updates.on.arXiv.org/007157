Low-cost devices are now commonplace and can be found in diverse environments such as home electronics
or cars. As such devices are ubiquitous and portable, manufacturers strive to minimize their cost
and power consumption by eliminating many features that exist in other computing systems. Unfortunately,
this results in a lack of basic security features, even though their ubiquity and ease of physical
access make these devices particularly vulnerable to attacks. To address the lack of security mechanisms
in low-cost devices that make use of DRAM, we propose Dataplant, a new set of low-cost, high-performance,
and reliable security primitives that reside in and make use of commodity DRAM chips. The main idea
of Dataplant is to slightly modify the internal DRAM timing signals to expose the inherent process
variation found in all DRAM chips for generating unpredictable but reproducible values (e.g.,
keys, seeds, signatures) within DRAM, without affecting regular DRAM operation. We use Dataplant
to build two new security mechanisms: 1) a new Dataplant-based physical unclonable function (PUF)
with high throughput and high resiliency to temperature changes, and 2) a new cold boot attack prevention
mechanism based on Dataplant that automatically destroys all data within DRAM on every power cycle
with zero run-time energy and latency overheads. These mechanisms are very easy to integrate with
current DDR memory modules. Using a combination of detailed simulations and experiments with real
DRAM devices, we show that our Dataplant-based PUF has 10x higher throughput than state-of-the-art
DRAM PUFs while being much more resilient to temperature changes. We also demonstrate that our Dataplant-based
cold boot attack protection mechanism is 19.5x faster and consumes 2.54x less energy when compared
to existing mechanisms.
