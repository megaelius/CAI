Real time nature of social networks with bursty short messages and their respective large data scale
spread among vast variety of topics are research interest of many researchers. These properties
of social networks which are known as 5'Vs of big data has led to many unique and enlightenment algorithms
and techniques applied to large social networking datasets and data streams. Many of these researches
are based on detection and tracking of hot topics and trending social media events that help revealing
many unanswered questions. These algorithms and in some cases software products mostly rely on
the nature of the language itself. Although, other techniques such as unsupervised data mining
methods are language independent but many requirements for a comprehensive solution are not met.
Many research issues such as noisy sentences that adverse grammar and new online user invented words
are challenging maintenance of a good social network topic detection and tracking methodology;
The semantic relationship between words and in most cases, synonyms are also ignored by many of these
researches. In this research, we use Transformers combined with an incremental community detection
algorithm. Transformer in one hand, provides the semantic relation between words in different
contexts. On the other hand, the proposed graph mining technique enhances the resulting topics
with aid of simple structural rules. Named entity recognition from multimodal data, image and text,
labels the named entities with entity type and the extracted topics are tuned using them. All operations
of proposed system has been applied with big social data perspective under NoSQL technologies.
In order to present a working and systematic solution, we combined MongoDB with Neo4j as two major
database systems of our work. The proposed system shows higher precision and recall compared to
other methods in three different datasets.
