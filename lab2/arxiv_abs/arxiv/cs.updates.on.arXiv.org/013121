Individual tooth segmentation from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is an essential
prerequisite for an anatomical understanding of orthodontic structures in several applications,
such as tooth reformation planning and implant guide simulations. However, the presence of severe
metal artifacts in CBCT images hinders the accurate segmentation of each individual tooth. In this
study, we propose a neural network for pixel-wise labeling to exploit an instance segmentation
framework that is robust to metal artifacts. Our method comprises of three steps: 1) image cropping
and realignment by pose regressions, 2) metal-robust individual tooth detection, and 3) segmentation.
We first extract the alignment information of the patient by pose regression neural networks to
attain a volume-of-interest (VOI) region and realign the input image, which reduces the inter-overlapping
area between tooth bounding boxes. Then, individual tooth regions are localized within a VOI realigned
image using a convolutional detector. We improved the accuracy of the detector by employing non-maximum
suppression and multiclass classification metrics in the region proposal network. Finally, we
apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform individual tooth segmentation by converting
the pixel-wise labeling task to a distance regression task. Metal-intensive image augmentation
is also employed for a robust segmentation of metal artifacts. The result shows that our proposed
method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially for teeth with metal artifacts.
The primary significance of the proposed method is two-fold: 1) an introduction of pose-aware VOI
realignment followed by a robust tooth detection and 2) a metal-robust CNN framework for accurate
tooth segmentation.
