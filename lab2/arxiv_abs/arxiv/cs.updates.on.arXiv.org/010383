The use of monotonicity and Tarski's theorem in existence proofs of equilibria is very widespread
in economics, while Tarski's theorem is also often used for similar purposes in the context of verification.
However, there has been relatively little in the way of analysis of the complexity of finding the
fixed points and equilibria guaranteed by this result. We study a computational formalism based
on monotone functions on the $d$-dimensional grid with sides of length $N$, and their fixed points,
as well as the closely connected subject of supermodular games and their equilibria. It is known
that finding some (any) fixed point of a monotone function can be done in time $\log^d N$, and we show
it requires at least $\log^2 N$ function evaluations already on the 2-dimensional grid, even for
randomized algorithms. We show that the general Tarski problem of finding some fixed point, when
the monotone function is given succinctly (by a boolean circuit), is in the class PLS of problems
solvable by local search and, rather surprisingly, also in the class PPAD. Finding the greatest
or least fixed point guaranteed by Tarski's theorem, however, requires $d\cdot N$ steps, and is
NP-hard in the white box model. For supermodular games, we show that finding an equilibrium in such
games is essentially computationally equivalent to the Tarski problem, and finding the maximum
or minimum equilibrium is similarly harder. Interestingly, two-player supermodular games where
the strategy space of one player is one-dimensional can be solved in $O(\log N)$ steps. We also observe
that computing (approximating) the value of Condon's (Shapley's) stochastic games reduces to
the Tarski problem. An important open problem highlighted by this work is proving a $\Omega(\log^d
N)$ lower bound for small fixed dimension $d \geq 3$.
