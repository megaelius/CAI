In this big data era, more and more social activities are digitized thereby becoming traceable,
and thus the studies of social networks attract increasing attention from academia. It is widely
believed that social networks play important role in the process of information diffusion. However,
the opposite question, i.e., how does information diffusion process rebuild social networks,
has been largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a new framework for understanding this reversing
effect. Specifically, we first introduce a novel information diffusion model on social networks,
by considering two types of individuals, i.e., smart and normal individuals, and two kinds of messages,
true and false messages. Since social networks consist of human individuals, who have self-learning
ability, in such a way that the trust of an individual to one of its neighbors increases (or decreases)
if this individual received a true (or false) message from that neighbor. Based on such a simple self-learning
mechanism, we prove that a social network can indeed become smarter, in terms of better distinguishing
the true message from the false one. Moreover, we observe the emergence of social stratification
based on the new model, i.e., the true messages initially posted by an individual closer to the smart
one can be forwarded by more others, which is enhanced by the self-learning mechanism. We also find
the crossover advantage, i.e., interconnection between two chain networks can make the related
individuals possessing higher social influences, i.e., their messages can be forwarded by relatively
more others. We obtained these results theoretically and validated them by simulations, which
help better understand the reciprocity between social networks and information diffusion.
