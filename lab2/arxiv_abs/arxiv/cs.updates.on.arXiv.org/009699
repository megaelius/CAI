Facial MicroExpressions (MEs) are spontaneous, involuntary facial movements when a person experiences
an emotion but deliberately or unconsciously attempts to conceal his or her genuine emotions. Recently,
ME recognition has attracted increasing attention due to its potential applications such as clinical
diagnosis, business negotiation, interrogations and security. However, it is expensive to build
large scale ME datasets, mainly due to the difficulty of naturally inducing spontaneous MEs. This
limits the application of deep learning techniques which require lots of training data. In this
paper, we propose a simple, efficient yet robust descriptor called Extended Local Binary Patterns
on Three Orthogonal Planes (ELBPTOP) for ME recognition. ELBPTOP consists of three complementary
binary descriptors: LBPTOP and two novel ones Radial Difference LBPTOP (RDLBPTOP) and Angular
Difference LBPTOP (ADLBPTOP), which explore the local second order information along radial and
angular directions contained in ME video sequences. ELBPTOP is a novel ME descriptor inspired by
the unique and subtle facial movements. It is computationally efficient and only marginally increases
the cost of computing LBPTOP, yet is extremely effective for ME recognition. In addition, by firstly
introducing Whitened Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) to ME recognition, we can further obtain
more compact and discriminative feature representations, and achieve significantly computational
savings. Extensive experimental evaluation on three popular spontaneous ME datasets SMIC, CASMEII
and SAMM show that our proposed ELBPTOP approach significantly outperforms previous state of the
art on all three evaluated datasets. Our proposed ELBPTOP achieves 73.94% on CASMEII, which is 6.6%
higher than state of the art on this dataset. More impressively, ELBPTOP increases recognition
accuracy from 44.7% to 63.44% on the SAMM dataset.
