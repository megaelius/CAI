The Coalitional Manipulation problem has been studied extensively in the literature for many voting
rules. However, most studies have focused on the complete information setting, wherein the manipulators
know the votes of the non-manipulators. While this assumption is reasonable for purposes of showing
intractability, it is unrealistic for algorithmic considerations. In most real-world scenarios,
it is impractical for the manipulators to have accurate knowledge of all the other votes. In this
paper, we investigate manipulation with incomplete information. In our framework, the manipulators
know a partial order for each voter that is consistent with the true preference of that voter. In this
setting, we formulate three natural computational notions of manipulation, namely weak, opportunistic,
and strong manipulation. We say that an extension of a partial order is if there exists a manipulative
vote for that extension. 1. Weak Manipulation (WM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that makes
their preferred candidate win in at least one extension of the partial votes of the non-manipulators.
2. Opportunistic Manipulation (OM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that makes their preferred
candidate win in every viable extension of the partial votes of the non-manipulators. 3. Strong
Manipulation (SM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that makes their preferred candidate win
in every extension of the partial votes of the non-manipulators. We consider several scenarios
for which the traditional manipulation problems are easy (for instance, Borda with a single manipulator).
For many of them, the corresponding manipulative questions that we propose turn out to be computationally
intractable. Our hardness results often hold even when very little information is missing, or in
other words, even when the instances are quite close to the complete information setting.
