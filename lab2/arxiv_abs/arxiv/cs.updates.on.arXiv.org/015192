Cognitive radio technology offers an important function in the efficient utilization of the radio
spectrum. Besides, it is expected that CR-enabled vehicular ad-hoc networks (CR-VANETs) enrich
the communication performance of the existing vehicular networks (VANETs). However, to ensure
efficient performance in a multi-hop communication, the routing protocol in CR-VANETs needs to
consider the autonomous mobility of the vehicles as well as the stochastic availability of the channels.
Hence, this paper introduces a spectrum-aware mobility pattern based reactive routing protocol
for CR-VANET. The proposed protocol accommodates the dynamic behavior and selects a stable transmission
path from a source node to the destination. Therefore, the proposed protocol is outlined as a weighted
graph problem where the weight for an edge is measured based on a parameter termed as NHDF (Next-hop
Determination Factor). The NHDF implicitly considers mobility patterns of the nodes and channel
availability to select the optimum path for communication. Therefore, in the proposed routing
protocol, the mobility pattern of a node is defined from the viewpoint of distance, speed, direction,
and node's reliability. Furthermore, the spectrum awareness in the proposed protocol is measured
over the number of shared common channels and the channel quality. It is anticipated that the proposed
protocol shows efficient routing performance by selecting stable and secured paths from source
to destination. Simulation is carried out to assess the performance of the protocol where it is witnessed
that the proposed routing protocol outperforms existing ones.
