We study a game theoretic model where a coalition of processors might collude to bias the outcome
of the protocol, where we assume that the processors always prefer any legitimate outcome over a
non-legitimate one. We show that the problems of Fair Leader Election and Fair Coin Toss are equivalent,
and focus on Fair Leader Election. Our main focus is on a directed asynchronous ring of $n$ processors,
where we investigate the protocol proposed by Abraham et al. \cite{abraham2013distributed} and
studied in Afek et al. \cite{afek2014distributed}. We show that in general the protocol is resilient
only to sub-linear size coalitions. Specifically, we show that $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ randomly
located processors or $\Omega(\sqrt[3]{n})$ adversarially located processors can force any
outcome. We complement this by showing that the protocol is resilient to any adversarial coalition
of size $O(\sqrt[4]{n})$. We propose a modification to the protocol, and show that it is resilient
to every coalition of size $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, by exhibiting both an attack and a resilience result.
For every $k \geq 1$, we define a family of graphs ${\mathcal{G}}_{k}$ that can be simulated by trees
where each node in the tree simulates at most $k$ processors. We show that for every graph in ${\mathcal{G}}_{k}$,
there is no fair leader election protocol that is resilient to coalitions of size $k$. Our result
generalizes a previous result of Abraham et al. \cite{abraham2013distributed} that states that
for every graph, there is no fair leader election protocol which is resilient to coalitions of size
$\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$.
