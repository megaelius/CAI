Legged robots require knowledge of pose and velocity in order to maintain stability and execute
walking paths. Current solutions either rely on vision data, which is susceptible to environmental
and lighting conditions, or fusion of kinematic and contact data with measurements from an inertial
measurement unit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter
(InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups and invariant observer design. This filter combines contact-inertial
dynamics with forward kinematic corrections to estimate pose and velocity along with all current
contact points. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation
with several important consequences: (a) the observable state variables can be rendered convergent
with a domain of attraction that is independent of the system's trajectory; (b) unlike the standard
EKF, neither the linearized error dynamics nor the linearized observation model depend on the current
state estimate, which (c) leads to improved convergence properties and (d) a local observability
matrix that is consistent with the underlying nonlinear system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
to include IMU biases, add/remove contacts, and formulate both world-centric and robo-centric
versions. We compare the convergence of the proposed InEKF with the commonly used quaternion-based
EKF though both simulations and experiments on a Cassie-series bipedal robot. Filter accuracy
is analyzed using motion capture, while a LiDAR mapping experiment provides a practical use case.
Overall, the developed contact-aided InEKF provides better performance in comparison with the
quaternion-based EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in system.
