Nanoscale semiconductor technology has been a key enabler of the computing revolution. It has done
so via advances in new materials and manufacturing processes that resulted in the size of the basic
building block of computing systems - the logic switch and memory devices - being reduced into the
nanoscale regime. Nanotechnology has provided increased computing functionality per unit volume,
energy, and cost. In order for computing systems to continue to deliver substantial benefits for
the foreseeable future to society at large, it is critical that the very notion of computing be examined
in the light of nanoscale realities. In particular, one needs to ask what it means to compute when
the very building block - the logic switch - no longer exhibits the level of determinism required
by the von Neumann architecture. There needs to be a sustained and heavy investment in a nation-wide
Vertically Integrated Semiconductor Ecosystem (VISE). VISE is a program in which research and
development is conducted seamlessly across the entire compute stack - from applications, systems
and algorithms, architectures, circuits and nanodevices, and materials. A nation-wide VISE provides
clear strategic advantages in ensuring the US's global superiority in semiconductors. First,
a VISE provides the highest quality seed-corn for nurturing transformative ideas that are critically
needed today in order for nanotechnology-inspired computing to flourish. It does so by dramatically
opening up new areas of semiconductor research that are inspired and driven by new application needs.
Second, a VISE creates a very high barrier to entry from foreign competitors because it is extremely
hard to establish, and even harder to duplicate.
