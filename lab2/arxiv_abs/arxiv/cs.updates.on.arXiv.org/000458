The syntactic complexity of a regular language is the size of its syntactic semigroup. This semigroup
is isomorphic to the transition semigroup of the minimal deterministic finite automaton accepting
the language, that is, to the semigroup generated by transformations induced by non-empty words
on the set of states of the automaton. In this paper we search for the largest syntactic semigroup
of a star-free language having $n$ left quotients; equivalently, we look for the largest transition
semigroup of an aperiodic finite automaton with $n$ states. We introduce two new aperiodic transition
semigroups. The first is generated by transformations that change only one state; we call such transformations
and resulting semigroups unitary. In particular, we study complete unitary semigroups which have
a special structure, and we show that each maximal unitary semigroup is complete. For $n \ge 4$ there
exists a complete unitary semigroup that is larger than any aperiodic semigroup known to date. We
then present even larger aperiodic semigroups, generated by transformations that map a non-empty
subset of states to a single state; we call such transformations and semigroups semiconstant. In
particular, we examine semiconstant tree semigroups which have a structure based on full binary
trees. The semiconstant tree semigroups are at present the best candidates for largest aperiodic
semigroups. We also prove that $2^n-1$ is an upper bound on the state complexity of reversal of star-free
languages, and resolve an open problem about a special case of state complexity of concatenation
of star-free languages.
