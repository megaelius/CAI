The commercialization of transistors capable of both switching and amplification in 1960 resulted
in the development of second-generation computers, which resulted in the miniaturization and
lightening, while accelerating the reduction and development of production costs. However, the
self-resistance and the resistance used in conjunction with semiconductors, which are the basic
principles of computers, generate a lot of heat, which results in semiconductor obsolescence,
and limits the computation speed (Clock rate). In implementing logic operation, this paper proposes
the concept of Structure-based Computer which can implement NOT gate made of semiconductor transistor
only by Structure-based twist of cable without resistance. In Structure-based computer, the theory
of 'inverse signal pair' of digital signals was introduced so that it could operate in a different
way than semiconductor-based transistors. In this paper, we propose a new hardware called Structure-based
computer that can solve various problems in semiconductor computers only with the wiring structure
of the conductor itself, not with the silicon-based semiconductor. A USB-type Structure-based
computer prototype has been built, and a logical cloning method using CPU Clock is proposed to avoid
the risk of current being reversed by cloning logical values. Furthermore, we propose a deep-priority
exploration-based simulation method that can easily implement and test complex Structure-based
computer circuits. Furthermore, this paper suggests a mechanism to implement optical computers
currently under development and research based on structures rather than devices.
