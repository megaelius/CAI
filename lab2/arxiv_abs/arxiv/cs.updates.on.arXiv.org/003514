Random geometric graphs are the simplest, and perhaps the earliest possible random graph model
of spatial networks, introduced by Gilbert in 1961. In the most basic setting, a random geometric
graph $G(n,r)$ has $n$ vertices. Each vertex of the graph is assigned a real number in $[0,1]$ randomly
and uniformly. There is an edge between two vertices if the corresponding two random numbers differ
by at most $r$ (to mitigate the boundary effect, let us consider the Lee distance here, $d_L(u,v)
= \min\{|u-v|, 1-|u-v|\}$). It is well-known that the connectivity threshold regime for random
geometric graphs is at $r \approx \frac{\log n}{n}$. In particular, if $r = \frac{a\log n}{n}$,
then a random geometric graph is connected with high probability if and only if $a > 1$. Consider $G(n,\frac{(1+\epsilon)\log{n}}{n})$
for any $\epsilon >0$ to satisfy the connectivity requirement and delete half of its edges which
have distance at most $\frac{\log{n}}{2n}$. It is natural to believe that the resultant graph will
be disconnected. Surprisingly, we show that the graph still remains connected! Formally, generalizing
random geometric graphs, we define a random annulus graph $G(n, [r_1, r_2]), r_1 <r_2$ with $n$ vertices.
Each vertex of the graph is assigned a real number in $[0,1]$ randomly and uniformly as before. There
is an edge between two vertices if the Lee distance between the corresponding two random numbers
is between $r_1$ and $r_2$, $0<r_1<r_2$. Let us assume $r_1 = \frac{b \log n}{n},$ and $r_2 = \frac{a
\log n}{n}, 0 <b <a$. We show that this graph is connected with high probability if and only if $a -b
> \frac12$ and $a >1$. That is $G(n, [0,\frac{0.99\log n}{n}])$ is not connected but $G(n,[\frac{0.50
\log n}{n},\frac{1+\epsilon \log n}{n}])$ is. This result is then used to give improved lower and
upper bounds on the recovery threshold of the geometric block model.
