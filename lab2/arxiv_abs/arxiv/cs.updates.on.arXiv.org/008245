Most of the existing recognition algorithms are proposed for closed set scenarios, where all categories
are known beforehand. However, in practice, recognition is essentially an open set problem. There
are categories we know called "knowns", and there are more we do not know called "unknowns". Enumerating
all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently it is infeasible to prepare sufficient
training samples for those unknowns. Applying closed set recognition methods will naturally lead
to unseen-category errors. To address this problem, we propose the prototype based Open Deep Network
(P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype learning into open
set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to guide a CNN network to
derive more discriminative features. Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class
triplet thresholding method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual
labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new categories. Predictors
for new categories are added to the classification layer to "open" the deep neural networks to incorporate
new categories dynamically. The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying
a distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this initialization
method speed up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples needed to train new predictors. Extensive
experiments show that P-ODN can effectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human
intervention to recognize a new category. In the real world scenarios, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the UCF11, UCF50, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.
