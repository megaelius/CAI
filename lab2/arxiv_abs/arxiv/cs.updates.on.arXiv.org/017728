Application-specific optical processors have been considered disruptive technologies for modern
computing that can fundamentally accelerate the development of artificial intelligence (AI)
by offering substantially improved computing performance. Recent advancements in optical neural
network architectures for neural information processing have been applied to perform various
machine learning tasks. However, the existing architectures have limited complexity and performance;
and each of them requires its own dedicated design that cannot be reconfigured to switch between
different neural network models for different applications after deployment. Here, we propose
an optoelectronic reconfigurable computing paradigm by constructing a diffractive processing
unit (DPU) that can efficiently support different neural networks and achieve a high model complexity
with millions of neurons. It allocates almost all of its computational operations optically and
achieves extremely high speed of data modulation and large-scale network parameter updating by
dynamically programming optical modulators and photodetectors. We demonstrated the reconfiguration
of the DPU to implement various diffractive feedforward and recurrent neural networks and developed
a novel adaptive training approach to circumvent the system imperfections. We applied the trained
networks for high-speed classifying of handwritten digit images and human action videos over benchmark
datasets, and the experimental results revealed a comparable classification accuracy to the electronic
computing approaches. Furthermore, our prototype system built with off-the-shelf optoelectronic
components surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs) by
several times on computing speed and more than an order of magnitude on system energy efficiency.
