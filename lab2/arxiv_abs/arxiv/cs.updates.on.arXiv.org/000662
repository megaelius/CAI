Sensation-seeking, risk-taking behaviour, pathological gambling, and (perception of) control
over event outcomes positively correlate with each other. Explanations for this co-occurrence
include impulsiveness of the individual, perceived self-efficacy, and optimistic risk perception.
Optimistic risk perception results from event outcome probability bias characterized by higher
regard for positive outcome probabilities compared to negative ones. However, the mechanistic
details of this relation, in particular in the context of task-adaptive behaviour, remain unknown.
Here we show that intensity of sensations, risk-taking, pathological gambling, and lower levels
of fear co-occur when optimistic risk perception underlies the temporal difference (TD) signal
used in learning to adapt to a risky task. We found in agent-based, in computo trials that optimistic
calculation of the TD signal, compared to different forms of realistic calculation, results in
risk taking and in persistent gambling behaviour. We also found that an optimistic TD signal results
in less fear and more intense joy. We found these results to be consistent for a variety of risky tasks.
Our work computationally replicates the finding that effects of perception of control on risk-taking
are mediated by optimistic risk perceptions and replicates the positive correlation between sensation
intensity and pathological gambling. Our work underlines the importance of the relation between
the prefrontal cortex (as a locus of control and outcome value representation), the amygdala (as
a locus of gated value recalculation and fear processing), and the ventral striatum (as a locus of
error signal processing and hedonic euphoria) and gives further evidence for Reinforcement Learning
being a computational model for reward processing, emotion and task-adaptive behaviour.
