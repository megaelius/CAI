The exploitation of already deployed wireless local area networks (WLAN)s (e.g., WiFi access points
(AP)s) has attracted considerable attention, as an efficient and practical method to improve the
performance of beyond 4G wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a novel communication paradigm
to satisfy the performance demands of future wireless networks: a hybrid Cellular/WLAN network
architecture with wireless offloading. In contrast to the commonly adopted practice of WiFi offloading,
where the WLAN APs have a wired backhaul (e.g., Digital Subscriber Line), we propose a wireless offloading
approach, where the WLAN APs will share their wireless cellular broadband connection with other
users. These users will select their serving node, i.e., the macro-cell eNodeB or a WLAN AP, based
on a certain selection criterion. Thus a challenging research field is originated, where interfering
effects and wireless resources limitations play a dominant role. Important performance metrics
of the proposed hybrid scheme, including the bit error probability, the ergodic capacity and the
average signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio, are theoretically studied and closed form
expressions are derived for the single-user case with multiple interferers, for both identical
and non-identical fading conditions. Also, based on the general multi-cellular hybrid WLAN-Cellular
concept, we first propose a intercell interference minimization approach. Then we present a novel
scheme for achieving frequency reuse equal to one within a single macro-cell, under specific performance
criteria and constraints, that guarantee the overall cell or the individual user QoS requirements.
