We study the problem of metrical service systems with multiple servers (MSSMS), which generalizes
two well-known problems -- the $k$-server problem, and metrical service systems. The MSSMS problem
is to service requests, each of which is an $l$-point subset of a metric space, using $k$ servers,
with the objective of minimizing the total distance traveled by the servers. Feuerstein initiated
a study of this problem by proving upper and lower bounds on the deterministic competitive ratio
for uniform metric spaces. We improve Feuerstein's analysis of the upper bound and prove that his
algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $k({{k+l}\choose{l}}-1)$. In the randomized online
setting, for uniform metric spaces, we give an algorithm which achieves a competitive ratio $\mathcal{O}(k^3\log
l)$, beating the deterministic lower bound of ${{k+l}\choose{l}}-1$. We prove that any randomized
algorithm for MSSMS on uniform metric spaces must be $\Omega(\log kl)$-competitive. We then prove
an improved lower bound of ${{k+2l-1}\choose{k}}-{{k+l-1}\choose{k}}$ on the competitive ratio
of any deterministic algorithm for $(k,l)$-MSSMS, on general metric spaces. In the offline setting,
we give a pseudo-approximation algorithm for $(k,l)$-MSSMS on general metric spaces, which achieves
an approximation ratio of $l$ using $kl$ servers. We also prove a matching hardness result, that
a pseudo-approximation with less than $kl$ servers is unlikely, even for uniform metric spaces.
For general metric spaces, we highlight the limitations of a few popular techniques, that have been
used in algorithm design for the $k$-server problem and metrical service systems.
