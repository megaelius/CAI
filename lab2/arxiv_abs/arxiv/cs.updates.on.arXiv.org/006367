Objective: Ultrasound elastography is gaining traction as an accessible and useful diagnostic
tool for such things as cancer detection and differentiation and thyroid disease diagnostics.
Unfortunately, state of the art shear wave imaging techniques, essential to promote this goal,
are limited to high end ultrasound hardware due to high power requirements; are extremely sensitive
to patient and sonographer motion; and generally suffer from low frame rates. Motivated by research
and theory showing that pressure wave velocity carries similar diagnostic abilities to shear wave
imaging, we present an alternative approach using single sided pressure-wave velocity measurements
from a conventional ultrasound probe, enabling elasticity based diagnostics using portable and
low cost devices. Methods: In this paper, we present a single sided sound speed inversion solution
using a fully convolutional deep neural network. We use simulations for training, allowing the
generation of large volumes of ground truth data. Results: We show that it is possible to invert for
longitudinal sound speed in soft tissue at super real time frame rates. Our method shows exceptional
results on simulated data, and highly encouraging initial results on real data. Conclusion: Sound
speed inversion on channel data has significant potential, made possible in real time with deep
learning technologies. Significance: High end ultrasound devices remain inaccessible in many
locations. Utilizing pressure sound speed and deep learning technologies, brings the same quality
diagnostic abilities to low power devices at real time frame rates. Potential frame rates also enable
dynamic functional imaging, impossible with shear wave imaging.
