Human-Computer Interaction with the traditional User Interface is done using a specified in advance
script dialog menu, mainly based on human intellect and unproductive use of navigation. This approach
does not lead to making qualitative decision in control systems, where the situations and processes
cannot be structured in advance. Any dynamic changes in the controlled business process (as example,
in organizational unit of the information fuzzy control system) make it necessary to modify the
script dialogue in User Interface. This circumstance leads to a redesign of the components of the
User Interface and of the entire control system. In the Intelligent User Interface, where the dialog
situations are unknown in advance, fuzzy structured and artificial intelligence is crucial, the
redesign described above is impossible. To solve this and other problems, we propose the data, information
and knowledge based technology of Smart/ Intelligent User Interface (IUI) design, which interacts
with users and systems in natural and other languages, utilizing the principles of Situational
Control and Fuzzy Logic theories, Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics, Knowledge Base technologies
and others. The proposed technology of IUI design is defined by multi-agents of Situational Control
and of data, information and knowledge, modelling of Fuzzy Logic Inference, Generalization, Representation
and Explanation of knowledge, Planning and Decision-making, Dialog Control, Reasoning and Systems
Thinking, Fuzzy Control of organizational unit in real-time, fuzzy conditions, heterogeneous
domains, and multi-lingual communication under uncertainty and in Fuzzy Environment.
