Deep neural networks (DNN) can be easily fooled by adding human imperceptible perturbations to
the images. These perturbed images are known as the `adversarial examples' that pose a serious threat
to security and safety critical systems. A litmus test for the strength of adversarial examples
is their transferability across different DNN models in a black box setting (i.i. when target model's
architecture and parameters are not known to attacker). Current attack algorithms that seek to
enhance adversarial transferability work on the decision level i.e. generate perturbations that
alter the network decisions. This leads to two key limitations: (a) An attack is dependent on the
task-specific loss function (e.g. softmax cross-entropy for object recognition) and therefore
does not generalize beyond its original task. (b) The adversarial examples are specific to the network
architecture and demonstrate poor transferability to other network architectures. We propose
a novel approach to create adversarial examples that can broadly fool different networks on multiple
tasks. Our approach is based on the following intuition: "Deep features are highly generalizable
and show excellent performance across different tasks, therefore an ideal attack must create maximum
distortions in the feature space to realize highly transferable examples". Specifically, for
an input image, we calculate perturbations that push its feature representations furthest away
from the original image features. We report extensive experiments to show how adversarial examples
generalize across multiple networks across classification, object detection and segmentation
tasks.
