We consider the black-box reduction from multi-dimensional revenue maximization to virtual welfare
maximization. Cai et al. show a polynomial-time approximation-preserving reduction, however,
the mechanism produced by their reduction is only approximately Bayesian incentive compatible
($\varepsilon$-BIC). We provide a new polynomial time transformation that converts any $\varepsilon$-BIC
mechanism to an exactly BIC mechanism with only a negligible revenue loss. Our transformation applies
to a very general mechanism design setting and only requires sample access to the agents' type distributions
and query access to the original $\varepsilon$-BIC mechanism. Other $\varepsilon$-BIC to BIC
transformations for revenue exist in the literature but all require exponential time to run in the
general setting we consider. As an application of our transformation, we improve the reduction
by Cai et al. to generate an exactly BIC mechanism. Our transformation builds on a novel idea developed
in a recent paper by Dughmi et al.: finding the maximum entropy regularized perfect matching using
Bernoulli factories. We show that their approach is insufficient to obtain an $\varepsilon$-BIC
to BIC transformation that preserves the revenue. The main barrier is that, unlike preserving welfare,
preserving the revenue requires (i) finding a distribution of matchings whose expected weight
is close to maximum weight matching, in a graph with both positive and negative edge weights, and
(ii) no left hand side node in the matching is attached to a negative edge with high probability. The
algorithm by Dughmi et al. violates property (ii) and thus cannot preserve the revenue. The main
technical contribution of this paper is to provide a generalization of their algorithm that satisfies
both properties.
