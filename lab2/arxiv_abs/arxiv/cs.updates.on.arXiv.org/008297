Transportation data analysis is becoming a major area of computing application. Operation and
management of transportation system have been transforming with the advancements in computing
technology. This study presents such an advancement in transportation data analysis with a novel
computing framework. This study presents the Labelled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (L-LDA)-incorporated
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with the supporting computing strategy for using publicly
available Twitter data, which is 1% of the total twitter data, in determining transportation related
events (i.e., incidents, congestions, special events, construction and other events) to provide
reliable information to travelers. The analytical approach includes analyzing tweets using text
classification and geocoding locations based on string similarity. A case study conducted for
the New York City and its surrounding areas demonstrates the feasibility of the analytical approach.
In total, almost 700,010 tweets are analyzed to extract relevant transportation related information
for one week. For a large geographic area like New York City and its surrounding areas, using parallel
computation, 30 times speedup is achieved compared to the sequential processing in analyzing transportation
related tweets. The SVM classifier achieves more than 85% accuracy in identifying transportation-related
tweets from structured data. To further categorize the transportation related tweets into sub-classes:
incident, congestion, construction, special events, and other events, three supervised classifiers
are used: L-LDA, SVM, and L-LDA incorporated SVM. The analytical framework, which uses the L-LDA
incorporated SVM, can classify roadway transportation related data from Twitter with over 98.3%
accuracy, which is significantly higher than the accuracies achieved by standalone L-LDA and SVM.
