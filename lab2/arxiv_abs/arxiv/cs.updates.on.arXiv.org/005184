A society of agents, with ideological positions, or "opinions" measured by real values ranging
from $-\infty$ (the "far left") to $+\infty$ (the "far right"), is considered. At fixed (unit) time
intervals agents repeatedly reconsider and change their opinions if and only if they find themselves
at the extremes of the range of ideological positions held by members of the society. Extremist agents
are erratic: they become either more radical, and move away from the positions of other agents, with
probability $\varepsilon$, or more moderate, and move towards the positions held by peers, with
probability $(1 - \varepsilon)$. The change in the opinion of the extremists is one unit on the real
line. We prove that the agent positions cluster in time, with all non-extremist agents located within
a unit interval. However, the consensus opinion is dynamic. Due to the extremists' erratic behavior
the clustered opinion set performs a "sluggish" random walk on the entire range of possible ideological
positions (the real line). The inertia of the group, the reluctance of the society's agents to change
their consensus opinion, increases with the size of the group. The extremists perform biased random
walk excursions to the right and left and, in time, their actions succeed to move the society of agents
in random directions. The "far left" agent effectively pushes the group consensus toward the right,
while the "far right" agent counter-balances the push and causes the consensus to move toward the
left. We believe that this model, and some of its variations, has the potential to explain the real
world swings in societal ideologies that we see around us.
