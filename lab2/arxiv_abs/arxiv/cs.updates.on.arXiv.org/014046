With the merit of containing full panoramic content in one camera, Virtual Reality (VR) and 360-degree
videos have attracted more and more attention in the field of industrial cloud manufacturing and
training. Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), where many VR terminals needed to be online at the
same time, can hardly guarantee VR's bandwidth requirement. However, by making use of users' quality
of experience (QoE) awareness factors, including the relative moving speed and depth difference
between the viewpoint and other content, bandwidth consumption can be reduced. In this paper, we
propose OFB-VR (Optical Flow Based VR), an interactive method of VR streaming that can make use of
VR users' QoE awareness to ease the bandwidth pressure. The Just-Noticeable Difference through
Optical Flow Estimation (JND-OFE) is explored to quantify users' awareness of quality distortion
in 360-degree videos. Accordingly, a novel 360-degree videos QoE metric based on PSNR and JND-OFE
(PSNR-OF) is proposed. With the help of PSNR-OF, OFB-VR proposes a versatile-size tiling scheme
to lessen the tiling overhead. A Reinforcement Learning(RL) method is implemented to make use of
historical data to perform Adaptive BitRate(ABR). For evaluation, we take two prior VR streaming
schemes, Pano and Plato, as baselines. Vast evaluations show that our system can increase the mean
PSNR-OF score by 9.5-15.8% while maintaining the same rebuffer ratio compared with Pano and Plato
in a fluctuate LTE bandwidth dataset. Evaluation results show that OFB-VR is a promising prototype
for actual interactive industrial VR. A prototype of OFB-VR can be found in https://github.com/buptexplorers/OFB-VR.
