The increasing popularity of JavaScript has led to a variety of JavaScript frameworks that aim to
help developers to address programming tasks. However, the number of JavaScript frameworks has
risen rapidly to thousands of versions. It is challenging for practitioners to identify the frameworks
that best fit their needs and to develop new ones which fit such needs. Furthermore, there is a lack
of knowledge regarding what drives developers towards the choice. This paper explores the factors
and actors that lead to the choice of a JavaScript framework. We conducted a qualitative interpretive
study of semi-structured interviews. We interviewed 18 decision makers regarding the JavaScript
framework selection, up to reaching theoretical saturation. Through coding the interview responses,
we offer a model of desirable JavaScript framework adoption factors. The factors are grouped into
categories that are derived via the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. The factors
are performance expectancy (performance, size), effort expectancy (automatization, learnability,
flexibility, complexity, understandability), social influence (competitor analysis, collegial
advice, community size, community responsiveness), facilitating conditions (suitability,
updates, modularity, isolation, extensibility), and price value. A combination of four decision
makers, which are customer, developer, team, and team leader, leads to the choice. Our model contributes
to the body of knowledge related to the adoption of technology by software engineers. As a practical
implication, our model is useful for decision makers when evaluating JavaScript frameworks, as
well as for developers for producing desirable frameworks.
