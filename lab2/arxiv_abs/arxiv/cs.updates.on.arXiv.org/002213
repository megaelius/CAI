Embedded systems play a crucial role in fueling the growth of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) in application
domains such as healthcare, home automation, transportation, etc. However, their increasingly
network-connected nature, coupled with their ability to access potentially sensitive/confidential
information, has given rise to many security and privacy concerns. An additional challenge is the
growing number of counterfeit components in these devices, resulting in serious reliability and
financial implications. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a promising security primitive
to help address these concerns. Memory-based PUFs are particularly attractive as they require
minimal or no additional hardware for their operation. However, current memory-based PUFs utilize
only a single memory technology for constructing the PUF, which has several disadvantages including
making them vulnerable to security attacks. In this paper, we propose the design of a new memory-based
combination PUF that intelligently combines two memory technologies, SRAM and DRAM, to overcome
these shortcomings. The proposed combination PUF exhibits high entropy, supports a large number
of challenge-response pairs, and is intrinsically reconfigurable. We have implemented the proposed
combination PUF using a Terasic TR4-230 FPGA board and several off-the-shelf SRAMs and DRAMs. Experimental
results demonstrate substantial improvements over current memory-based PUFs including the ability
to resist various attacks. Extensive authentication tests across a wide temperature range (20
- 60 deg. Celsius) and accelerated aging (12 months) demonstrate the robustness of the proposed
design, which achieves a 100% true-positive rate and 0% false-positive rate for authentication
across these parameter ranges.
