Distributed graph algorithms that separately optimize for either the number of rounds used or the
total number of messages sent have been studied extensively. However, algorithms simultaneously
efficient with respect to both measures have been elusive for a long time. For example, only very
recently was it shown that for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), an optimal message and round complexity
is achievable (up to polylog terms) by a single algorithm in the CONGEST model of communication.
In this paper we provide algorithms that are simultaneously round-optimal with near-linear message
complexities for a number of well-studied distributed optimization problems. Our algorithmic
centerpiece is such a distributed algorithm that solves what we dub Part-Wise Aggregation: computing
simple functions over each part of a graph partition. From this algorithm we derive round-optimal
algorithms for MST, Approximate Min-Cut and Approximate Single Source Shortest Paths (SSSP),
all with $\tilde{O}(m)$ message complexities. On general graphs all of our algorithms achieve
a worst-case optimal $\tilde{O}(D+\sqrt n)$ round complexities and $\tilde{O}(m)$ message complexities.
Furthermore, our algorithms require even fewer rounds on many widely-studied classes of graphs,
namely planar, genus-bounded, treewidth-bounded and pathwidth-bounded graphs. For these graphs
our algorithms require an optimal $\tilde{O}(D)$ rounds and $\tilde{O}(m)$ messages. Our results
are the first instance of distributed algorithms with $\tilde{O}(m)$ message complexities for
Approximate Min-Cut and Approximate SSSP. Moreover, our algorithms are the first algorithms for
any of these problems that beat the general graph round lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(D + \sqrt{n})$
on graph families of interest and simultaneously achieve an $\tilde{O}(m)$ message complexity.
