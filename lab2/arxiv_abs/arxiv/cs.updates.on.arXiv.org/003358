Vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques are among the most common approaches
for structural damage identification. The presence of damage in structures may be identified by
monitoring the changes in dynamic behavior subject to external loading, and is typically performed
by using experimental modal analysis (EMA) or operational modal analysis (OMA). These tools for
SHM normally require a limited number of physically attached transducers (e.g. accelerometers)
in order to record the response of the structure for further analysis. Signal conditioners, wires,
wireless receivers and a data acquisition system (DAQ) are also typical components of traditional
sensing systems used in vibration-based SHM. However, instrumentation of lightweight structures
with contact sensors such as accelerometers may induce mass-loading effects, and for large-scale
structures, the instrumentation is labor intensive and time consuming. Achieving high spatial
measurement resolution for a large-scale structure is not always feasible while working with traditional
contact sensors, and there is also the potential for a lack of reliability associated with fixed
contact sensors in outliving the life-span of the host structure. Among the state-of-the-art non-contact
measurements, digital video cameras are able to rapidly collect high-density spatial information
from structures remotely. In this paper, the subtle motions from recorded video (i.e. a sequence
of images) are extracted by means of Phase-based Motion Estimation (PME) and the extracted information
is used to conduct damage identification on a 2.3-meter long Skystream wind turbine blade (WTB).
The PME and phased-based motion magnification approach estimates the structural motion from the
captured sequence of images for both a baseline and damaged test cases on a wind turbine blade.
