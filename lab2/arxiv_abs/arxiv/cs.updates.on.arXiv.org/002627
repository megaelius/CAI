Randomness extractors, which extract high quality (almost-uniform) random bits from biased random
sources, are important objects both in theory and in practice. While there have been significant
progress in obtaining near optimal constructions of randomness extractors in various settings,
the computational complexity of randomness extractors is still much less studied. In particular,
it is not clear whether randomness extractors with good parameters can be computed in several interesting
complexity classes that are much weaker than P. In this paper we study randomness extractors in the
following two models of computation: (1) constant-depth circuits (AC0), and (2) the local computation
model. Previous work in these models, such as Goldreich et. al. (CCC15) and, Bogdanov and Guo (ITCS13),
only achieve constructions with weak parameters. In this work we give explicit constructions of
randomness extractors with much better parameters. As an application, we use our AC0 extractors
to study pseudorandom generators in AC0, and show that we can construct both cryptographic pseudorandom
generators (under reasonable computational assumptions) and unconditional pseudorandom generators
for space bounded computation with very good parameters. Our constructions combine several previous
techniques in randomness extractors, as well as introduce new techniques to reduce or preserve
the complexity of extractors, which may be of independent interest. These include (1) a general
way to reduce the error of strong seeded extractors while preserving the AC0 property and small locality,
and (2) a seeded randomness condenser with small locality.
