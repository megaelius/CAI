Chest radiography is a general method for diagnosing a patient's condition and identifying important
information; therefore, radiography is used extensively in routine medical practice in various
situations, such as emergency medical care and medical checkup. However, a high level of expertise
is required to interpret chest radiographs. Thus, medical specialists spend considerable time
in diagnosing such huge numbers of radiographs. In order to solve these problems, methods for generating
findings have been proposed. However, the study of generating chest radiograph findings has primarily
focused on the English language, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies have studied Japanese
data on this subject. There are two challenges involved in generating findings in the Japanese language.
The first challenge is that word splitting is difficult because the boundaries of Japanese word
are not clear. The second challenge is that there are numerous orthographic variants. For deal with
these two challenges, we proposed an end-to-end model that generates Japanese findings at the character-level
from chest radiographs. In addition, we introduced the attention mechanism to improve not only
the accuracy, but also the interpretation ability of the results. We evaluated the proposed method
using a public dataset with Japanese findings. The effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed
using the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy score. And, we were confirmed from the generated findings
that the proposed method was able to consider the orthographic variants. Furthermore, we confirmed
via visual inspection that the attention mechanism captures the features and positional information
of radiographs.
