Intelligent Object manipulation for grasping is a challenging problem for robots. Unlike robots,
humans almost immediately know how to manipulate objects for grasping due to learning over the years.
A grown woman can grasp objects more skilfully than a child because of learning skills developed
over years, the absence of which in the present day robotic grasping compels it to perform well below
the human object grasping benchmarks. In this paper we have taken up the challenge of developing
learning based pose estimation by decomposing the problem into both position and orientation learning.
More specifically, for grasp position estimation, we explore three different methods - a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) based optimization method to minimize error between calculated image points and
predicted end-effector (EE) position, a regression based method (RM) where collected data points
of robot EE and image points have been regressed with a linear model, a PseudoInverse (PI) model which
has been formulated in the form of a mapping matrix with robot EE position and image points for several
observations. Further for grasp orientation learning, we develop a deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) model which we name as Grasp Deep Q-Network (GDQN) and benchmarked our results with Modified
VGG16 (MVGG16). Rigorous experimentations show that due to inherent capability of producing very
high-quality solutions for optimization problems and search problems, GA based predictor performs
much better than the other two models for position estimation. For orientation learning results
indicate that off policy learning through GDQN outperforms MVGG16, since GDQN architecture is
specially made suitable for the reinforcement learning. Based on our proposed architectures and
algorithms, the robot is capable of grasping all rigid body objects having regular shapes.
