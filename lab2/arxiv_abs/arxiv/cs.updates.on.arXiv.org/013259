This paper presents a novel method for remote heart rate (HR) estimation. Recent studies have proved
that blood pumping by the heart is highly correlated to the intense color of face pixels, and surprisingly
can be utilized for remote HR estimation. Researchers successfully proposed several methods for
this task, but making it work in realistic situations is still a challenging problem in computer
vision community. Furthermore, learning to solve such a complex task on a dataset with very limited
annotated samples is not reasonable. Consequently, researchers do not prefer to use the deep learning
approaches for this problem. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient approach to benefit
the advantages of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) by simplifying HR estimation from a complex task
to learning from very correlated representation to HR. Inspired by previous work, we learn a component
called Front-End (FE) to provide a discriminative representation of face videos, afterward a light
deep regression auto-encoder as Back-End (BE) is learned to map the FE representation to HR. Regression
task on the informative representation is simple and could be learned efficiently on limited training
samples. Beside of this, to be more accurate and work well on low-quality videos, two deep encoder-decoder
networks are trained to refine the output of FE. We also introduce a challenging dataset (HR-D) to
show that our method can efficiently work in realistic conditions. Experimental results on HR-D
and MAHNOB datasets confirm that our method could run as a real-time method and estimate the average
HR better than state-of-the-art ones.
