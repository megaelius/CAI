For a low-mobile Poisson bipolar network and under line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight (LOS/NLOS)
path-loss model, we study repetitive retransmissions (RR) and blocked incremental redundancy
(B-IR). We consider spatially-coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) zero-forcing beamforming
(ZFBF) multiplexing system, whereby the packet success reception is determined based on the aggregate
data rate across spatial dimensions of the MIMO system. Characterization of retransmission performance
in this low-mobile configuration is practically important, but inherently complex due to a substantial
rate correlation across retransmissions and intractability of evaluating the probability density
function (pdf) of aggregate data rate. Adopting tools of stochastic geometry, we firstly characterize
the rate correlation coefficient (RCC) for both schemes. Our results show that, compared to RR scheme,
B-IR scheme has higher RCC while its coverage probability is substantially larger. We demonstrate
that the spotted contention between coverage probability and RCC causes the mean transmission
delay (MTD) of B-IR to become either smaller or larger than the MTD of RR scheme. Finally, we develop
a numerical approximation of MTD, and evaluate the effective spatial throughput (EST), which is
reciprocal to MTD, of RR and B-IR schemes. Our numerical results highlight fundamental tradeoffs
between densification, multiplexing gain, block length, and activity factor of nodes. We further
observe that for dense networks 1) LOS component is considerably instrumental to enhance EST; 2)
EST of B-IR scheme can be much higher than that of RR scheme; 3) When Doppler spread exists, it can improve
MTD of B-IR while it does not cast any meaningful effect on the MTD of RR.
