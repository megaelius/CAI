Research in texture recognition often concentrates on recognizing textures with intraclass variations
such as illumination, rotation, viewpoint and small scale changes. In contrast, in real-world
applications a change in scale can have a dramatic impact on texture appearance, to the point of changing
completely from one texture category to another. As a result, texture variations due to changes
in scale are amongst the hardest to handle. In this work we conduct the first study of classifying
textures with extreme variations in scale. To address this issue, we first propose and then reduce
scale proposals on the basis of dominant texture patterns. Motivated by the challenges posed by
this problem, we propose a new GANet network where we use a Genetic Algorithm to change the units in
the hidden layers during network training, in order to promote the learning of more informative
semantic texture patterns. Finally, we adopt a FVCNN (Fisher Vector pooling of a Convolutional
Neural Network filter bank) feature encoder for global texture representation. Because extreme
scale variations are not necessarily present in most standard texture databases, to support the
proposed extreme-scale aspects of texture understanding we are developing a new dataset, the Extreme
Scale Variation Textures (ESVaT), to test the performance of our framework. It is demonstrated
that the proposed framework significantly outperforms gold-standard texture features by more
than 10% on ESVaT. We also test the performance of our proposed approach on the KTHTIPS2b and OS datasets
and a further dataset synthetically derived from Forrest, showing superior performance compared
to the state of the art.
