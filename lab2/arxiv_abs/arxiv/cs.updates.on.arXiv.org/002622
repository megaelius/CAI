In this survey, we discuss the role of energy in the design of future mobile networks and, in particular,
we advocate and elaborate on the use of energy harvesting (EH) hardware as a means to decrease the
environmental footprint of 5G technology. To take full advantage of the harvested (renewable)
energy, while still meeting the quality of service required by dense 5G deployments, suitable management
techniques are here reviewed, highlighting the open issues that are still to be solved to provide
eco-friendly and cost-effective mobile architectures. Several solutions have recently been
proposed to tackle capacity, coverage and efficiency problems, including: C-RAN, Software Defined
Networking (SDN) and fog computing, among others. However, these are not explicitly tailored to
increase the energy efficiency of networks featuring renewable energy sources, and have the following
limitations: (i) their energy savings are in many cases still insufficient and (ii) they do not consider
network elements possessing energy harvesting capabilities. In this paper, we systematically
review existing energy sustainable paradigms and methods to address points (i) and (ii), discussing
how these can be exploited to obtain highly efficient, energy self-sufficient and high capacity
networks. Several open issues have emerged from our review, ranging from the need for accurate energy,
transmission and consumption models, to the lack of accurate data traffic profiles, to the use of
power transfer, energy cooperation and energy trading techniques. These challenges are here discussed
along with some research directions to follow for achieving sustainable 5G systems.
