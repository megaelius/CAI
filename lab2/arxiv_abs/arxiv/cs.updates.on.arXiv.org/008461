There are many factors affecting visual face recognition, such as low resolution images, aging,
illumination and pose variance, etc. One of the most important problem is low resolution face images
which can result in bad performance on face recognition. Most of the general face recognition algorithms
usually assume a sufficient resolution for the face images. However, in practice many applications
often do not have sufficient image resolutions. The modern face hallucination models demonstrate
reasonable performance to reconstruct high-resolution images from its corresponding low resolution
images. However, they do not consider identity level information during hallucination which directly
affects results of the recognition of low resolution faces. To address this issue, we propose a Face
Hallucination Generative Adversarial Network (FH-GAN) which improves the quality of low resolution
face images and accurately recognize those low quality images. Concretely, we make the following
contributions: 1) we propose FH-GAN network, an end-to-end system, that improves both face hallucination
and face recognition simultaneously. The novelty of this proposed network depends on incorporating
identity information in a GAN-based face hallucination algorithm via combining a face recognition
network for identity preserving. 2) We also propose a new face hallucination network, namely Dense
Sparse Network (DSNet), which improves upon the state-of-art in face hallucination. 3) We demonstrate
benefits of training the face recognition and GAN-based DSNet jointly by reporting good result
on face hallucination and recognition.
