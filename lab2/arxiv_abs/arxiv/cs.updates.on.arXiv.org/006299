Radiological imaging offers effective measurement of anatomy, which is useful in disease diagnosis
and assessment. Previous study has shown that the left atrial wall remodeling can provide information
to predict treatment outcome in atrial fibrillation. Nevertheless, the segmentation of the left
atrial structures from medical images is still very time-consuming. Current advances in neural
network may help creating automatic segmentation models that reduce the workload for clinicians.
In this preliminary study, we propose automated, two-stage, three-dimensional U-Nets with convolutional
neural network, for the challenging task of left atrial segmentation. Unlike previous two-dimensional
image segmentation methods, we use 3D U-Nets to obtain the heart cavity directly in 3D. The dual 3D
U-Net structure consists of, a first U-Net to coarsely segment and locate the left atrium, and a second
U-Net to accurately segment the left atrium under higher resolution. In addition, we introduce
a Contour loss based on additional distance information to adjust the final segmentation. We randomly
split the data into training datasets (80 subjects) and validation datasets (20 subjects) to train
multiple models, with different augmentation setting. Experiments show that the average Dice
coefficients for validation datasets are around 0.91 - 0.92, the sensitivity around 0.90-0.94
and the specificity 0.99. Compared with traditional Dice loss, models trained with Contour loss
in general offer smaller Hausdorff distance with similar Dice coefficient, and have less connected
components in predictions. Finally, we integrate several trained models in an ensemble prediction
to segment testing datasets.
