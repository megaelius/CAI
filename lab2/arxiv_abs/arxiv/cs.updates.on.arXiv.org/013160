Even though deep learning methods have greatly increased the overall accuracy of face recognition,
an old problem still persists: accuracy is higher for men than for women. Previous researchers have
speculated that the difference could be due to cosmetics, head pose, or hair covering the face. It
is also often speculated that the lower accuracy for women is caused by women being under-represented
in the training data. This work aims to investigate if gender imbalance in the training data is actually
the cause of lower accuracy for females. Using a state-of-the-art deep CNN, three different loss
functions, and two training datasets, we train each on seven subsets with different male/female
ratios, totaling forty two train-ings. The trained face matchers are then tested on three different
testing datasets. Results show that gender-balancing the dataset has an overall positive effect,
with higher accuracy for most of the combinations of loss functions and datasets when a balanced
subset is used. However, for the best combination of loss function and dataset, the original training
dataset shows better accuracy on 3 out of 4 times. We observe that test accuracy for males is higher
when the training data is all male. However, test accuracy for females is not maximized when the training
data is all female. Fora number of combinations of loss function and test dataset, accuracy for females
is higher when only 75% of the train-ing data is female than when 100% of the training data is female.
This suggests that lower accuracy for females is nota simple result of the fraction of female training
data. By clustering face features, we show that in general, male faces are closer to other male faces
than female faces, and female faces are closer to other female faces than male faces
