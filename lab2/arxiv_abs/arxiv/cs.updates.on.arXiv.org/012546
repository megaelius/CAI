Many real-world relations can be represented by signed networks with positive links (e.g., friendships
and trust) and negative links (e.g., foes and distrust). Link prediction helps advance tasks in
social network analysis such as recommendation systems. Most existing work on link analysis focuses
on unsigned social networks. The existence of negative links piques research interests in investigating
whether properties and principles of signed networks differ from those of unsigned networks, and
mandates dedicated efforts on link analysis for signed social networks. Recent findings suggest
that properties of signed networks substantially differ from those of unsigned networks and negative
links can be of significant help in signed link analysis in complementary ways. In this article,
we center our discussion on a challenging problem of signed link analysis. Signed link analysis
faces the problem of data sparsity, i.e. only a small percentage of signed links are given. This problem
can even get worse when negative links are much sparser than positive ones as users are inclined more
towards positive disposition rather than negative. We investigate how we can take advantage of
other sources of information for signed link analysis. This research is mainly guided by three social
science theories, Emotional Information, Diffusion of Innovations, and Individual Personality.
Guided by these, we extract three categories of related features and leverage them for signed link
analysis. Experiments show the significance of the features gleaned from social theories for signed
link prediction and addressing the data sparsity challenge.
