Climate change is profoundly affecting nearly all aspects of life on earth, including human societies,
economies and health. Various human activities are responsible for significant greenhouse gas
emissions, including data centres and other sources of large-scale computation. Although many
important scientific milestones have been achieved thanks to the development of high-performance
computing, the resultant carbon impact has been underappreciated. In this paper, we present a methodological
framework to estimate the carbon impact (CO2 equivalent) of any computational task in a standardised
and reliable way, based on the running time, type of computing core, memory used and the efficiency
and location of the computing facility. Metrics to interpret and contextualise carbon impact are
defined, including the equivalent distance travelled by car or plane as well as the number of tree-months
necessary for carbon sequestration. We develop a freely available online tool, Green Algorithms
(www.green-algorithms.org), which enables a user to estimate and report the environmental impact
of their computation. The Green Algorithms tool easily integrates with computational processes
as it requires minimal information and does not interfere with existing code, while also accounting
for a broad range of CPUs, GPUs, cloud computing, local servers and desktop computers. Finally,
by applying Green Algorithms, we quantify the environmental impact of algorithms used for particle
physics simulations, weather forecasts and natural language processing. Taken together, this
study develops a simple generalisable framework and freely available tool to quantify the carbon
impact of nearly any computation. Combined with a series of recommendations to minimise unnecessary
CO2 emissions, we hope to raise awareness and facilitate greener computation.
