Memristive crossbars have become a popular means for realizing unsupervised and supervised learning
techniques. In previous neuromorphic architectures with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons,
the crossbar itself has been separated from the neuron capacitors to preserve mathematical rigor.
In this work, we sought to simplify the design, creating a fast circuit that consumed significantly
lower power at a minimal cost of accuracy. We also showed that connecting the neurons directly to
the crossbar resulted in a more efficient sparse coding architecture, and alleviated the need to
pre-normalize receptive fields. This work provides derivations for the design of such a network,
named the Simple Spiking Locally Competitive Algorithm, or SSLCA, as well as CMOS designs and results
on the CIFAR and MNIST datasets. Compared to a non-spiking model which scored 33% on CIFAR-10 with
a single-layer classifier, this hardware scored 32% accuracy. When used with a state-of-the-art
deep learning classifier, the non-spiking model achieved 82% and our simplified, spiking model
achieved 80%, while compressing the input data by 92%. Compared to a previously proposed spiking
model, our proposed hardware consumed 99% less energy to do the same work at 21x the throughput. Accuracy
held out with online learning to a write variance of 3%, suitable for the often-reported 4-bit resolution
required for neuromorphic algorithms; with offline learning to a write variance of 27%; and with
read variance to 40%. The proposed architecture's excellent accuracy, throughput, and significantly
lower energy usage demonstrate the utility of our innovations. This work provides a means for extremely
low-energy sparse coding in mobile devices, such as cellular phones, or for very sparse coding as
is needed by self-driving cars or robotics that must integrate data from multiple, high-resolution
sensors.
