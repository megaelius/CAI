Recent research has shown that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for image classification are vulnerable
to adversarial attacks. However, most works on adversarial samples utilize sub-perceptual noise
that, while invisible or slightly visible to humans, often covers the entire image. Additionally,
most of these attacks often require knowledge of the neural network architecture and its parameters,
and the ability to calculate the gradients of the parameters with respect to the inputs. In this work,
we show that it is possible to attack neural networks in a highly restricted threat setting, where
attackers have no knowledge of the neural network (i.e., in a black-box setting) and can only modify
highly localized adversarial noise in the form of randomly chosen straight lines or scratches.
Our Adversarial Scratches attack method covers only 1-2% of the image pixels and are generated using
the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy, a purely black-box method that does not
require knowledge of the neural network architecture and its gradients. Against ImageNet models,
Adversarial Scratches requires 3 times fewer queries than GenAttack (without any optimizations)
and 73 times fewer queries than ZOO, both prior state-of-the-art black-box attacks. We successfully
deceive state-of-the-art Inception-v3, ResNet-50 and VGG-19 models trained on ImageNet with
deceiving rates of 75.8%, 62.7%, and 45% respectively, with fewer queries than several state-of-the-art
black-box attacks, while modifying less than 2% of the image pixels. Additionally, we provide a
new threat scenario for neural networks, demonstrate a new attack surface that can be used to perform
adversarial attacks, and discuss its potential implications.
