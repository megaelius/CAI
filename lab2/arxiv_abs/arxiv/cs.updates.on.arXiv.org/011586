The merits of fast convergence and potentially better performance of the weight normalization
family have drawn increasing attention in recent years. These methods use standardization or normalization
that changes the weight $\boldsymbol{W}$ to $\boldsymbol{W}'$, which makes $\boldsymbol{W}'$
independent to the magnitude of $\boldsymbol{W}$. Surprisingly, $\boldsymbol{W}$ must be decayed
during gradient descent, otherwise we will observe a severe under-fitting problem, which is very
counter-intuitive since weight decay is widely known to prevent deep networks from over-fitting.
In this paper, we \emph{theoretically} prove that the weight decay term $\frac{1}{2}\lambda||{\boldsymbol{W}}||^2$
merely modulates the effective learning rate for improving objective optimization, and has no
influence on generalization when the weight normalization family is compositely employed. Furthermore,
we also expose several critical problems when introducing weight decay term to weight normalization
family, including the missing of global minimum and training instability. To address these problems,
we propose an $\epsilon-$shifted $L_2$ regularizer, which shifts the $L_2$ objective by a positive
constant $\epsilon$. Such a simple operation can theoretically guarantee the existence of global
minimum, while preventing the network weights from being too small and thus avoiding gradient float
overflow. It significantly improves the training stability and can achieve slightly better performance
in our practice. The effectiveness of $\epsilon-$shifted $L_2$ regularizer is comprehensively
validated on the ImageNet, CIFAR-100, and COCO datasets. Our codes and pretrained models will be
released in https://github.com/implus/PytorchInsight.
