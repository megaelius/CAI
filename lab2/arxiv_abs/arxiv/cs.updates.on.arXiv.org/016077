Information-theoretic formulations of the private information retrieval (PIR) problem have
been investigated under a variety of scenarios. Symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR)
is a variant where a user is able to privately retrieve one out of $K$ messages from $N$ non-colluding
replicated databases without learning anything about the remaining $K-1$ messages. However,
the goal of perfect privacy can be too taxing for certain applications. In this paper, we investigate
if the information-theoretic capacity of SPIR (equivalently, the inverse of the minimum download
cost) can be increased by relaxing both user and DB privacy definitions. Such relaxation is relevant
in applications where privacy can be traded for communication efficiency. We introduce and investigate
the Asymmetric Leaky PIR (AL-PIR) model with different privacy leakage budgets in each direction.
For user privacy leakage, we bound the probability ratios between all possible realizations of
DB queries by a function of a non-negative constant $\epsilon$. For DB privacy, we bound the mutual
information between the undesired messages, the queries, and the answers, by a function of a non-negative
constant $\delta$. We propose a general AL-PIR scheme that achieves an upper bound on the optimal
download cost for arbitrary $\epsilon$ and $\delta$. We show that the optimal download cost of AL-PIR
is upper-bounded as $D^{*}(\epsilon,\delta)\leq 1+\frac{1}{N-1}-\frac{\delta e^{\epsilon}}{N^{K-1}-1}$.
Second, we obtain an information-theoretic lower bound on the download cost as $D^{*}(\epsilon,\delta)\geq
1+\frac{1}{Ne^{\epsilon}-1}-\frac{\delta}{(Ne^{\epsilon})^{K-1}-1}$. The gap analysis
between the two bounds shows that our AL-PIR scheme is optimal when $\epsilon =0$, i.e., under perfect
user privacy and it is optimal within a maximum multiplicative gap of $\frac{N-e^{-\epsilon}}{N-1}$
for any $(\epsilon,\delta)$.
