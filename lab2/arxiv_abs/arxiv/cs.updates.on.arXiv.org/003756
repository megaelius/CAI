System logs are a valuable source of information for the analysis and understanding of systems behavior
for the purpose of improving their performance. Such logs contain various types of information,
including sensitive information. Information deemed sensitive can either directly be extracted
from system log entries by correlation of several log entries, or can be inferred from the combination
of the (non-sensitive) information contained within system logs with other logs and/or additional
datasets. The analysis of system logs containing sensitive information compromises data privacy.
Therefore, various anonymization techniques, such as generalization and suppression have been
employed, over the years, by data and computing centers to protect the privacy of their users, their
data, and the system as a whole. Privacy-preserving data resulting from anonymization via generalization
and suppression may lead to significantly decreased data usefulness, thus, hindering the intended
analysis for understanding the system behavior. Maintaining a balance between data usefulness
and privacy preservation, therefore, remains an open and important challenge. Irreversible encoding
of system logs using collision-resistant hashing algorithms, such as SHAKE-128, is a novel approach
previously introduced by the authors to mitigate data privacy concerns. The present work describes
a study of the applicability of the encoding approach from earlier work on the system logs of a production
high performance computing system. Moreover, a metric is introduced to assess the data usefulness
of the anonymized system logs to detect and identify the failures encountered in the system.
