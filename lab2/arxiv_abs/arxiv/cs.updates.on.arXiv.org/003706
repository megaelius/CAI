The rapid growth of traffic-related fatalities and injuries around the world including developed
countries has drawn researchers' attention for conducting research on automated highway systems
to improve road safety over the past few years. In addition, fuel expenses due to traffic congestion
in the U.S. translate to billions of dollars annually. These issues are motivating researchers
across many disciplines to develop strategies to implement automation in transportation. The
advent of connected-vehicle (CV) technology has added a new dimension to the research. The CV technology
allows a vehicle to communicate with roadside infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastructure),
and other vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle) on roads wirelessly using dedicated short-range communication
(DSRC) protocol. Collectively, the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure
(V2I) communication technologies are known as V2X technology. Automotive companies have started
to include On-Board Units (OBUs) on latest automobiles which can run safety-critical and assistive
applications using V2X technology. For example, US Department of Transportation has already launched
various applications including but not limited to lane-change assistance, collision avoidance,
SPaT for emergency and transit vehicles. Merge conflicts, especially when vehicles are trying
to merge from ramps to freeways, are a significant source of collisions, traffic congestion and
fuel use. This paper describes a novel freeway merge assistance system utilizing V2X technology
with the help of the DSRC protocol. The freeway merge assistance system uses an innovative three-way
handshaking protocol and provides advisories to drivers to guide the merging sequence.
