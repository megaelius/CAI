Autonomous vehicles and driving technologies have received notable attention in the past decades.
In autonomous driving systems, \textcolor{black}{the} information of vehicle dynamics is required
in most cases for designing of motion planning and control algorithms. However, it is nontrivial
for identifying a global model of vehicle dynamics due to the existence of strong non-linearity
and uncertainty. Many efforts have resorted to machine learning techniques for building data-driven
models, but it may suffer from interpretability and result in a complex nonlinear representation.
In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework relying on an interpretable Koopman operator
to build a data-driven predictor of the vehicle dynamics. The main idea is to use the Koopman operator
for representing the nonlinear dynamics in a linear lifted feature space. The approach results
in a global model that integrates the dynamics in both longitudinal and lateral directions. As the
core contribution, we propose a deep learning-based extended dynamic mode decomposition (Deep
EDMD) algorithm to learn a finite approximation of the Koopman operator. Different from other machine
learning-based approaches, deep neural networks play the role of learning feature representations
for EDMD in the framework of the Koopman operator. Simulation results in a high-fidelity CarSim
environment are reported, which show the capability of the Deep EDMD approach in multi-step prediction
of vehicle dynamics at a wide operating range. Also, the proposed approach outperforms the EDMD
method, the multi-layer perception (MLP) method, and the Extreme Learning Machines-based EDMD
(ELM-EDMD) method in terms of modeling performance. Finally, we design a linear MPC with Deep EDMD
(DE-MPC) for realizing reference tracking and test the controller in the CarSim environment.
