The latest High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard significantly improves coding efficiency
over its previous video coding standards. The expense of such improvement is enormous computational
complexity, from both encoding and decoding sides. Since computational capability and power capacity
are diverse across portable devices, it is necessary to reduce decoding complexity to a target with
tolerable quality loss, so called complexity control. This paper proposes a Saliency-Guided Complexity
Control (SGCC) approach for HEVC decoding, which reduces the decoding complexity to the target
with minimal perceptual quality loss. First, we establish the SGCC formulation to minimize perceptual
quality loss at the constraint on reduced decoding complexity, which is achieved via disabling
Deblocking Filter (DF) and simplifying Motion Compensation (MC) of some non-salient Coding Tree
Units (CTUs). One important component in this formulation is the modelled relationship between
decoding complexity reduction and DF disabling/MC simplification, which determines the control
accuracy of our approach. Another component is the modelled relationship between quality loss
and DF disabling/MC simplification, responsible for optimizing perceptual quality. By solving
the SGCC formulation for a given target complexity, we can obtain the DF and MC settings of each CTU,
and then decoding complexity can be reduced to the target. Finally, the experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our SGCC approach, from the aspects of control performance, complexity-distortion
performance, fluctuation of quality loss and subjective quality.
