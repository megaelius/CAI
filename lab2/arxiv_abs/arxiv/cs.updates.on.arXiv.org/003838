We investigate exploration algorithms for autonomous mobile robots evolving in uniform ring-shaped
networks. Different from the usual Look-Compute-Move (LCM) model, we consider two characteristics:
myopia and luminosity. Myopia means each robot has a limited visibility. We consider the weakest
assumption for myopia: each robot can only observe its neighboring nodes. Luminosity means each
robot maintains a non-volatile visible light. We consider the weakest assumption for luminosity:
each robot can use only two colors for its light. The main interest of this paper is to clarify the impact
of luminosity on exploration with myopic robots. As a main contribution, we prove that 1) in the fully
synchronous model, two and three robots are necessary and sufficient to achieve perpetual and terminating
exploration, respectively, and 2) in the semi-synchronous and asynchronous models, three and
four robots are necessary and sufficient to achieve perpetual and terminating exploration, respectively.
These results clarify the power of lights for myopic robots since, without lights, five robots are
necessary and sufficient to achieve terminating exploration in the fully synchronous model, and
no terminating exploration algorithm exists in the semi-synchronous and asynchronous models.
We also show that, in the fully synchronous model (resp., the semi-synchronous and asynchronous
models), the proposed perpetual exploration algorithm is universal, that is, the algorithm solves
perpetual exploration from any solvable initial configuration with two (resp., three) robots
and two colors. On the other hand, we show that, in the fully synchronous model (resp., the semi-synchronous
and asynchronous models), no universal algorithm exists for terminating exploration, that is,
no algorithm may solve terminating exploration from any solvable initial configuration with three
(resp., four) robots and two colors.
