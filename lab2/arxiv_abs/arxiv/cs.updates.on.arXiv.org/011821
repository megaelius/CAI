Recent automated crop mapping via supervised learning-based methods have demonstrated unprecedented
improvement over classical techniques. However, most crop mapping studies are limited to same-year
crop mapping in which the present year's labeled data is used to predict the same year's crop map.
Classification accuracies of these methods degrade considerably in cross-year mapping. Cross-year
crop mapping is more useful as it allows the prediction of the following years' crop maps using previously
labeled data. We propose Vector Dynamic Time Warping (VDTW), a novel multi-year classification
approach based on warping of angular distances between phenological vectors. The results prove
that the proposed VDTW method is robust to temporal and spectral variations compensating for different
farming practices, climate and atmospheric effects, and measurement errors between years. We
also describe a method for determining the most discriminative time window that allows high classification
accuracies with limited data. We carried out tests of our approach with Landsat 8 time-series imagery
from years 2013 to 2016 for classification of corn and cotton in the Harran Plain, and corn, cotton,
and soybean in the Bismil Plain of Southeastern Turkey. In addition, we tested VDTW corn and soybean
in Kansas, the US for 2017 and 2018 with the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel data. The VDTW method achieved
99.85% and 99.74% overall accuracies for the same and cross years, respectively with fewer training
samples compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, i.e. spectral angle mapper (SAM), dynamic
time warping (DTW), time-weighted DTW (TWDTW), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM)
and deep long short-term memory (LSTM) methods. The proposed method could be expanded for other
crop types and/or geographical areas.
