The recent surge of applications involving the use of $360^o$ video challenges mobile networks
infrastructure, as $360^o$ video files are of significant size, and current delivery and edge caching
architectures are unable to guarantee their timely delivery. In this paper, we investigate the
problem of joint collaborative content-aware caching and delivery of $360^o$ videos in a video
on demand setting. The proposed scheme takes advantage of $360^o$ video encoding in multiple tiles
and layers to make fine-grained decisions regarding which tiles to cache in each Small Base Station
(SBS), and where to deliver them from to the end users, as users may reside in the coverage area of multiple
SBSs. This permits to cache the most popular tiles in the SBSs, while the remaining tiles may be obtained
through the backhaul. In addition, we explicitly consider the time delivery constraints to ensure
continuous video playback. To reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem,
we simplify it by introducing a fairness constraint. This allows us to split the original problem
into subproblems corresponding to Groups of Pictures (GoP). Each of the subproblems is then solved
with the method of Lagrange partial relaxation. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
method for various system parameters and compare it with schemes that do not consider $360^o$ video
encoding into multiple tiles and quality layers, as well as with two variants of the proposed method
one that considers layered encoding and SBSs collaboration and another that uses tiles encoding
but with no SBSs collaboration. The results showcase the benefits coming from caching and delivery
decisions on per tile basis and the importance of exploiting SBSs collaboration.
