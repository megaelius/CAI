Millimeter-wave (mmWave) using conventional phased array (CPA) enables highly directional and
fixed angular beamforming (FAB), therefore enhancing physical layer security (PLS) in the angular
domain. However, as the eavesdropper is located in the direction pointed by the mainlobe of the information-carrying
beam, information leakage is inevitable and FAB cannot guarantee PLS performance. To address this
threat, we propose a novel fixed region beamforming (FRB) by employing a frequency diverse subarray
(FDSA) architecture to enhance the PLS performance for mmWave directional communications. In
particular, we carefully introduce multiple frequency offset increments (FOIs) across subarrays
to achieve a sophisticated beampattern synthesis that ensures a confined information transmission
only within the desired angle-range region (DARR) in close vicinity of the target user. More specifically,
we formulate the secrecy rate maximization problem with FRB over possible subarray FOIs, and consider
two cases of interests, i.e., without/with the location information of eavesdropping, both turn
out to be NP-hard. For the unknown eavesdropping location case, we propose a seeker optimization
algorithm to minimize the maximum sidelobe peak of the beampattern outside the DARR. As for the known
eavesdropping location case, a block coordinate descend linear approximation algorithm is proposed
to minimize the sidelobe level in the eavesdropping region. By using the proposed FRB, the mainlobes
of all subarrays are constructively superimposed in the DARR while the sidelobes are destructively
overlayed outside the DARR. Therefore, FRB takes prominent effect on confining information transmission
within the DARR. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed FDSA-based FRB can provide
superior PLS performance over the CPA-based FAB.
