Data size is the bottleneck for developing deep saliency models, because collecting eye-movement
data is very time consuming and expensive. Most of current studies on human attention and saliency
modeling have used high quality stereotype stimuli. In real world, however, captured images undergo
various types of transformations. Can we use these transformations to augment existing saliency
datasets? Here, we first create a novel saliency dataset including fixations of 10 observers over
1900 images degraded by 19 types of transformations. Second, by analyzing eye movements, we find
that observers look at different locations over transformed versus original images. Third, we
utilize the new data over transformed images, called data augmentation transformation (DAT),
to train deep saliency models. We find that label preserving DATs with negligible impact on human
gaze boost saliency prediction, whereas some other DATs that severely impact human gaze degrade
the performance. These label preserving valid augmentation transformations provide a solution
to enlarge existing saliency datasets. Finally, we introduce a novel saliency model based on generative
adversarial network (dubbed GazeGAN). A modified UNet is proposed as the generator of the GazeGAN,
which combines classic skip connections with a novel center-surround connection (CSC), in order
to leverage multi level features. We also propose a histogram loss based on Alternative Chi Square
Distance (ACS HistLoss) to refine the saliency map in terms of luminance distribution. Extensive
experiments and comparisons over 3 datasets indicate that GazeGAN achieves the best performance
in terms of popular saliency evaluation metrics, and is more robust to various perturbations. Our
