The robot market has been growing significantly and is expected to become 1.5 times larger in 2024
than what it was in 2019. Robots have attracted attention of security companies thanks to their mobility.
These days, for security robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have quickly emerged by highlighting
their advantage: they can even go to any hazardous place that humans cannot access. For UAVs, Drone
has been a representative model and has several merits to consist of various sensors such as high-resolution
cameras. Therefore, Drone is the most suitable as a mobile surveillance robot. These attractive
advantages such as high-resolution cameras and mobility can be a double-edged sword, i.e., privacy
infringement. Surveillance drones take videos with high-resolution to fulfill their role, however,
those contain a lot of privacy sensitive information. The indiscriminate shooting is a critical
issue for those who are very reluctant to be exposed. To tackle the privacy infringement, this work
proposes face-anonymizing drone patrol system. In this system, one person's face in a video is transformed
into a different face with facial components maintained. To construct our privacy-preserving
system, we have adopted the latest generative adversarial networks frameworks and have some modifications
on losses of those frameworks. Our face-anonymzing approach is evaluated with various public face-image
and video dataset. Moreover, our system is evaluated with a customized drone consisting of a high-resolution
camera, a companion computer, and a drone control computer. Finally, we confirm that our system
can protect privacy sensitive information with our face-anonymzing algorithm while preserving
the performance of robot perception, i.e., simultaneous localization and mapping.
