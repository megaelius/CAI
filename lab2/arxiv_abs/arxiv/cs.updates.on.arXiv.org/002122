We present an information-theoretic framework for bounding the number of labeled samples needed
to train a classifier in a parametric Bayesian setting. We derive bounds on the average $L_p$ distance
between the learned classifier and the true maximum a posteriori classifier, which are well-established
surrogates for the excess classification error due to imperfect learning. We provide lower and
upper bounds on the rate-distortion function, using $L_p$ loss as the distortion measure, of a maximum
a priori classifier in terms of the differential entropy of the posterior distribution and a quantity
called the interpolation dimension, which characterizes the complexity of the parametric distribution
family. In addition to expressing the information content of a classifier in terms of lossy compression,
the rate-distortion function also expresses the minimum number of bits a learning machine needs
to extract from training data to learn a classifier to within a specified $L_p$ tolerance. We use
results from universal source coding to express the information content in the training data in
terms of the Fisher information of the parametric family and the number of training samples available.
The result is a framework for computing lower bounds on the Bayes $L_p$ risk. This framework complements
the well-known probably approximately correct (PAC) framework, which provides minimax risk bounds
involving the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension or Rademacher complexity. Whereas the PAC framework
provides upper bounds the risk for the worst-case data distribution, the proposed rate-distortion
framework lower bounds the risk averaged over the data distribution. We evaluate the bounds for
a variety of data models, including categorical, multinomial, and Gaussian models. In each case
the bounds are provably tight orderwise, and in two cases we prove that the bounds are tight up to multiplicative
constants.
