The main security service in the connected world of cyber physical systems necessitates to authenticate
a large number of nodes privately. In this paper, the private authentication problem is considered,
that consists of a certificate authority, a verifier, many legitimate users (prover) and any arbitrary
number of illegitimate users. Each legitimate user wants to be authenticated (using his personal
key) by the verifier, while simultaneously wants to stay completely anonymous (even to the verifier
and the CA). On the other hand, an illegitimate user must fail to authenticate himself. We analyze
this problem from an information theoretical perspective. First, we propose a general interactive
information-theoretic model for the problem. As a metric to measure the reliability, we consider
the authentication key rate whose rate maximization has a trade-off with establishing privacy.
Then, we analyze the problem in two different regimes: finite size regime (i.e., the variables are
elements of a finite field) and asymptotic regime (i.e., the variables are considered to have large
enough length). For both regimes, we propose schemes that satisfy the completeness, soundness
and privacy properties. In finite size regime, the idea is to generate the authentication keys according
to a secret sharing scheme. In asymptotic regime, we use a random binning based scheme which relies
on the joint typicality to generate the authentication keys. Moreover, providing the converse
proof, we show that our scheme achieves capacity in the asymptotic regime. For finite size regime
our scheme achieves capacity for large field size.
