Motivation: Cellular Electron CryoTomography (CECT) is an emerging 3D imaging technique that
visualizes subcellular organization of single cells at submolecular resolution and in near-native
state. CECT captures large numbers of macromolecular complexes of highly diverse structures and
abundances. However, the structural complexity and imaging limits complicate the systematic
de novo structural recovery and recognition of these macromolecular complexes. Efficient and
accurate reference-free subtomogram averaging and classification represent the most critical
tasks for such analysis. Existing subtomogram alignment based methods are prone to the missing
wedge effects and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, existing maximum-likelihood based
methods rely on integration operations, which are in principle computationally infeasible for
accurate calculation. Results: Built on existing works, we propose an integrated method, Fast
Alignment Maximum Likelihood method (FAML), which uses fast subtomogram alignment to sample sub-optimal
rigid transformations. The transformations are then used to approximate integrals for maximum-likelihood
update of subtomogram averages through expectation-maximization algorithm. Our tests on simulated
and experimental subtomograms showed that, compared to our previously developed fast alignment
method (FA), FAML is significantly more robust to noise and missing wedge effects with moderate
increases of computation cost.Besides, FAML performs well with significantly fewer input subtomograms
when the FA method fails. Therefore, FAML can serve as a key component for improved construction
of initial structural models from macromolecules captured by CECT.
