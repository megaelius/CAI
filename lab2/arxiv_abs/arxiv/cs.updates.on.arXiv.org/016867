Water pollution is a critical issue that can affects humans' health and the entire ecosystem thus
inducing economical and social concerns. In this paper, we focus on an Internet of Things water quality
prediction system, namely WaterS, that can remotely communicate the gathered measurements leveraging
Low-Power Wide Area Network technologies. The solution addresses the water pollution problem
while taking into account the peculiar Internet of Things constraints such as energy efficiency
and autonomy as the platform is equipped with a photovoltaic cell. At the base of our solution, there
is a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network used for time series prediction. It results
as an efficient solution to predict water quality parameters such as pH, conductivity, oxygen,
and temperature. The water quality parameters measurements involved in this work are referred
to the Tiziano Project dataset in a reference time period spanning from 2007 to 2012. The LSTM applied
to predict the water quality parameters achieves high accuracy and a low Mean Absolute Error of 0.20,
a Mean Square Error of 0.092, and finally a Cosine Proximity of 0.94. The obtained results were widely
analyzed in terms of protocol suitability and network scalability of the current architecture
towards large-scale deployments. From a networking perspective, with an increasing number of
Sigfox-enabling end-devices, the Packet Error Rate increases as well up to 4% with the largest envisioned
deployment. Finally, the source code of WaterS ecosystem has been released as open-source, to encourage
and promote research activities from both Industry and Academia.
