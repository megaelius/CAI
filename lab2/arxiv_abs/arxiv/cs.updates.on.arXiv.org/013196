Image compression is one of the most fundamental techniques and commonly used applications in the
image and video processing field. Earlier methods built a well-designed pipeline, and efforts
were made to improve all modules of the pipeline by handcrafted tuning. Later, tremendous contributions
were made, especially when data-driven methods revitalized the domain with their excellent modeling
capacities and flexibility in incorporating newly designed modules and constraints. Despite
great progress, a systematic benchmark and comprehensive analysis of end-to-end learned image
compression methods are lacking. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive literature survey
of learned image compression methods. The literature is organized based on several aspects to jointly
optimize the rate-distortion performance with a neural network, i.e., network architecture,
entropy model and rate control. We describe milestones in cutting-edge learned image-compression
methods, review a broad range of existing works, and provide insights into their historical development
routes. With this survey, the main challenges of image compression methods are revealed, along
with opportunities to address the related issues with recent advanced learning methods. This analysis
provides an opportunity to take a further step towards higher-efficiency image compression. By
introducing a coarse-to-fine hyperprior model for entropy estimation and signal reconstruction,
we achieve improved rate-distortion performance, especially on high-resolution images. Extensive
benchmark experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model in coding efficiency and the potential
for acceleration by large-scale parallel computing devices.
