We present a comprehensive analysis on connectivity and resilience of secure sensor networks under
the widely studied q-composite key predistribution scheme. For network connectivity which ensures
that any two sensors can find a path in between for secure communication, we derive the conditions
to guarantee connectivity in consideration of (i) node-capture attacks, where the adversary may
capture a set of sensors and compromise keys in their memory; (ii) sensor mobility, meaning that
sensors can move around so that the network topology may change over time; (iii) physical transmission
constraints, under which two sensors have to be within each other's transmission range for communication;
(iv) the boundary effect of network fields; and (v) link unreliability, meaning that links are allowed
to be unreliable. In contrast, many prior connectivity analyses of secure sensor networks often
ignore the above issues. For resilience, although limited studies have presented formal analysis,
it is often assumed that the adversary captures a random set of sensors, whereas this paper allows
the adversary to capture an arbitrary set of sensors. We present conditions to ensure unassailability
and unsplittability in secure sensor networks under the q-composite scheme. Unassailability
ensures that an adversary capturing any set consisting of a negligible fraction of sensors can compromise
only a negligible fraction of communication links although the adversary may compromise communications
between noncaptured nodes which happen to use keys that are shared by captured nodes. Unsplittability
means that when a negligible fraction of sensors are captured, almost all of the remaining nodes
are still securely connected. Based on the results of connectivity, unassailability and unsplittability,
we provide useful guidelines for the design of secure sensor networks.
