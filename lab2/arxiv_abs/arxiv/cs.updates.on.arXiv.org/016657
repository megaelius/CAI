Data, algorithms, and compute/storage infrastructure are key assets that drive data science and
artificial intelligence applications. As providing all these assets requires a huge investment,
data science and artificial intelligence technologies are currently dominated by a small number
of providers who can afford these investments. This leads to lock-in effects and hinders features
that require a flexible exchange of assets among users. In this vision paper, we present Agora, a
unified asset ecosystem. The Agora system provides the technical infrastructure that allows for
offering and using data and algorithms, as well as physical infrastructure components. Agora is
designed as an open ecosystem of asset marketplaces and provides to a broad audience not only data
but the entire data value chain (including computational resources and human expertise). Agora
(i) leverages a fine-grained exchange of assets, (ii) allows for combining assets to novel applications,
and (iii) flexibly executes such applications on available resources. As a result, Agora overcomes
lock-in effects and removes entry barriers for new asset providers. In contrast to existing data
management systems, Agora operates in a heavily decentralized and dynamic environment: Data,
algorithms, and even compute resources are dynamically created, modified, and removed by different
stakeholders. Agora presents novel research directions for the data management community as a
whole: It requires to combine our traditional expertise in scalable data processing and management
with infrastructure provisioning as well as economic and application aspects of data, algorithms,
and infrastructure.
