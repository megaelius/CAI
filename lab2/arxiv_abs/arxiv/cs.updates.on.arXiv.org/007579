It is commonplace to encounter heterogeneous or nonstationary data, of which the underlying generating
process changes across domains or over time. Such a distribution shift feature presents both challenges
and opportunities for causal discovery. In this paper, we develop a framework for causal discovery
from such data, called Constraint-based causal Discovery from heterogeneous/NOnstationary
Data (CD-NOD), to find causal skeleton and directions and estimate the properties of mechanism
changes. First, we propose an enhanced constraint-based procedure to detect variables whose local
mechanisms change and recover the skeleton of the causal structure over observed variables. Second,
we present a method to determine causal orientations by making use of independent changes in the
data distribution implied by the underlying causal model, benefiting from information carried
by changing distributions. After learning the causal structure, next, we investigate how to efficiently
estimate the `driving force' of the nonstationarity of a causal mechanism. That is, we aim to extract
from data a low-dimensional representation of changes. The proposed methods are nonparametric,
with no hard restrictions on data distributions and causal mechanisms, and do not rely on window
segmentation. Furthermore, we find that data heterogeneity benefits causal structure identification
even with particular types of confounders. Finally, we show the connection between heterogeneity/nonstationarity
and soft intervention in causal discovery. Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world
data sets (task-fMRI and stock market data) are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
methods.
