Traffic violations like illegal parking, illegal turning, and speeding have become one of the greatest
challenges in urban transportation systems, bringing potential risks of traffic congestions,
vehicle accidents, and parking difficulties. To maximize the utility and effectiveness of the
traffic enforcement strategies aiming at reducing traffic violations, it is essential for urban
authorities to infer the traffic violation-prone locations in the city. Therefore, we propose
a low-cost, comprehensive, and dynamic framework to infer traffic violation-prone locations
in cities based on the large-scale vehicle trajectory data and road environment data. Firstly,
we normalize the trajectory data by map matching algorithms and extract key driving behaviors,
i.e., turning behaviors, parking behaviors, and speeds of vehicles. Secondly, we restore spatiotemporal
contexts of driving behaviors to get corresponding traffic restrictions such as no parking, no
turning, and speed restrictions. After matching the traffic restrictions with driving behaviors,
we get the traffic violation distribution. Finally, we extract the spatiotemporal patterns of
traffic violations, and build a visualization system to showcase the inferred traffic violation-prone
locations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive studies
on large-scale, real-world vehicle GPS trajectories collected from two Chinese cities, respectively.
Evaluation results confirm that the proposed framework infers traffic violation-prone locations
effectively and efficiently, providing comprehensive decision supports for traffic enforcement
strategies.
