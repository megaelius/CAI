The quest for colorful components (connected components where each color is associated with at
most one vertex) inside a vertex-colored graph has been widely considered in the last ten years.
Here we consider two variants, Minimum Colorful Components (MCC) and Maximum Edges in transitive
Closure (MEC), introduced in 2011 in the context of orthology gene identification in bioinformatics.
The input of both MCC and MEC is a vertex-colored graph. MCC asks for the removal of a subset of edges,
so that the resulting graph is partitioned in the minimum number of colorful connected components;
MEC asks for the removal of a subset of edges, so that the resulting graph is partitioned in colorful
connected components and the number of edges in the transitive closure of such a graph is maximized.
We study the parameterized and approximation complexity of MCC and MEC, for general and restricted
instances. For MCC on trees we show that the problem is basically equivalent to Minimum Cut on Trees,
thus MCC is not approximable within factor $1.36 - \varepsilon$, it is fixed-parameter tractable
and it admits a poly-kernel (when the parameter is the number of colorful components). Moreover,
we show that MCC, while it is polynomial time solvable on paths, it is NP-hard even for graphs with
constant distance to disjoint paths number. Then we consider the parameterized complexity of MEC
when parameterized by the number $k$ of edges in the transitive closure of a solution (the graph obtained
by removing edges so that it is partitioned in colorful connected components). We give a fixed-parameter
algorithm for MEC paramterized by $k$ and, when the input graph is a tree, we give a poly-kernel.
