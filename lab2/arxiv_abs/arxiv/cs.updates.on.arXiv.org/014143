Recent advances in electronics are enabling substantial processing to be performed at each node
(robots, sensors) of a networked system. Local processing enables data compression and may mitigate
measurement noise, but it is still slower compared to a central computer (it entails a larger computational
delay). However, while nodes can process the data in parallel, the centralized computational is
sequential in nature. On the other hand, if a node sends raw data to a central computer for processing,
it incurs communication delay. This leads to a fundamental communication-computation trade-off,
where each node has to decide on the optimal amount of preprocessing in order to maximize the network
performance. We consider a network in charge of estimating the state of a dynamical system and provide
three contributions. First, we provide a rigorous problem formulation for optimal real-time estimation
in processing networks in the presence of delays. Second, we show that, in the case of a homogeneous
network (where all sensors have the same computation) that monitors a continuous-time scalar linear
system, the optimal amount of local preprocessing maximizing the network estimation performance
can be computed analytically. Third, we consider the realistic case of a heterogeneous network
monitoring a discrete-time multi-variate linear system and provide algorithms to decide on suitable
preprocessing at each node, and to select a sensor subset when computational constraints make using
all sensors suboptimal. Numerical simulations show that selecting the sensors is crucial. Moreover,
we show that if the nodes apply the preprocessing policy suggested by our algorithms, they can largely
improve the network estimation performance.
