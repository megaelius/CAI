It is widely known that there is a lot of useful information hidden in big data, leading to a new saying
that "data is money." Thus, it is prevalent for individuals to mine crucial information for utilization
in many real-world applications. In the past, studies have considered frequency. Unfortunately,
doing so neglects other aspects, such as utility, interest, or risk. Thus, it is sensible to discover
high-utility itemsets (HUIs) in transaction databases while utilizing not only the quantity but
also the predefined utility. To find patterns that can represent the supporting transaction, a
recent study was conducted to mine high utility-occupancy patterns whose contribution to the utility
of the entire transaction is greater than a certain value. Moreover, in realistic applications,
patterns may not exist in transactions but be connected to an existence probability. In this paper,
a novel algorithm, called High-Utility-Occupancy Pattern Mining in Uncertain databases (UHUOPM),
is proposed. The patterns found by the algorithm are called Potential High Utility Occupancy Patterns
(PHUOPs). This algorithm divides user preferences into three factors, including support, probability,
and utility occupancy. To reduce memory cost and time consumption and to prune the search space in
the algorithm as mentioned above, probability-utility-occupancy list (PUO-list) and probability-frequency-utility
table (PFU-table) are used, which assist in providing the downward closure property. Furthermore,
an original tree structure, called support count tree (SC-tree), is constructed as the search space
of the algorithm. Finally, substantial experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance
of proposed UHUOPM algorithm on both real-life and synthetic datasets, particularly in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency.
