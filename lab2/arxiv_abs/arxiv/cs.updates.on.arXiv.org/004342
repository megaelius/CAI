In recent years, due to the trend in globalization, system integrators have had to deal with integrated
circuit (IC)/intellectual property (IP) counterfeiting more than ever. These counterfeit hardware
issues counterfeit hardware that have driven the need for more secure chip authentication. High
entropy random numbers from physical sources are a critical component in authentication and encryption
processes within secure systems [6]. Secure encryption is dependent on sources of truly random
numbers for generating keys, and there is a need for an on chip random number generator to achieve
adequate security. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) adopts a large number of these hardware-based
security and prevention solutions in order to securely exchange data in resource efficient manner.
In this work, we have developed several methodologies of hardware-based random functions in order
to address the issues and enhance the security and trust of ICs: a novel DRAM-based intrinsic Physical
Unclonable Function (PUF) [13] for system level security and authentication along with analysis
of the impact of various environmental conditions, particularly silicon aging; a DRAM remanence
based True Random Number Generation (TRNG) to produce random sequences with a very low overhead;
a DRAM TRNG model using its startup value behavior for creating random bit streams; an efficient
power supply noise based TRNG model for generating an infinite number of random bits which has been
evaluated as a cost effective technique; architectures and hardware security solutions for the
Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Since IoT devices are heavily resource constrained, our
proposed designs can alleviate the concerns of establishing trustworthy and security in an efficient
and low-cost manner.
