In recent years, distinctive-dictionary construction has gained importance due to his usefulness
in data processing. Usually, one or more dictionaries are constructed from a training data and then
they are used to classify signals that did not participate in the training process. A new dictionary
construction algorithm is introduced. It is based on a low-rank matrix factorization being achieved
by the application of the randomized LU decomposition to a training data. This method is fast, scalable,
parallelizable, consumes low memory, outperforms SVD in these categories and works also extremely
well on large sparse matrices. In contrast to existing methods, the randomized LU decomposition
constructs an under-complete dictionary, which simplifies both the construction and the classification
processes of newly arrived signals. The dictionary construction is generic and general that fits
different applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of this algorithm for file type identification,
which is a fundamental task in digital security arena, performed nowadays for example by sandboxing
mechanism, deep packet inspection, firewalls and anti-virus systems. We propose a content-based
method that detects file types that neither depend on file extension nor on metadata. Such approach
is harder to deceive and we show that only a few file fragments from a whole file are needed for a successful
classification. Based on the constructed dictionaries, we show that the proposed method can effectively
identify execution code fragments in PDF files. $\textbf{Keywords.}$ Dictionary construction,
