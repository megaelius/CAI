Peer-to-peer trading in energy networks is expected to be exclusively conducted by the prosumers
of the network with negligible influence from the grid. This raises the critical question: how can
enough prosumers be encouraged to participate in peer-to-peer trading so as to make its operation
sustainable and beneficial to the overall electricity network? To this end, this paper proposes
how a motivational psychology framework can be used effectively to design peer-to-peer energy
trading to increase user participation. To do so, first, the state-of-the-art of peer-to-peer
energy trading literature is discussed by following a systematic classification, and gaps in existing
studies are identified. Second, a motivation psychology framework is introduced, which consists
of a number of motivational models that a prosumer needs to satisfy before being convinced to participate
in energy trading. Third, a game-theoretic peer-to-peer energy trading scheme is developed, its
relevant properties are studied, and it is shown that the coalition among different prosumers is
a stable coalition. Fourth, through numerical case studies, it is shown that the proposed model
can reduce carbon emissions by 18.38% and 9.82% in a single day in Summer and Winter respectively
compared to a feed-in-tariff scheme. The proposed scheme is also shown to reduce the cost of energy
up to 118 cents and 87 cents per day in Summer and Winter respectively. Finally, how the outcomes of
the scheme satisfy all the motivational psychology models is discussed, which subsequently shows
its potential to attract users to participate in energy trading.
