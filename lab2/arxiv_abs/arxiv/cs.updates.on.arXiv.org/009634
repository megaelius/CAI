The emerging theory of graph limits exhibits an analytic perspective on graphs, showing that many
important concepts and tools in graph theory and its applications can be described more naturally
(and sometimes proved more easily) in analytic language. We extend the theory of graph limits to
the ordered setting, presenting a limit object for dense vertex-ordered graphs, which we call an
\emph{orderon}. As a special case, this yields limit objects for matrices whose rows and columns
are ordered, and for dynamic graphs that expand (via vertex insertions) over time. Along the way,
we devise an ordered locality-preserving variant of the cut distance between ordered graphs, showing
that two graphs are close with respect to this distance if and only if they are similar in terms of their
ordered subgraph frequencies. We show that the space of orderons is compact with respect to this
distance notion, which is key to a successful analysis of combinatorial objects through their limits.
We derive several applications of the ordered limit theory in extremal combinatorics, sampling,
and property testing in ordered graphs. In particular, we prove a new ordered analogue of the well-known
result by Alon and Stav [RS\&A'08] on the furthest graph from a hereditary property; this is the first
known result of this type in the ordered setting. Unlike the unordered regime, here the random graph
model $G(n, p)$ with an ordering over the vertices is \emph{not} always asymptotically the furthest
from the property for some $p$. However, using our ordered limit theory, we show that random graphs
generated by a stochastic block model, where the blocks are consecutive in the vertex ordering,
are (approximately) the furthest. Additionally, we describe an alternative analytic proof of
the ordered graph removal lemma [Alon et al., FOCS'17].
