Given a bipartite graph, the maximum balanced biclique (\textsf{MBB}) problem, discovering a
mutually connected while equal-sized disjoint sets with the maximum cardinality, plays a significant
role for mining the bipartite graph and has numerous applications. Despite the NP-hardness of the
\textsf{MBB} problem, in this paper, we show that an exact \textsf{MBB} can be discovered extremely
fast in bipartite graphs for real applications. We propose two exact algorithms dedicated for dense
and sparse bipartite graphs respectively. For dense bipartite graphs, an $\mathcal{O}^{*}( 1.3803^{n})$
algorithm is proposed. This algorithm in fact can find an \textsf{MBB} in near polynomial time for
dense bipartite graphs that are common for applications such as VLSI design. This is because, using
our proposed novel techniques, the search can fast converge to sufficiently dense bipartite graphs
which we prove to be polynomially solvable. For large sparse bipartite graphs typical for applications
such as biological data analysis, an $\mathcal{O}^{*}( 1.3803^{\ddot{\delta}})$ algorithm
is proposed, where $\ddot{\delta}$ is only a few hundreds for large sparse bipartite graphs with
millions of vertices. The indispensible optimizations that lead to this time complexity are: we
transform a large sparse bipartite graph into a limited number of dense subgraphs with size up to
$\ddot{\delta}$ and then apply our proposed algorithm for dense bipartite graphs on each of the
subgraphs. To further speed up this algorithm, tighter upper bounds, faster heuristics and effective
reductions are proposed, allowing an \textsf{MBB} to be discovered within a few seconds for bipartite
graphs with millions of vertices. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real large
bipartite graphs to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and
techniques.
