Objective: Electronic medical records (EMRs) contain an amount of medical knowledge which can
be used for clinical decision support (CDS). Our objective is a general system that can extract and
represent these knowledge contained in EMRs to support three CDS tasks: test recommendation, initial
diagnosis, and treatment plan recommendation, with the given condition of one patient. Methods:
We extracted four kinds of medical entities from records and constructed an EMR-based medical knowledge
network (EMKN), in which nodes are entities and edges reflect their co-occurrence in a single record.
Three bipartite subgraphs (bi-graphs) were extracted from the EMKN to support each task. One part
of the bi-graph was the given condition (e.g., symptoms), and the other was the condition to be inferred
(e.g., diseases). Each bi-graph was regarded as a Markov random field to support the inference.
Three lazy energy functions and one parameter-based energy function were proposed, as well as two
knowledge representation learning-based energy functions, which can provide a distributed representation
of medical entities. Three measures were utilized for performance evaluation. Results: On the
initial diagnosis task, 80.11% of the test records identified at least one correct disease from
top 10 candidates. Test and treatment recommendation results were 87.88% and 92.55%, respectively.
These results altogether indicate that the proposed system outperformed the baseline methods.
The distributed representation of medical entities does reflect similarity relationships in
regards to knowledge level. Conclusion: Combining EMKN and MRF is an effective approach for general
medical knowledge representation and inference. Different tasks, however, require designing
their energy functions individually.
