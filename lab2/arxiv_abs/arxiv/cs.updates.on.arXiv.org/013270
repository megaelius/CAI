Machine learning (ML) methods have the potential to automate clinical EEG analysis. They can be
categorized into feature-based (with handcrafted features), and end-to-end approaches (with
learned features). Previous studies on EEG pathology decoding have typically analyzed a limited
number of features, decoders, or both. For a I) more elaborate feature-based EEG analysis, and II)
in-depth comparisons of both approaches, here we first develop a comprehensive feature-based
framework, and then compare this framework to state-of-the-art end-to-end methods. To this aim,
we apply the proposed feature-based framework and deep neural networks including an EEG-optimized
temporal convolutional network (TCN) to the task of pathological versus non-pathological EEG
classification. For a robust comparison, we chose the Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal
EEG Corpus (v2.0.0), which contains approximately 3000 EEG recordings. The results demonstrate
that the proposed feature-based decoding framework can achieve accuracies on the same level as
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find accuracies across both approaches in an astonishingly
narrow range from 81--86\%. Moreover, visualizations and analyses indicated that both approaches
used similar aspects of the data, e.g., delta and theta band power at temporal electrode locations.
We argue that the accuracies of current binary EEG pathology decoders could saturate near 90\% due
to the imperfect inter-rater agreement of the clinical labels, and that such decoders are already
clinically useful, such as in areas where clinical EEG experts are rare. We make the proposed feature-based
framework available open source and thus offer a new tool for EEG machine learning research.
