In recent years visual object tracking has become a very active research area. An increasing number
of tracking algorithms are being proposed each year. It is because tracking has wide applications
in various real world problems such as human-computer interaction, autonomous vehicles, robotics,
surveillance and security just to name a few. In the current study, we review latest trends and advances
in the tracking area and evaluate the robustness of different trackers based on the feature extraction
methods. The first part of this work comprises a comprehensive survey of the recently proposed trackers.
We broadly categorize trackers into Correlation Filter based Trackers (CFTs) and Non-CFTs. Each
category is further classified into various types based on the architecture and the tracking mechanism.
In the second part, we experimentally evaluated 24 recent trackers for robustness, and compared
handcrafted and deep feature based trackers. We observe that trackers using deep features performed
better, though in some cases a fusion of both increased performance significantly. In order to overcome
the drawbacks of the existing benchmarks, a new benchmark Object Tracking and Temple Color (OTTC)
has also been proposed and used in the evaluation of different algorithms. We analyze the performance
of trackers over eleven different challenges in OTTC, and three other benchmarks. Our study concludes
that Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) based trackers perform better than the others. Our
study also reveals that inclusion of different types of regularizations over DCF often results
in boosted tracking performance. Finally, we sum up our study by pointing out some insights and indicating
future trends in visual object tracking field.
