Labeling data (e.g., labeling the people, objects, actions and scene in images) comprehensively
and efficiently is a widely needed but challenging task. Numerous models were proposed to label
various data and many approaches were designed to enhance the ability of deep learning models or
accelerate them. Unfortunately, a single machine-learning model is not powerful enough to extract
various semantic information from data. Given certain applications, such as image retrieval platforms
and photo album management apps, it is often required to execute a collection of models to obtain
sufficient labels. With limited computing resources and stringent delay, given a data stream and
a collection of applicable resource-hungry deep-learning models, we design a novel approach to
adaptively schedule a subset of these models to execute on each data item, aiming to maximize the
value of the model output (e.g., the number of high-confidence labels). Achieving this lofty goal
is nontrivial since a model's output on any data item is content-dependent and unknown until we execute
it. To tackle this, we propose an Adaptive Model Scheduling framework, consisting of 1) a deep reinforcement
learning-based approach to predict the value of unexecuted models by mining semantic relationship
among diverse models, and 2) two heuristic algorithms to adaptively schedule the model execution
order under a deadline or deadline-memory constraints respectively. The proposed framework doesn't
require any prior knowledge of the data, which works as a powerful complement to existing model optimization
technologies. We conduct extensive evaluations on five diverse image datasets and 30 popular image
labeling models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design: our design could save around 53\%
execution time without loss of any valuable labels.
