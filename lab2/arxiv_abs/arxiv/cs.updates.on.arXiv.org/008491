The effectiveness of biosignal generation and data augmentation with biosignal generative models
based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are a type of deep learning technique, was
demonstrated in our previous paper. GAN-based generative models only learn the projection between
a random distribution as input data and the distribution of training data.Therefore, the relationship
between input and generated data is unclear, and the characteristics of the data generated from
this model cannot be controlled. This study proposes a method for generating time-series data based
on GANs and explores their ability to generate biosignals with certain classes and characteristics.
Moreover, in the proposed method, latent variables are analyzed using canonical correlation analysis
(CCA) to represent the relationship between input and generated data as canonical loadings. Using
these loadings, we can control the characteristics of the data generated by the proposed method.
The influence of class labels on generated data is analyzed by feeding the data interpolated between
two class labels into the generator of the proposed GANs. The CCA of the latent variables is shown
to be an effective method of controlling the generated data characteristics. We are able to model
the distribution of the time-series data without requiring domain-dependent knowledge using
the proposed method. Furthermore, it is possible to control the characteristics of these data by
analyzing the model trained using the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is
the first to generate biosignals using GANs while controlling the characteristics of the generated
data.
