Segmentation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) from Magnetic Resonance (MRI) Images is a crucial
procedure for radiotherapy to improve clinical outcome and reduce radiation-associated toxicity.
It is a time-consuming and label-intensive work for radiologists to manually mark the boundary
of NPC slice by slice. In addition, due to the complex anatomical structure of NPC, automatic algorithms
based on single-modality MRI do not have enough capability to get accurate delineation. To address
the problem of weak distinction between normal adjacent tissues and lesion region in one single
modality MRI, we propose a multi-modality MRI fusion network (MMFNet) to take advantage of three
modalities MRI to realize NPC's segmentation. The backbone is a multi-encoder-based network,
which is composed with several modality-specific encoders and one single decoder. The skip connection
layer is utilized to combine low-level features from different modalities MRI with high-level
features. Additionally, a fusion block is proposed to effectively fuse features from multi-modality
MRI. Specifically speaking, the fusion block firstly highlight informative features and regions
of interest, and then these weighted features will by fused and be further refined by a residual fusion
block. Moreover, a training strategy named self-transfer is proposed to initializing encoders
for multi-encoder-based network, it can stimulate encoders to make full mining of specific modality
MRI. Our proposed framework can effectively make use of multi-modality medical datasets and the
proposed modules such as fusion block and self-transfer can easily generalize to other multi-modality-based
tasks.
