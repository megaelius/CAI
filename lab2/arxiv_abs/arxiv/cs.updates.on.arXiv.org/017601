A k-colouring c of a graph G is a mapping V(G) to {1,2,... k} such that c(u) is distinct from c(v) whenever
u and v are adjacent. The corresponding decision problem is Colouring. A colouring is acyclic, star,
or injective if any two colour classes induce a forest, star forest or disjoint union of vertices
and edges, respectively. Hence, every injective colouring is a star colouring and every star colouring
is an acyclic colouring. The corresponding decision problems are Acyclic Colouring, Star Colouring
and Injective Colouring (the last problem is also known as L(1,1)-Labelling). A classical complexity
result on Colouring is a well-known dichotomy for H-free graphs, which was established twenty years
ago (in this context, a graph is H-free if and only if it does not contain H as an induced subgraph).
Moreover, this result has led to a large collection of results, which helped us to better understand
the complexity of Colouring. In contrast, there is no systematic study into the computational complexity
of the other three problems despite numerous algorithmic and structural results that have appeared
over the years. We initiate such a systematic complexity study, and similar to the study of Colouring
we use the class of H-free graphs as a testbed. We prove: 1. We give almost complete classifications
for the computational complexity of Acyclic Colouring, Star Colouring and Injective Colouring
for H-free graphs. 2. If the number of colours k is fixed, that is, not part of the input, we give full
complexity classifications for each of the three problems for H-free graphs. From our study we conclude
that for fixed k the three problems behave in the same way, but this is no longer true if k is part of the
input. To obtain several of our results we prove stronger complexity results that in particular
involve the girth of a graph and the class of line graphs.
