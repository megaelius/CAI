A general open problem in networking is: what are the fundamental limits to the performance that
is achievable with some given amount of resources? More specifically, if each node in the network
has information about only its $1$-hop neighborhood, then what are the limits to performance? This
problem is considered for wireless networks where each communication link has a minimum bandwidth
quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. Links in the same vicinity contend for the shared wireless
medium. The conflict graph captures which pairs of links interfere with each other and depends on
the MAC protocol. In IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol-based networks, when communication between nodes
$i$ and $j$ takes place, the neighbors of both $i$ and $j$ remain silent. This model of interference
is called the $2$-hop interference model because the distance in the network graph between any two
links that can be simultaneously active is at least $2$. In the admission control problem, the objective
is to determine, using only localized information, whether a given set of flow rates is feasible.
In the present work, a distributed algorithm is proposed for this problem, where each node has information
only about its $1$-hop neighborhood. The worst-case performance of the distributed algorithm,
i.e. the largest factor by which the performance of this distributed algorithm is away from that
of an optimal, centralized algorithm, is analyzed. Lower and upper bounds on the suboptimality
of the distributed algorithm are obtained, and both bounds are shown to be tight. The exact worst-case
performance is obtained for some ring topologies. While distance-$d$ distributed algorithms
have been analyzed for the $1$-hop interference model, an open problem in the literature is to extend
these results to the $K$-hop interference model, and the present work initiates the generalization
to the $K$-hop interference model.
