Left atrial (LA) and atrial scar segmentation from late gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (LGE MRI) is an important task in clinical practice. %, to guide ablation therapy and predict
treatment results for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. The automatic segmentation is however
still challenging, due to the poor image quality, the various LA shapes, the thin wall, and the surrounding
enhanced regions. Previous methods normally solved the two tasks independently and ignored the
intrinsic spatial relationship between LA and scars. In this work, we develop a new framework, namely
AtrialJSQnet, where LA segmentation, scar projection onto the LA surface, and scar quantification
are performed simultaneously in an end-to-end style. We propose a mechanism of shape attention
(SA) via an explicit surface projection, to utilize the inherent correlation between LA and LA scars.
In specific, the SA scheme is embedded into a multi-task architecture to perform joint LA segmentation
and scar quantification. Besides, a spatial encoding (SE) loss is introduced to incorporate continuous
spatial information of the target, in order to reduce noisy patches in the predicted segmentation.
We evaluated the proposed framework on 60 LGE MRIs from the MICCAI2018 LA challenge. Extensive experiments
on a public dataset demonstrated the effect of the proposed AtrialJSQnet, which achieved competitive
performance over the state-of-the-art. The relatedness between LA segmentation and scar quantification
was explicitly explored and has shown significant performance improvements for both tasks. The
code and results will be released publicly once the manuscript is accepted for publication via https://zmiclab.github.io/projects.html.
