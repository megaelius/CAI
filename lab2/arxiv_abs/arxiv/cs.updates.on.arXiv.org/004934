Context: Families of experiments (i.e., groups of experiments with the same goal) are on the rise
in Software Engineering (SE). Selecting unsuitable aggregation techniques to analyze families
may undermine their potential to provide in-depth insights from experiments' results. Objectives:
Identifying the techniques used to aggregate experiments' results within families in SE. Raising
awareness of the importance of applying suitable aggregation techniques to reach reliable conclusions
within families. Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS) to identify the aggregation
techniques used to analyze families of experiments in SE. We outline the advantages and disadvantages
of each aggregation technique according to mature experimental disciplines such as medicine and
pharmacology. We provide preliminary recommendations to analyze and report families of experiments
in view of families' common limitations with regard to joint data analysis. Results: Several aggregation
techniques have been used to analyze SE families of experiments, including Narrative synthesis,
Aggregated Data (AD), Individual Participant Data (IPD) mega-trial or stratified, and Aggregation
of p-values. The rationale used to select aggregation techniques is rarely discussed within families.
Families of experiments are commonly analyzed with unsuitable aggregation techniques according
to the literature of mature experimental disciplines. Conclusion: Data analysis' reporting practices
should be improved to increase the reliability and transparency of joint results. AD and IPD stratified
appear to be suitable to analyze SE families of experiments.
