The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining ground as a pervasive presence around us by enabling miniaturized
things with computation and communication capabilities to collect, process, analyze, and interpret
information. Consequently, trustworthy data act as fuel for applications that rely on the data
generated by these things, for critical decision-making processes, data debugging, risk assessment,
forensic analysis, and performance tuning. Currently, secure and reliable data communication
in IoT is based on public-key cryptosystems such as Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC). Nevertheless,
reliance on the security of de-facto cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by the impending
quantum computers. Therefore, the transition from classical primitives to quantum-safe primitives
is indispensable to ensure the overall security of data en route. In this paper, we investigate applications
of one of the post-quantum signatures called Hash-Based Signature (HBS) schemes for the security
of IoT devices in the quantum era. We give a succinct overview of the evolution of HBS schemes with
emphasis on their construction parameters and associated strengths and weaknesses. Then, we outline
the striking features of HBS schemes and their significance for the IoT security in the quantum era.
We investigate the optimal selection of HBS in the IoT networks with respect to their performance-constrained
requirements, resource-constrained nature, and design optimization objectives. In addition
to ongoing standardization efforts, we also highlight current and future research and deployment
challenges along with possible solutions. Finally, we outline the essential measures and recommendations
that must be adopted by the IoT ecosystem while preparing for the quantum world.
