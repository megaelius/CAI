Recent development of quantitative myocardial blood flow (MBF) mapping allows direct evaluation
of absolute myocardial perfusion, by computing pixel-wise flow maps. Clinical studies suggest
quantitative evaluation would be more desirable for objectivity and efficiency. Objective assessment
can be further facilitated by segmenting the myocardium and automatically generating reports
following the AHA model. This will free user interaction for analysis and lead to a 'one-click' solution
to improve workflow. This paper proposes a deep neural network based computational workflow for
inline myocardial perfusion analysis. Adenosine stress and rest perfusion scans were acquired
from three hospitals. Training set included N=1,825 perfusion series from 1,034 patients. Independent
test set included 200 scans from 105 patients. Data were consecutively acquired at each site. A convolution
neural net (CNN) model was trained to provide segmentation for LV cavity, myocardium and right ventricular
by processing incoming 2D+T perfusion Gd series. Model outputs were compared to manual ground-truth
for accuracy of segmentation and flow measures derived on global and per-sector basis. The trained
models were integrated onto MR scanners for effective inference. Segmentation accuracy and myocardial
flow measures were compared between CNN models and manual ground-truth. The mean Dice ratio of CNN
derived myocardium was 0.93 +/- 0.04. Both global flow and per-sector values showed no significant
difference, compared to manual results. The AHA 16 segment model was automatically generated and
reported on the MR scanner. As a result, the fully automated analysis of perfusion flow mapping was
achieved. This solution was integrated on the MR scanner, enabling 'one-click' analysis and reporting
of myocardial blood flow.
