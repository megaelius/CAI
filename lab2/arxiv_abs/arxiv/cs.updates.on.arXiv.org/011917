Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technique to enhance the wireless communication
spectral efficiency with low hardware and energy cost. In this letter, we consider the integration
of IRS to an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based multiuser downlink communication
system, and study the pertinent joint optimization of the IRS reflection coefficients and OFDMA
time-frequency resource block as well as power allocations to maximize the users' common (minimum)
rate. Specifically, due to the lack of frequency-selective passive beamforming capability at
the IRS, only one set of reflection coefficients can be designed for adapting to a large number of
channels of multiple users over different frequency sub-bands. To tackle this difficulty, we propose
a novel dynamic passive beamforming scheme where the IRS reflection coefficients are dynamically
adjusted over different time slots within each channel coherence block to create artificial time-varying
channels and select only a subset of the users to be simultaneously served in each time slot, thus
achieving a higher passive beamforming gain. Although the formulated optimization problem is
non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to it. Numerical
results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system common rate over the setup
without IRS and that with random IRS reflection coefficients. Moreover, our proposed dynamic passive
beamforming outperforms the fixed passive beamforming which employs a common set of reflection
coefficients in each channel coherence block, by more flexibly balancing between passive beamforming
and multiuser diversity gains.
