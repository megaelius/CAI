Open technologies, decentralized computation and intelligent applications enable the third-generation
web, Web 3.0, thereby digitizing whole industries. The emerging Economy of Things (EoT) will be
based on software agents running on peer-to-peer trustless networks that require a programmable,
regulation conform means of payment. We give an overview of current solutions that differ in their
fundamental values and technological possibilities, like e.g. private-issued stablecoins,
DLT-issued electronic money and genuine cryptocurrencies. Based on this analysis, we present
the concept of justified trust and propose to combine the strengths of the crypto based, decentralized
trustless elements with established and well regulated means of payment, based on this concept,
via a secure external re-balancing interface. Combining the advantages, e.g. lightweight, trustless,
efficient high frequency micro state transfers on the one hand, and ease of use, widely spread, accepted
alignment to a multitude of regulative requirements, on the other hand, while neither leading into
a lock-in in any of the proposed solutions, nor undermining the basic principles of the crypto-movement
or unnecessarily reinforcing the banking system provides a synergy and the necessary flexibility
for further evolution alongside the regulative framework. This offers a regulation conform transitional
solution that can be implemented in the short term, which enables companies to place their decentralized
business operations in a regulated environment. The contribution of our work is twofold: First,
we illustrate and discuss different DLT-operable means of payment. Second, our research proposes
a novel hybrid payment solution by interfacing trustless with justified trust combined generalized
state channels.
