We present an empirical and large-scale analysis of malware samples captured from two different
enterprises from 2017 to early 2018. Particularly, we perform threat vector, social-engineering,
vulnerability and time-series analysis on our dataset. Unlike existing malware studies, our analysis
is specifically focused on the recent enterprise malware samples. First of all, based on our analysis
on the combined datasets of two enterprises, our results confirm the general consensus that AV-only
solutions are not enough for real-time defenses in enterprise settings because on average 40% of
the malware samples, when first appeared, are not detected by most AVs on VirusTotal or not uploaded
to VT at all (i.e., never seen in the wild yet). Moreover, our analysis also shows that enterprise
users transfer documents more than executables and other types of files. Therefore, attackers
embed malicious codes into documents to download and install the actual malicious payload instead
of sending malicious payload directly or using vulnerability exploits. Moreover, we also found
that financial matters (e.g., purchase orders and invoices) are still the most common subject seen
in Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams that aim to trick employees. Finally, based on our analysis
on the timestamps of captured malware samples, we found that 93% of the malware samples were delivered
on weekdays. Our further analysis also showed that while the malware samples that require user interaction
such as macro-based malware samples have been captured during the working hours of the employees,
the massive malware attacks are triggered during the off-times of the employees to be able to silently
spread over the networks.
