Due to the availability of huge amounts of data and processing abilities, current artificial intelligence
(AI) systems are effective at solving complex tasks. However, despite the success of AI in different
areas, the problem of designing AI systems that can truly mimic human cognitive capabilities such
as artificial general intelligence, remains largely open. Consequently, many emerging cross-device
AI applications will require a transition from traditional centralized learning systems towards
large-scale distributed AI systems that can collaboratively perform multiple complex learning
tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel design philosophy called democratized learning (Dem-AI)
whose goal is to build large-scale distributed learning systems that rely on the self-organization
of distributed learning agents that are well-connected, but limited in learning capabilities.
Correspondingly, inspired from the societal groups of humans, the specialized groups of learning
agents in the proposed Dem-AI system are selforganized in a hierarchical structure to collectively
perform learning tasks more efficiently. As such, the Dem-AI learning system can evolve and regulate
itself based on the underlying duality of two processes that we call specialized and generalized
processes. In this regard, we present a reference design as a guideline to realize future Dem-AI
systems, inspired by various interdisciplinary fields. Accordingly, we introduce four underlying
mechanisms in the design such as plasticity-stability transition mechanism, self-organizing
hierarchical structuring, specialized learning, and generalization. Finally, we establish
possible extensions and new challenges for the existing learning approaches to provide better
scalable, flexible, and more powerful learning systems with the new setting of Dem-AI.
