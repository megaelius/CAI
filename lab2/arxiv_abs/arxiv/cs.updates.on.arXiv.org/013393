Despite significant progress in sequencing technology, there are many cellular enzymatic activities
that remain unknown. We develop a new method, referred to as SUNDRY (Similarity-weighting for UNlabeled
Data in a Residual HierarchY), for training enzyme-specific predictors that take as input a query
substrate molecule and return whether the enzyme would act on that substrate or not. When addressing
this enzyme promiscuity prediction problem, a major challenge is the lack of abundant labeled data,
especially the shortage of labeled data for negative cases (enzyme-substrate pairs where the enzyme
does not act to transform the substrate to a product molecule). To overcome this issue, our proposed
method can learn to classify a target enzyme by sharing information from related enzymes via known
tree hierarchies. Our method can also incorporate three types of data: those molecules known to
be catalyzed by an enzyme (positive cases), those with unknown relationships (unlabeled cases),
and molecules labeled as inhibitors for the enzyme. We refer to inhibitors as hard negative cases
because they may be difficult to classify well: they bind to the enzyme, like positive cases, but
are not transformed by the enzyme. Our method uses confidence scores derived from structural similarity
to treat unlabeled examples as weighted negatives. We compare our proposed hierarchy-aware predictor
against a baseline that cannot share information across related enzymes. Using data from the BRENDA
database, we show that each of our contributions (hierarchical sharing, per-example confidence
weighting of unlabeled data based on molecular similarity, and including inhibitors as hard-negative
examples) contributes towards a better characterization of enzyme promiscuity.
