Given an $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph $G$ with non negative edge-weights, the girth of $G$ is the weight
of a shortest cycle in $G$. For any graph $G$ with polynomially bounded integer weights, we present
a deterministic algorithm that computes, in $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3}+m)$-time, a cycle of weight
at most twice the girth of $G$. Our approach combines some new insights on the previous approximation
algorithms for this problem (Lingas and Lundell, IPL'09; Roditty and Tov, TALG'13) with Hitting
Set based methods that are used for approximate distance oracles and date back from (Thorup and Zwick,
JACM'05). Then, we turn our algorithm into a deterministic $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation
for graphs with arbitrary non negative edge-weights, at the price of a slightly worse running-time
in $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3}\log^{{\cal O}(1)}{(1/\varepsilon)}+m)$. Finally, if we insist
in removing the dependency in the number $m$ of edges, we can transform our algorithms into an $\tilde{\cal
O}(n^{5/3})$-time randomized $4$-approximation for the graphs with non negative edge-weights
-- assuming the adjacency lists are sorted. Combined with the aforementioned Hitting Set based
methods, this algorithm can be derandomized, thereby yielding an $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3})$-time
deterministic $4$-approximation for the graphs with polynomially bounded integer weights, and
an $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3}\log^{{\cal O}(1)}{(1/\varepsilon)})$-time deterministic $(4+\varepsilon)$-approximation
for the graphs with non negative edge-weights. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first known
subquadratic-time approximation algorithms for computing the girth of weighted graphs.
