Intelligent connected vehicles equipped with wireless sensors, intelligent control system,
and communication devices are expected to commercially launch and emerge on road in short-term.
These smart vehicles are able to partially/fully drive themselves; collect data from sensors,
make and execute decisions based on that data; communicate with other vehicles, pedestrians, and
nodes installed on the road; and provide infotainment and value-added services, such as broadband
transmission of ultra-high definition video, files/apps downloading and uploading, online gaming,
access to social media, audio/video conference streaming (office-in-car), live TV streaming,
etc.; and so on. In addition, it is also possible for autonomous vehicles to form a "platoon" on road;
maintaining close proximity in order to reduce the consumption of fuel and/or emission of gas, decrease
costs, increase safety, and enhance the efficiency of the legacy transportation system. These
emerging vehicular applications demand a large amount of computing and communication capacity
to excel in their compute-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks. Based on these facts, the authors
of this paper presented a visionary concept -- "platoon-assisted vehicular cloud" -- that exploits
underutilized resources in platoons to augment vehicular cloud aiming to provide cost-effective
and on-demand computing resources. Moreover, the authors presented three potential scenarios
and explained the exploitation of platoon resources and roadside infrastructure to facilitate
new applications. Besides system design, the paper did also summarize a number of open research
challenges with the purpose of motivating new advances and potential solutions to this field.
