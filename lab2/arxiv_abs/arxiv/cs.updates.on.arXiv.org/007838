Imitation learning is a control design paradigm that seeks to learn a control policy reproducing
demonstrations from expert agents. By substituting expert demonstrations for optimal behaviours,
the same paradigm leads to the design of control policies closely approximating the optimal state-feedback.
This approach requires training a machine learning algorithm (in our case deep neural networks)
directly on state-control pairs originating from optimal trajectories. We have shown in previous
work that, when restricted to low-dimensional state and control spaces, this approach is very successful
in several deterministic, non-linear problems in continuous-time. In this work, we refine our
previous studies using as a test case a simple quadcopter model with quadratic and time-optimal
objective functions. We describe in detail the best learning pipeline we have developed, that is
able to approximate via deep neural networks the state-feedback map to a very high accuracy. We introduce
the use of the softplus activation function in the hidden units of neural networks showing that it
results in a smoother control profile whilst retaining the benefits of rectifiers. We show how to
evaluate the optimality of the trained state-feedback, and find that already with two layers the
objective function reached and its optimal value differ by less than one percent. We later consider
also an additional metric linked to the system asymptotic behaviour - time taken to converge to the
policy's fixed point. With respect to these metrics, we show that improvements in the mean absolute
error do not necessarily correspond to better policies.
