Background: The use of clinical trial registries to signal when systematic reviews become out of
date has been limited due to the manual effort required to identify relevant trials. Our aim was to
evaluate a new method that could partially automate the identification of trials relevant to a systematic
review update. Methods: We identified 179 systematic reviews of drug interventions for type 2 diabetes,
linked to 537 trial registrations in ClinicalTrials.gov. Text from the registrations were used
as features or transformed using latent Dirichlet allocation or principal component analysis.
We tested a shared latent space matrix factorisation method to learn how to rank trial registrations
for each systematic review, and compared its performance to baselines that used document similarity.
The approaches were tested on a holdout set of trials from the set of type 2 diabetes systematic reviews,
and on a set of 17 systematic reviews with updates sourced from the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews, linked to 141 clinical trial registrations. The performance was measured by the median
rank of relevant trial registrations in the ranked candidate lists and by the number of relevant
trial registrations found after examining 100 candidates (recall@100). Results: The matrix factorisation
approach outperformed the document similarity approach with a median rank of 36 (of 128,392 candidate
registrations in ClinicalTrials.gov) and recall@100 of 75.2%, compared to a median rank of 60 and
recall@100 of 60.2% in the document similarity baseline. In the set of systematic reviews and their
updates, the highest performing approach used document similarity (median rank 67; recall@100
62.9%). Conclusions: A shared latent space matrix factorisation method was useful for ranking
trial registrations to reduce the manual workload associated with finding relevant trials for
systematic review updates.
