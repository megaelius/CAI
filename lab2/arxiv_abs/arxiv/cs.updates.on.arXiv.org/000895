Bioclimate-driven regression analysis is a widely used approach for modelling ecological niches
and zonation. Although the bioclimatic complexity of the European continent is high, a particular
combination of 12 climatic and topographic covariates was recently found able to reliably reproduce
the ecological zoning of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for forest
resources assessment at pan-European scale, generating the first fuzzy similarity map of FAO ecozones
in Europe. The reproducible procedure followed to derive this collection of bioclimatic indices
is now presented. It required an integration of data-transformation modules (D-TM) using geospatial
tools such as Geographic Information System (GIS) software, and array-based mathematical implementation
such as semantic array programming (SemAP). Base variables, intermediate and final covariates
are described and semantically defined by providing the workflow of D-TMs and the mathematical
formulation following the SemAP notation. Source layers to derive base variables were extracted
by exclusively relying on global-scale public open geodata in order for the same set of bioclimatic
covariates to be reproducible in any region worldwide. In particular, two freely available datasets
were exploited for temperature and precipitation (WorldClim) and elevation (Global Multi-resolution
Terrain Elevation Data). The working extent covers the European continent to the Urals with a resolution
of 30 arc-second. The proposed set of bioclimatic covariates will be made available as open data
in the European Forest Data Centre (EFDAC). The forthcoming complete set of D-TM codelets will enable
the 12 covariates to be easily reproduced and expanded through free software.
