We present a systematic global sensitivity analysis using the Sobol method which can be utilized
to rank the variables that affect two quantity of interests -- pore pressure depletion and stress
change -- around a hydraulically-fractured horizontal well based on their degree of importance.
These variables include rock properties and stimulation design variables. A fully-coupled poroelastic
hydraulic fracture model is used to account for pore pressure and stress changes due to production.
To ease the computational cost of a simulator, we also provide reduced order models (ROMs), which
can be used to replace the complex numerical model with a rather simple analytical model, for calculating
the pore pressure and stresses at different locations around hydraulic fractures. The main findings
of this research are: (i) mobility, production pressure, and fracture half-length are the main
contributors to the changes in the quantities of interest. The percentage of the contribution of
each parameter depends on the location with respect to pre-existing hydraulic fractures and the
quantity of interest. (ii) As the time progresses, the effect of mobility decreases and the effect
of production pressure increases. (iii) These two variables are also dominant for horizontal stresses
at large distances from hydraulic fractures. (iv) At zones close to hydraulic fracture tips or inside
the spacing area, other parameters such as fracture spacing and half-length are the dominant factors
that affect the minimum horizontal stress. The results of this study will provide useful guidelines
for the stimulation design of legacy wells and secondary operations such as refracturing and infill
drilling.
