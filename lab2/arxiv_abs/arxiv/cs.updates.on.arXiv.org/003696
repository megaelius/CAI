The right to protest is perceived as one of the primary civil rights. Citizens participate in mass
demonstrations to express themselves and exercise their democratic rights. However, because
of the large number of participants, protests may lead to violence and destruction, and hence can
be costly. Thus, it is important to predict such demonstrations in advance to safeguard against
such damages. Recent research has shown that about 75 percent of protests that are regarded as legal,
are planned in advance. Twitter, the prominent micro-blogging website, has been used as a tool by
protestors for planning, organizing, and announcing many of the recent protests worldwide such
as those that led to the Arab Spring, Britain riots, and those against Mr. Trump after the presidential
election in the U.S. In this paper, we aim to predict protests by means of machine learning algorithms.
In particular, we consider the case of protests against the then-president-elect Mr. Trump after
the results of the presidential election were announced in November 2016. We first identify the
hashtags calling for demonstration from Trending Topics on Twitter, and download the corresponding
tweets. We then apply four machine learning algorithms to make predictions. Our findings indicate
that Twitter can be used as a powerful tool for predicting future protests with an average prediction
accuracy of over 75 percent (up to 100 percent). We further validate our model by predicting the protests
held in the U.S. airports after President Trump's executive order banning citizens of seven Muslim
countries from entering the U.S. An important contribution of our study is the inclusion of event
specific features for prediction purposes which helps to achieve high levels of accuracy.
