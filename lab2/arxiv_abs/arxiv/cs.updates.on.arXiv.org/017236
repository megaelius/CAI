Timely access to accurate scientific literature in the battle with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
is critical. This unprecedented public health risk has motivated research towards understanding
the disease in general, identifying drugs to treat the disease, developing potential vaccines,
etc. This has given rise to a rapidly growing body of literature that doubles in number of publications
every 20 days as of May 2020. Providing medical professionals with means to quickly analyze the literature
and discover growing areas of knowledge is necessary for addressing their question and information
needs. In this study we analyze the LitCovid collection, 13,369 COVID-19 related articles found
in PubMed as of May 15th, 2020 with the purpose of examining the landscape of literature and presenting
it in a format that facilitates information navigation and understanding. We do that by applying
state-of-the-art named entity recognition, classification, clustering and other NLP techniques.
By applying NER tools, we capture relevant bioentities (such as diseases, internal body organs,
etc.) and assess the strength of their relationship with COVID-19 by the extent they are discussed
in the corpus. We also collect a variety of symptoms and co-morbidities discussed in reference to
COVID-19. Our clustering algorithm identifies topics represented by groups of related terms,
and computes clusters corresponding to documents associated with the topic terms. Among the topics
we observe several that persist through the duration of multiple weeks and have numerous associated
documents, as well several that appear as emerging topics with fewer documents. All the tools and
data are publicly available, and this framework can be applied to any literature collection. Taken
together, these analyses produce a comprehensive, synthesized view of COVID-19 research to facilitate
knowledge discovery from literature.
