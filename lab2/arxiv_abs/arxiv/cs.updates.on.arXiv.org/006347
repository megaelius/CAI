Recent developments in intelligent transport systems (ITS) based on smart mobility significantly
improves safety and security over roads and highways. ITS networks are comprised of the Internet-connected
vehicles (mobile nodes), roadside units (RSU), cellular base stations and conventional core network
routers to create a complete data transmission platform that provides real-time traffic information
and enable prediction of future traffic conditions. However, the heterogeneity and complexity
of the underlying ITS networks raise new challenges in intrusion prevention of mobile network nodes
and detection of security attacks due to such highly vulnerable mobile nodes. In this paper, we consider
a new type of security attack referred to as crossfire attack, which involves a large number of compromised
nodes that generate low-intensity traffic in a temporally coordinated fashion such that target
links or hosts (victims) are disconnected from the rest of the network. Detection of such attacks
is challenging since the attacking traffic flows are indistinguishable from the legitimate flows.
With the support of software-defined networking that enables dynamic network monitoring and traffic
characteristic extraction, we develop a machine learning model that can learn the temporal correlation
among traffic flows traversing in the ITS network, thus differentiating legitimate flows from
coordinated attacking flows. We use different deep learning algorithms to train the model and study
the performance using Mininet-WiFi emulation platform. The results show that our approach achieves
a detection accuracy of at least 80%.
