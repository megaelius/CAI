Industry 4.0 is the latest industrial revolution primarily merging automation with advanced manufacturing
to reduce human effort and resources. Predictive maintenance (PdM) is an industry 4.0 solution,
which facilitates predicting faults in a component or a system powered by state-of-the-art machine
learning (ML) algorithms (especially deep learning) and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors.
However, IoT sensors and deep learning (DL) algorithms, both are known for their vulnerabilities
to cyber-attacks. In the context of PdM systems, such attacks can have catastrophic consequences
as they are hard to detect. To date, the majority of the published literature focuses on the accuracy
of the IoT and DL enabled PdM systems and often ignores the effect of such attacks. In this paper, we
demonstrate the effect of IoT sensor attacks (in the form of false data injection attack) on a PdM
system. At first, we use three state-of-the-art DL algorithms, specifically, Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting
the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a turbofan engine using NASA's C-MAPSS dataset. Our obtained
results show that the GRU-based PdM model outperforms some of the recent literature on RUL prediction
using the C-MAPSS dataset. Afterward, we model and apply two different types of false data injection
attacks (FDIA) on turbofan engine sensor data and evaluate their impact on CNN, LSTM, and GRU-based
PdM systems. Our results demonstrate that attacks on even a small number of IoT sensors can strongly
defect the RUL prediction. However, the GRU-based PdM model performs better in terms of accuracy
and resiliency. Lastly, we perform a study on the GRU-based PdM model using four different GRU networks.
Our experiments reveal an interesting relationship between the accuracy, resiliency and sequence
length for the GRU-based PdM models.
