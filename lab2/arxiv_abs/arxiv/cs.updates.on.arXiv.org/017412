Background: Machine learning methods offer great potential for fast and accurate detection and
prognostication of COVID-19 from standard-of-care chest radiographs (CXR) and computed tomography
(CT) images. In this systematic review we critically evaluate the machine learning methodologies
employed in the rapidly growing literature. Methods: In this systematic review we reviewed EMBASE
via OVID, MEDLINE via PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv for published papers and preprints uploaded
from Jan 1, 2020 to June 24, 2020. Studies which consider machine learning models for the diagnosis
or prognosis of COVID-19 from CXR or CT images were included. A methodology quality review of each
paper was performed against established benchmarks to ensure the review focusses only on high-quality
reproducible papers. This study is registered with PROSPERO [CRD42020188887]. Interpretation:
Our review finds that none of the developed models discussed are of potential clinical use due to
methodological flaws and underlying biases. This is a major weakness, given the urgency with which
validated COVID-19 models are needed. Typically, we find that the documentation of a model's development
is not sufficient to make the results reproducible and therefore of 168 candidate papers only 29
are deemed to be reproducible and subsequently considered in this review. We therefore encourage
authors to use established machine learning checklists to ensure sufficient documentation is
made available, and to follow the PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) framework
to determine the underlying biases in their model development process and to mitigate these where
possible. This is key to safe clinical implementation which is urgently needed.
