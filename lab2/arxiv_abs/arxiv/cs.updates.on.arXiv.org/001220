Recently, a secrecy measure based on list-reconstruction has been proposed [2], in which a wiretapper
is allowed to produce a list of $2^{mR_{L}}$ reconstruction sequences and the secrecy is measured
by the minimum distortion over the entire list. In this paper, we show that this list secrecy problem
is equivalent to the one with secrecy measured by a new quantity \emph{lossy-equivocation}, which
is proven to be the minimum optimistic 1-achievable source coding rate (the minimum coding rate
needed to reconstruct the source within target distortion with positive probability for \emph{infinitely
many blocklengths}) of the source with the wiretapped signal as two-sided information, and also
can be seen as a lossy extension of conventional equivocation. Upon this (or list) secrecy measure,
we study source-channel secrecy problem in the discrete memoryless Shannon cipher system with
\emph{noisy} wiretap channel. Two inner bounds and an outer bound on the achievable region of secret
key rate, list rate, wiretapper distortion, and distortion of legitimate user are given. The inner
bounds are derived by using uncoded scheme and (operationally) separate scheme, respectively.
Thanks to the equivalence between lossy-equivocation secrecy and list secrecy, information spectrum
method is leveraged to prove the outer bound. As special cases, the admissible region for the case
of degraded wiretap channel or lossless communication for legitimate user has been characterized
completely. For both these two cases, separate scheme is proven to be optimal. Interestingly, however,
separation indeed suffers performance loss for other certain cases. Besides, we also extend our
results to characterize the achievable region for Gaussian communication case. As a side product
optimistic lossy source coding has also been addressed.
