We have designed and tested a parallel 8-bit ERSFQ binary shifter that is one of the essential circuits
in the design of the energy-efficient superconducting CPU. The binary shifter performs a bi-directional
SHIFT instruction of an 8-bit argument. It consists of a bi-direction triple-port shift register
controlled by two (left and right) shift pulse generators asynchronously generating a set number
of shift pulses. At first clock cycle, an 8-bit word is loaded into the binary shifter and a 3-bit shift
argument is loaded into the desired shift-pulse generator. Next, the generator produces the required
number of shift SFQ pulses (from 0 to 7) asynchronously, with a repetition rate set by the internal
generator delay of ~ 30 ps. These SFQ pulses are applied to the left (positive) or the right (negative)
input of the binary shifter. Finally, after the shift operation is completed, the resulting 8-bit
word goes to the parallel output. The complete 8-bit ERSFQ binary shifter, consisting of 820 Josephson
junctions, was simulated and optimized using PSCAN2. It was fabricated in MIT Lincoln Lab 10-kA/cm2
SFQ5ee fabrication process with a high-kinetic inductance layer. We have successfully tested
the binary shifter at both the LSB-to-MSB and MSB-to-LSB propagation regimes for all eight shift
arguments. A single shift operation on a single input word demonstrated operational margins of
+/-16% of the dc bias current. The correct functionality of the 8-bit ERSFQ binary shifter with the
large, exhaustive data pattern was observed within +/-10% margins of the dc bias current. In this
paper, we describe the design and present the test results for the ERSFQ 8-bit parallel binary shifter.
