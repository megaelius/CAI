To collectively forecast the demand for ride-sourcing services in all regions of a city, the deep
learning approaches have been applied with commendable results. However, the local statistical
differences throughout the geographical layout of the city make the spatial stationarity assumption
of the convolution invalid, which limits the performance of CNNs on the demand forecasting task.
In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework called LC-ST-FCN (locally connected spatiotemporal
fully-convolutional neural network) to address the unique challenges of the region-level demand
forecasting problem within one end-to-end architecture (E2E). We first employ the 3D convolutional
layers to fuse the spatial and temporal information existed in the input and then feed the spatiotemporal
features extracted by the 3D convolutional layers to the subsequent 2D convolutional layers. Afterward,
the prediction value of each region is obtained by the locally connected convolutional layers which
relax the parameter sharing scheme. We evaluate the proposed model on a real dataset from a ride-sourcing
service platform (DiDiChuxing) and observe significant improvements compared with a bunch of
baseline models. Besides, we also illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by visualizing
how different types of convolutional layers transform their input and capture useful features.
The visualization results show that fully convolutional architecture enables the model to better
localize the related regions. And the locally connected layers play an important role in dealing
with the local statistical differences and activating useful regions.
