With the growing popularity of shared resources, large volumes of complex data of different types
are collected automatically. Traditional data mining algorithms generally have problems and
challenges including huge memory cost, low processing speed, and inadequate hard disk space. As
a fundamental task of data mining, sequential pattern mining (SPM) is used in a wide variety of real-life
applications. However, it is more complex and challenging than other pattern mining tasks, i.e.,
frequent itemset mining and association rule mining, and also suffers from the above challenges
when handling the large-scale data. To solve these problems, mining sequential patterns in a parallel
or distributed computing environment has emerged as an important issue with many applications.
In this paper, an in-depth survey of the current status of parallel sequential pattern mining (PSPM)
is investigated and provided, including detailed categorization of traditional serial SPM approaches,
and state of the art parallel SPM. We review the related work of parallel sequential pattern mining
in detail, including partition-based algorithms for PSPM, Apriori-based PSPM, pattern growth
based PSPM, and hybrid algorithms for PSPM, and provide deep description (i.e., characteristics,
advantages, disadvantages and summarization) of these parallel approaches of PSPM. Some advanced
topics for PSPM, including parallel quantitative / weighted / utility sequential pattern mining,
PSPM from uncertain data and stream data, hardware acceleration for PSPM, are further reviewed
in details. Besides, we review and provide some well-known open-source software of PSPM. Finally,
we summarize some challenges and opportunities of PSPM in the big data era.
