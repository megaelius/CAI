We study the algorithmic properties of the graph class Chordal-ke, that is, graphs that can be turned
into a chordal graph by adding at most k edges or, equivalently, the class of graphs of fill-in at most
k. We discover that a number of fundamental intractable optimization problems being parameterized
by k admit subexponential algorithms on graphs from Chordal-ke. We identify a large class of optimization
problems on Chordal-ke that admit algorithms with the typical running time 2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log
k)}\cdot n^{O(1)}. Examples of the problems from this class are finding an independent set of maximum
weight, finding a feedback vertex set or an odd cycle transversal of minimum weight, or the problem
of finding a maximum induced planar subgraph. On the other hand, we show that for some fundamental
optimization problems, like finding an optimal graph coloring or finding a maximum clique, are
FPT on Chordal-ke when parameterized by k but do not admit subexponential in k algorithms unless
ETH fails. Besides subexponential time algorithms, the class of Chordal-ke graphs appears to be
appealing from the perspective of kernelization (with parameter k). While it is possible to show
that most of the weighted variants of optimization problems do not admit polynomial in k kernels
on Chordal-ke graphs, this does not exclude the existence of Turing kernelization and kernelization
for unweighted graphs. In particular, we construct a polynomial Turing kernel for Weighted Clique
on Chordal-ke graphs. For (unweighted) Independent Set we design polynomial kernels on two interesting
subclasses of Chordal-ke, namely, Interval-ke and Split-ke graphs.
