Let ${\cal F}$ be a family of graphs. In the ${\cal F}$-Completion problem, we are given a graph $G$
and an integer $k$ as input, and asked whether at most $k$ edges can be added to $G$ so that the resulting
graph does not contain a graph from ${\cal F}$ as an induced subgraph. It appeared recently that special
cases of ${\cal F}$-Completion, the problem of completing into a chordal graph known as Minimum
Fill-in, corresponding to the case of ${\cal F}=\{C_4,C_5,C_6,\ldots\}$, and the problem of completing
into a split graph, i.e., the case of ${\cal F}=\{C_4, 2K_2, C_5\}$, are solvable in parameterized
subexponential time $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log{k})}n^{O(1)}$. The exploration of this phenomenon
is the main motivation for our research on ${\cal F}$-Completion. In this paper we prove that completions
into several well studied classes of graphs without long induced cycles also admit parameterized
subexponential time algorithms by showing that: - The problem Trivially Perfect Completion is
solvable in parameterized subexponential time $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log{k})}n^{O(1)}$, that is ${\cal
F}$-Completion for ${\cal F} =\{C_4, P_4\}$, a cycle and a path on four vertices. - The problems known
in the literature as Pseudosplit Completion, the case where ${\cal F} = \{2K_2, C_4\}$, and Threshold
Completion, where ${\cal F} = \{2K_2, P_4, C_4\}$, are also solvable in time $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log{k})}
n^{O(1)}$. We complement our algorithms for ${\cal F}$-Completion with the following lower bounds:
- For ${\cal F} = \{2K_2\}$, ${\cal F} = \{C_4\}$, ${\cal F} = \{P_4\}$, and ${\cal F} = \{2K_2, P_4\}$,
${\cal F}$-Completion cannot be solved in time $2^{o(k)} n^{O(1)}$ unless the Exponential Time
Hypothesis (ETH) fails. Our upper and lower bounds provide a complete picture of the subexponential
parameterized complexity of ${\cal F}$-Completion problems for ${\cal F}\subseteq\{2K_2, C_4,
P_4\}$.
