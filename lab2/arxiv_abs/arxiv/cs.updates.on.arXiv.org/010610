Context: When an application evolves, some of the developed test cases break. Discarding broken
test cases causes a significant waste of effort and leads to test suites that are less effective and
have lower coverage. Test repair approaches evolve test suites along with applications by repairing
the broken test cases. Objective: Numerous studies are published on test repair approaches every
year. It is important to summarise and consolidate the existing knowledge in the area to provide
directions to researchers and practitioners. This research work provides a systematic literature
review in the area of test case repair and breakage prevention, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners
in the field of software testing. Method: We followed the standard protocol for conducting a systematic
literature review. First, research goals were defined using the Goal Question Metric (GQM). Then
we formulate research questions corresponding to each goal. Finally, metrics are extracted from
the included papers. Based on the defined selection criteria a final set of 41 primary studies are
included for analysis. Results: The selection process resulted in 5 journal papers, and 36 conference
papers. We present a taxonomy that lists the causes of test case breakages extracted from the literature.
We found that only four proposed test repair tools are publicly available. Most studies evaluated
their approaches on open-source case studies. Conclusion: There is significant room for future
research on test repair techniques. Despite the positive trend of evaluating approaches on large
scale open-source studies, there is a clear lack of results from studies done in a real industrial
context. Few tools are publicly available which lowers the potential of adaption by industry practitioners.
