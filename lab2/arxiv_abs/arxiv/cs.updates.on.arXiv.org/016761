Arrow's Theorem concerns a fundamental problem in social choice theory: given the individual preferences
of members of a group, how can they be aggregated to form rational group preferences? Arrow showed
that in an election between three or more candidates, there are situations where any voting rule
satisfying a small list of natural "fairness" axioms must produce an apparently irrational intransitive
outcome. Furthermore, quantitative versions of Arrow's Theorem in the literature show that when
voters choose rankings in an i.i.d.\ fashion, the outcome is intransitive with non-negligible
probability. It is natural to ask if such a quantitative version of Arrow's Theorem holds for non-i.i.d.\
models. To answer this question, we study Arrow's Theorem under a natural non-i.i.d.\ model of voters
inspired by canonical models in statistical physics; indeed, a version of this model was previously
introduced by Raffaelli and Marsili in the physics literature. This model has a parameter, temperature,
that prescribes the correlation between different voters. We show that the behavior of Arrow's
Theorem in this model undergoes a striking phase transition: in the entire high temperature regime
of the model, a Quantitative Arrow's Theorem holds showing that the probability of paradox for any
voting rule satisfying the axioms is non-negligible; this is tight because the probability of paradox
under pairwise majority goes to zero when approaching the critical temperature, and becomes exponentially
small in the number of voters beyond it. We prove this occurs in another natural model of correlated
voters and conjecture this phenomena is quite general.
