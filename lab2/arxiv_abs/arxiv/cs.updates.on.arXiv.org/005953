It is challenging to design a high speed tracking approach using l1-norm due to its non-differentiability.
In this paper, a new kernelized correlation filter is introduced by leveraging the sparsity attribute
of l1-norm based regularization to design a high speed tracker. We combine the l1-norm and l2-norm
based regularizations in one Huber-type loss function, and then formulate an optimization problem
in the Fourier Domain for fast computation, which enables the tracker to adaptively ignore the noisy
features produced from occlusion and illumination variation, while keep the advantages of l2-norm
based regression. This is achieved due to the attribute of Convolution Theorem that the correlation
in spatial domain corresponds to an element-wise product in the Fourier domain, resulting in that
the l1-norm optimization problem could be decomposed into multiple sub-optimization spaces in
the Fourier domain. But the optimized variables in the Fourier domain are complex, which makes using
the l1-norm impossible if the real and imaginary parts of the variables cannot be separated. However,
our proposed optimization problem is formulated in such a way that their real part and imaginary
parts are indeed well separated. As such, the proposed optimization problem can be solved efficiently
to obtain their optimal values independently with closed-form solutions. Extensive experiments
on two large benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm significantly
improves the tracking accuracy of the original kernelized correlation filter (KCF) while with
little sacrifice on tracking speed. Moreover, it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches
in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.
