A word $x$ that is absent from a word $y$ is called minimal if all its proper factors occur in $y$. Given
a collection of $k$ words $y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_k$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, we are asked to compute
the set $\mathrm{M}^{\ell}_{y_{1}\#\ldots\#y_{k}}$ of minimal absent words of length at most
$\ell$ of word $y=y_1\#y_2\#\ldots\#y_k$, $\#\notin\Sigma$. In data compression, this corresponds
to computing the antidictionary of $k$ documents. In bioinformatics, it corresponds to computing
words that are absent from a genome of $k$ chromosomes. This computation generally requires $\Omega(n)$
space for $n=|y|$ using any of the plenty available $\mathcal{O}(n)$-time algorithms. This is
because an $\Omega(n)$-sized text index is constructed over $y$ which can be impractical for large
$n$. We do the identical computation incrementally using output-sensitive space. This goal is
reasonable when $||\mathrm{M}^{\ell}_{y_{1}\#\ldots\#y_{N}}||=o(n)$, for all $N\in[1,k]$.
For instance, in the human genome, $n \approx 3\times 10^9$ but $||\mathrm{M}^{12}_{y_{1}\#\ldots\#y_{k}}||
\approx 10^6$. We consider a constant-sized alphabet for stating our results. We show that all $\mathrm{M}^{\ell}_{y_{1}},\ldots,\mathrm{M}^{\ell}_{y_{1}\#\ldots\#y_{k}}$
can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(kn+\sum^{k}_{N=1}||\mathrm{M}^{\ell}_{y_{1}\#\ldots\#y_{N}}||)$
total time using $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{MaxIn}+\mathrm{MaxOut})$ space, where $\mathrm{MaxIn}$
is the length of the longest word in $\{y_1,\ldots,y_{k}\}$ and $\mathrm{MaxOut}=\max\{||\mathrm{M}^{\ell}_{y_{1}\#\ldots\#y_{N}}||:N\in[1,k]\}$.
Proof-of-concept experimental results are also provided confirming our theoretical findings
and justifying our contribution.
