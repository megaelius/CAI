Scattered trees outside of dense, closed-canopy forests are very important for carbon sequestration,
supporting livelihoods, maintaining ecosystem integrity, and climate change adaptation and
mitigation. In contrast to trees inside of closed-canopy forests, not much is known about the spatial
extent and distribution of scattered trees at a global scale. Due to the cost of high-resolution
satellite imagery, global monitoring systems rely on medium-resolution satellites to monitor
land use. Here we present a globally consistent method to identify trees with canopy diameters greater
than three meters with medium-resolution optical and radar imagery. Biweekly cloud-free, pan-sharpened
10 meter Sentinel-2 optical imagery and Sentinel-1 radar imagery are used to train a fully convolutional
network, consisting of a convolutional gated recurrent unit layer and a feature pyramid attention
layer. Tested across more than 215,000 Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 pixels distributed from -60 to
+60 latitude, the proposed model exceeds 75% user's and producer's accuracy identifying trees
in hectares with a low to medium density (less than 40%) of tree cover, and 95% user's and producer's
accuracy in hectares with dense (greater than 40%) tree cover. The proposed method increases the
accuracy of monitoring tree presence in areas with sparse and scattered tree cover (less than 40%)
by as much as 20%, and reduces commission and omission error in mountainous and very cloudy regions
by nearly half. When applied across large, heterogeneous landscapes, the results demonstrate
potential to map trees in high detail and accuracy over diverse landscapes across the globe. This
information is important for understanding current land cover and can be used to detect changes
in land cover such as agroforestry, buffer zones around biological hotspots, and expansion or encroachment
of forests.
