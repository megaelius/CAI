We present a novel approach to optimally retarget videos for varied displays with differing aspect
ratios by preserving salient scene content discovered via eye tracking. Our algorithm performs
editing with cut, pan and zoom operations by optimizing the path of a cropping window within the original
video while seeking to (i) preserve salient regions, and (ii) adhere to the principles of cinematography.
Our approach is (a) content agnostic as the same methodology is employed to re-edit a wide-angle
video recording or a close-up movie sequence captured with a static or moving camera, and (b) independent
of video length and can in principle re-edit an entire movie in one shot. Our algorithm consists of
two steps. The first step employs gaze transition cues to detect time stamps where new cuts are to
be introduced in the original video via dynamic programming. A subsequent step optimizes the cropping
window path (to create pan and zoom effects), while accounting for the original and new cuts. The
cropping window path is designed to include maximum gaze information, and is composed of piecewise
constant, linear and parabolic segments. It is obtained via L(1) regularized convex optimization
which ensures a smooth viewing experience. We test our approach on a wide variety of videos and demonstrate
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art, both in terms of computational complexity
and qualitative aspects. A study performed with 16 users confirms that our approach results in a
superior viewing experience as compared to gaze driven re-editing and letterboxing methods, especially
for wide-angle static camera recordings.
