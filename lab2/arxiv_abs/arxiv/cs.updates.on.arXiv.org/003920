This paper proposes a novel user cooperation approach in both computation and communication for
mobile edge computing (MEC) systems to improve the energy efficiency for latency-constrained
computation. We consider a basic three-node MEC system consisting of a user node, a helper node,
and an access point (AP) node attached with an MEC server, in which the user has latency-constrained
and computation-intensive tasks to be executed. We consider two different computation offloading
models, namely the partial and binary offloading, respectively. Under this setup, we focus on a
particular finite time block and develop an efficient four-slot transmission protocol to enable
the joint computation and communication cooperation. Besides the local task computing over the
whole block, the user can offload some computation tasks to the helper in the first slot, and the helper
cooperatively computes these tasks in the remaining time; while in the second and third slots, the
helper works as a cooperative relay to help the user offload some other tasks to the AP for remote execution
in the fourth slot. For both cases with partial and binary offloading, we jointly optimize the computation
and communication resources allocation at both the user and the helper (i.e., the time and transmit
power allocations for offloading, and the CPU frequencies for computing), so as to minimize their
total energy consumption while satisfying the user's computation latency constraint. Although
the two problems are non-convex in general, we propose efficient algorithms to solve them optimally.
Numerical results show that the proposed joint computation and communication cooperation approach
significantly improves the computation capacity and energy efficiency at the user and helper nodes,
as compared to other benchmark schemes without such a joint design.
