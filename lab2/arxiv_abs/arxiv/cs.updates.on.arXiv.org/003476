In the Traveling Salesperson Problem with Neighborhoods (TSPN), we are given a collection of geometric
regions in some space. The goal is to output a tour of minimum length that visits at least one point
in each region. Even in the Euclidean plane, TSPN is known to be APX-hard, which gives rise to studying
more tractable special cases of the problem. In this paper, we focus on the fundamental special case
of regions that are hyperplanes in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. This case contrasts the
much-better understood case of so-called fat regions. While for $d=2$ an exact algorithm with running
time $O(n^5)$ is known, settling the exact approximability of the problem for $d=3$ has been repeatedly
posed as an open question. To date, only an approximation algorithm with guarantee exponential
in $d$ is known, and NP-hardness remains open. For arbitrary fixed $d$, we develop a Polynomial Time
Approximation Scheme (PTAS) that works for both the tour and path version of the problem. Our algorithm
is based on approximating the convex hull of the optimal tour by a convex polytope of bounded complexity.
Such polytopes are represented as solutions of a sophisticated LP formulation, which we combine
with the enumeration of crucial properties of the tour. As the approximation guarantee approaches
$1$, our scheme adjusts the complexity of the considered polytopes accordingly. In the analysis
of our approximation scheme, we show that our search space includes a sufficiently good approximation
of the optimum. To do so, we develop a novel and general sparsification technique to transform an
arbitrary convex polytope into one with a constant number of vertices and, in turn, into one of bounded
complexity in the above sense. Hereby, we maintain important properties of the polytope.
