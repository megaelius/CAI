The bottom-up construction of synthetic cells is one of the most intriguing and interesting research
arenas in synthetic biology. Synthetic cells are built by encapsulating biomolecules inside lipid
vesicles (liposomes), allowing the synthesis of one or more functional proteins. Thanks to the
in situ synthesized proteins, synthetic cells become able to perform several biomolecular functions,
which can be exploited for a large variety of applications. This paves the way to several advanced
uses of synthetic cells in basic science and biotechnology, thanks to their versatility, modularity,
biocompatibility, and programmability. In the previous WIVACE (2012) we presented the state-of-the-art
of semi-synthetic minimal cell (SSMC) technology and introduced, for the first time, the idea of
chemical communication between synthetic cells and natural cells. The development of a proper
synthetic communication protocol should be seen as a tool for the nascent field of bio/chemical-based
Information and Communication Technologies (bio-chem-ICTs) and ultimately aimed at building
soft-wet-micro-robots. In this contribution (WIVACE, 2013) we present a blueprint for realizing
this project, and show some preliminary experimental results. We firstly discuss how our research
goal (based on the natural capabilities of biological systems to manipulate chemical signals)
finds a proper place in the current scientific and technological contexts. Then, we shortly comment
on the experimental approaches from the viewpoints of (i) synthetic cell construction, and (ii)
bioengineering of microorganisms, providing up-to-date results from our laboratory. Finally,
we shortly discuss how autopoiesis can be used as a theoretical framework for defining synthetic
minimal life, minimal cognition, and as bridge between synthetic biology and artificial intelligence.
