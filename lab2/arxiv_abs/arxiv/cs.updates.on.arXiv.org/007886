This paper considers a nonlinear multi-hop multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)
relay channel, in which multiple users send information symbols to a multi-antenna base station
(BS) with one-bit analog-to-digital converters via intermediate relays, each with one-bit transceiver.
To understand the fundamental limit of the detection performance, the optimal maximum-likelihood
(ML) detector is proposed with the assumption of perfect and global channel state information (CSI)
at the BS. This multi-user detector, however, is not practical due to the unrealistic CSI assumption
and the overwhelming detection complexity. These limitations are addressed by presenting a novel
detection framework inspired by supervised-learning. The key idea is to model the complicated
multihop MU-MIMO channel as a simplified channel with much fewer and learnable parameters. One
major finding is that, even using the simplified channel model, a near ML detection performance
is achievable with a reasonable amount of pilot overheads in a certain condition. In addition, an
online supervised-learning detector is proposed, which adaptively tracks channel variations.
The idea is to update the model parameters with a reliably detected data symbol by treating it as a
new training (labelled) data. Lastly, a multi-user detector using a deep neural network is proposed.
Unlike the model-based approaches, this model-free approach enables to remove the errors in the
simplified channel model, while increasing the computational complexity for parameter learning.
Via simulations, the detection performances of classical, model-based, and model-free detectors
are thoroughly compared to demonstrate the effectiveness of the supervised-learning approaches
in this channel.
