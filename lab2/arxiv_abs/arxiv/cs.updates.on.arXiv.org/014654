COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was emerged in December 2019 within Wuhan, China. As the crisis
of its serious increasing dynamic outbreak in all parts of the globe, the forecast maps and analysis
of confirmed cases (CS) becomes a vital great changeling task. In this study, a new forecasting model
is presented to analyze and forecast the CS of COVID-19 for the coming days based on the reported data
since 22 Jan 2020. The proposed forecasting model, named ISACL-MFNN, integrates an improved interior
search algorithm (ISA) based on chaotic learning (CL) strategy into a multi-layer feed-forward
neural network (MFNN). The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance the performance of ISA
and avoid the trapping in the local optima. By this methodology, it is intended to train the neural
network by tuning its parameters to optimal values and thus achieving high-accuracy level regarding
forecasted results. The ISACL-MFNN model is investigated on the official data of the COVID-19 reported
by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the confirmed cases for the upcoming days. The
performance regarding the proposed forecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing
some indices including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization algorithms are presented.
The proposed model is investigated in the most affected countries (i.e., USA, Italy, and Spain).
The experimental simulations illustrate that the proposed ISACL-MFNN provides promising performance
rather than the other algorithms while forecasting task for the candidate countries.
