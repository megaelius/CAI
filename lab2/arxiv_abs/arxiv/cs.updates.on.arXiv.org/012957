Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation aims to offer suggestions on which POI to visit next,
given a user's POI visit history. This problem has a wide application in the tourism industry, and
it is gaining an increasing interest as more POI check-in data become available. The problem is often
modeled as a sequential recommendation problem to take advantage of the sequential patterns of
user check-ins, e.g., people tend to visit Central Park after The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York City. Recently, self-attentive networks have been shown to be both effective and efficient
in general sequential recommendation problems, e.g., to recommend products, video games, or movies.
Directly adopting self-attentive networks for next POI recommendation, however, may produce
sub-optimal recommendations. This is because vanilla self-attentive networks do not consider
the spatial and temporal patterns of user check-ins, which are two critical features in next POI
recommendation. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a model named SANST that incorporates
spatio-temporal patterns of user check-ins into self-attentive networks. To incorporate the
spatial patterns, we encode the relative positions of POIs into their embeddings before feeding
the embeddings into the self-attentive network. To incorporate the temporal patterns, we discretize
the time of POI check-ins and model the temporal relationship between POI check-ins by a relation-aware
self-attention module. We evaluate the performance of our SANST model with three real-world datasets.
The results show that SANST consistently outperforms the state-of-theart models, and the advantage
in nDCG@10 is up to 13.65%.
