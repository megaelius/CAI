The advent of autonomous vehicles is envisaged to disrupt the auto insurance liability model.Compared
to the the current model where liability is largely attributed to the driver,autonomous vehicles
necessitate the consideration of other entities in the automotive ecosystem including the auto
manufacturer,software provider,service technician and the vehicle owner.The proliferation
of sensors and connecting technologies in autonomous vehicles enables an autonomous vehicle to
gather sufficient data for liability attribution,yet increased connectivity exposes the vehicle
to attacks from interacting entities.These possibilities motivate potential liable entities
to repudiate their involvement in a collision event to evade liability. While the data collected
from vehicular sensors and vehicular communications is an integral part of the evidence for arbitrating
liability in the event of an accident,there is also a need to record all interactions between the
aforementioned entities to identify potential instances of negligence that may have played a role
in the accident.In this paper,we propose a BlockChain(BC) based framework that integrates the
concerned entities in the liability model and provides untampered evidence for liability attribution
and adjudication.We first describe the liability attribution model, identify key requirements
and describe the adversarial capabilities of entities. Also,we present a detailed description
of data contributing to evidence.Our framework uses permissioned BC and partitions the BC to tailor
data access to relevant BC participants.Finally,we conduct a security analysis to verify that
the identified requirements are met and resilience of our proposed framework to identified attacks.
