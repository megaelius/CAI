We study a vertical market with an upsteam supplier and multiple downstream retailers. Demand uncertainty
falls to the supplier who acts first and sets a uniform wholesale price before the retailers observe
the realized demand and engage in retail competition. Our focus is on the supplier's optimal pricing
decision. We express the price elasticity of expected demand in terms of the mean residual demand
(MRD) function of the demand distribution. This allows for a closed form characterization of the
points of unitary elasticity that maximize the seller's profits and the derivation of a mild unimodality
condition for the seller's objective function that generalizes the widely used increasing generalized
failure rate (IGFR) condition. A direct implication is that optimal prices between different markets
can be ordered if the markets can be stochastically ordered according to their MRD functions or equivalently
to their elasticities. Based on this, we apply the theory of stochastic orders to study the response
of the supplier's optimal price to various features of the demand distribution. Our findings challenge
previously established economic insights about the effects of market size, demand transformations
and demand variability on wholesale prices and indicate that the conclusions largely depend on
the exact notion that will be employed. We then turn to measure market performance and derive a distribution
free and tight bound on the probability of no trade between the supplier and the retailers. If trade
takes place, our findings indicate that ovarall performance depends on the interplay between demand
uncertainty and level of retail competition. We illustrate our results with numerical examples.
