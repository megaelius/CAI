A spreading process on a network is influenced by the network's underlying spatial structure, and
it is insightful to study the extent to which a spreading process follows such structure. We consider
a threshold contagion on a network whose nodes are embedded in a manifold and which has both `geometric
edges', which respect the geometry of the underlying manifold, and `non-geometric edges' that
are not constrained by that geometry. Building on ideas from Taylor et al. \cite{Taylor2015}, we
examine when a contagion propagates as a wave along a network whose nodes are embedded in a torus and
when it jumps via long non-geometric edges to remote areas of the network. We build a `contagion map'
for a contagion spreading on such a `noisy geometric network' to produce a point cloud; and we study
the dimensionality, geometry, and topology of this point cloud to examine qualitative properties
of this spreading process. We identify a region in parameter space in which the contagion propagates
predominantly via wavefront propagation. We consider different probability distributions for
constructing non-geometric edges --- reflecting different decay rates with respect to the distance
between nodes in the underlying manifold --- and examine how qualitative spreading dynamics are
affected by these choices. Our work generalizes the analysis in Taylor et al. and consolidates contagion
maps both as a tool for investigating spreading behavior on spatial networks and as a technique for
manifold learning. Moreover, we incorporate an approach for calibrating persistent-homology
barcodes of different scales. This approach is applicable in various other applications that use
persistent homology, and the Wasserstein distance between barcodes in particular.
