Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples-maliciously crafted inputs
that cause DNNs to make incorrect predictions. Recent work has shown that these attacks generalize
to the physical domain, to create perturbations on physical objects that fool image classifiers
under a variety of real-world conditions. Such attacks pose a risk to deep learning models used in
safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we extend physical attacks to more challenging
object detection models, a broader class of deep learning algorithms widely used to detect and label
multiple objects within a scene. Improving upon a previous physical attack on image classifiers,
we create perturbed physical objects that are either ignored or mislabeled by object detection
models. We implement a Disappearance Attack, in which we cause a Stop sign to "disappear" according
to the detector-either by covering thesign with an adversarial Stop sign poster, or by adding adversarial
stickers onto the sign. In a video recorded in a controlled lab environment, the state-of-the-art
YOLOv2 detector failed to recognize these adversarial Stop signs in over 85% of the video frames.
In an outdoor experiment, YOLO was fooled by the poster and sticker attacks in 72.5% and 63.5% of the
video frames respectively. We also use Faster R-CNN, a different object detection model, to demonstrate
the transferability of our adversarial perturbations. The created poster perturbation is able
to fool Faster R-CNN in 85.9% of the video frames in a controlled lab environment, and 40.2% of the
video frames in an outdoor environment. Finally, we present preliminary results with a new Creation
Attack, where in innocuous physical stickers fool a model into detecting nonexistent objects.
