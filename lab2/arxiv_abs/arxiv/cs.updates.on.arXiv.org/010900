Advances in deep neural network (DNN) based molecular property prediction have recently led to
the development of models of remarkable accuracy and generalization ability, with graph convolution
neural networks (GCNNs) reporting state-of-the-art performance for this task. However, some
challenges remain and one of the most important that needs to be fully addressed concerns uncertainty
quantification. DNN performance is affected by the volume and the quality of the training samples.
Therefore, establishing when and to what extent a prediction can be considered reliable is just
as important as outputting accurate predictions, especially when out-of-domain molecules are
targeted. Recently, several methods to account for uncertainty in DNNs have been proposed, most
of which are based on approximate Bayesian inference. Among these, only a few scale to the large datasets
required in applications. Evaluating and comparing these methods has recently attracted great
interest, but results are generally fragmented and absent for molecular property prediction.
In this paper, we aim to quantitatively compare scalable techniques for uncertainty estimation
in GCNNs. We introduce a set of quantitative criteria to capture different uncertainty aspects,
and then use these criteria to compare MC-Dropout, deep ensembles, and bootstrapping, both theoretically
in a unified framework that separates aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty and experimentally on
the QM9 dataset. Our experiments quantify the performance of the different uncertainty estimation
methods and their impact on uncertainty-related error reduction. Our findings indicate that ensembling
and bootstrapping consistently outperform MC-Dropout, with different context-specific pros
and cons. Our analysis also leads to a better understanding of the role of aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty
and highlights the challenge posed by out-of-domain uncertainty.
