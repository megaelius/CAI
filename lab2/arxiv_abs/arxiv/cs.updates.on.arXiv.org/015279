The severe outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic has affected many countries across the world, and disrupted
the day to day activities of many people. During such outbreaks, understanding the emotional state
of citizens of a country could be of interest to various organizations to carry out tasks and to take
necessary measures. Several studies have been performed on data available on various social media
platforms and websites to understand the emotions of people against many events, inclusive of Covid-19,
across the world. Twitter and other social media platforms have been bridging the gap between the
citizens and government in various countries and are of more prominence in India. Sentiment Analysis
of posts on twitter is observed to accurately reveal the sentiments. Analysing real time posts on
twitter in India during Covid-19, could help in identifying the mood of the nation. However, most
of the existing studies related to Covid-19, on twitter and other social media platforms are performed
on data posted during a specific interval. We are not aware of any research that identifies emotional
state of India on a daily basis. Hence, we present a web portal that aims to display mood of India during
Covid-19, based on real time twitter data. This portal also enables users to select date range, specific
date and state in India to display mood of people belonging to the specified region, on the specified
date or during the specified date range. Also, the number of Covid-19 cases and mood of people at specific
cities and states on specific dates is visualized on the country map. As of May 6 2020, the web portal
has about 194370 tweets, and each of these tweets are classified into seven categories that include
six basic emotions and a neutral category. A list of Trigger Events are also specified, to allow users
to view the mood of India on specific events happening in the country during Covid-19.
