Submodular function maximization has been a central topic in the theoretical computer science
community over the last decade. A plenty of well-performed approximation algorithms have been
designed for the maximization of monotone/non-monotone submodular functions over a variety of
constraints. In this paper, we consider the submodular multiple knapsack problem (SMKP), which
is the submodular version of the well-studied multiple knapsack problem (MKP). Roughly speaking,
the problem asks to maximize a monotone submodular function over multiple bins (knapsacks). Despite
lots of known results in the field of submodular maximization, surprisingly, it remains unknown
whether or not this problem enjoys the well-known tight $(1 - 1 / e)$-approximation. In this paper,
we answer this question affirmatively by proposing tight $(1 - 1 / e - \epsilon)$-approximation
algorithms for this problem in most cases. We first considered the case when the number of bins is
a constant. Previously a randomized approximation algorithm can obtain approximation ratio $(1
- 1 / e-\epsilon)$ based on the involved continuous greedy technique. Here we provide a simple combinatorial
deterministic algorithm with ratio $(1-1/e)$ by directly applying the greedy technique. We then
generalized the result to arbitrary number of bins. When the capacity of bins are identical, we design
a combinatorial and deterministic algorithm which can achieve the tight approximation ratio $(1
- 1 / e-\epsilon)$. When the ratio between the maximum capacity and the minimum capacity of the bins
is bounded by a constant, we provide a $(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm which is also
combinatorial and deterministic. We can further boost the approximation ratio to $(1 - 1 / e - \epsilon)$
with the help of continuous greedy technique, which gives a tight randomized approximation algorithm
for this case.
