In this work, we consider the problem of predicting the course of a progressive disease, such as cancer
or Alzheimer's. Progressive diseases often start with mild symptoms that might precede a diagnosis,
and each patient follows their own trajectory. Patient trajectories exhibit wild variability,
which can be associated with many factors such as geno- type, age, or sex. An additional layer of complexity
is that, in real life, the amount and type of data available for each patient can differ significantly.
For example, for one patient we might have no prior history, whereas for another patient we might
have detailed clinical assessments obtained at mul- tiple prior time-points. This paper presents
a probabilistic model that can handle multiple modalities (including im- ages and clinical assessments)
and variable patient histories with irregular timings and missing entries, to predict clinical
scores at future time-points. We use a sigmoidal function to model latent disease progression,
which gives rise to clini- cal observations in our generative model. We implemented an approximate
Bayesian inference strategy on the proposed model to estimate the parameters on data from a large
pop- ulation of subjects. Furthermore, the Bayesian framework enables the model to automatically
fine-tune its predictions based on historical observations that might be available on the test
subject. We applied our method to a longitudinal Alzheimer's disease dataset with more than 3000
subjects [23] and present a detailed empirical analysis of prediction performance under different
scenarios, with comparisons a- gainst several benchmarks. We also demonstrate how the proposed
model can be interrogated to glean insights about temporal dynamics in Alzheimer's disease.
