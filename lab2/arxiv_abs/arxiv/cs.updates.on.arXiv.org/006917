Despite inherent ill-definition, anomaly detection is a research endeavor of great interest within
machine learning and visual scene understanding alike. Most commonly, anomaly detection is considered
as the detection of outliers within a given data distribution based on some measure of normality.
The most significant challenge in real-world anomaly detection problems is that available data
is highly imbalanced towards normality (i.e. non-anomalous) and contains a most a subset of all
possible anomalous samples - hence limiting the use of well-established supervised learning methods.
By contrast, we introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection model, trained only on the normal (non-anomalous,
plentiful) samples in order to learn the normality distribution of the domain and hence detect abnormality
based on deviation from this model. Our proposed approach employs an encoder-decoder convolutional
neural network with skip connections to thoroughly capture the multi-scale distribution of the
normal data distribution in high-dimensional image space. Furthermore, utilizing an adversarial
training scheme for this chosen architecture provides superior reconstruction both within high-dimensional
image space and a lower-dimensional latent vector space encoding. Minimizing the reconstruction
error metric within both the image and hidden vector spaces during training aids the model to learn
the distribution of normality as required. Higher reconstruction metrics during subsequent test
and deployment are thus indicative of a deviation from this normal distribution, hence indicative
of an anomaly. Experimentation over established anomaly detection benchmarks and challenging
real-world datasets, within the context of X-ray security screening, shows the unique promise
of such a proposed approach.
