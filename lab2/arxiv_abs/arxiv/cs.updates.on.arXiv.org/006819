By achieving their purposes through interactions with the physical world, Cyber Physical Systems
(CPS) pose new challenges in terms of dependability. Indeed, the evolution of the physical systems
they control with transducers can be affected by surrounding physical processes over which they
have no control and which may potentially hamper the achievement of their purposes. While it is illusory
to hope for a comprehensive model of the physical environment at design time to anticipate and remove
faults that may occur once these systems are deployed, it becomes necessary to evaluate their degree
of effectiveness in vivo.In this paper, the degree of effectiveness is formally defined and generalized
in the context of the measure theory and the mathematical properties it has to comply with are detailed.
The measure is developed in the context of the Transfer Belief Model (TBM), an elaboration on the
Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence so as to handle epistemic and aleatory uncertainties respectively
pertaining the users expectations and the natural variability of the physical environment. This
theoretical framework has several advantages over the probability and the possibility theories.
(1) It is built on the Open World Assumption (OWA), (2) it allows to cope with dependent and possibly
unreliable sources of information. The TBM is used in conjunction with the Input Output Hidden Markov
Modeling framework (IOHMM) to specify the expected evolution of the physical system controlled
by the CPS and the tolerances towards uncertainties. The measure of effectiveness is obtained from
the forward algorithm, leveraging the conflict entailed by the successive combinations of the
beliefs obtained from observations of the physical system and the beliefs corresponding to its
expected evolution. The conflict, inherent to OWA, is meant to quantify the inability of the model
at explaining observations.
