The Viola-Jones face detection algorithm was (and still is) a quite popular face detector. In spite
of the numerous face detection techniques that have been recently presented, there are many research
works that are still based on the Viola-Jones algorithm because of its simplicity. In this paper,
we study the influence of a set of blind pre-processing methods on the face detection rate using the
Viola-Jones algorithm. We focus on two aspects of improvement, specifically badly illuminated
faces and blurred faces. Many methods for lighting invariant and deblurring are used in order to
improve the detection accuracy. We want to avoid using blind pre-processing methods that may obstruct
the face detector. To that end, we perform two sets of experiments. The first set is performed to avoid
any blind pre-processing method that may hurt the face detector. The second set is performed to study
the effect of the selected pre-processing methods on images that suffer from hard conditions. We
present two manners of applying the pre-processing method to the image prior to being used by the
Viola-Jones face detector. Four different datasets are used to draw a coherent conclusion about
the potential improvement caused by using prior enhanced images. The results demonstrate that
some of the pre-processing methods may hurt the accuracy of Viola-Jones face detection algorithm.
However, other pre-processing methods have an evident positive impact on the accuracy of the face
detector. Overall, we recommend three simple and fast blind photometric normalization methods
as a pre-processing step in order to improve the accuracy of the pre-trained Viola-Jones face detector.
