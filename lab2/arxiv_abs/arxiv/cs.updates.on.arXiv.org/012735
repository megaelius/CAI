The web contains a vast corpus of HTML tables. They can be used to provide direct answers to many web
queries. We focus on answering two classes of queries with those tables: those seeking lists of entities
(e.g., `cities in california') and those seeking superlative entities (e.g., `largest city in
california'). The main challenge is to achieve high precision with significant coverage. Existing
approaches train machine learning models to select the answer from the candidates; they rely on
textual match features between the query and the content of the table along with features capturing
table quality/importance. These features alone are inadequate for achieving the above goals.
Our main insight is that we can improve precision by (i) first extracting intent (structured information)
from the query for the above query classes and (ii) then performing structure-aware matching (instead
of just textual matching) between the extracted intent and the candidates to select the answer.
We model (i) as a sequence tagging task. We leverage state-of-the-art deep neural network models
with word embeddings. The model requires large scale training data which is expensive to obtain
via manual labeling; we therefore develop a novel method to automatically generate the training
data. For (ii), we develop novel features to compute structure-aware match and train a machine learning
model. Our experiments on real-life web search queries show that (i) our intent extractor for list
and superlative intent queries has significantly higher precision and coverage compared with
baseline approaches and (ii) our table answer selector significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
baseline approach. This technology has been used in production by Microsoft's Bing search engine
since 2016.
