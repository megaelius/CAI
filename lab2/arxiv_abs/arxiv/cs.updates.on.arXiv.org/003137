As online ad offerings become increasingly complex, with multiple size configurations and layouts
available to advertisers, the sale of web advertising space increasingly resembles a combinatorial
auction with complementarities. Standard ad auction formats do not immediately extend to these
settings, and truthful combinatorial auctions, such as the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction, can
yield unacceptably low revenue. Core selecting auctions, which apply to combinatorial markets,
boost revenue by setting prices so that no group of agents, including the auctioneer, can jointly
improve their utilities by switching to a different allocation and payments. Among outcomes in
the core, bidder-optimal core points have been the most widely studied due to their incentive properties,
such as being implementable at equilibrium. Prior work in economics has studied heuristics for
computing approximate bidder-optimal core points given oracle access to the welfare optimization
problem, but these solutions either lack performance guarantees or are based on prohibitively
slow convex programs. Our main result is a combinatorial algorithm that finds an approximate bidder-optimal
core point with almost linear number of calls to the welfare maximization oracle. Our algorithm
is faster than previously-proposed heuristics, has theoretical guarantees, and reveals some
useful structural properties of the core polytope. We conclude that core pricing is implementable
even for very time sensitive practical use cases such as realtime auctions for online advertising
and can yield more revenue. We justify this claim experimentally using the Microsoft Bing Ad Auction
platform, which allows advertisers to have decorations with a non-uniform number of lines of text.
We find that core pricing generates almost 100% more revenue than VCG, and almost 20% more revenue
than the standard Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction.
