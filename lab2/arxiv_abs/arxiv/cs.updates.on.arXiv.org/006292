The set of permutations on a finite set can be given the lattice structure known as the weak Bruhat
order. This lattice structure is generalized to the set of words on a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$ = {x,y,z,...},
where each letter has a fixed number of occurrences. These lattices are known as multinomial lattices
and, when card($\Sigma$) = 2, as lattices of lattice paths. By interpreting the letters x, y, z, .
. . as axes, these words can be interpreted as discrete increasing paths on a grid of a d-dimensional
cube, with d = card($\Sigma$).We show how to extend this ordering to images of continuous monotone
functions from the unit interval to a d-dimensional cube and prove that this ordering is a lattice,
denoted by L(I^d). This construction relies on a few algebraic properties of the quantale of join-continuous
functions from the unit interval of the reals to itself: it is cyclic $\star$-autonomous and it satisfies
the mix rule.We investigate structural properties of these lattices, which are self-dual and not
distributive. We characterize join-irreducible elements and show that these lattices are generated
under infinite joins from their join-irreducible elements, they have no completely join-irreducible
elements nor compact elements. We study then embeddings of the d-dimensional multinomial lattices
into L(I^d). We show that these embeddings arise functorially from subdivisions of the unit interval
and observe that L(I^d) is the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of the colimit of these embeddings.
Yet, if we restrict to embeddings that take rational values and if d > 2, then every element of L(I^d)
is only a join of meets of elements from the colimit of these embeddings.
