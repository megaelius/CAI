With the widespread dissemination of user-generated content on different social networks, and
online consumer systems such as Amazon, the quantity of opinionated information available on the
Internet has been increased. One of the main tasks of the sentiment analysis is to detect polarity
within a text. The existing polarity detection methods mainly focus on keywords and their naive
frequency counts; however, they less regard the meanings and implicit dimensions of the natural
concepts. Although background knowledge plays a critical role in determining the polarity of concepts,
it has been disregarded in polarity detection methods. This study presents a context-based model
to solve ambiguous polarity concepts using commonsense knowledge. First, a model is presented
to generate a source of ambiguous sentiment concepts based on SenticNet by computing the probability
distribution. Then the model uses a bag-of-concepts approach to remove ambiguities and semantic
augmentation with the ConceptNet handling to overcome lost knowledge. ConceptNet is a large-scale
semantic network with a large number of commonsense concepts. In this paper, the point mutual information
(PMI) measure is used to select the contextual concepts having strong relationships with ambiguous
concepts. The polarity of the ambiguous concepts is precisely detected using positive/negative
contextual concepts and the relationship of the concepts in the semantic knowledge base. The text
representation scheme is semantically enriched using Numberbatch, which is a word embedding model
based on the concepts from the ConceptNet semantic network. The proposed model is evaluated by applying
a corpus of product reviews, called Semeval. The experimental results revealed an accuracy rate
of 82.07%, representing the effectiveness of the proposed model.
