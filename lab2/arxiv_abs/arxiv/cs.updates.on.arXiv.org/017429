Effective adoption of online platforms for teaching, learning, and skill development is essential
to both academic institutions and workplaces. Adoption of online learning has been abruptly accelerated
by COVID19 pandemic, drawing attention to research on pedagogy and practice for effective online
instruction. Online learning requires a multitude of skills and resources spanning from learning
management platforms to interactive assessment tools, combined with multimedia content, presenting
challenges to instructors and organizations. This study focuses on ways that learning sciences
and visual learning analytics can be used to design, and to improve, online workforce training in
advanced manufacturing. Scholars and industry experts, educational researchers, and specialists
in data analysis and visualization collaborated to study the performance of a cohort of 900 professionals
enrolled in an online training course focused on additive manufacturing. The course was offered
through MITxPro, MIT Open Learning is a professional learning organization which hosts in a dedicated
instance of the edX platform. This study combines learning objective analysis and visual learning
analytics to examine the relationships among learning trajectories, engagement, and performance.
The results demonstrate how visual learning analytics was used for targeted course modification,
and interpretation of learner engagement and performance, such as by more direct mapping of assessments
to learning objectives, and to expected and actual time needed to complete each segment of the course.
The study also emphasizes broader strategies for course designers and instructors to align course
assignments, learning objectives, and assessment measures with learner needs and interests,
and argues for a synchronized data infrastructure to facilitate effective just in time learning
and continuous improvement of online courses.
