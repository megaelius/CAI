In next-generation communications, massive machine-type communications (MTC) induce severe
burden on base stations. To address such issue, automatic modulation classification (AMC) can
reduce signaling overhead through blindly recognizing the modulation types without handshaking,
thus playing an important role in intelligent modems. The emerging deep learning (DL) technique
stores intelligence in the network, resulting in superior performance over traditional approaches.
However, DL-based approaches suffer from computational complexity and offline training overhead,
which severely hinder practical applications. Furthermore, the required massive resources for
online retraining should be further considered under time-varying fading channel, which has not
been studied in the prior arts. In this work, an accumulated polar feature-based DL with channel
compensation mechanism is proposed to cope with the aforementioned issues. Firstly, the simulation
results show that learning features from polar domain with historical information can approach
optimal performance and reduce offline training overhead by 37.8 times. Secondly, the proposed
neural network-based channel estimator (NN-CE) can learn the channel response and compensate
for the distorted channel with 13% improvement. Moreover, in applying the novel NN-CE in the time-varying
fading channel, two efficient mechanisms of online retraining are proposed, which reduce transmission
overhead and retraining overhead by 90% and 76%, respectively. Finally, the performance of the
proposed approach is evaluated and compared with prior arts on a public dataset to demonstrate its
great efficiency.
