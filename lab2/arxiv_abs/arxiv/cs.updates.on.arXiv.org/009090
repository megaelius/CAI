We present a computer-supported approach for the logical analysis and conceptual explicitation
of argumentative discourse. Computational hermeneutics harnesses recent progresses in automated
reasoning for higher-order logics and aims at formalizing natural-language argumentative discourse
using flexible combinations of expressive non-classical logics. In doing so, it allows us to render
explicit the tacit conceptualizations implicit in argumentative discursive practices. Our approach
operates on networks of structured arguments and is iterative and two-layered. At one layer we search
for logically correct formalizations for each of the individual arguments. At the next layer we
select among those correct formalizations the ones which honor the argument's dialectic role,
i.e. attacking or supporting other arguments as intended. We operate at these two layers in parallel
and continuously rate sentences' formalizations by using, primarily, inferential adequacy criteria.
An interpretive, logical theory will thus gradually evolve. This theory is composed of meaning
postulates serving as explications for concepts playing a role in the analyzed arguments. Such
a recursive, iterative approach to interpretation does justice to the inherent circularity of
understanding: the whole is understood compositionally on the basis of its parts, while each part
is understood only in the context of the whole (hermeneutic circle). We summarily discuss previous
work on exemplary applications of human-in-the-loop computational hermeneutics in metaphysical
discourse. We also discuss some of the main challenges involved in fully-automating our approach.
By sketching some design ideas and reviewing relevant technologies, we argue for the technological
feasibility of a highly-automated computational hermeneutics.
