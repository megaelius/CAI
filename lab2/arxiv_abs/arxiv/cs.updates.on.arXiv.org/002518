Let $P$ be a simple,stationary point process having fast decay of correlations, i.e., its correlation
functions factorize up to an additive error decaying faster than any power of the separation distance.
Let $P_n:= P \cap W_n$ be its restriction to windows $W_n:= [-{1 \over 2}n^{1/d},{1 \over 2}n^{1/d}]^d
\subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We consider the statistic $H_n^\xi:= \sum_{x \in P_n}\xi(x,P_n)$ where
$\xi(x,P_n)$ denotes a score function representing the interaction of $x$ with respect to $P_n$.
When $\xi$ depends on local data in the sense that its radius of stabilization has an exponential
tail, we establish expectation asymptotics, variance asymptotics, and CLT for $H_n^{\xi}$ and,
more generally, for statistics of the re-scaled, possibly signed, $\xi$-weighted point measures
$\mu_n^{\xi} := \sum_{x \in P_n} \xi(x,P_n) \delta_{n^{-1/d}x}$, as $W_n \uparrow \mathbb{R}^d$.
This gives the limit theory for non-linear geometric statistics (such as clique counts, intrinsic
volumes of the Boolean model, and total edge length of the $k$-nearest neighbors graph) of $\alpha$-determinantal
point processes having fast decreasing kernels extending the CLTs of Soshnikov (2002) to non-linear
statistics. It also gives the limit theory for geometric U-statistics of $\alpha$-permanental
point processes and the zero set of Gaussian entire functions, extending the CLTs of Nazarov and
Sodin (2012) and Shirai and Takahashi (2003), which are also confined to linear statistics. The
proof of the central limit theorem relies on a factorial moment expansion originating in Blaszczyszyn
(1995), Blaszczyszyn, Merzbach, Schmidt (1997) to show the fast decay of the correlations of $\xi$-weighted
point measures. The latter property is shown to imply a condition equivalent to Brillinger mixing
and consequently yields the CLT for $\mu_n^\xi$ via an extension of the cumulant method.
