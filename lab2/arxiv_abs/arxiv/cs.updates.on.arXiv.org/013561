The Rank metric decoding problem is the main problem considered in cryptography based on codes in
the rank metric. Very efficient schemes based on this problem or quasi-cyclic versions of it have
been proposed recently, such as those in the submissions ROLLO and RQC currently at the second round
of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process. While combinatorial attacks
on this problem have been extensively studied and seem now well understood, the situation is not
as satisfactory for algebraic attacks, for which previous work essentially suggested that they
were ineffective for cryptographic parameters. In this paper, starting from Ourivski and Johansson's
algebraic modelling of the problem into a system of polynomial equations, we show how to augment
this system with easily computed equations so that the augmented system is solved much faster via
Groebner bases. This happens because the augmented system has solving degree $r$, $r+1$ or $r+2$
depending on the parameters, where $r$ is the rank weight, which we show by extending results from
Verbel et al. (PQCrypto 2019) on systems arising from the MinRank problem; with target rank $r$,
Verbel et al. lower the solving degree to $r+2$, and even less for some favorable instances that they
call superdetermined. We give complexity bounds for this approach as well as practical timings
of an implementation using Magma. This improves upon the previously known complexity estimates
for both Groebner basis and (non-quantum) combinatorial approaches, and for example leads to an
attack in 200 bits on ROLLO-I-256 whose claimed security was 256 bits.
