This report provides an overview of recent work that harnesses the Big Data Revolution and Large
Scale Computing to address grand computational challenges in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics,
with a particular emphasis on real-time discovery campaigns. Acknowledging the transdisciplinary
nature of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, this document has been prepared by members of the physics,
astronomy, computer science, data science, software and cyberinfrastructure communities who
attended the NSF-, DOE- and NVIDIA-funded "Deep Learning for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics: Real-time
Discovery at Scale" workshop, hosted at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications,
October 17-19, 2018. Highlights of this report include unanimous agreement that it is critical
to accelerate the development and deployment of novel, signal-processing algorithms that use
the synergy between artificial intelligence (AI) and high performance computing to maximize the
potential for scientific discovery with Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. We discuss key aspects
to realize this endeavor, namely (i) the design and exploitation of scalable and computationally
efficient AI algorithms for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics; (ii) cyberinfrastructure requirements
to numerically simulate astrophysical sources, and to process and interpret Multi-Messenger
Astrophysics data; (iii) management of gravitational wave detections and triggers to enable electromagnetic
and astro-particle follow-ups; (iv) a vision to harness future developments of machine and deep
learning and cyberinfrastructure resources to cope with the scale of discovery in the Big Data Era;
(v) and the need to build a community that brings domain experts together with data scientists on
equal footing to maximize and accelerate discovery in the nascent field of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics.
