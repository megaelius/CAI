Spikes are the currency in central nervous systems for information transmission and processing.
They are also believed to play an essential role in low-power consumption of the biological systems,
whose efficiency attracts increasing attentions to the field of neuromorphic computing. However,
efficient processing and learning of discrete spikes still remains as a challenging problem. In
this paper, we make our contributions towards this direction. A simplified spiking neuron model
is firstly introduced with effects of both synaptic input and firing output on membrane potential
being modeled with an impulse function. An event-driven scheme is then presented to further improve
the processing efficiency. Based on the neuron model, we propose two new multi-spike learning rules
which demonstrate better performance over other baselines on various tasks including association,
classification, feature detection. In addition to efficiency, our learning rules demonstrate
a high robustness against strong noise of different types. They can also be generalized to different
spike coding schemes for the classification task, and notably single neuron is capable of solving
multi-category classifications with our learning rules. In the feature detection task, we re-examine
the ability of unsupervised STDP with its limitations being presented, and find a new phenomenon
of losing selectivity. In contrast, our proposed learning rules can reliably solve the task over
a wide range of conditions without specific constraints being applied. Moreover, our rules can
not only detect features but also discriminate them. The improved performance of our methods would
contribute to neuromorphic computing as a preferable choice.
