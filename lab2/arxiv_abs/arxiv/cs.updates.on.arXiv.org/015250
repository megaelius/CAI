A two-terminal distributed binary hypothesis testing (HT) problem over a noisy channel is studied.
The two terminals, called the observer and the decision maker, each has access to $n$ independent
and identically distributed samples, denoted by $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$, respectively.
The observer communicates to the decision maker over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC), and the
decision maker performs a binary hypothesis test on the joint probability distribution of $(\mathbf{U},\mathbf{V})$
based on $\mathbf{V}$ and the noisy information received from the observer. The trade-off between
the exponents of the type I and type II error probabilities in HT is investigated. Two inner bounds
are obtained, one using a separation-based scheme that involves type-based compression and unequal
error-protection channel coding, and the other using a joint scheme that incorporates type-based
hybrid coding. The separation-based scheme is shown to recover the inner bound obtained by Han and
Kobayashi for the special case of a rate-limited noiseless channel, and also the one obtained by
the authors previously for a corner point of the trade-off. Exact single-letter characterization
of the optimal trade-off is established for the special case of testing for the marginal distribution
of $\mathbf{U}$, when $\mathbf{V}$ is unavailable. Our results imply that a separation holds in
this case, in the sense that the optimal trade-off is achieved by a scheme that performs independent
HT and channel coding. Finally, we show via an example that the joint scheme achieves a strictly tighter
bound than the separation-based scheme for some points of the error-exponent trade-off.
