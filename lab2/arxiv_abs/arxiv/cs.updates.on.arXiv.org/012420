Sequential decision-making under uncertainty for optimal life-cycle control of deteriorating
engineering systems and infrastructure entails two fundamental classes of decisions. The first
class pertains to the various structural interventions, which can directly modify the existing
properties of the system, while the second class refers to prescribing appropriate inspection
and monitoring schemes, which are essential for updating our existing knowledge about the system
states. The latter have to rely on quantifiable measures of efficiency, determined on the basis
of objective criteria that, among others, consider the Value of Information (VoI) of different
observational strategies, and the Value of Structural Health Monitoring (VoSHM) over the entire
system life-cycle. In this work, we present general solutions for quantifying the VoI and VoSHM
in partially observable stochastic domains, and although our definitions and methodology are
general, we are particularly emphasizing and describing the role of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (POMDPs) in solving this problem, due to their advantageous theoretical and
practical attributes in estimating arbitrarily well globally optimal policies. POMDP formulations
are articulated for different structural environments having shared intervention actions but
diversified inspection and monitoring options, thus enabling VoI and VoSHM estimation through
their differentiated stochastic optimal control policies. POMDP solutions are derived using
point-based solvers, which can efficiently approximate the POMDP value functions through Bellman
backups at selected reachable points of the belief space. The suggested methodology is applied
on stationary and non-stationary deteriorating environments, with both infinite and finite planning
horizons, featuring single- or multi-component engineering systems.
