We study the effect of edge contractions on simplicial homology because these contractions have
turned to be useful in various applications involving topology. It was observed previously that
contracting edges that satisfy the so called link condition preserves homeomorphism in low dimensional
complexes, and homotopy in general. But, checking the link condition involves computation in all
dimensions, and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensional complexes. We define a weaker
and more local condition called the p-link condition for each dimension p, and study its effect on
edge contractions. We prove the following: (i) For homology groups, edges satisfying the p- and
(p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without disturbing the p-dimensional homology group.
(ii) For relative homology groups, the (p-1)-, and the (p-2)-link conditions suffice to guarantee
that the contraction does not introduce any new class in any of the resulting relative homology groups,
though some of the existing classes can be destroyed. Unfortunately, the surjection in relative
homolgy groups does not guarantee that no new relative torsion is created. (iii) For torsions, edges
satisfying the p-link condition alone can be contracted without creating any new relative torsion
and the p-link condition cannot be avoided. The results on relative homology and relative torsion
are motivated by recent results on computing optimal homologous chains, which state that such problems
can be solved by linear programming if the complex has no relative torsion. Edge contractions that
do not introduce new relative torsions, can safely be availed in these contexts.
