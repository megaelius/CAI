The large volumes of Sentinel-1 data produced over Europe are being used to develop pan-national
ground motion services. However, simple analysis techniques like thresholding cannot detect
and classify complex deformation signals reliably making providing usable information to a broad
range of non-expert stakeholders a challenge. Here we explore the applicability of deep learning
approaches by adapting a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect deformation
in a national-scale velocity field. For our proof-of-concept, we focus on the UK where previously
identified deformation is associated with coal-mining, ground water withdrawal, landslides
and tunnelling. The sparsity of measurement points and the presence of spike noise make this a challenging
application for deep learning networks, which involve calculations of the spatial convolution
between images. Moreover, insufficient ground truth data exists to construct a balanced training
data set, and the deformation signals are slower and more localised than in previous applications.
We propose three enhancement methods to tackle these problems: i) spatial interpolation with modified
matrix completion, ii) a synthetic training dataset based on the characteristics of real UK velocity
map, and iii) enhanced over-wrapping techniques. Using velocity maps spanning 2015-2019, our
framework detects several areas of coal mining subsidence, uplift due to dewatering, slate quarries,
landslides and tunnel engineering works. The results demonstrate the potential applicability
of the proposed framework to the development of automated ground motion analysis systems.
