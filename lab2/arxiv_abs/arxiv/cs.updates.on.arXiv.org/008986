Accurate pulmonary nodule detection is a crucial step in lung cancer screening. Computer-aided
detection (CAD) systems are not routinely used by radiologists for pulmonary nodule detection
in clinical practice despite their potential benefits. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) images
improve the detection of pulmonary nodules in radiological evaluation with computed tomography
(CT) scans. Inspired by the clinical methodology of radiologists, we aim to explore the feasibility
of applying MIP images to improve the effectiveness of automatic lung nodule detection using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). We propose a CNN-based approach that takes MIP images of different slab
thicknesses (5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm) and 1 mm axial section slices as input. Such an approach augments the
two-dimensional (2-D) CT slice images with more representative spatial information that helps
discriminate nodules from vessels through their morphologies. Our proposed method achieves sensitivity
of 92.67% with 1 false positive per scan and sensitivity of 94.19% with 2 false positives per scan
for lung nodule detection on 888 scans in the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The use of thick MIP images helps
the detection of small pulmonary nodules (3 mm-10 mm) and results in fewer false positives. Experimental
results show that utilizing MIP images can increase the sensitivity and lower the number of false
positives, which demonstrates the effectiveness and significance of the proposed MIP-based CNNs
framework for automatic pulmonary nodule detection in CT scans. The proposed method also shows
the potential that CNNs could gain benefits for nodule detection by combining the clinical procedure.
