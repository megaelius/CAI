Serendipity has played a role in many human discoveries, and an improved understanding of serendipity
could help bring about breakthroughs in the field of computational discovery. The concept of serendipity
has previously been adopted for users' benefit by many subfields of computer science, in work that
focused on employing computer systems to support and catalyse a serendipitous experience for the
user. In this article, we switch perspectives to focus on artificial systems that catalyse, evaluate
and leverage serendipitous occurrences themselves. Since serendipity cannot be generated on
demand, our analysis embraces the concept of $\mathit{serendipity}\ \mathit{potential}$. We
survey the literature on serendipity and creativity to distil the core common themes, which we then
use as a conceptual framework. Specifically, we describe five operational dimensions of systems
with serendipity potential: perception of a chance event, attention to salient detail, a focus
shift achieved by interest, bridge to a problem, and valuation of the result. The focus shift is a
central necessary condition, in which the system reevaluates or recontextualises something that
had been given a low evaluation score, and subsequently finds it to be of increased value. We use our
framework to analyse several historical systems which included features of serendipity: Mueller's
$\mathsf{DAYDREAMER}$, Figueiredo and Campos's $\mathsf{Max}$, Colton's $\mathsf{HR}$, and
Pease's $\mathsf{HRL}$. We show that $\mathsf{DAYDREAMER}$ and $\mathsf{HRL}$ manifest all
of the features of our framework. We discuss our framework in relationship to existing work on serendipity,
surprise, and control in a computing context. We comment on how environmental factors and system
features interact when designing for serendipity, and compare the evaluation of serendipity to
the evaluation of creativity.
