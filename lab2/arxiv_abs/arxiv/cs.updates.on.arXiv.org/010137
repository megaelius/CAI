Multiphysics problems involving two or more coupled physical phenomena are ubiquitous in science
and engineering. This work develops a new partitioned exponential approach for the time integration
of multiphysics problems. After a possible semi-discretization in space, the class of problems
under consideration are modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations where the right-hand
side is a summation of two component functions, each corresponding to a given set of physical processes.
The partitioned-exponential methods proposed herein evolve each component of the system via an
exponential integrator, and information between partitions is exchanged via coupling terms.
The traditional approach to constructing exponential methods, based on the variation-of-constants
formula, is not directly applicable to partitioned systems. Rather, our approach to developing
new partitioned-exponential families is based on a general-structure additive formulation of
the schemes. Two method formulations are considered, one based on a linear-nonlinear splitting
of the right hand component functions, and another based on approximate Jacobians. The paper develops
classical (non-stiff) order conditions theory for partitioned exponential schemes based on particular
families of T-trees and B-series theory. Several practical methods of third order are constructed
that extend the Rosenbrock-type and EPIRK families of exponential integrators. Several implementation
optimizations specific to the application of these methods to reaction-diffusion systems are
also discussed. Numerical experiments reveal that the new partitioned-exponential methods can
perform better than traditional unpartitioned exponential methods on some problems.
