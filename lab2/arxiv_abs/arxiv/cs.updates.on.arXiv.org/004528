Many inference problems, notably the stochastic block model (SBM) that generates a random graph
with a hidden community structure, undergo phase transitions as a function of the signal-to-noise
ratio, and can exhibit hard phases in which optimal inference is information-theoretically possible
but computationally challenging. In this paper we refine this description in two ways. In a qualitative
perspective we emphasize the existence of more generic phase diagrams with a hybrid-hard phase
in which it is computationally easy to reach a non-trivial inference accuracy, but computationally
hard to match the information theoretically optimal one. We support this discussion by quantitative
expansions of the functional cavity equations that describe inference problems on sparse graphs.
These expansions shed light on the existence of hybrid-hard phases, for a large class of planted
constraint satisfaction problems, and on the question of the tightness of the Kesten-Stigum (KS)
bound for the associated tree reconstruction problem. Our results show that the instability of
the trivial fixed point is not a generic evidence for the Bayes-optimality of the message passing
algorithms. We clarify in particular the status of the symmetric SBM with 4 communities and of the
tree reconstruction of the associated Potts model: in the assortative (ferromagnetic) case the
KS bound is always tight, whereas in the disassortative (antiferromagnetic) case we exhibit an
explicit criterion involving the degree distribution that separates a large degree regime where
the KS bound is tight and a low degree regime where it is not. We also investigate the SBM with 2 communities
of different sizes, a.k.a. the asymmetric Ising model, and describe quantitatively its computational
gap as a function of its asymmetry. We complement this study with numerical simulations of the Belief
Propagation iterative algorithm.
