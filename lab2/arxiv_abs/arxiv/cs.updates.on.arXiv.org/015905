This work aims to monitor and control the presence of UPNA research staff in the main research profiles
platforms, not only in the most obvious ones such as Google Scholar Citation, Researcher ID, Scopus
ID and ORCID, but also in other services that, in practice, they function as research profiles, such
as Mendeley, Linkedin, ResearchGate, Academia.edu and Academica-e. We also find it interesting
to analyze that presence and see how it responds to a variables, such as the department, gender, job
category, research group. In this study we have excluded some platforms for different reasons.
Dialnet profiles are entered from the UPNA library (BUPNA), which means that all those who meet the
requirements for inclusion would be there, so their analysis does not make much sense, since it depends
on factors outside the will of the researcher himself. The same is the case with the UPNA Scientific
Production Portal (PPC): the data is entered from the Vicerrectorado de Investigaci\'on and should
include all members of the UPNA PDI. Using as a base the census of university research staff provided
by the Vicerrectorado de Investigaci\'on, it has been verified, for each author, the existence
or not of a profile in the different services studied. The results have been tabulated in an Excel
file to be able to analyze them later. The data has been collected in March 2018 for Orcid, ResearcherID,
ScopusID, Google Scholar Citations and Mendeley. In November 2018, data from Academica-e, Academia.edu,
ResearchGate and Linkedin were taken. For each of the profiles, a search by institutional affiliation
was used, when possible, to obtain a first list of UPNA research personnel with that profile. Subsequently,
a search was carried out, person by person, of the rest of the research staff that did not appear in
that first list.
