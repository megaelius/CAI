Cloud computing datacenters provide thousands to millions of virtual machines (VMs) on-demand
in highly dynamic environments, requiring quick placement of requested VMs into available physical
machines (PMs). Due to the randomness of customer requests, the Virtual Machine Placement (VMP)
should be formulated as an online optimization problem. The first part of this work analyzes alternatives
to solve the formulated problem, an experimental comparison of five different online deterministic
heuristics against an offline memetic algorithm with migration of VMs was performed, considering
several experimental workloads. Simulations indicate that First-Fit Decreasing algorithm (A4)
outperforms other evaluated heuristics on average. This work presents a two-phase schema formulation
of a VMP problem considering the optimization of three objective functions in an IaaS environment
with elasticity and overbooking capabilities. The two-phase schema formulation describes that
the allocation of the VMs can be separated into two sub-problems, the incremental allocation (iVMP)
and the reconfiguration of a placement (VMPr). To analyze alternatives to solve the formulated
problem, an experimental comparison of three different objective function scalarization methods
as part of the iVMP and VMPr was performed considering several experimental workloads. Simulations
indicate that the Euclidean distance to origin outperforms other evaluated scalarization methods
on average. In order to portray the dynamic nature of an IaaS environment a customizable workload
trace generator was developed to simulate uncertainty in the scenarios with elasticity and overbooking
of resources in VM requests. Experimental results proved that the Euclidean distance is preferable
over the other scalarizatiom methods to improve the values of the power consumption objective function.
