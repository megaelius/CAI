In Online Social Networks (OSNs), interpersonal communication and information sharing are happening
all the time, and it is real-time. When a user initiates an activity in OSNs, immediately, he/she
will have a certain influence in his/her friendship circle naturally, some users in the initiator's
friendship circle will be attracted to participate in this activity. Based on such a fact, we design
a k-hop Collaborate Game Model, which means that an activity initiated by a user can only influence
those users whose distance are within k-hop from this initiator in OSNs. Besides, we introduce the
problem of Revenue Maximization under k-hop Collaborate Game (RMKCG), which identifies a limited
number of initiators in order to obtain revenue as much as possible. Collaborate Game Model describes
in detail how to quantify revenue and the logic behind it. We do not know how many followers would be
generated from an activity in advance, thus, we need to adopt an adaptive strategy, where the decision
who is the next potential initiator depends on the results of past decisions. Adaptive RMKCG problem
can be considered as a new stochastic optimization problem, and we prove it is NP-hard, adaptive
monotone, but not adaptive submodular. But in some special cases, it is adaptive submodular and
an adaptive greedy strategy can obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation by adaptive submodularity theory.
Due to the complexity of our model, it is hard to compute the marginal gain for each candidate user,
then, we propose a convenient and efficient computational method. The effectiveness and correctness
of our algorithms are validated by heavy simulation on real-world social networks eventually.
