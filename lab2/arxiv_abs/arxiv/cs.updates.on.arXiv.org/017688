Prudent and meaningful algorithm performance evaluation is essential for the progression of any
research field. In the field of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), performance evaluation
can be conducted on real-world aggregate signals, provided by smart energy meters, or artificial
superpositions of individual load signals (i.e., denoised aggregates). It has long been suspected
that testing on these denoised aggregates provides better evaluation results mainly due to the
fact that the signal is less complex. Complexity in real-world aggregate signals increases with
the number of unknown/untracked load. Although this is a know performance reporting problem, an
investigation in the actual performance gap between real and denoised testing is still pending.
In this paper, we examine the performance gap between testing on real-world and denoised aggregates
with the aim of bringing clarity into this matter. Starting with an assessment of noise levels in
three datasets, we find significant differences in test cases. We give broad insights into our evaluation
setup comprising three load disaggregation algorithms, two of them relying on neural network architectures.
The results presented in this paper, based on studies covering three scenarios with ascending noise
levels, show a strong tendency towards load disaggregation algorithms providing significantly
better performance on denoised aggregate signals. A closer look at the outcome of our studies reveals
that all appliance types could be subject to this phenomenon. We conclude the paper by discussing
aspects that could be causing these considerable gaps between real and denoised testing in NILM.
