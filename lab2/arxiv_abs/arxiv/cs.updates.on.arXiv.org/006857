Advertisements are unavoidable in modern society. Times Square is notorious for its incessant
display of advertisements. Its popularity is worldwide and smaller cities possess miniature versions
of the display, such as Pittsburgh and its digital works in Oakland on Forbes Avenue. Tokyo's Ginza
district recently rose to popularity due to its upscale shops and constant onslaught of advertisements
to pedestrians. Advertisements arise in other mediums as well. For example, they help popular streaming
services, such as Spotify, Hulu, and Youtube TV gather significant streams of revenue to reduce
the cost of monthly subscriptions for consumers. Ads provide an additional source of money for companies
and entire industries to allocate resources toward alternative business motives. They are attractive
to companies and nearly unavoidable for consumers. One challenge for advertisers is examining
a advertisement's effectiveness or usefulness in conveying a message to their targeted demographics.
Rather than constructing a single, static image of content, a video advertisement possesses hundreds
of frames of data with varying scenes, actors, objects, and complexity. Therefore, measuring effectiveness
of video advertisements is important to impacting a billion-dollar industry. This paper explores
the combination of human-annotated features and common video processing techniques to predict
effectiveness ratings of advertisements collected from Youtube. This task is seen as a binary (effective
vs. non-effective), four-way, and five-way machine learning classification task. The first findings
in terms of accuracy and inference on this dataset, as well as some of the first ad research, on a small
dataset are presented. Accuracies of 84\%, 65\%, and 55\% are reached on the binary, four-way, and
five-way tasks respectively.
