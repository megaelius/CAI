Consider an MISO channel overheard by multiple eavesdroppers. Our goal is to design an artificial
noise (AN)-aided transmit strategy, such that the achievable secrecy rate is maximized subject
to the sum power constraint. AN-aided secure transmission has recently been found to be a promising
approach for blocking eavesdropping attempts. In many existing studies, the confidential information
transmit covariance and the AN covariance are not simultaneously optimized. In particular, for
design convenience, it is common to prefix the AN covariance as a specific kind of spatially isotropic
covariance. This paper considers joint optimization of the transmit and AN covariances for secrecy
rate maximization (SRM), with a design flexibility that the AN can take any spatial pattern. Hence,
the proposed design has potential in jamming the eavesdroppers more effectively, based upon the
channel state information (CSI). We derive an optimization approach to the SRM problem through
both analysis and convex conic optimization machinery. We show that the SRM problem can be recast
as a single-variable optimization problem, and that resultant problem can be efficiently handled
by solving a sequence of semidefinite programs. Our framework deals with a general setup of multiple
multi-antenna eavesdroppers, and can cater for additional constraints arising from specific
application scenarios, such as interference temperature constraints in interference networks.
We also generalize the framework to an imperfect CSI case where a worst-case robust SRM formulation
is considered. A suboptimal but safe solution to the outage-constrained robust SRM design is also
investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed AN-aided SRM design yields significant
secrecy rate gains over an optimal no-AN design and the isotropic AN design, especially when there
are more eavesdroppers.
