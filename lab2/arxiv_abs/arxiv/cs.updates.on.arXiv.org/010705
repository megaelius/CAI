Due to the popularity of context-awareness in the Internet of Things (IoT) and the recent advanced
features in the most popular IoT device, i.e., smartphone, modeling and predicting personalized
usage behavior based on relevant contexts can be highly useful in assisting them to carry out daily
routines and activities. Usage patterns of different categories smartphone apps such as social
networking, communication, entertainment, or daily life services related apps usually vary greatly
between individuals. People use these apps differently in different contexts, such as temporal
context, spatial context, individual mood and preference, work status, Internet connectivity
like Wifi? status, or device related status like phone profile, battery level etc. Thus, we consider
individuals' apps usage as a multi-class context-aware problem for personalized modeling and
prediction. Random Forest learning is one of the most popular machine learning techniques to build
a multi-class prediction model. Therefore, in this paper, we present an effective context-aware
smartphone apps prediction model, and name it "AppsPred" using random forest machine learning
technique that takes into account optimal number of trees based on such multi-dimensional contexts
to build the resultant forest. The effectiveness of this model is examined by conducting experiments
on smartphone apps usage datasets collected from individual users. The experimental results show
that our AppsPred significantly outperforms other popular machine learning classification approaches
like ZeroR, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression while predicting
smartphone apps in various context-aware test cases.
