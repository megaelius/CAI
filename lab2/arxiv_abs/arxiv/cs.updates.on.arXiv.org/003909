Demand Response (DR) schemes are effective tools to maintain a dynamic balance in energy markets
with higher integration of fluctuating renewable energy sources. DR schemes can be used to harness
residential devices' flexibility and to utilize it to achieve social and financial objectives.
However, existing DR schemes suffer from low user participation as they fail at taking into account
the users' requirements. First, DR schemes are highly demanding for the users, as users need to provide
direct information, e.g. via surveys, on their energy consumption preferences. Second, the user
utility models based on these surveys are hard-coded and do not adapt over time. Third, the existing
scheduling techniques require the users to input their energy requirements on a daily basis. As
an alternative, this paper proposes a DR scheme for user-oriented direct load-control of residential
appliances operations. Instead of relying on user surveys to evaluate the user utility, we propose
an online data-driven approach for estimating user utility functions, purely based on available
load consumption data, that adaptively models the users' preference over time. Our scheme is based
on a day-ahead scheduling technique that transparently prescribes the users with optimal device
operation schedules that take into account both financial benefits and user-perceived quality
of service. To model day-ahead user energy demand and flexibility, we propose a probabilistic approach
for generating flexibility models under uncertainty. Results on both real-world and simulated
datasets show that our DR scheme can provide significant financial benefits while preserving the
user-perceived quality of service.
