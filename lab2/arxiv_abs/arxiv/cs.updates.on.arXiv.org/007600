Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with different degrees of aggressiveness,
variable prognosis and various heterogeneous histologic sub-regions, i.e., peritumoral edematous/invaded
tissue, necrotic core, active and non-enhancing core. This intrinsic heterogeneity is also portrayed
in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by varying intensity profiles disseminated
across multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological
properties. Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that make these
tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount of resected tumor is a factor
also considered in longitudinal scans, when evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis
of progression. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the various
tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis towards prediction of patient
overall survival. This study assesses the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used
for brain tumor image analysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the International
Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, i.e., 2012-2018. Specifically, we focus on i) evaluating
segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions in pre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential
tumor progression by virtue of longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANO
criteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRI scans of patients
that underwent gross total resection. Finally, we investigate the challenge of identifying the
best ML algorithms for each of these tasks, considering that apart from being diverse on each instance
of the challenge, the multi-institutional mpMRI BraTS dataset has also been a continuously evolving/growing
dataset.
