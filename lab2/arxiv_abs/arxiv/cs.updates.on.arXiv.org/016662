Efficient integration of uncertain observations with decision-making optimization is key for
prescribing informed intervention actions, able to preserve structural safety of deteriorating
engineering systems. To this end, it is necessary that scheduling of inspection and monitoring
strategies be objectively performed on the basis of their expected value-based gains that, among
others, reflect quantitative metrics such as the Value of Information (VoI) and the Value of Structural
Health Monitoring (VoSHM). In this work, we introduce and study the theoretical and computational
foundations of the above metrics within the context of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs), thus alluding to a broad class of decision-making problems of partially observable stochastic
deteriorating environments that can be modeled as POMDPs. Step-wise and life-cycle VoI and VoSHM
definitions are devised and their bounds are analyzed as per the properties stemming from the Bellman
equation and the resulting optimal value function. It is shown that a POMDP policy inherently leverages
the notion of VoI to guide observational actions in an optimal way at every decision step, and that
the permanent or intermittent information provided by SHM or inspection visits, respectively,
can only improve the cost of this policy in the long-term, something that is not necessarily true
under locally optimal policies, typically adopted in decision-making of structures and infrastructure.
POMDP solutions are derived based on point-based value iteration methods, and the various definitions
are quantified in stationary and non-stationary deteriorating environments, with both infinite
and finite planning horizons, featuring single- or multi-component engineering systems.
