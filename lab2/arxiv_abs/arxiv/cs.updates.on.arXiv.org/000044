Increasing popularity of decentralized P2P architecture emphasizes on the need to come across
an overlay structure that can provide efficient content discovery mechanism, accommodate high
churn rate and adapt to failures. Traditional p2p systems are not able to solve the problems relating
scalability and high churn rates. Hierarchical model were introduced to provide better fault isolation,
effective bandwidth utilization, a superior adaptation to the underlying physical network and
a reduction of the lookup path length as additional advantages. It is more efficient and easier to
manage than traditional p2p networks. This paper discusses a further step in p2p hierarchy via 3-layers
hierarchical model with distributed database architecture in different layer, each of which is
connected through its root. The peers are divided into three categories according to their physical
stability and strength. They are Ultra Super-peer, Super-peer and Ordinary Peer and we assign these
peers to first, second and third level of hierarchy respectively. Peers in a group in lower layer
have their own local database which hold as associated super-peer in middle layer and access the
database among the peers through user queries. In our 3-layer hierarchical model for DHT algorithms,
we used an advanced Chord algorithm with optimized finger table which can remove the redundant entry
in the finger table in upper layer that influences the system to reduce the lookup latency. Our research
work finally resulted that our model really provides faster search since the network lookup latency
is decreased by reducing the number of hops. The peers in such network then can contribute with improve
functionality and can perform well in P2P networks.
