In this paper, we propose a spatial coded modulation (SCM) scheme, which improves the accuracy of
the active antenna detection by coding over the transmit antennas. Specifically, the antenna activation
pattern in the SCM corresponds to a codeword in a properly designed codebook with a larger minimum
Hamming distance than its counterpart conventional spatial modulation. As the minimum Hamming
distance increases, the reliability of the active antenna detection is directly enhanced, which
in turn improves the demodulation of the modulated symbols and yields a better system reliability.
In addition to the reliability, the proposed SCM scheme also achieves a higher capacity with the
identical antenna configuration compared to the conventional spatial modulation technique.
Moreover, the proposed SCM scheme strikes a balance between spectral efficiency and reliability
by trading off the minimum Hamming distance with the number of available codewords. The optimal
maximum likelihood detector is first formulated. Then, a low-complexity suboptimal detector
is proposed to reduce the computational complexity, which has a two-step detection. Theoretical
derivations of the channel capacity and the bit error rate are presented in various channel scenarios,
i.e., Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m, imperfect channel state information, and spatial correlation.
Further derivation on performance bounding is also provided to reveal the insight of the benefit
of increasing the minimum Hamming distance. Numerical results validate the analysis and demonstrate
that the proposed SCM outperforms the conventional spatial modulation techniques in both channel
capacity and system reliability.
