The robust state estimation problem is on how to design robust filters for estimating an unknown
state of uncertain systems. This paper considers this problem for multi-agent systems with multiplicative
noise and degraded measurements over corrupted channels. Employing a covariance intersection
fusion method, we propose a distributed robust Kalman filter with stochastic gains, which enables
a sequence of upper bounds of conditional mean square error given channel noise to be calculated
online. Considering the limitation of step-wise optimization, for better performance, we propose
a switching fusion scheme based on a sliding window method, which provides an online design of covariance
intersection weights by solving a semi-definite programming problem. Compared to the filter fusing
latest estimates, the one based on the switching fusion method has a smaller upper bound of the conditional
mean square error. We present a robust collective observability condition, which degenerates
to the traditional collective observability condition for time-varying stochastic systems if
there is no measurement degradation or multiplicative noise. Under this condition and strong connectivity,
we prove that the mean square errors of two filters are both uniformly upper bounded by a constant
matrix over a finite transient time, which depends on the system observability and the network size.
Different to existing results, some requirements including stability for the systems and observability
of the sub-systems are not needed for our results. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to
validate the theoretical results.
