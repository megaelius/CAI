In this paper, a novel swarm intelligent algorithm is proposed, known as the fitness dependent optimizer
(FDO). The bee swarming reproductive process and their collective decision-making have inspired
this algorithm; it has no algorithmic connection with the honey bee algorithm or the artificial
bee colony algorithm. It is worth mentioning that FDO is considered a particle swarm optimization
(PSO)-based algorithm that updates the search agent position by adding velocity (pace). However,
FDO calculates velocity differently; it uses the problem fitness function value to produce weights,
and these weights guide the search agents during both the exploration and exploitation phases.
Throughout the paper, the FDO algorithm is presented, and the motivation behind the idea is explained.
Moreover, FDO is tested on a group of 19 classical benchmark test functions, and the results are compared
with three well-known algorithms: PSO, the genetic algorithm (GA), and the dragonfly algorithm
(DA), additionally, FDO is tested on IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation Benchmark Test
Functions (CEC-C06, 2019 Competition) [1]. The results are compared with three modern algorithms:
(DA), the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). The FDO results
show better performance in most cases and comparative results in other cases. Furthermore, the
results are statistically tested with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to show the significance of the
results. Likewise, FDO stability in both the exploration and exploitation phases is verified and
performance-proofed using different standard measurements. Finally, FDO is applied to real-world
applications as evidence of its feasibility.
