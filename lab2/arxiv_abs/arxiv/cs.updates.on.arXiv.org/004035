The launch of KALPANA-1 satellite in the year 2002 heralded the establishment of an indigenous operational
payload for meteorological predictions. This was further enhanced in the year 2003 with the launching
of INSAT-3A satellite. The software for generating products from the data of these two satellites
was taken up subsequently in the year 2004 and the same was installed at the Indian Meteorological
Department, New Delhi in January 2006. Registration has been one of the most fundamental operations
to generate almost all the data products from the remotely sensed data. Registration is a challenging
task due to inevitable radiometric and geometric distortions during the acquisition process.
Besides the presence of clouds makes the problem more complicated. In this paper, we present an algorithm
for multitemporal and multiband registration. In addition, India facing reference boundaries
for the CCD data of INSAT-3A have also been generated. The complete implementation is made up of the
following steps: 1) automatic identification of the ground control points (GCPs) in the sensed
data, 2) finding the optimal transformation model based on the match-points, and 3) resampling
the transformed imagery to the reference coordinates. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated
using the real datasets from KALPANA-1 and INSAT-3A. Both KALAPANA-1 and INSAT-3A have recently
been decommissioned due to lack of fuel, however, the experience gained from them have given rise
to a series of meteorological satellites and associated software; like INSAT-3D series which give
continuous weather forecasting for the country. This paper is not so much focused on the theory (widely
available in the literature) but concentrates on the implementation of operational software.
