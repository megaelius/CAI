Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are remote-controlled vehicles capable of flight and are present
in a variety of environments from military operations to domestic enjoyment. These vehicles are
great assets, but just as their pilot can control them remotely, cyberattacks can be executed in
a similar manner. Cyber attacks on UAVs can bring a plethora of issues to physical and virtual systems.
Such malfunctions are capable of giving an attacker the ability to steal data, incapacitate the
UAV, or hijack the UAV. To mitigate such attacks, it is necessary to identify and patch vulnerabilities
that may be maliciously exploited. In this paper, a new UAV vulnerability is explored with related
UAV security practices identified for possible exploitation using large streams of data sent at
specific ports. The more in-depth model involves strings of data involving FTP-specific keywords
sent to the UAV's FTP port in the form of a fuzzing test and launching thousands of packets at other
ports on the UAV as well. During these tests, virtual and physical systems are monitored extensively
to identify specific patterns and vulnerabilities. This model is applied to a Parrot Bebop 2, which
accurately portrays a UAV that had their network compromised by an attacker and portrays many lower-end
UAV models for domestic use. During testings, the Parrot Bebop 2 is monitored for degradation in
GPS performance, video speed, the UAV's reactivity to the pilot, motor function, and the accuracy
of the UAV's sensor data. All these points of monitoring give a comprehensive view of the UAV's reaction
to each individual test. In this paper, countermeasures to combat the exploitation of this vulnerability
will be discussed as well as possible attacks that can branch from the fuzzing tests.
