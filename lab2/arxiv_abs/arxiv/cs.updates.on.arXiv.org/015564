Facial attractiveness enhancement has been an interesting application in Computer Vision and
Graphics over these years. It aims to generate a more attractive face via manipulations on image
and geometry structure while preserving face identity. In this paper, we propose the first Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) for enhancing facial attractiveness in both geometry and appearance
aspects, which we call "FA-GANs". FA-GANs contain two branches and enhance facial attractiveness
in two perspectives: facial geometry and facial appearance. Each branch consists of individual
GANs with the appearance branch adjusting the facial image and the geometry branch adjusting the
facial landmarks in appearance and geometry aspects, respectively. Unlike the traditional facial
manipulations learning from paired faces, which are infeasible to collect before and after enhancement
of the same individual, we achieve this by learning the features of attractiveness faces through
unsupervised adversarial learning. The proposed FA-GANs are able to extract attractiveness features
and impose them on the enhancement results. To better enhance faces, both the geometry and appearance
networks are considered to refine the facial attractiveness by adjusting the geometry layout of
faces and the appearance of faces independently. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
enhance the facial attractiveness with GANs in both geometry and appearance aspects. The experimental
results suggest that our FA-GANs can generate compelling perceptual results in both geometry structure
and facial appearance and outperform current state-of-the-art methods.
