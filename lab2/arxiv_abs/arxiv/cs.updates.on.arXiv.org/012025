Wastewater infrastructure systems deteriorate over time due to a combination of physical and chemical
factors. Failure of this significant infrastructure could affect important social, environmental,
and economic impacts. Furthermore, recognizing the optimized timeline for inspection of sewer
pipelines are challenging tasks for the utility managers and other authorities. Regular examination
of sewer networks is not cost-effective due to limited time and high cost of assessment technologies
and a large inventory of pipes. To avoid such obstacles, various researchers endeavored to improve
infrastructure condition assessment methodologies to maintain sewer pipe systems at the desired
condition. Sewer condition prediction models are developed to provide a framework to forecast
the future condition of pipes to schedule inspection frequencies. The main goal of this study is
to develop a predictive model for wastewater pipes using random forest classification. Predictive
models can effectively predict sewer pipe condition and can increase the certainty level of the
predictive results and decrease uncertainty in the current condition of wastewater pipes. The
developed random forest classification model has achieved a stratified test set false negative
rate, the false positive rate, and an excellent area under the ROC curve of 0.81 in a case study application
for the City of LA, California. An area under the ROC curve > 0.80 indicates the developed model is
an "excellent" choice for predicting the condition of individual pipes in a sewer network. The deterioration
models can be used in the industry to improve the inspection timeline and maintenance planning.
