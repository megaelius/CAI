Routing is a challenging problem for wireless ad hoc networks, especially when the nodes are mobile
and spread so widely that in most cases multiple hops are needed to route a message from one node to
another. In fact, it is known that any online routing protocol has a poor performance in the worst
case, in a sense that there is a distribution of nodes resulting in bad routing paths for that protocol,
even if the nodes know their geographic positions and the geographic position of the destination
of a message is known. The reason for that is that radio holes in the ad hoc network may require messages
to take long detours in order to get to a destination, which are hard to find in an online fashion. In
this paper, we assume that the wireless ad hoc network can make limited use of long-range links provided
by a global communication infrastructure like a cellular infrastructure or a satellite in order
to compute an abstraction of the wireless ad hoc network that allows the messages to be sent along
near-shortest paths in the ad hoc network. We present distributed algorithms that compute an abstraction
of the ad hoc network in $\mathcal{O}\left(\log ^2 n\right)$ time using long-range links, which
results in $c$-competitive routing paths between any two nodes of the ad hoc network for some constant
$c$ if the convex hulls of the radio holes do not intersect. We also show that the storage needed for
the abstraction just depends on the number and size of the radio holes in the wireless ad hoc network
and is independent on the total number of nodes, and this information just has to be known to a few nodes
for the routing to work.
