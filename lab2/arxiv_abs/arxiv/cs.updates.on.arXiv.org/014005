In this paper we address the problem of designing online algorithms for dynamic matching markets
in distribution systems whose objective is to maximize social welfare while being effective in
integrating renewable energy by leveraging load flexibility. With the intuition that the performance
of any online algorithm would worsen with increasing randomness, we propose two indicators for
measuring the effectiveness of an online algorithm. First one is convergence to optimality (CO)
as the randomness goes to zero. The second one focuses on the deviation from optimality measured
as a function of the standard deviation, $\sigma$, of the underlying randomness: renewable generation
and customer loads. We take into account the fact that a customer's value decreases with delay in
load servicing. We present a pair of online matching algorithms for the following generation-consumption
conditions: (i) when the mean of renewable generation ($\mu_s$) is greater than the mean of the number
of customers ($\mu_n$) (assumed to be unit demand), and (ii) when the condition (i) is reversed.
The online algorithm we present for the first case satisfies CO with a deviation that varies as $\sim
O(\sigma)$. But the same algorithm fails to satisfy CO for the second case. We then present an extension
of this algorithm and show that the modified algorithm satisfies CO for the second case with a deviation
that varies as $\sim O(\sigma)$ plus an offset that is $O(\mu_n - \mu_s)$. Thus, there are two distinct
regimes in the set of all possible generation-consumption conditions, with the platform requiring
a distinct algorithm for each regime to be effective in terms of the indicators described above.
