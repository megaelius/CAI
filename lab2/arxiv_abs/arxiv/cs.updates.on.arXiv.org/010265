Monitoring population-level changes in diet could be useful for education and for implementing
interventions to improve health. Research has shown that data from social media sources can be used
for monitoring dietary behavior. We propose a scrape-by-location methodology to create food image
datasets from Instagram posts. We used it to collect 3.56 million images over a period of 20 days in
March 2019. We also propose a scrape-by-keywords methodology and used it to scrape ~30,000 images
and their captions of 38 Kenyan food types. We publish two datasets of 104,000 and 8,174 image/caption
pairs, respectively. With the first dataset, Kenya104K, we train a Kenyan Food Classifier, called
KenyanFC, to distinguish Kenyan food from non-food images posted in Kenya. We used the second dataset,
KenyanFood13, to train a classifier KenyanFTR, short for Kenyan Food Type Recognizer, to recognize
13 popular food types in Kenya. The KenyanFTR is a multimodal deep neural network that can identify
13 types of Kenyan foods using both images and their corresponding captions. Experiments show that
the average top-1 accuracy of KenyanFC is 99% over 10,400 tested Instagram images and of KenyanFTR
is 81% over 8,174 tested data points. Ablation studies show that three of the 13 food types are particularly
difficult to categorize based on image content only and that adding analysis of captions to the image
analysis yields a classifier that is 9 percent points more accurate than a classifier that relies
only on images. Our food trend analysis revealed that cakes and roasted meats were the most popular
foods in photographs on Instagram in Kenya in March 2019.
