Dempster-Shafer evidence theory has been widely used in various fields of applications, because
of the flexibility and effectiveness in modeling uncertainties without prior information. Besides,
it has been proven that the quantum theory has powerful capabilities of solving the decision making
problems, especially for modelling human decision and cognition. However, due to the inconsistency
of the expression, the classical Dempster-Shafer evidence theory modelled by real numbers can
not be integrated directly with the quantum theory modelled by complex numbers. So, how can we establish
a bridge of communications between the classical Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and the quantum
theory? To answer this question, a generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is proposed in
this paper. The main contribution in this study is that, unlike the existing evidence theory, a mass
function in the generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is modelled by a complex number, called
as a complex mass function. In addition, compared with the classical Dempster's combination rule,
the condition in terms of the conflict coefficient between two evidences (K < 1) is released in the
generalized Dempster's combination rule so that it is more general and applicable than the classical
Dempster's combination rule. When the complex mass function is degenerated from complex numbers
to real numbers, the generalized Dempster's combination rule degenerates to the classical evidence
theory under the condition that the conflict coefficient between two evidences K is less than 1.
This generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory provides a promising way to model and handle
more uncertain information. Numerical examples are illustrated to show the efficiency of the generalized
Dempster-Shafer evidence theory.
