We exploit altered patterns in brain functional connectivity as features for automatic discriminative
analysis of neuropsychiatric patients. Deep learning methods have been introduced to functional
network classification only very recently for fMRI, and the proposed architectures essentially
focused on a single type of connectivity measure. We propose a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) framework for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived brain connectome
in schizophrenia (SZ). To capture complementary aspects of disrupted connectivity in SZ, we explore
combination of various connectivity features consisting of time and frequency-domain metrics
of effective connectivity based on vector autoregressive model and partial directed coherence,
and complex network measures of network topology. We design a novel multi-domain connectome CNN
(MDC-CNN) based on a parallel ensemble of 1D and 2D CNNs to integrate the features from various domains
and dimensions using different fusion strategies. Hierarchical latent representations learned
by the multiple convolutional layers from EEG connectivity reveal apparent group differences
between SZ and healthy controls (HC). Results on a large resting-state EEG dataset show that the
proposed CNNs significantly outperform traditional support vector machine classifiers. The
MDC-CNN with combined connectivity features further improves performance over single-domain
CNNs using individual features, achieving remarkable accuracy of $93.06\%$ with a decision-level
fusion. The proposed MDC-CNN by integrating information from diverse brain connectivity descriptors
is able to accurately discriminate SZ from HC. The new framework is potentially useful for developing
diagnostic tools for SZ and other disorders.
