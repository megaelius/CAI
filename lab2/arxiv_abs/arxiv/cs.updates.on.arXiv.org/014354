Accurately predicting drug-target binding affinity (DTA) in silico is a key task in drug discovery.
Most of the conventional DTA prediction methods are simulation-based, which rely heavily on domain
knowledge or the assumption of having the 3D structure of the targets, which are often difficult
to obtain. Meanwhile, traditional machine learning-based methods apply various features and
descriptors, and simply depend on the similarities between drug-target pairs. Recently, with
the increasing amount of affinity data available and the success of deep representation learning
models on various domains, deep learning techniques have been applied to DTA prediction. However,
these methods consider either label/one-hot encodings or the topological structure of molecules,
without considering the local chemical context of amino acids and SMILES sequences. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel end-to-end learning framework, called DeepGS, which uses deep neural
networks to extract the local chemical context from amino acids and SMILES sequences, as well as
the molecular structure from the drugs. To assist the operations on the symbolic data, we propose
to use advanced embedding techniques (i.e., Smi2Vec and Prot2Vec) to encode the amino acids and
SMILES sequences to a distributed representation. Meanwhile, we suggest a new molecular structure
modeling approach that works well under our framework. We have conducted extensive experiments
to compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art models including KronRLS, SimBoost, DeepDTA
and DeepCPI. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiorities and competitiveness
of DeepGS.
