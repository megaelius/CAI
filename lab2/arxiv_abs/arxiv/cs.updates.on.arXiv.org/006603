Modern popular TV series often develop complex storylines spanning several seasons, but are usually
watched in quite a discontinuous way. As a result, the viewer generally needs a comprehensive summary
of the previous season plot before the new one starts. The generation of such summaries requires
first to identify and characterize the dynamics of the series subplots. One way of doing so is to study
the underlying social network of interactions between the characters involved in the narrative.
The standard tools used in the Social Networks Analysis field to extract such a network rely on an
integration of time, either over the whole considered period, or as a sequence of several time-slices.
However, they turn out to be inappropriate in the case of TV series, due to the fact the scenes showed
onscreen alternatively focus on parallel storylines, and do not necessarily respect a traditional
chronology. This makes existing extraction methods inefficient to describe the dynamics of relationships
between characters, or to get a relevant instantaneous view of the current social state in the plot.
This is especially true for characters shown as interacting with each other at some previous point
in the plot but temporarily neglected by the narrative. In this article, we introduce narrative
smoothing, a novel, still exploratory, network extraction method. It smooths the relationship
dynamics based on the plot properties, aiming at solving some of the limitations present in the standard
approaches. In order to assess our method, we apply it to a new corpus of 3 popular TV series, and compare
it to both standard approaches. Our results are promising, showing narrative smoothing leads to
more relevant observations when it comes to the characterization of the protagonists and their
relationships. It could be used as a basis for further modeling the intertwined storylines constituting
TV series plots.
