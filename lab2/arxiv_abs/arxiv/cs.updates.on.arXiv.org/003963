Word equations are a crucial element in the theoretical foundation of constraint solving over strings,
which have received a lot of attention in recent years. A word equation relates two words over string
variables and constants. Its solution amounts to a function mapping variables to constant strings
that equate the left and right hand sides of the equation. While the problem of solving word equations
is decidable, the decidability of the problem of solving a word equation with a length constraint
(i.e., a constraint relating the lengths of words in the word equation) has remained a long-standing
open problem. In this paper, we focus on the subclass of quadratic word equations, i.e., in which
each variable occurs at most twice. We first show that the length abstractions of solutions to quadratic
word equations are in general not Presburger-definable. We then describe a class of counter systems
with Presburger transition relations which capture the length abstraction of a quadratic word
equation with regular constraints. We provide an encoding of the effect of a simple loop of the counter
systems in the theory of existential Presburger Arithmetic with divisibility (PAD). Since PAD
is decidable, we get a decision procedure for quadratic words equations with length constraints
for which the associated counter system is \emph{flat} (i.e., all nodes belong to at most one cycle).
We show a decidability result (in fact, also an NP algorithm with a PAD oracle) for a recently proposed
NP-complete fragment of word equations called regular-oriented word equations, together with
length constraints. Decidability holds when the constraints are additionally extended with regular
constraints with a 1-weak control structure.
