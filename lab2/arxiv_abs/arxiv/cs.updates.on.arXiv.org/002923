Recent advances in deep learning have significantly increased the performance of face recognition
systems. The performance and reliability of these models depend heavily on the amount and quality
of the training data. However, the collection of annotated large datasets does not scale well and
the control over the quality of the data decreases with the size of the dataset. In this work, we explore
how synthetically generated data can be used to decrease the number of real-world images needed
for training deep face recognition systems. In particular, we make use of a 3D morphable face model
for the generation of images with arbitrary amounts of facial identities and with full control over
image variations, such as pose, illumination, and background. In our experiments with an off-the-shelf
face recognition software we observe the following phenomena: 1) The amount of real training data
needed to train competitive deep face recognition systems can be reduced significantly. 2) Combining
large-scale real-world data with synthetic data leads to an increased performance. 3) Models trained
only on synthetic data with strong variations in pose, illumination, and background perform very
well across different datasets even without dataset adaptation. 4) The real-to-virtual performance
gap can be closed when using synthetic data for pre-training, followed by fine-tuning with real-world
images. 5) There are no observable negative effects of pre-training with synthetic data. Thus,
any face recognition system in our experiments benefits from using synthetic face images. The synthetic
data generator, as well as all experiments, are publicly available.
