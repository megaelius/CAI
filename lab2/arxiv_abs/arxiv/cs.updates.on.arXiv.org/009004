In patients with obstructive coronary artery disease, the functional significance of a coronary
artery stenosis needs to be determined to guide treatment. This is typically established through
fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement, performed during invasive coronary angiography (ICA).
We present a method for automatic and non-invasive detection of functionally significant coronary
artery stenosis, employing deep unsupervised analysis of complete coronary arteries in cardiac
CT angiography (CCTA) images. We retrospectively collected CCTA scans of 187 patients, 137 of them
underwent invasive FFR measurement in 192 different coronary arteries. These FFR measurements
served as a reference standard for the functional significance of the coronary stenosis. The centerlines
of the coronary arteries were extracted and used to reconstruct straightened multi-planar reformatted
(MPR) volumes. To automatically identify arteries with functionally significant stenosis, each
MPR volume was encoded into a fixed number of encodings using two disjoint 3D and 1D convolutional
autoencoders performing spatial and sequential encodings, respectively. Thereafter, these
encodings were employed to classify arteries according to the presence of functionally significant
stenosis using a support vector machine classifier. The detection of functionally significant
stenosis, evaluated using repeated cross-validation experiments, resulted in an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve of $0.81 \pm 0.02$ on the artery-level, and $0.87 \pm 0.02$
on the patient-level. The results demonstrate that automatic non-invasive detection of the functionally
significant stenosis in coronary arteries, using characteristics of complete coronary arteries
in CCTA images, is feasible. This could potentially reduce the number of patients that unnecessarily
undergo ICA.
