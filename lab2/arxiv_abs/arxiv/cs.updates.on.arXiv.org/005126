HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) is quickly becoming the dominant video delivery technique for adaptive
streaming over the Internet. Still considered as its primary challenges are determining the optimal
rate adaptation and improving both the quality of experience (QoE) and QoE-fairness. Most of the
proposed approaches have relied on local information to find a result. However, employing techniques
that provide a comprehensive and central view of the network resources can lead to more gains in performance.
By leveraging software defined networking (SDN), this paper proposes an SDN-based framework,
named S2VC, to maximize QoE metrics and QoE-fairness in SVC-based HTTP adaptive streaming. The
proposed framework determines both the optimal adaptation and data paths for delivering the requested
video files from HTTP-media servers to DASH clients. In fact, by utilizing an SDN controller and
its complete view of the network, we introduce an SVC flow optimizer (SFO) application module to
determine the optimal solution in a centralized and time slot fashion. In the current approach,
we first formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model.
The MILP is designed in such a way that it applies defined policies, e.g. setting priorities for clients
in obtaining video quality. Secondly, we show that this problem is NP-complete and propose an LP-relaxation
model to enable S2VC framework for performing rate adaptation on a large-scale network. Finally,
we conduct experiments by emulating the proposed framework in Mininet, with the usage of Floodlight
as the SDN controller. In terms of improving QoE-fairness and QoE metrics, the effectiveness of
the proposed framework is validated by a comparison with different approaches.
