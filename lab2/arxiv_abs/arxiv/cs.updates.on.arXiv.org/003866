The notions of knowledge and its management have been at the core of the information systems (IS)
field almost since its inception. Knowledge has been viewed in several ways in the prior literature,
including as a state of mind, an object, a process, access to information, and a capability. A commonly-used
definition characterizes knowledge as a justified belief that increases an entity's capacity
for effective action (Alavi and Leidner 2001, p. 109). Relatedly, knowledge management (KM) has
been defined as a systemic process to acquire, organize, and communicate individual knowledge
so that others may make use of it (Beck et al. 2014). Knowledge-management systems (KMSs) support
these processes for creating, exchanging, and storing knowledge (Beck et al. 2014), and have been
viewed as being either repository- based or network-based (Kankanhalli et al. 2005). In an attempt
to provide a useful resource for scholars interested in KM, we take stock of the pertinent research
published in MISQ. More specifically, the goal of this curation is to serve as a living document that
will offer a starting point for future KM research. This curation highlights the 44 articles with
a primary focus on KM (Table 1). The articles address theoretical and conceptual issues, provide
methodological guidance, and use a wide range of quantitative and qualitative research methods.
To define the scope of this curation, we excluded: (1) articles in which KM is used as part of another
construct; (2) some early articles that were practice- oriented with limited scholarly orientation;
and (3) articles that focus on knowledge (such as the knowledge requirements of IS professionals)
but not on KM.
