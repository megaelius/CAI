Data assimilation provides algorithms for widespread applications in various fields. It is of
practical use to deal with a large amount of information in the complex system that is hard to estimate.
Weather forecasting is one of the applications, where the prediction of meteorological data are
corrected given the observations. Numerous approaches are contained in data assimilation. One
specific sequential method is the Kalman Filter. The core is to estimate unknown information with
the new data that is measured and the prior data that is predicted. As a matter of fact, there are different
improved methods in the Kalman Filter. In this project, the Ensemble Kalman Filter with perturbed
observations is considered. It is achieved by Monte Carlo simulation. In this method, the ensemble
is involved in the calculation instead of the state vectors. In addition, the measurement with perturbation
is viewed as the suitable observation. These changes compared with the Linear Kalman Filter make
it more advantageous in that applications are not restricted in linear systems any more and less
time is taken when the data are calculated by computers. The thesis seeks to develop the Ensemble
Kalman Filter with perturbed observation gradually. With the Mathematical preliminaries including
the introduction of dynamical systems, the Linear Kalman Filter is built. Meanwhile, the prediction
and analysis processes are derived. After that, we use the analogy thoughts to lead in the non-linear
Ensemble Kalman Filter with perturbed observations. Lastly, a classic Lorenz 63 model is illustrated
by MATLAB. In the example, we experiment on the number of ensemble members and seek to investigate
the relationships between the error of variance and the number of ensemble members. We reach the
conclusion that on a limited scale the larger number of ensemble members indicates the smaller error
of prediction.
