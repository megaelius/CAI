In intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted communication systems, the acquisition of channel
state information (CSI) is a crucial impediment for achieving the beamforming gain of IRS because
of the considerable overhead required for channel estimation. Specifically, under the current
beamforming design for IRS-assisted communications, $KMN+KM$ channel coefficients should be
estimated, where $K$, $N$ and $M$ denote the numbers of users, IRS reflecting elements, and antennas
at the base station (BS), respectively. To accurately estimate such a large number of channel coefficients
within a short time interval, we propose a novel three-phase pilot-based channel estimation framework
in this paper for IRS-assisted uplink multiuser communications. Under this framework, we analytically
prove that a time duration consisting of $K+N+\max(K-1,\lceil (K-1)N/M \rceil)$ pilot symbols
is sufficient for the BS to perfectly recover all the $KMN+KM$ channel coefficients for the case
without receiver noise at the BS. In contrast to the channel estimation for conventional uplink
communications without IRS where the minimum channel estimation time is independent of the number
of receive antennas at the BS, our result reveals the crucial role of massive MIMO (multiple-input
multiple-output) in reducing the channel estimation time for IRS-assisted communications. Further,
for the case with receiver noise, the user pilot sequences, IRS reflecting coefficients, and BS
linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimators are characterized in closed-form,
and the corresponding estimation mean-squared error (MSE) is quantified.
