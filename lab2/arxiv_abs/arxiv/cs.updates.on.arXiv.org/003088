Relational DBMSs continue to dominate the database market, and inference problem on external schema
of relational DBMS's is still an important issue in terms of data privacy.Especially for the last
10 years, external schema construction for application-specific database usage has increased
its independency from the conceptual schema, as the definitions and implementations of views and
procedures have been optimized. This paper offers an optimized decomposition strategy for the
external schema, which concentrates on the privacy policy and required associations of attributes
for the intended user roles. The method proposed in this article performs a proactive decomposition
of the external schema, in order to satisfy both the forbidden and required associations of attributes.Functional
dependency constraints of a database schema can be represented as a graph, in which vertices are
attribute sets and edges are functional dependencies. In this representation, inference problem
can be defined as a process of searching a subtree in the dependency graph containing the attributes
that need to be related. The optimized decomposition process aims to generate an external schema,
which guarantees the prevention of the inference of the forbidden attribute sets while guaranteeing
the association of the required attribute sets with a minimal loss of possible association among
other attributes, if the inhibited and required attribute sets are consistent with each other.
Our technique is purely proactive, and can be viewed as a normalization process. Due to the usage
independency of external schema construction tools, it can be easily applied to any existing systems
without rewriting data access layer of applications. Our extensive experimental analysis shows
the effectiveness of this optimized proactive strategy for a wide variety of logical schema volumes.
