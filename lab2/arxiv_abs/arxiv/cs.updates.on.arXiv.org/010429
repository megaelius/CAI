The biomanufacturing industry is growing rapidly and becoming one of the key drivers of personalized
medicine and life science. However, biopharmaceutical production faces critical challenges,
including complexity, high variability, long lead time and rapid changes in technologies, processes,
and regulatory environment. Driven by these challenges, we explore the bio-technology domain
knowledge and propose a rigorous risk and sensitivity analysis framework for biomanufacturing
innovation. Built on the causal relationships of raw material quality attributes, production
process, and bio-drug properties in safety and efficacy, we develop a Bayesian Network (BN) to model
the complex probabilistic interdependence between process parameters and quality attributes
of raw materials/in-process materials/drug substance. It integrates various sources of data
and leads to an interpretable probabilistic knowledge graph of the end-to-end production process.
Then, we introduce a systematic risk analysis to assess the criticality of process parameters and
quality attributes. The complex production processes often involve many process parameters and
quality attributes impacting the product quality variability. However, the real-world (batch)
data are often limited, especially for customized and personalized bio-drugs. We propose uncertainty
quantification and sensitivity analysis to analyze the impact of model risk. Given very limited
process data, the empirical results show that we can provide reliable and interpretable risk and
sensitivity analysis. Thus, the proposed framework can provide the science- and risk-based guidance
on the process monitoring, data collection, and process parameters specifications to facilitate
the production process learning and stability control.
