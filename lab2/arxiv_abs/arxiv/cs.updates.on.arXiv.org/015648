Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of compartment (SIR) models at local
scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local mixing. Here, we examine the effect of employing
more geographically detailed diffusion models based on known spatial features of interpersonal
networks, most particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the probability
of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19
diffusion in 19 U.S cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have
large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales
mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long
lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease
trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital
demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities
in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis
of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic
can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance
with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure
to generate highly non-uniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance
of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform healthcare planning, predict
community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.
