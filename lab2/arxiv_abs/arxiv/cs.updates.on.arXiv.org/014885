Deep cerebellar nuclei are a key structure of the cerebellum that are involved in processing motor
and sensory information. It is thus a crucial step to precisely segment deep cerebellar nuclei for
the understanding of the cerebellum system and its utility in deep brain stimulation treatment.
However, it is challenging to clearly visualize such small nuclei under standard clinical magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and therefore an automatic patient-specific segmentation
is not feasible. Recent advances in 7 Tesla (T) MRI technology and great potential of deep neural
networks facilitate automatic, fast, and accurate segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel
deep learning framework (referred to as DCN-Net) for the segmentation of deep cerebellar dentate
and interposed nuclei on 7T diffusion MRI. DCN-Net effectively encodes contextual information
on the image patches without consecutive pooling operations and adding complexity via proposed
dilated dense blocks. During the end-to-end training, label probabilities of dentate and interposed
nuclei are independently learned with a hybrid loss, handling highly imbalanced data. Finally,
we utilize self-training strategies to cope with the problem of limited labeled data. To this end,
auxiliary dentate and interposed nuclei labels are created on unlabeled data by using DCN-Net trained
on manual labels. We validate the proposed framework using 7T B0 MRIs from 60 subjects. Experimental
results demonstrate that DCN-Net provides better segmentation than atlas-based deep cerebellar
nuclei segmentation tools and other state-of-the-art deep neural networks in terms of accuracy
and consistency. We further prove the effectiveness of the proposed components within DCN-Net
in dentate and interposed nuclei segmentation.
