$R$-limited functions are multivariate generalization of band-limited functions whose Fourier
transforms are supported within a compact region $R\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In this work, we generalize
sampling and interpolation theorems for band-limited functions to $R$-limited functions. More
precisely, we investigated the following question: "For a function compactly supported within
a region similar to $R$, does there exist an $R$-limited function that agrees with the function over
its support for a desired accuracy?". Starting with the Fourier domain definition of an $R$-limited
function, we write the equivalent convolution and a discrete Fourier transform representations
for $R$-limited functions through approximation of the convolution kernel using a discrete subset
of Fourier basis. The accuracy of the approximation of the convolution kernel determines the accuracy
of the discrete Fourier representation. Construction of the discretization can be achieved using
the tools from approximation theory as demonstrated in the appendices. The main contribution of
this work is proving the equivalence between the discretization of the Fourier and convolution
representations of $R$-limited functions. Here discrete convolution representation is restricted
to shifts over a compactly supported region similar to $R$. We show that discrete shifts for the convolution
representation are equivalent to the spectral parameters used in discretization of the Fourier
representation of the convolution kernel. This result is a generalization of the cardinal theorem
of interpolation of band-limited functions. The error corresponding to discrete convolution
representation is also bounded by the approximation of the convolution kernel using discretized
Fourier basis.
