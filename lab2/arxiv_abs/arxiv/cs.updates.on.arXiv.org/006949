The problem of completing high-dimensional matrices from a limited set of observations arises
in many big data applications, especially, recommender systems. Existing matrix completion models
generally follow either a memory- or a model-based approach, whereas, geometric matrix completion
models combine the best from both approaches. Existing deep-learning-based geometric models
yield good performance, but, in order to operate, they require a fixed structure graph capturing
the relationships among the users and items. This graph is typically constructed by evaluating
a pre-defined similarity metric on the available observations or by using side information, e.g.,
user profiles. In contrast, Markov-random-fields-based models do not require a fixed structure
graph but rely on handcrafted features to make predictions. When no side information is available
and the number of available observations becomes very low, existing solutions are pushed to their
limits. In this paper, we propose a geometric matrix completion approach that addresses these challenges.
We consider matrix completion as a structured prediction problem in a conditional random field
(CRF), which is characterized by a maximum a posterior (MAP) inference, and we propose a deep model
that predicts the missing entries by solving the MAP inference problem. The proposed model simultaneously
learns the similarities among matrix entries, computes the CRF potentials, and solves the inference
problem. Its training is performed in an end-to-end manner, with a method to supervise the learning
of entry similarities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed model compared to various state-of-the-art models on popular benchmark datasets and
underline its superior capacity to deal with highly incomplete matrices.
