Efficient sequential matching of supply and demand is a problem of interest in many online to offline
services. For instance, Uber, Lyft, Grab for matching taxis to customers; Ubereats, Deliveroo,
FoodPanda etc for matching restaurants to customers. In these online to offline service problems,
individuals who are responsible for supply (e.g., taxi drivers, delivery bikes or delivery van
drivers) earn more by being at the "right" place at the "right" time. We are interested in developing
approaches that learn to guide individuals to be in the "right" place at the "right" time (to maximize
revenue) in the presence of other similar "learning" individuals and only local aggregated observation
of other agents states (e.g., only number of other taxis in same zone as current agent). A key characteristic
of the domains of interest is that the interactions between individuals are anonymous, i.e., the
outcome of an interaction (competing for demand) is dependent only on the number and not on the identity
of the agents. We model these problems using the Anonymous MARL (AyMARL) model. The key contribution
of this paper is in employing principle of maximum entropy to provide a general framework of independent
learning that is both empirically effective (even with only local aggregated information of agent
population distribution) and theoretically justified. Finally, our approaches provide a significant
improvement with respect to joint and individual revenue on a generic simulator for online to offline
services and a real world taxi problem over existing approaches. More importantly, this is achieved
while having the least variance in revenues earned by the learning individuals, an indicator of
fairness.
