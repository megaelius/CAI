Interpretability has always been a major concern for fuzzy rule-based classifiers. The usage of
human-readable models allows them to explain the reasoning behind their predictions and decisions.
However, when it comes to Big Data classification problems, fuzzy rule-based classifiers have
not been able to maintain the good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability that has characterized
these techniques in non-Big Data environments. The most accurate methods build too complex models
composed of a large number of rules and fuzzy sets, while those approaches focusing on interpretability
do not provide state-of-the-art discrimination capabilities. In this paper, we propose a new distributed
learning algorithm named CFM-BD to construct accurate and compact fuzzy rule-based classification
systems for Big Data. This method has been specifically designed from scratch for Big Data problems
and does not adapt or extend any existing algorithm. The proposed learning process consists of three
stages: 1) pre-processing based on the probability integral transform theorem; 2) rule induction
inspired by CHI-BD and Apriori algorithms; 3) rule selection by means of a global evolutionary optimization.
We conducted a complete empirical study to test the performance of our approach in terms of accuracy,
complexity, and runtime. The results obtained were compared and contrasted with four state-of-the-art
fuzzy classifiers for Big Data (FBDT, FMDT, Chi-Spark-RS, and CHI-BD). According to this study,
CFM-BD is able to provide competitive discrimination capabilities using significantly simpler
models composed of a few rules of less than 3 antecedents, employing 5 linguistic labels for all variables.
