Blockchain systems are designed to produce blocks at a constant average rate. The most popular systems
currently employ a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm as a means of creating these blocks. Bitcoin produces,
on average, one block every 10 minutes. An unfortunate limitation of all deployed PoW blockchain
systems is that the time between blocks has high variance. For example, 5% of the time, Bitcoin's
inter-block time is at least 40 minutes. This variance impedes the consistent flow of validated
transactions through the system. We propose an alternative process for PoW-based block discovery
that results in an inter-block time with significantly lower variance. Our algorithm, called Bobtail,
generalizes the current algorithm by comparing the mean of the k lowest order statistics to a target.
We show that the variance of inter-block times decreases as k increases. If our approach were applied
to Bitcoin, about 80% of blocks would be found within 7 to 12 minutes, and nearly every block would
be found within 5 to 18 minutes; the average inter-block time would remain at 10 minutes. Further,
we show that low-variance mining significantly thwarts doublespend and selfish mining attacks.
For Bitcoin and Ethereum currently (k=1), an attacker with 40% of the mining power will succeed with
30% probability when the merchant sets up an embargo of 8 blocks; however, when k>=20, the probability
of success falls to less than 1%. Similarly, for Bitcoin and Ethereum currently, a selfish miner
with 40% of the mining power will claim about 66% of blocks; however, when k>=5, the same miner will
find that selfish mining is less successful than honest mining. The cost of our approach is a larger
block header.
