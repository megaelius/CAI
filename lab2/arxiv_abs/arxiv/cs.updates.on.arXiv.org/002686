This paper derives new formulations for designing dominant pole placement based proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) controllers to handle second order processes with time delays (SOPTD). Previously, similar
attempts have been made for pole placement in delay-free systems. The presence of the time delay
term manifests itself as a higher order system with variable number of interlaced poles and zeros
upon Pade approximation, which makes it difficult to achieve precise pole placement control. We
here report the analytical expressions to constrain the closed loop dominant and non-dominant
poles at the desired locations in the complex s-plane, using a third order Pade approximation for
the delay term. However, invariance of the closed loop performance with different time delay approximation
has also been verified using increasing order of Pade, representing a closed to reality higher order
delay dynamics. The choice of the nature of non-dominant poles e.g. all being complex, real or a combination
of them modifies the characteristic equation and influences the achievable stability regions.
The effect of different types of non-dominant poles and the corresponding stability regions are
obtained for nine test-bench processes indicating different levels of open-loop damping and lag
to delay ratio. Next, we investigate which expression yields a wider stability region in the design
parameter space by using Monte Carlo simulations while uniformly sampling a chosen design parameter
space. Various time and frequency domain control performance parameters are investigated next,
as well as their deviations with uncertain process parameters, using thousands of Monte Carlo simulations,
around the robust stable solution for each of the nine test-bench processes.
