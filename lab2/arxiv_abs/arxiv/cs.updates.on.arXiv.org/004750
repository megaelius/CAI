We define a general model of stochastically-evolving graphs, namely the \emph{Edge-Uniform Stochastically-Evolving
Graphs}. In this model, each possible edge of an underlying general static graph evolves independently
being either alive or dead at each discrete time step of evolution following a (Markovian) stochastic
rule. The stochastic rule is identical for each possible edge and may depend on the past $k \ge 0$ observations
of the edge's state. We examine two kinds of random walks for a single agent taking place in such a dynamic
graph: (i) The \emph{Random Walk with a Delay} (\emph{RWD}), where at each step the agent chooses
(uniformly at random) an incident possible edge, i.e., an incident edge in the underlying static
graph, and then it waits till the edge becomes alive to traverse it. (ii) The more natural \emph{Random
Walk on what is Available} (\emph{RWA}) where the agent only looks at alive incident edges at each
time step and traverses one of them uniformly at random. Our study is on bounding the \emph{cover
time}, i.e., the expected time until each node is visited at least once by the agent. For \emph{RWD},
we provide a first upper bound for the cases $k = 0, 1$ by correlating \emph{RWD} with a simple random
walk on a static graph. Moreover, we present a modified electrical network theory capturing the
$k = 0$ case. For \emph{RWA}, we derive some first bounds for the case $k = 0$, by reducing \emph{RWA}
to an \emph{RWD}-equivalent walk with a modified delay. Further, we also provide a framework, which
is shown to compute the exact value of the cover time for a general family of stochastically-evolving
graphs in exponential time. Finally, we conduct experiments on the cover time of \emph{RWA} in Edge-Uniform
graphs and compare the experimental findings with our theoretical bounds.
