Life's most valuable asset is health. Continuously understanding the state of our health and modeling
how it evolves is essential if we wish to improve it. Given the opportunity that people live with more
data about their life today than any other time in history, the challenge rests in interweaving this
data with the growing body of knowledge to compute and model the health state of an individual continually.
This dissertation presents an approach to build a personal model and dynamically estimate the health
state of an individual by fusing multi-modal data and domain knowledge. The system is stitched together
from four essential abstraction elements: 1. the events in our life, 2. the layers of our biological
systems (from molecular to an organism), 3. the functional utilities that arise from biological
underpinnings, and 4. how we interact with these utilities in the reality of daily life. Connecting
these four elements via graph network blocks forms the backbone by which we instantiate a digital
twin of an individual. Edges and nodes in this graph structure are then regularly updated with learning
techniques as data is continuously digested. Experiments demonstrate the use of dense and heterogeneous
real-world data from a variety of personal and environmental sensors to monitor individual cardiovascular
health state. State estimation and individual modeling is the fundamental basis to depart from
disease-oriented approaches to a total health continuum paradigm. Precision in predicting health
requires understanding state trajectory. By encasing this estimation within a navigational approach,
a systematic guidance framework can plan actions to transition a current state towards a desired
one. This work concludes by presenting this framework of combining the health state and personal
graph model to perpetually plan and assist us in living life towards our goals.
