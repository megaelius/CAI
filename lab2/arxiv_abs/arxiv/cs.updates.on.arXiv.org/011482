We consider the optimal multi-agent persistent monitoring problem defined for a team of agents
traversing on a set of nodes (targets) interconnected according to a fixed graph topology. The underlying
objective is to minimize a measure of mean overall node state uncertainty evaluated over a finite
interval. The solution to this problem involves each agent's trajectory defined both by the sequence
of nodes to be visited and the amount of time to be spent at each node. In literature, for this problem,
a class of distributed threshold-based parametric controllers has been proposed where agent transitions
from one node to the next are controlled via enforcing thresholds on the respective node uncertainties.
Under such a policy, the behavior of the agent-target system is a hybrid dynamic system, which enables
the use of Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) to find the optimal threshold parameters
in an on-line manner using gradient descent. However, due to the non-convexity of the associated
objective function, the used initial thresholds in the gradient descent scheme directly affects
the final optimal solution (controller). Therefore, initial thresholds should be carefully chosen
to achieve a better optimal solution. To overcome this initialization challenge, we extensively
analyze the asymptotic steady-state behavior of the agent-target hybrid system under periodic
agent trajectories. Then, based on the obtained theoretical results, we propose a computationally
efficient offline greedy approach to generate a reasonably well-performing initial thresholds.
In almost all the considered cases, it was observed that the initial thresholds provided by the proposing
greedy technique is optimal (still local) and performs better than the locally optimal threshold
policies given by the IPA techniques (with randomly chosen initial threshold).
