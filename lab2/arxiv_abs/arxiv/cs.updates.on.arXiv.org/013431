Deep learning models for MRI classification face two recurring problems: they are typically limited
by low sample size, and are abstracted by their own complexity (the "black box problem"). In this
paper, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the largest multi-source, functional
MRI (fMRI) connectomic dataset ever compiled, consisting of 43,858 datapoints. We apply this model
to a cross-sectional comparison of autism (ASD) vs typically developing (TD) controls that has
proved difficult to characterise with inferential statistics. To contextualise these findings,
we additionally perform classifications of gender and task vs rest. Employing class-balancing
to build a training set, we trained 3$\times$300 modified CNNs in an ensemble model to classify fMRI
connectivity matrices with overall AUROCs of 0.6774, 0.7680, and 0.9222 for ASD vs TD, gender, and
task vs rest, respectively. Additionally, we aim to address the black box problem in this context
using two visualization methods. First, class activation maps show which functional connections
of the brain our models focus on when performing classification. Second, by analyzing maximal activations
of the hidden layers, we were also able to explore how the model organizes a large and mixed-centre
dataset, finding that it dedicates specific areas of its hidden layers to processing different
covariates of data (depending on the independent variable analyzed), and other areas to mix data
from different sources. Our study finds that deep learning models that distinguish ASD from TD controls
focus broadly on temporal and cerebellar connections, with a particularly high focus on the right
caudate nucleus and paracentral sulcus.
