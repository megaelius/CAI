With the development of social networks, fake news for various commercial and political purposes
has been appearing in large numbers and gotten widespread in the online world. With deceptive words,
people can get infected by the fake news very easily and will share them without any fact-checking.
For instance, during the 2016 US president election, various kinds of fake news about the candidates
widely spread through both official news media and the online social networks. These fake news is
usually released to either smear the opponents or support the candidate on their side. The erroneous
information in the fake news is usually written to motivate the voters' irrational emotion and enthusiasm.
Such kinds of fake news sometimes can bring about devastating effects, and an important goal in improving
the credibility of online social networks is to identify the fake news timely. In this paper, we propose
to study the fake news detection problem. Automatic fake news identification is extremely hard,
since pure model based fact-checking for news is still an open problem, and few existing models can
be applied to solve the problem. With a thorough investigation of a fake news data, lots of useful
explicit features are identified from both the text words and images used in the fake news. Besides
the explicit features, there also exist some hidden patterns in the words and images used in fake
news, which can be captured with a set of latent features extracted via the multiple convolutional
layers in our model. A model named as TI-CNN (Text and Image information based Convolutinal Neural
Network) is proposed in this paper. By projecting the explicit and latent features into a unified
feature space, TI-CNN is trained with both the text and image information simultaneously. Extensive
experiments carried on the real-world fake news datasets have demonstrate the effectiveness of
TI-CNN.
