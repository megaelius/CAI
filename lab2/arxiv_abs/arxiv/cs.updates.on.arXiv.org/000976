Teachers have tried to teach their students by introducing text books along with verbal instructions
in traditional education system. However, teaching and learning methods could be changed for developing
Information and Communication Technology. It's time to adapt students with interactive learning
system so that they can improve their learning, catching, and memorizing capabilities. It is indispensable
to create high quality and realistic leaning environment for students. Visual learning can be easier
to understand and deal with their learning. We developed visual learning materials in the form of
video for students of primary level using different multimedia application tools. The objective
of this paper is to examine the impact of students abilities to acquire new knowledge or skills through
visual learning materials and blended leaning that is integration of visual learning materials
with teachers instructions. We visited a primary school in Dhaka city for this study and conducted
teaching with three different groups of students, (i) teacher taught students by traditional system
on same materials and marked level of students ability to adapt by a set of questions, (ii) another
group was taught with only visual learning material and assessment was done with 15 questionnaires,
(iii) the third group was taught with the video of solar system combined with teachers instructions
and assessed with the same questionnaires. This integration of visual materials with verbal instructions
is a blended approach of learning. The interactive blended approach greatly promoted students
ability of acquisition of knowledge and skills. Students response and perception were very positive
towards the blended technique than the other two methods. This interactive blending leaning system
may be an appropriate method especially for school children.
