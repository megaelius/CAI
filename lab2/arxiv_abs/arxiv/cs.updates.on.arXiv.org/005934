The digital telecommunications receiver is an important context for inference methodology, the
key objective being to minimize the expected loss function in recovering the transmitted information.
For that criterion, the optimal decision is the Bayesian minimum-risk estimator. However, the
computational load of the Bayesian estimator is often prohibitive and, hence, efficient computational
schemes are required. The design of novel schemes, striking new balances between accuracy and computational
load, is the primary concern of this thesis. Two popular techniques, one exact and one approximate,
will be studied. The exact scheme is a recursive one, namely the generalized distributive law (GDL),
whose purpose is to distribute all operators across the conditionally independent (CI) factors
of the joint model, so as to reduce the total number of operators required. In a novel theorem derived
in this thesis, GDL, if applicable, will be shown to guarantee such a reduction in all cases. An associated
lemma also quantifies this reduction. For practical use, two novel algorithms, namely the no-longer-needed
(NLN) algorithm and the generalized form of the Markovian Forward-Backward (FB) algorithm, recursively
factorizes and computes the CI factors of an arbitrary model, respectively. The approximate scheme
is an iterative one, namely the Variational Bayes (VB) approximation, whose purpose is to find the
independent (i.e. zero-order Markov) model closest to the true joint model in the minimum Kullback-Leibler
divergence (KLD) sense. Despite being computationally efficient, this naive mean field approximation
confers only modest performance for highly correlated models. A novel approximation, namely Transformed
Variational Bayes (TVB), will be designed in the thesis in order to relax the zero-order constraint
in the VB approximation, further reducing the KLD of the optimal approximation.
