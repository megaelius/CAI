Smart lighting is an underlying concept that links three main aspects: solid-state lighting (SSL)
technologies, advanced control and universal communication interfaces following global standards.
However, this conceptualization is constantly evolving to comply with the guidelines of the next
generation of devices that work in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Modern smart lighting
systems are based on light emitting diode (LED) technology and involve advanced drivers that have
features such as dynamic spectral light reproduction and advanced sensing capabilities. The ultimate
feature is of additional advanced services serving as the hub for optical communications that allows
coexistence with traditional Wi-Fi gateways in indoor environments. In this context, lighting
systems are evolving to support different wireless communications interfaces compatible with
the IoT ecosystem. Market tendencies of SSL systems predict the accelerated expansion of connected
IoT lighting control systems in different markets from smart homes and industrial environments.
These systems offer advanced features never seen before such as advanced spectral control of the
light source and also, the inclusion of several communication interfaces. These are mainly wired,
radiofrequencies (RF) and optical wireless communications (OWC) interfaces for advanced services
such as sensing and visible light communications (VLC). In this paper we present how to design and
realize IoT-based smart lighting systems for different applications using different IoT-centric
lighting architectures. Finally, different standards and aspects related to interoperability
and web services are explained taking into account commercial smart lighting platforms.
