The study of genetic variants can help find correlating population groups to identify cohorts that
are predisposed to common diseases and explain differences in disease susceptibility and how patients
react to drugs. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to identify interacting
GVs to understand their complex phenotypic traits. Since the performance of a learning algorithm
not only depends on the size and nature of the data but also on the quality of underlying representation,
deep neural networks can learn non-linear mappings that allow transforming GVs data into more clustering
and classification friendly representations than manual feature selection. In this paper, we
proposed convolutional embedded networks in which we combine two DNN architectures called convolutional
embedded clustering and convolutional autoencoder classifier for clustering individuals and
predicting geographic ethnicity based on GVs, respectively. We employed CAE-based representation
learning on 95 million GVs from the 1000 genomes and Simons genome diversity projects. Quantitative
and qualitative analyses with a focus on accuracy and scalability show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches such as VariantSpark and ADMIXTURE. In particular, CEC can cluster
targeted population groups in 22 hours with an adjusted rand index of 0.915, the normalized mutual
information of 0.92, and the clustering accuracy of 89%. Contrarily, the CAE classifier can predict
the geographic ethnicity of unknown samples with an F1 and Mathews correlation coefficient(MCC)
score of 0.9004 and 0.8245, respectively. To provide interpretations of the predictions, we identify
significant biomarkers using gradient boosted trees(GBT) and SHAP. Overall, our approach is transparent
and faster than the baseline methods, and scalable for 5% to 100% of the full human genome.
