Signature-based Intrusion Detection System (SIDS) provides a promising solution to the problem
of web application security. However, the performance of the system highly relies on the quality
of the signatures designed to detect attacks. A weak signature set may considerably cause an increase
in false alarm rate, making impractical to deploy the system. The objective of the paper is to identify
the flaws in the signature structure which are responsible to reduce the efficiency of the detection
system. The paper targets SQL injection signatures particularly. Initially, some essential concepts
of the domain of the attack that should be focused by the developer in prior to designing the signatures
have been discussed. Afterwards, we conducted a case study on the well known PHPIDS tool for analyzing
the quality of its SQL signatures. Based on the analysis, we identify various flaws in the designing
practice that yield inefficient signatures. We divide the weak signatures into six categories,
namely incomplete, irrelevant, semi-relevant, susceptible, redundant and inconsistent signatures.
Moreover, we quantify these weaknesses and define them mathematically in terms of set theory. To
the best of our knowledge, we have identified some novel signature design issues. The paper will
basically assist the signature developer to know what level of expertise is required for devising
a quality signature set and how a little ignorance may lead to deterioration in the performance of
the SIDS. Furthermore, a security expert may evaluate the detector against the identified flaws
by conducting structural analysis on its signature set.
