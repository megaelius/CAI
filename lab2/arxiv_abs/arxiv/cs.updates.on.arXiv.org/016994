The in-depth analysis of human behavior has been increasingly recognized as a crucial means for
disclosing interior driving forces, causes and impact on businesses in handling many challenging
issues. The modeling and analysis of behaviors in virtual organizations is an open area. Traditional
behavior modeling mainly relies on qualitative methods from behavioral science and social science
perspectives. The so-called behavior analysis is actually based on human demographic and business
usage data, where behavior-oriented elements are hidden in routinely collected transactional
data. As a result, it is ineffective or even impossible to deeply scrutinize native behavior intention,
lifecycle and impact on complex problems and business issues. We propose the approach of Behavior
Informatics (BI), in order to support explicit and quantitative behavior involvement through
a conversion from source data to behavioral data, and further conduct genuine analysis of behavior
patterns and impacts. BI consists of key components including behavior representation, behavioral
data construction, behavior impact analysis, behavior pattern analysis, behavior simulation,
and behavior presentation and behavior use. We discuss the concepts of behavior and an abstract
behavioral model, as well as the research tasks, process and theoretical underpinnings of BI. Substantial
experiments have shown that BI has the potential to greatly complement the existing empirical and
specific means by finding deeper and more informative patterns leading to greater in-depth behavior
understanding. BI creates new directions and means to enhance the quantitative, formal and systematic
modeling and analysis of behaviors in both physical and virtual organizations.
