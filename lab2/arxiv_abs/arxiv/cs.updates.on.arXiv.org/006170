Angiography by Optical Coherence Tomography is a non-invasive retinal imaging modality of recent
appearance that allows the visualization of the vascular structure at predefined depths based
on the detection of the blood movement. OCT-A images constitute a suitable scenario to analyse the
retinal vascular properties of regions of interest, measuring the characteristics of the foveal
vascular and avascular zones. Extracted parameters of this region can be used as prognostic factors
that determine if the patient suffers from certain pathologies, indicating the associated pathological
degree. The manual extraction of these biomedical parameters is a long, tedious and subjective
process, introducing a significant intra and inter-expert variability, which penalizes the utility
of the measurements. In addition, the absence of tools that automatically facilitate these calculations
encourages the creation of computer-aided diagnosis frameworks that ease the doctor's work, increasing
their productivity and making viable the use of this type of vascular biomarkers. We propose a fully
automatic system that identifies and precisely segments the region of the foveal avascular zone
(FAZ) using a novel ophthalmological image modality as is OCT-A. The system combines different
image processing techniques to firstly identify the region where the FAZ is contained and, secondly,
proceed with the extraction of its precise contour. The system was validated using a representative
set of 168 OCT-A images, providing accurate results with the best correlation with the manual measurements
of two experts clinician of 0.93 as well as a Jaccard's index of 0.82 of the best experimental case.
This tool provides an accurate FAZ measurement with the desired objectivity and reproducibility,
being very useful for the analysis of relevant vascular diseases through the study of the retinal
microcirculation.
