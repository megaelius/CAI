Given a continuous-time signal that can be modeled as the superposition of localized, time-shifted
events from multiple sources, the goal of Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) is to identify
the location of the events--by Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC)--and learn the template for each
source--by Convolutional Dictionary Update (CDU). In practice, because we observe samples of
the continuous-time signal on a uniformly-sampled grid in discrete time, classical CSC methods
can only produce estimates of the times when the events occur on this grid, which degrades the performance
of the CDU. We introduce a CDL framework that significantly reduces the errors arising from performing
the estimation in discrete time. Specifically, we construct an expanded dictionary that comprises,
not only discrete-time shifts of the templates, but also interpolated variants, obtained by bandlimited
interpolation, that account for continuous-time shifts. For CSC, we develop a novel computationally
efficient CSC algorithm, termed Convolutional Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with interpolated
dictionary (COMP-INTERP). We benchmarked COMP-INTERP to Contiunuous Basis Pursuit (CBP), the
state-of-the-art CSC algorithm for estimating off-the-grid events, and demonstrate, on simulated
data, that 1) COMP-INTERP achieves a similar level of accuracy, and 2) is two orders of magnitude
faster. For CDU, we derive a novel procedure to update the templates given sparse codes that can occur
both on and off the discrete-time grid. We also show that 3) dictionary update with the overcomplete
dictionary yields more accurate templates. Finally, we apply the algorithms to the spike sorting
problem on electrophysiology recording and show their competitive performance.
